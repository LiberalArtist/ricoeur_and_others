  Book Title: The Political Style of Conspiracy-Chase, Summer, and Lincoln<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Pfau Michael William<br>
  Abstract: The turbulent history of the United States has provided a fertile ground for conspiracies, both real and imagined. From the American Revolution to the present day, conspiracy discourse-linguistic and symbolic practices and artifacts revolving around themes, claims, or accusations of conspiracy-has been a staple of political rhetoric. Some conspiracy theories never catch on with the public, while others achieve widespread popularity. Whether successful or not, the means by which particular conspiracy theories spread is a rhetorical process, a process in which persuasive language, symbolism, and arguments act upon individual minds within concrete historical and political settings.Conspiracy rhetoric was a driving force in the evolution of antebellum political culture, contributing to the rise and fall of the great parties in the nineteenth century. One conspiracy theory in particular-the "slave power" conspiracy-was instrumental in facilitating the growth of the young Republican Party's membership and ideology.
      The Political Style of Conspiracyanalyzes the concept and reality of the "slave power" in the rhetorical discourse of the mid-nineteenth-century, in particular the speeches and writing of politicians Salmon P. Chase, Charles Sumner, and Abraham Lincoln. By examining their mainstream texts, Pfau reveals that, in addition to the "paranoid style" of conspiracy rhetoric that inhabits the margins of political life, Lincoln, Chase, and Sumner also engaged in a distinctive form of conspiracy rhetoric that is often found at the center of mainstream American society and politics.<br>

  Book Title: Invoking the Invisible Hand-Social Security and the Privatization Debates<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Medhurst Martin J.<br>
  Abstract: In Invoking the InvisibleHand Robert Asen scrutinizes contemporary debates over proposals to privatize Social Security. Asen argues that a rights-based rhetoric employed by Social Security's original supporters enabled advocates of privatization to align their proposals with the widely held belief that Social Security functions simply as a return on a worker's contributions and that it is not, in fact, a social insurance program.By analyzing major debates over a preeminent American institution, Asen reveals the ways in which language is deployed to identify problems for public policy, craft policy solutions, and promote policies to the populace. He shows how debate participants seek to create favorable contexts for their preferred policies and how they connect these policies to idealized images of the nation.<br>

  Abstract: Readers in search of an entry point into Michael C. Leff’s signature talent for weaving histories of rhetoric together with theoretical innovations attuned to the present will want to start with “Tradition and Agency in Humanistic Rhetoric.” For Leff, the standard opposition of individual agency to collective tradition had to be reconfigured and rethought for rhetoric’s intelligibility to break through the grid of modernist and postmodernist attitudes towards language, culture, and power. Leff notes how in both ancient and modern times rhetoricians have been taxed with not being independent agents but merely mouthpieces for popular and received opinion. And yet,<br>

  Abstract: An evolving interpretation of the Greco-Roman rhetorical traditions of antiquity grounded Leff’s guiding vision of the purpose and distinctiveness of rhetoric study. And yet this vision advanced, became more complex, and found new audiences thorough its intimate connection to the social and political tensions of nineteenth and twentieth Century American public address and through its dialogue with philosophies of language and hermeneutics that he encountered in his early years as a scholar.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1d10hh7">Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy</a><br>
  Abstract: In the course of his analysis of traditional principles of rhetoric, Kenneth Burke makes the curious remark that “the Aristotelian topics shift so imperceptibly between ideas and images that you wonder how the two realms could ever come to be at odds.”¹ The remark is curious, perhaps even subversive, since it associates two domains that both ancient and modern theorists generally have kept apart. In classical rhetoric, of course, images belong to the office of style and function to ornament the language of oratory. Topics, on the other hand, refer to matters of thought and to the office of invention.<br>

  Abstract: In everyday language, the term “paradox” is used to refer to any claim or argument that contrasts with what is usually considered obvious. In a more specific and philosophical sense, a paradox is a claim or an argument that develops from apparently true premises and leads to a seemingly absurd (self-contradictory or logically unacceptable) conclusion. The term is also sometimes used in the context of religion to refer to a form of fideism professing a religious belief even when, or precisely because, that belief defies reason (as paradigmatically expressed by Tertullian’s

  Martin Wight: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt5q8">Post-Realism</a><br>
  Author(s) Epp Roger<br>
  Abstract: Martin Wight’s reputation as a realist rests primarily on two texts. The first is his 1946 tract,
                  Power Politics,which framed what became the conventional analysis of the League of Nations in the language associated now with realism: in the end, the League was a facade made possible, then shattered by a shifting balance of power; it had not supplanted the international anarchy.Power Politicswas greeted by one emigre scholar as a “brilliant summary of ideas which we share”—ideas which in the “appeasement period” had been a “minor heresy.”³ The second text is the well-known essay whose title—“Why<br>

  Author(s) Goodnight G. Thomas<br>
  Abstract: The dramatic ending of the Second World War—the obliteration of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the revelation of the holocaust, the establishment of the United Nations, and the transformation of the Soviet Union from wartime ally to global competitor—challenged prevailing precepts and practices of international relations. Abjuring the traditional language of diplomacy, elite and public policy discourses of the 1940s were spoken within the horizons of global necessities and apocalyptic fears. A Soviet atomic test in 1949 yet again disrupted the contexts of international relations. “In truth, the first atomic explosion on Russian soil has shattered American foreign policy as<br>

  René et moi from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt8fr">For René Girard</a><br>
  Author(s) Gans Eric<br>
  Abstract: I first encountered René Girard on entering the graduate program in Romance languages at Johns Hopkins University in 1960, just before the publication of
                     Mensonge romantique et vérité romanesquein 1961 brought him wide public recognition.¹ Although I was immediately struck by the power and range of his intellect, it was only with the appearance ofLa violence et le sacréin 1972 that I realized that his mimetic theory of desire was in fact the kernel of a radically new anthropology.²<br>

  Drawn into Conversion: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt8fr">For René Girard</a><br>
  Author(s) Palaver Wolfgang<br>
  Abstract: There were surely several circumstances in my life that prepared me to become interested in mimetic theory while I was studying theology at the University of Innsbruck in Austria. First, I have maintained a long ongoing interest in anthropology.

  Abstract: This book is a study of epistemology, which I define as what people know in their daily lives. Becker and Laing are used as starting points for a general depiction of Hispano thought, which includes the study of how language develops an understanding of the world of everyday life. Language usage is the vehicle for understanding how people name events, interactions, attitudes, and values. Understanding how words are used to construct the edifice of everyday life is best accomplished by using concepts from phenomenology.<br>

Although this chapter covers components of a phenomenological or ethnomethodological stance, strictly speaking some of the material here does not rise to either a phenomenological or ethnomethodological study. The oral tradition of Hispanos is about the use of language and creating meaning, and in this respect the oral tradition contributes significantly.<br>

  Book Title: The Thought of Music-  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Kramer Lawrence<br>
  Abstract: What, exactly, is knowledge of music? And what does it tell us about humanistic knowledge in general?
      The Thought of Musicgrapples directly with these fundamental questions-questions especially compelling at a time when humanistic knowledge is enmeshed in debates about its character and future. In this third volume in a trilogy on musical understanding that includesInterpreting MusicandExpression and Truth, Lawrence Kramer seeks answers in both thoughtaboutmusic and thoughtinmusic-thinking in tones. He skillfully assesses musical scholarship in the aftermath of critical musicology and musical hermeneutics and in view of more recent concerns with embodiment, affect, and performance. This authoritative and timely work challenges the prevailing conceptions of every topic it addresses: language, context, and culture; pleasure and performance; and, through music, the foundations of understanding in the humanities.<br>

  Book Title: Symposium of the Whole-A Range of Discourse Toward an Ethnopoetics<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Rothenberg Diane<br>
  Abstract: Symposium of the Wholetraces a discourse on poetry and culture that has profoundly influenced the art of our time, with precedents going back two centuries and more. Beginning with a reassertion of the complexity of poetry among peoples long labeled "primitive" and "savage," many recent poets have sought to base a new poetics over the fullest range of human cultures. The attempt to define an ethnopoetics has been significantly connected with the most experimental and future-directed side of Romantic and modern poetry, both in the Western world and, increasingly, outside it. As a visionary poetics and as a politics, this complex redefinition of cultural and intellectual values has involved a rarely acknowledged collaboration between poets and scholars, who together have challenged the narrow view of literature that has excluded so many traditions.In this gathering, the Rothenbergs follow the idea of an ethnopoetics from predecessors such as Vico, Blake, Thoreau, and Tzara to more recent essays and manifestos by poets and social thinkers such as Olson, Eliade, Snyder, Turner, and Baraka. The themes range widely, from the divergence of oral and written cultures to the shaman as proto-poet and the reemergence of suppressed and rejected forms and images: the goddess, the trickster, and the "human universe." The book's three ethnographic sections demonstrate how various poetries are structured and composed, how they reflect meaning and worldview, and how they are performed in cultures where all art may be thought of as art-in-motion.Among the poetries discussed are the language of magic; West African drum language and poetry; the Huichol Indian language of reversals; chance operations in African divination poetry; picture-writings and action-writings from Australia and Africa; and American Indian sacred-clown dramas and traditional trickster narratives. The cumulative effect is a new reading of the poetic past and present-in the editors' words, "a changed paradigm of what poetry was or now could come to be."<br>

  Abstract: Thoreau brings the ʺwildernessʺ side of the proposition into focus: what the nineteenth century would have subsumed under the word ʺnatureʺ and the later twentieth century under ʺecology.ʺ The emphasis is in fact characteristically American, and the view of wilderness and wildness brings together ideas (social and personal) of place, of language, of body, and of mind. In the American instance, also, the persistent presence is that of the Indian (ʺthe vengeful ghost lurking in the back of the troubled American mindʺ—G. Snyder), as one remembers the word ʺIndianʺ spoken by Thoreau on his death bed—or his vision<br>

  Abstract: Fenollosaʹs long essay, written circa 1908, is the outstanding instance of the impact on contemporary practice not simply of another poetry but of the inherent poetics of another language—its written as well as spoken form. Ezra Pound, who had translated Japanese Noh plays with Fenollosa, arranged for the essayʹs posthumous publication, writing in introduction: ʺIn his search through unknown art, Fenollosa, coming upon unknown motives and principles unrecognized in the West, was already led into many modes of thought since fruitful in ʹnewʹ Western painting and poetry….

  Abstract: The ʺreturn of the goddessʺ is one of the central events of a poetics of recovery, a symposium of the whole, etc. From Blake on (ʺThe Eternal Female groand! it was heard all over the Earthʺ), her image accompanies many of our most radical language experiments, summoning up past images (e.g., Shekinah, Sophia, Kali), leading to a male-centered vision of the muse, as with Graves in what follows, and to a revitalized feminism exploring its own numinosity. But the goddess is linked as well with a geocentric/Gaiacentric vision (ʺthe earth as a religious formʺ [Eliade]) and thus with contemporary stabs<br>

  Abstract: The poetry of reversals described by the maraʹakáme (shaman), Ramón Medina Silva, of San Sebastian, Mexico, is part of the Huichol peyote hunt and ritual (see below, p. 225). The tactic is common to the languages, acts, and dream-work of shamans and sacred clowns throughout the world. Its Crow Indian manifestation, for example, took the form of warrior societies of ʺcontrariesʺ (Crazy Dogs) whose behavior included ʺsaying the opposite of what you mean & making others say the opposite of what they mean in returnʺ (Rothenberg 1972: 195).

  Abstract: ʺOf very great interest and importance is the possibility of transferring the whole system of speech symbolism into other terms than those that are involved in the typical process … a transfer, direct or indirect, from the typical symbolism of language as spoken and heard…. The ease with which speech symbolism can be transferred from one sense to another, from technique to technique, itself indicates that the mere sounds of speech are not the essential fact of language, which lies rather in the classification, in the formal patterning, and in the relating of conceptsʺ (Sapir 1921: 19–21).<br>

  Abstract: Munnʹs instance of a traditional tie between oral and visual language is from the Walbiri of northwestern Australia. The visual side (hand and eye) of ethnopoetics has generally been ignored in favor of the oral side (mouth and ear). Fundamental relations between writing/drawing and speaking/singing, although clear enough within such cultures as the Walbiri, have received little real attention from without. A series of propositions in this regard has come from the French philosopher, Jacques Derrida, whose elevation of other-than-alphabetic forms of writing should simultaneously help establish the equality of oral modes of poetry.

But it isnʹt the shamans who speak directly; itʹs the mushrooms, called ʺsaint children,ʺ and ʺlittle ones,ʺ and ʺflesh of god.ʺ that give them language. ʺIf you ask a shaman where his imagery comes fromʺ—Henry Munn tells us in<br>

  Abstract: Artaudʹs efforts ʺto break through language in order to touch lifeʺ placed him, finally, among the truly radical poets of the twentieth century and among those who pioneered a necessary ethnopoetics toward such ends. An actor by profession, he pursued a new overview of art and life, first as the director of the Paris-based Bureau of Surrealist Research and, after his break with the Surrealists, through his thwarted experiments with theater and film, his writings such as The Theater and Its Double (from which the present excerpt), and his collapse into a personal agony he could yet project through language.<br>

In the Papua New Guinea instance following, the projection and expulsion, here of grief and anger, works through a language-centered, basically social and nonmystical exploitation of human feelings—a cathartic geography, a primal poetry of name and place. ʺMoving and violent,ʺ in Schieffelinʹs words, the Gisaro Ceremony is itself part of a larger series of ceremonial events involving ritual exchanges between kinsmen who are living at some distance from each<br>

  Abstract: Even in its early, tentative stages, the signing poetry emerging as an aspect of the ʺculture of the deafʺ challenges some of our cherished preconceptions about poetry and its relation to human speech. Ameslan (American Sign Language) represents, literally, a poetry without sound and, for its practitioners, a poetry without access to that experience of sound as voice that weʹve so often taken as the bedrock of all poetics and all language. In the real world of the deaf, then, language exists as a kind of writing in space and as a primary form of communication without reference to any<br>

  Author(s) THOREAU HENRY DAVID<br>
  Abstract: Thoreau brings the ʺwildernessʺ side of the proposition into focus: what the nineteenth century would have subsumed under the word ʺnatureʺ and the later twentieth century under ʺecology.ʺ The emphasis is in fact characteristically American, and the view of wilderness and wildness brings together ideas (social and personal) of place, of language, of body, and of mind. In the American instance, also, the persistent presence is that of the Indian (ʺthe vengeful ghost lurking in the back of the troubled American mindʺ—G. Snyder), as one remembers the word ʺIndianʺ spoken by Thoreau on his death bed—or his vision<br>

Ezra Pound, who had translated Japanese Noh plays with Fenollosa, arranged for the essayʹs posthumous publication, writing in introduction: ʺIn his search through unknown art, Fenollosa, coming upon unknown motives and principles unrecognized in the West, was already led into many modes of thought since fruitful in ʹnewʹ Western painting and poetry….

  Abstract: The ʺreturn of the goddessʺ is one of the central events of a poetics of recovery, a symposium of the whole, etc. From Blake on (ʺThe Eternal Female groand! it was heard all over the Earthʺ), her image accompanies many of our most radical language experiments, summoning up past images (e.g., Shekinah, Sophia, Kali), leading to a male-centered vision of the muse, as with Graves in what follows, and to a revitalized feminism exploring its own numinosity. But the goddess is linked as well with a geocentric/Gaiacentric vision (ʺthe earth as a religious formʺ [Eliade]) and thus with contemporary stabs<br>

Fundamental relations between writing/drawing and speaking/singing, although clear enough within such cultures as the Walbiri, have received little real attention from without.

  Book Title: Symposium of the Whole-A Range of Discourse Toward an Ethnopoetics<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Rothenberg Diane<br>
  Abstract: Symposium of the Wholetraces a discourse on poetry and culture that has profoundly influenced the art of our time, with precedents going back two centuries and more. Beginning with a reassertion of the complexity of poetry among peoples long labeled "primitive" and "savage," many recent poets have sought to base a new poetics over the fullest range of human cultures. The attempt to define an ethnopoetics has been significantly connected with the most experimental and future-directed side of Romantic and modern poetry, both in the Western world and, increasingly, outside it. As a visionary poetics and as a politics, this complex redefinition of cultural and intellectual values has involved a rarely acknowledged collaboration between poets and scholars, who together have challenged the narrow view of literature that has excluded so many traditions.In this gathering, the Rothenbergs follow the idea of an ethnopoetics from predecessors such as Vico, Blake, Thoreau, and Tzara to more recent essays and manifestos by poets and social thinkers such as Olson, Eliade, Snyder, Turner, and Baraka. The themes range widely, from the divergence of oral and written cultures to the shaman as proto-poet and the reemergence of suppressed and rejected forms and images: the goddess, the trickster, and the "human universe." The book's three ethnographic sections demonstrate how various poetries are structured and composed, how they reflect meaning and worldview, and how they are performed in cultures where all art may be thought of as art-in-motion.Among the poetries discussed are the language of magic; West African drum language and poetry; the Huichol Indian language of reversals; chance operations in African divination poetry; picture-writings and action-writings from Australia and Africa; and American Indian sacred-clown dramas and traditional trickster narratives. The cumulative effect is a new reading of the poetic past and present-in the editors' words, "a changed paradigm of what poetry was or now could come to be."<br>

  Abstract: In considering languages of grief in relation to languages of certainty, there is a tension in the ways death can be thought of in connection to modern knowledge. On the one hand, we can consider death as that which underlies the possibility of knowledge, as that end point to the fostering or disallowing of life that stands for the modern configuration of power/knowledge (as Foucault [1978] had it). And on the other hand, we can imagine death as that which cannot be spoken in languages of modernity (as de Certeau [1986] suggested). Put differently, this is the distinction between death<br>

  Book Title: The Language of the Gods in the World of Men-Sanskrit, Culture, and Power in Premodern India<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Pollock Sheldon<br>
  Abstract: In this work of impressive scholarship, Sheldon Pollock explores the remarkable rise and fall of Sanskrit, India's ancient language, as a vehicle of poetry and polity. He traces the two great moments of its transformation: the first around the beginning of the Common Era, when Sanskrit, long a sacred language, was reinvented as a code for literary and political expression, the start of an amazing career that saw Sanskrit literary culture spread from Afghanistan to Java. The second moment occurred around the beginning of the second millennium, when local speech forms challenged and eventually replaced Sanskrit in both the literary and political arenas. Drawing striking parallels, chronologically as well as structurally, with the rise of Latin literature and the Roman empire, and with the new vernacular literatures and nation-states of late-medieval Europe,
      The Language of the Gods in the World of Menasks whether these very different histories challenge current theories of culture and power and suggest new possibilities for practice.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pnqs7">The Language of the Gods in the World of Men</a><br>
  Abstract: This book is an attempt to understand two great moments of transformation in culture and power in premodern India. The first occurred around the beginning of the Common Era, when Sanskrit, long a sacred language restricted to religious practice, was reinvented as a code for literary and political expression. This development marked the start of an amazing career that saw Sanskrit literary culture spread across most of southern Asia from Afghanistan to Java. The form of power for which this quasi-universal Sanskrit spoke was also meant to extend quasi-universally, “to the ends of the horizons,” although such imperial polity existed<br>

  CHAPTER ONE  The Language of the Gods Enters the World from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pnqs7">The Language of the Gods in the World of Men</a><br>
  Abstract: From around the beginning of the first millennium b.c.e., when the earliest form of Sanskrit appeared in South Asia, until around the beginning of the first millennium c.e., Sanskrit functioned as a communicative medium that was restricted both in terms of who was permitted to make use of the language and which purposes<br>

  CHAPTER TWO  Literature and the Cosmopolitan Language of Literature from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pnqs7">The Language of the Gods in the World of Men</a><br>
  Abstract: The astonishing expansion of the discursive realm of Sanskrit in the century or two around the beginning of the Common Era occurred not only at the level of royal inscriptional eulogy. The
                     praśastiitself was intimately related to, even a subset of, a new form of language use that was coming into being in the same period and would eventually be given the namekāvya.¹ It was only when the language of the gods entered the world of men that literature in India began.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pnqs7">The Language of the Gods in the World of Men</a><br>
  Abstract: When the scholar Hemacandra completed his grammar and presented it to King Jayasiṃha Siddharāja of Gujarat, the king had the book copied and distributed throughout the world—a world that was vast yet delimited in its vastness and completely named and known. The fact that a cosmopolitan grammar should have escaped its local confines in Aṇahilapāṭaka and circulated as far north as Nepal and as far south as Cōḻa country is in itself hardly surprising. After all, Sanskrit, like Prakrit and Apabhramsha (which are also analyzed in Hemacandra’s grammar), was no language of Place and was quite capable of traveling<br>

  CHAPTER EIGHT  Beginnings, Textualization, Superposition from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pnqs7">The Language of the Gods in the World of Men</a><br>
  Abstract: It is obvious that we cannot analyze the history of vernacularization—the term used here for the literary and political promotion of local language—or even observe it taking place, without knowing precisely what it is we are trying to observe and analyze. If we are concerned with the transition from quasi-universal to more regional ways of being in the spheres of culture and power, we will pay attention to, among other things, the ways people began to produce texts that were local rather than translocal in body and spirit—in their language and spheres of circulation as well as<br>

  CHAPTER NINE  Creating a Regional World: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pnqs7">The Language of the Gods in the World of Men</a><br>
  Abstract: Few local literary cultures of premodernity anywhere permit us to follow the history and reconstruct the meanings of vernacularization with quite the same precision as is possible for Kannada, the language of what is now the southern union state of Karnataka. We can chart the shifts in cosmopolitan and vernacular cultural production without interruption from about the fifth century on, based on texts that are for the most part securely datable—an almost unparalleled antiquity and chronological transparency. Much of the data is the hard evidence of epigraphs, and their quantity is breathtaking. The region must be one of the<br>

  CHAPTER TEN  Vernacular Poetries and Polities in Southern Asia from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pnqs7">The Language of the Gods in the World of Men</a><br>
  Abstract: Processes of literary-cultural transformation exactly like those found in the Kannada-speaking world are in evidence across much of southern Asia for a period of some five centuries beginning a little before 1000. Given so vast a domain with local complexities everywhere, and few comprehensive accounts existing for any one language let alone for the entire southern Asian world, only the general shape of this vernacular revolution can be sketched out here, with a few especially representative or complex instances examined more closely. Several features discernible in many instances (not, of course, all) will serve as focal points: the place of<br>

  CHAPTER ELEVEN  Europe Vernacularized from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pnqs7">The Language of the Gods in the World of Men</a><br>
  Abstract: To an outside observer, the vernacularization of Europe as a literary-cultural process in itself and, even more so, in relation to political processes appears to be one of the great understudied topics of Western history. The editor of a recent edition of the
                  Oxford History of Medieval Europe, while observing that a major factor in “the new diversity” that marked the late Middle Ages was “the exploitation of a variety of languages in important writings,” confesses himself at a loss to explain the development itself; the origins of the vernacular turn are for him as “mysterious” as its results are<br>

  Epilogue. from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pnqs7">The Language of the Gods in the World of Men</a><br>
  Abstract: Few things seem as natural as the multiplicity of vernacular languages used for making sense of life through texts—that is, for making literature. And few things seem as unnatural as their gradual disappearance in the present, especially from the pressures exerted by globalizing English. Literary-language loss is in fact often viewed as part of a more general reduction of diversity in a cultural ecosystem, a loss considered as dangerous as the reduction of biological diversity, to which—in another instance of cultural naturalization—it is often compared. Today’s homogenization of culture, of which language loss is one aspect, seems<br>

  Abstract: Truong Chinh, one of the founders of the Indochinese Communist Party and the party’s radical theoretician, employed the fishpond metaphor to explain the meaning of the “people’s war” to the masses in a language that was graphically familiar to them.² The paradigm of the people’s war was a marriage between two conventional doctrines<br>

  Book Title: A Problem of Presence-Beyond Scripture in an African Church<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Engelke Matthew<br>
  Abstract: The Friday Masowe apostolics of Zimbabwe refer to themselves as “the Christians who don’t read the Bible.” They claim they do not need the Bible because they receive the Word of God “live and direct” from the Holy Spirit. In this insightful and sensitive historical ethnography, Matthew Engelke documents how this rejection of scripture speaks to longstanding concerns within Christianity over mediation and authority. The Bible, of course, has been a key medium through which Christians have recognized God’s presence. But the apostolics perceive scripture as an unnecessary, even dangerous, mediator. For them, the materiality of the Bible marks a distance from the divine and prohibits the realization of a live and direct faith. Situating the Masowe case within a broad comparative framework, Engelke shows how their rejection of textual authority poses a problem of presence—which is to say, how the religious subject defines, and claims to construct, a relationship with the spiritual world through the semiotic potentials of language, actions, and objects. Written in a lively and accessible style, A Problem of Presence makes important contributions to the anthropology of Christianity, the history of religions in Africa, semiotics, and material culture studies.<br>

  Author(s) Borneman John<br>
  Abstract: As we reflect back on the essays assembled in this volume, it appears that each deals with a particular defining moment of thinking about and practicing anthropology. They do not aim to define a subdiscipline in anthropology or formulate an encompassing theoretical orientation regarding substantive issues. As a group, the authors differ in ethnicity, gender, and nationality, and in their respective stages of professional development. Though they all live near and work in U.S. and Canadian universities, their research spans societies that vary widely in geographical location, language, and sociopolitical situation: Canadian Inuit, European, Arab, African, Indian, and Russian societies.<br>

  Book Title: Little India-Diaspora, Time, and Ethnolinguistic Belonging in Hindu Mauritius<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Eisenlohr Patrick<br>
  Abstract: Little Indiais a rich historical and ethnographic examination of a fascinating example of linguistic plurality on the island of Mauritius, where more than two-thirds of the population is of Indian ancestry. Patrick Eisenlohr's groundbreaking study focuses on the formation of diaspora as mediated through the cultural phenomenon of Indian ancestral languages-principally Hindi, which is used primarily in religious contexts. Eisenlohr emphasizes the variety of cultural practices that construct and transform boundaries in communities in diaspora and illustrates different modes of experiencing the temporal relationships between diaspora and homeland.<br>

  CHAPTER 3  Social Semiotics of Language: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1ppkdj">Little India</a><br>
  Abstract: Hindu Mauritians make use of a wide repertoire of registers and styles of language in order to construct and inhabit interactional stances and claim ethnic and diasporic identities, which raises the issue of performance and its role in establishing social relationships and distinctions.¹ Building on John Austin’s theory of performance, Judith Butler (1990) has conceptualized social identities as created and reproduced through acts of performance, which in turn depend on the citationality of conventional signs recognized by others. Focusing on these qualities of performance, in this chapter I explore the multiple ways in which Hindu Mauritians both construct and align<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1ppkdj">Little India</a><br>
  Abstract: This chapter addresses the intersection of colonialism, nationalism, and language, in particular, it analyzes how the construction of communities in a colonial context was mediated by ideas about language. I show how debates surrounding the establishment of an educational system and educational language policy in colonial Mauritius became a privileged site for contesting hegemonic claims in the form of negotiating the relationships of different groups in a colonial plantation setting. Conflicting approaches to language in education also informed debates about the role and significance of Indo-Mauritians in ascribing an identity to Mauritius with its lack of a precolonial population.At the<br>

  Abstract: Hindu activists in religious organizations and state and para-state bodies, some of whom are also involved in the network of Hindu nationalist organizations that operate in both India and Mauritius, are concerned about the rapid language shift from Bhojpuri to Mauritian Creole among Hindu Mauritians. Interpreting the decreasing use of Bhojpuri as a threat to the reproduction of Hindu difference in Mauritius, and making use of their close connections to state institutions, they are trying to reverse the shift to Creole by arranging for the use of Bhojpuri on national television and radio. As I will discuss below, the use<br>

  Conclusion: from:

  Abstract: In this book I have sought to account for the emergence of diaspora in practical, phenomenological, and ideological terms by analyzing how a sense of being in diaspora is produced by language and its uses among Hindus in Mauritius. In this, I have focused on the indexical and iconic values of linguistic practices whose deployment in everyday social interaction and metapragmatic discourse results in ethnolinguistic forms of belonging pointing to a diasporic homeland. To be meaningful, these practices depend on a whole range of other linguistic practices and valuations among Hindu Mauritians that are not immediately concerned with issues of<br>

  Abstract: Up to this point, with the exception of a brief discussion of Prudentius, this study has been concerned exclusively with Greek literature and thought. In fact, much of what has been discussed has been of Italian origin, from the archaic Pythagoreanism of southern Italy to the teachings of Plotinus and Porphyry in Rome. Virtually all the material examined, however, has been Greek in language and tradition. Traces of the Platonized Homer can be found in Latin authors as early as Apuleius,¹ a contemporary of Numenius, but there is no single work in Latin that explores at length the conception of<br>

  Abstract: Imagism has created an “image” of Oriental cultures projected in language. Whether in Pound’s giant pancultural program or in Lowell’s intertextual travel narrative, an Orientalist “image,” in the form of both poetic effect and cultural description, stands out conspicuously, like “petals on a wet, black bough.” This double meaning of “image” thus bespeaks the twin projects that the Imagist Pound and Lowell were pursuing: on the one hand they were creating a modernist poetry, and on the other hand they were writing ethnographies of the Far East and looking at culture from a particular standpoint.

Associated with names such as Zarate, Kramsch, Byram, and, closer to home, Crozet and Liddicoat, it represents a turn away from the attempt to produce ersatz native speakers through institutionalized language learning and places greater emphasis on learners’ abilities to apprehend the particularities of their own culture as exposed through comparison with other cultures (see Byram et al. 2001: 5).

  Author(s) Marácz László<br>
  Abstract: The first academic Hungarian dictionary
                  A magyar nyelv szótára(The Dictionary of the Hungarian Language) was a monumental work compiled by two members of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences: Gergely Czuczor (1800-1866) and János Fogarasi (1801-1878) that was published in six volumes between 1862 and 1874 [Figs. 2 and 3]. Rather than just being a list of Hungarian words, Czuczor-Fogarasi’s monolingual dictionary (hereafter, the CzF Dictionary) must be considered a linguistic achievement. It contains 110,784 entries and is structured according to the agglutinative nature of the Hungarian language since it distinguishes roots and suffixes while also referring to interconnections within<br>

  Author(s) Efal Adi<br>
  Abstract: One of the operations included in philological inquiries is the restoration of etymologies, built up of linguistic units enduring through ages, languages, meanings, usages and contexts.² The following essay attempts a possible deployment of an etymology of the lingual unit ‘genre’. Our trail will be guided by two stations in the long and extended history of this etymon: First, the Aristotelian origins of the etymon ‘genre’ are reconsidered; second, attention is given to the presence of the same etymon in the vocabulary of modern art criticism. Working within a comparative framework, this essay tries to create a trail between literary<br>

  11.4  Sociology and the Proliferation of Knowledge: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt12877vs">The Making of the Humanities, vol. III</a><br>
  Author(s) Kempers Bram<br>
  Abstract: Sociology and its companion social sciences, such as cultural anthropology and psychology, enjoy ambivalent relations with one another, and with sections of the humanities, from cultural history to the study of languages. To complicate matters more, the relations with the natural sciences are ambiguous as well and subject to debate. Intellectuals never created a clear-cut and generally accepted classification of the arts and sciences concerned with human behavior. The cognitive quality of literature and the visual arts never disappeared. Literary authors still claim to enlighten

  Book Title: In Defense of Doctrine-Evangelicalism, Theology, and Scripture<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Putman Rhyne R.<br>
  Abstract: Questions surrounding the relationship of Scripture and doctrine are legion within the Protestant tradition. How can doctrine develop over time and maintain fidelity to the sacred text, especially for communities who cling to the Reformation principle of sola scriptura? Does not an appeal to contemporary, constructive theology belie commonly held Protestant and Evangelical convictions about the sufficiency of Scripture? Does admission and acceptance of doctrinal development result in a kind of reality-denying theological relativism? And in what way can a growing, postcanonical tradition maintain a sense of continuity with the faith of the New Testament? This study is an apologetic for the ongoing, constructive theological task in Protestant and Evangelical traditions. It suggests that doctrinal development can be explained as a hermeneutical phenomenon and that insights from hermeneutical philosophy and the philosophy of language can aid theologians in constructing explanatory theses for particular theological problems associated with the facts of doctrinal development, namely, questions related to textual authority, reality depiction, and theological identity. Joining the recent call to theological interpretation of Scripture, Putman provides a constructive model that forwards a descriptive and normative pattern for reading Scripture and theological tradition together.<br>

  Author(s) Yarber Angela<br>
  Abstract: Creative words and creative potential burst the world into being, according to the theology of the creation narratives of the opening chapters of Genesis. In John, Jesus was and is and becomes the Word. With words, God calls forth life and trees, stars and sunsets, oceans and rivers, animals and humanity. Color, design, beauty, creativity, and wonder are encapsulated—as best they can be—in words. And as best we can, we use our finite words to capture the infinite. Theology—faith seeking understanding—is most often articulated in language, words, sentences, grammar, structure, paragraphs, papers, and books. As a<br>

  THREE  Making Metaphors, Seeing Metonymies from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1287gfz">Figures of a Changing World: Metaphor and the Emergence of Modern Culture</a><br>
  Abstract: My way of formulating the contrast between metaphor and metonymy is indebted to various linguistic, structuralist, and semiotic discussions for some, but not all, of its elements. I have selectively synthesized certain aspects that characteristically emerge in those discussions and rejected others, so as to shift the emphasis of the distinction toward my focus on the problematics of culture change. Ever since Roman Jakobson placed the opposition between metaphor and metonymy at the foundations of language use, the terms have been subject to continuous definitional torquing and distension.¹ And although the privileged status of these tropes has been accepted or<br>

  Abstract: In
                  Allegories of Reading, Paul de Man examines Nietzsche’s method of submitting “the epistemological authority of perception,” language, and logic to a radically skeptical critique. Although Nietzsche was not the first to propose “that the paradigmatic structure of language is rhetorical rather than representational,” he affirmed more categorically than his predecessors that “the misrepresentation of reality … [that he finds] systematically repeated throughout the tradition is … rooted in the rhetorical structure of language”: “The trope is not a derived, marginal, or aberrant form of language but the linguistic paradigm par excellence.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1287gfz">Figures of a Changing World: Metaphor and the Emergence of Modern Culture</a><br>
  Abstract: My account of metaphor and metonymy in the preceding chapters suggests that if the difference between them is fluid, if it is weak in purely structural terms, it can be strengthened by contextualization. But a more serious problem confronts the effort to keep metaphor and metonymy apart. I’ve called them two fundamental tropes, or figures, and this means that I have already taken for granted a prior distinction: the distinction between the literal (or proper) and the figurative uses of language.<br>

  SIX  The Semiotics of Metaphor and Metonymy: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1287gfz">Figures of a Changing World: Metaphor and the Emergence of Modern Culture</a><br>
  Abstract: Nietzsche is fundamentally concerned with the circuitous and deceptive character of our relations to things, and with the transcendence of actuality to our representations of it at the level of the signifier. But to a semiotician, the distinction between linguistic activity and extralinguistic reality is naive, and so I turn to Umberto Eco’s more doggedly semiotic approach to this distinction in
                  A Theory of Semiotics. Eco divides semiotics into two parts: the theory of codes or signification and the theory of sign-production or language use.Codedesignates the system of rules that “generate signs as concrete occurrences in communicative intercourse.”¹<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1287gfz">Figures of a Changing World: Metaphor and the Emergence of Modern Culture</a><br>
  Abstract: Some of my previous remarks may suggest that our basic human impulse to metonymize or demetaphorize attained to its most triumphant moment in the Christian culture of the High Middle Ages. There if anywhere the unconscious and mechanical prejudices of language and perception were most fully reinforced by the flowering of a highly sophisticated and articulate cultural consciousness fashioned in the same mode and shaped by the same prejudices. But this is just what needs to be questioned.<br>

  Book Title: Ostension-Word Learning and the Embodied Mind<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Engelland Chad<br>
  Abstract: Ostension is bodily movement that manifests our engagement with things, whether we wish it to or not. Gestures, glances, facial expressions: all betray our interest in something. Ostension enables our first word learning, providing infants with a prelinguistic way to grasp the meaning of words. Ostension is philosophically puzzling; it cuts across domains seemingly unbridgeable -- public--private, inner--outer, mind--body. In this book, Chad Engelland offers a philosophical investigation of ostension and its role in word learning by infants. Engelland discusses ostension (distinguishing it from ostensive definition) in contemporary philosophy, examining accounts by Quine, Davidson, and Gadamer, and he explores relevant empirical findings in psychology, evolutionary anthropology, and neuroscience. He offers original studies of four representative historical thinkers whose work enriches the understanding of ostension: Wittgenstein, Merleau-Ponty, Augustine, and Aristotle. And, building on these philosophical and empirical foundations, Engelland offers a meticulous analysis of the philosophical issues raised by ostension. He examines the phenomenological problem of whether embodied intentions are manifest or inferred; the problem of what concept of mind allows ostensive cues to be intersubjectively available; the epistemological problem of how ostensive cues, notoriously ambiguous, can be correctly understood; and the metaphysical problem of the ultimate status of the key terms in his argument: animate movement, language, and mind. Finally, he argues for the centrality of manifestation in philosophy. Taking ostension seriously, he proposes, has far-reaching implications for thinking about language and the practice of philosophy.<br>

  Introduction: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1287hgz">Ostension</a><br>
  Abstract: Plato marked a turning point in the appreciation of language by philosophers. In the
                  Cratylus, he shows that words are thoroughly conventional. Those who coin them do so with only a superficial understanding of the things spoken about. Accordingly, philosophical knowledge comes from inquiring into the natures of things rather than from learning to speak. Despite discovering the conventionality of language, Plato still accords speech a crucial role. Insight into the nature of things occurs by means of a conversation carried out with conventional terms: “For this knowledge is not something that can be put into words like other sciences;<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1287hgz">Ostension</a><br>
  Abstract: Augustine is not only the first thinker to pose and answer the problem of first word acquisition; he is also the first to pose and answer the problem of other minds. Bodily movement, the movement native to living beings, establishes the natural prelinguistic context for us to share attention and thereby to share words. We acquire words by following the bodily movement of language speakers as they approach, point, and look toward what they are talking about. Wittgenstein famously criticized this account for several reasons. First, it applies only to certain kinds of words, not to all or even most<br>

  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): PATTERSON DAVID<br>
  Abstract: The Shriek of Silenceis a first in several respects: the first to examine the Holocaust novels in their original languages, the first to articulate a theoretical basis for its approach, and the first phenomenological investigation -- one that attempts to penetrate the process of creation for these novelists. Organized along conceptual lines, the book examines "the word in exile," the themes of death of the father and the child, transformations of the self, and the implications of the reader. Its philosophical foundations are Rosenzweig, Buber, Neher, and Levinas. Its critical approach is shaped by Bakhtin.<br>

  Abstract: “And it came to pass in those days that terror denied all languages and frontiers” (Wiesel,
                  Six Days5). For those were days invaded by night, the days of the reign of the Kingdom of Night. They are days that haunt and harrow all subsequent days, words, and deeds, cutting through the frontiers of language and meaning that might once have divided light from darkness. Terror has undone time and with it that being that once inhabited the heart of human being, the being of the word. “There is no peace for the darkened valleys,” Amos Oz has said, “something<br>

                  Northseeks a similar union by exposing both minds to the light of consciousness. As part of this process of exposure, Ulster’s pattern of violence forces him to confront the tragic origins of culture.

  Abstract: Robert Frost observed that poetry begins in delight and ends in wisdom. When asked in an interview whether the same could be said of a poet’s career, Seamus Heaney responded by saying that a poet “begins in delight and ends in self-consciousness.”¹ In their claims about poetic practice, both Frost and Heaney embrace the commonplace notion that poets first begin to find a voice by delighting in language. Beyond this, their statements also suggest that such playful indulgence leads, or should lead, not only to a greater command of language but to a more pervasive and subtle knowledge of the<br>

  Abstract: From the outset of his career, the calling of poet has required Heaney to embark on a quest for self-definition, a quest in which every imaginative return to origins precipitates a new journey outward whereby the poet’s art and identity are redefined and enlarged. Yet, despite Heaney’s seemingly inexhaustible ability to reinvent himself in his work, the original binding connection between poet and place remains constant.

  Book Title: Poetry Of Discovery-The Spanish Generation of 1956-1971<br>
  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): DEBICKI ANDREW P.<br>
  Abstract: Although each of these poets has developed an individual style, their work has certain common characteristics: use of the everyday language and images of contemporary Spain, development of language codes and intertextual references, and, most strikingly, metaphoric transformations and surprising reversals of the reader's expectations. Through such means these poets clearly invite their readers to join them in journeys of poetic discovery.<br>

  1  The Generation of 1956–1971 from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt130jd70">Poetry Of Discovery</a><br>
  Abstract: Beginning in the late 1950s and extending through the 1960s, there appeared in Spain several young poets whose work reveals a high degree of originality, coupled with significant value. Because they were writing in a seemingly direct language and dealing with themes that had also been dealt with by earlier writers, these poets were at first considered mere continuers of the general tendencies of post-Civil War verse and were not accorded the importance they deserved. But as their work has grown and unfolded, as their ideas on poetry have been expressed and linked to their work, and as critics have<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt130jd70">Poetry Of Discovery</a><br>
  Abstract: The work of Francisco Brines exemplifies some of the main features of Spanish poetry in the 1960s. Meditative and philosophical, often centered on the themes of time and death and on the reactions that these evoke, Brines’s poetry is also marked by the very careful and artistic use of seemingly ordinary language. Critics have observed the symbolic nature of his work and its way of giving impact to seemingly common vignettes and expressions by juxtapositions, superpositions, and linguistic devices.¹<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt130jd70">Poetry Of Discovery</a><br>
  Abstract: As has often been noted, Claudio Rodríguez’s poetry illustrates attitudes and tendencies that came to the fore in Spain in the 1960s. Its seemingly everyday language and its allusions to common events link this poetry to earlier tendencies of post-Civil War verse. Yet a close look at individual texts makes clear that Rodríguez employs that language in a highly unusual and creative way, imparting significance to common words and expressions and making ordinary events suggest very fundamental meanings. His work avoids easy social and conceptual messages, and deals in complex fashion with such subjects as the conflict between negative and<br>

  6  JOSÉ ANGEL VALENTE: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt130jd70">Poetry Of Discovery</a><br>
  Abstract: Author of both poetic and critical works of major importance, José Angel Valente has articulated with precision the poetics and the attitude to art which underlie the works of his generation. In his essays Valente constantly stresses the goal of poetry in seizing and coming to know reality. Opposing the notion (so prevalent in the immediate post-Civil War period) that poets should communicate previously existent philosophic and social outlooks, Valente defends their role in discovering, through language, realities which would otherwise remain unexplored. This attitude is most evident in his frequently cited essay “Conocimiento y communicación”: “Todo poema es, pues,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt130jd70">Poetry Of Discovery</a><br>
  Abstract: Carlos Sahagún’s poetry calls less attention to itself than that of most other Spanish writers of the 1960s. We do not find in it the novel use of colloquial expressions that characterizes Angel González and Gloria Fuertes, nor the surprising changes and reappraisals typical of José Angel Valente, nor the alternation of linguistic codes used by Claudio Rodríguez. The language of Sahagún’s verse seems ordinary but never blatantly colloquial; his works often consist of easy-to-understand evocations of past experiences, expressed in a low key.¹ They contain many visual images and make use of some metaphors, but these tend to be<br>

  Abstract: A careful study of Spanish poetry of the Generation of 1956–1971 makes evident its innovativeness and importance. Although they base their works on the ordinary reality surrounding them and write in everyday language, the members of this generation create poems of great originality by skillful use of their materials. The combination of diverse language codes in the work of Rodríguez, the blending of colloquial expressions and intertextual effects by Fuertes, and the detailed descriptions and transformations of Cabañero illustrate their transcendence of the pedestrian realism of many earlier post-Civil War writers.

These notes become the dialogue of his plays; Shakespeare is depicted here as a great folk-poet, taking the living language of his people and crafting it into a work of his own, what Henry Glassie (personal communication) calls “the individual expression of the collective will” (or, in this case, “the collecting Will”).

  Book Title: Language, Eros, Being: Kabbalistic Hermeneutics and Poetic Imagination-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): WOLFSON ELLIOT R.<br>
  Abstract: This long-awaited, magisterial study-an unparalleled blend of philosophy, poetry, and philology-draws on theories of sexuality, phenomenology, comparative religion, philological writings on Kabbalah, Russian formalism, Wittgenstein, Rosenzweig, William Blake, and the very physics of the time-space continuum to establish what will surely be a highwater mark in work on Kabbalah. Not only a study of texts, Language, Eros, Being is perhaps the fullest confrontation of the body in Jewish studies, if not in religious studies as a whole.Elliot R. Wolfson explores the complex gender symbolism that permeates Kabbalistic literature. Focusing on the nexus of asceticism and eroticism, he seeks to define the role of symbolic and poetically charged language in the erotically configured visionary imagination of the medieval Kabbalists. He demonstrates that the traditional Kabbalistic view of gender was a monolithic and androcentric one, in which the feminine was conceived as being derived from the masculine. He does not shrink from the negative implications of this doctrine, but seeks to make an honest acknowledgment of it as the first step toward the redemption of an ancient wisdom.Comparisons with other mystical traditions-including those in Christianity, Buddhism, and Islam-are a remarkable feature throughout the book. They will make it important well beyond Jewish studies, indeed, a must for historians of comparative religion, in particular of comparative mysticism.Praise for Elliot R.

  Abstract: 1. Performativity in the sense of the way a dance, a musical composition, or a part in a play is performed has practically nothing to do with performativity in the sense of the ability a given enunciation has to function as a performative speech act. “He gave a spectacular performance of Hamlet” does not exemplify, nor does it refer to, the same use of language as does saying “He gave his solemn promise that he would be here at ten,” even though both are forms of enunciation, of speaking out,<br>

  Book Title: Regard for the Other: Autothanatography in Rousseau, De Quincey, Baudelaire, and Wilde-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burt E. S.<br>
  Abstract: Although much has been written on autobiography, the same cannot be said of autothanatography, the writing of one's death. This study starts from the deconstructive premise that autobiography is aporetic, not or not only a matter of a subject strategizing with language to produce an exemplary identity but a matter also of its responding to an exorbitant call to write its death. The I-dominated representations of particular others and of the privileged other to whom a work is addressed, must therefore be set against an alterity plaguing the I from within or shadowing it from without. This alterity makes itself known in writing as the potential of the text to carry messages that remain secret to the confessing subject. Anticipation of the potential for the confessional text to say what Augustine calls the secret I do not know,the secret of death, engages the autothanatographical subject in a dynamic, inventive, and open-ended process of identification. The subject presented in these texts is not one that has already evolved an interior life that it seeks to reveal to others, but one that speaks to us as still in process. Through its exorbitant response, it gives intimations of an interiority and an ethical existence to come. Baudelaire emerges as a central figure for this understanding of autobiography as autothanatography through his critique of the narcissism of a certain Rousseau, his translation of De Quincey's confessions, with their vertiginously ungrounded subject-in-construction, his artistic practice of self-conscious, thorough-going doubleness, and his service to Wilde as model for an aporetic secrecy. The author discusses the interruption of narrative that must be central to the writing of one's death and addresses the I's dealings with the aporias of such structuring principles as secrecy, Levinasian hospitality, or interiorization as translation. The book makes a strong intervention in the debate over one of the most-read genres of our time.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x03fr">Interstices of the Sublime: Theology and Psychoanalytic Theory</a><br>
  Abstract: The problem of thinking is a problem of sublimation. To have language, meaning, and thereby religion, science, culture, and art, there must be sublimation in a broad sense. This book has traced some of the intricacies of sublimation through psychoanalytic theory as it impresses upon theology. Sublimation means that meaning is not direct and unmediated but consists of a detour. At the same time, my readings of theology, continental philosophy, and psychoanalytic theory suggest that sublimation is not an elevation above a material reality. In chapter 1, I appealed to Deleuze to question the two-level model of reality that sublimation<br>

  Conclusion from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x03fr">Interstices of the Sublime: Theology and Psychoanalytic Theory</a><br>
  Abstract: The problem of thinking is a problem of sublimation. To have language, meaning, and thereby religion, science, culture, and art, there must be sublimation in a broad sense. This book has traced some of the intricacies of sublimation through psychoanalytic theory as it impresses upon theology. Sublimation means that meaning is not direct and unmediated but consists of a detour. At the same time, my readings of theology, continental philosophy, and psychoanalytic theory suggest that sublimation is not an elevation above a material reality. In chapter 1, I appealed to Deleuze to question the two-level model of reality that sublimation<br>

  Book Title: Sounding/Silence: Martin Heidegger at the Limits of Poetics-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SMITH DAVID NOWELL<br>
  Abstract: Sounding/Silence charts Heidegger's deep engagement with poetry, situating it within the internal dynamics of his thought and within the domains of poetics and literary criticism. Heidegger viewed poetics and literary criticism with notorious disdain: he claimed that his Erlauterungen ("soundings") of Holderlin's poetry were not "contributions to aesthetics and literary history" but rather stemmed "from a necessity for thought." And yet, the questions he poses--the value of significance of prosody and trope, the concept of "poetic language", the relation between language and body, the "truth" of poetry--reach to the very heart of poetics as a discipline, and indeed situate Heidegger within a wider history of thinking on poetry and poetics. opening up points of contact between Heidegger's discussions of poetry and technical and critical analyses of these poems, Nowell Smith addresses a lacuna within Heidegger scholarship and sets off from Heidegger's thought to sketch a philosophical "poetics of limit".<br>

  Abstract: Given the prominence Heidegger accords to poetry throughout a
                  Gesamtausgabethat now extends to 102 volumes, his discussions of figurative language are, at first glance, most conspicuous for their scarcity. Metaphor in particular is dismissed over four lapidary and categorical pronouncements. If this might be taken to demonstrate that Heidegger was simply uninterested in questions of metaphor, and of figurative language more generally,¹ one should nevertheless note that these pronouncements lie at the crux of his attempts both to think thealetheiccapacity of artworks, and to “undergo an experience with language” (OL 57/159).

  Book Title: Postmodern Apologetics?: Arguments for God in Contemporary Philosophy-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: This book provides an introduction to the emerging field of continental philosophy of religion by treating the thought of its most important representatives, including its appropriations by several thinkers in the United States. Part I provides context by examining religious aspects of the thought of Martin Heidegger, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jacques Derrida. Christina Gschwandtner contends that, although the work of these thinkers is not apologetic in nature (i.e., it does not provide an argument for religion, whether Christianity or Judaism), it prepares the ground for the more religiously motivated work of more recent thinkers by giving religious language and ideas some legitimacy in philosophical discussions. Part II devotes a chapter to each of the contemporary French thinkers who articulate a phenomenology of religious experience: Paul Ricoeur, Jean-Luc Marion, Michel Henry, Jean-Louis Chretien, and Jean-Yves Lacoste. In it, the author argues that their respective philosophies can be read as an apologetics of sorts-namely, as arguments for the coherence of thought about God and the viability of religious experience-though each thinker does so in a different fashion and to a different degree. Part III considers the three major thinkers who have popularized and extended this phenomenology in the U.S. context: John D. Caputo, Merold Westphal, and Richard Kearney. The book thus both provides an introduction to important contemporary thinkers, many of whom have not yet received much treatment in English, and also argues that their philosophies can be read as providing an argument for Christian faith.<br>

  Author(s) Bosco Mark<br>
  Abstract: The above sentiments of the Second Vatican Council’s
                  Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern Worldcapture a transitional moment in the Catholic Church’s attitude in its relationship with modernity. This shift is seen most remarkably in the language of the Council, what Jesuit historian John W. O’Malley notes is a change from “the rhetoric of reproach” so prevalent in documents from previous church councils to an embrace of the “rhetoric of affirmation and invitation.” The rhetorical change in attitude that permeates the Council documents was matched by a new formulation of the Church’s consciousness of itself since the<br>

  Abstract: It is daunting to be asked to communicate why Bernard Lonergan is such an important thinker. The magnitude of his achievement is great, and I owe a great personal debt for all that I have learned from him. Over the course of his life, Lonergan wrote extensively and profoundly about an amazing range of topics—painting and music; economics and politics; epistemology, metaphysics, and ethics; quantum mechanics and relativity theory; statistics and evolution; sexuality and marriage; logic, ordinary language, and symbolic meaning; religion and feelings; common sense; the theory of history; sin, grace, and the theology of the Christian doctrines<br>

  Book Title: Translating Investments: Metaphor and the Dynamics of Cultural Change in Tudor-Stuart England-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: The title Translating Investments, a manifold pun, refers to metaphor and clothing, authority and interest, and trading and finance. Translation, Latin translatio, is historically a name for metaphor, and investment, etymologically a reference to clothing, participates both in the complex symbolism of early modern dress and in the cloth trade of the period. In this original and wide-ranging book, Judith Anderson studies the functioning of metaphor as a constructive force within language, religious doctrine and politics, literature, rhetoric, and economics during the reigns of the Tudors and early Stuarts. Invoking a provocative metaphorical concept from Andy Clark's version of cognitive science, she construes metaphor itself as a form of scaffolding fundamental to human culture. A more traditional and controversial conception of such scaffolding is known as sublation-Hegel's Aufhebung, or raising,as the philosophers Jacques Derrida and Paul Ricoeur have understood this term. Metaphor is the agent of raising, or sublation, and sublation is inseparable from the productive life of metaphor, as distinct in its death in code or clich. At the same time, metaphor embodies the sense both of partial loss and of continuity, or preservation, also conveyed by the term Aufhebung. Anderson's study is simultaneously critical and historical. History and the theory are shown to be mutually enlightening, as are a wide variety of early modern texts and their specific cultural contexts. From beginning to end, this study touches the present, engaging questions about language, rhetoric, and reading within post-structuralism and neo-cognitivism. It highlights connections between intellectual problems active in our own culture and those evident in the earlier texts, controversies, and crises Anderson analyzes. In this way, the study is bifocal, like metaphor itself. While Anderson's overarching concern is with metaphor as a creative exchange, a source of code-breaking conceptual power, each of her chapters focuses on a different but related issue and cultural sector. Foci include the basic conditions of linguistic meaning in the early modern period, instantiated by Shakespeare's plays and related to modern theories of metaphor; the role of metaphor in the words of eucharistic institution under Archbishop Cranmer; the play of metaphor and metonymy in the writings of Luther, Zwingli, and Calvin and in John Donne's Devotions; the manipulation of these two tropes in the politics of the controversy over ecclesiastical vestments and in its treatment by John Foxe; the abuse of figuration in the house of Edmund Spenser's Busirane, where catachresis, an extreme form of metaphor, is the trope du jour; the conception of metaphor in the Roman rhetorics and their legacy in the sixteenth century; and the concept of exchange in the economic writing of Gerrard de Malynes, merchant and metaphorist in the reigns of Elizabeth and James. What emerges at the end of this book is a heightened critical sense of the dynamic of metaphor in cultural history.<br>

Qualifying Lanham’s definition, I have also observed the appreciation of traditional rhetoric for the necessity, and not merely the extravagance, of catachresis in the absence of any other suitable words. Lanham’s definition is a cogent synthesis abstracted from classical and Renaissance sources, and I have annotated it as such, along with reference to Patricia Parker’s provocative analysis of definitions of metaphor and catachresis from classical times to the<br>

  Book Title: Translating Investments: Metaphor and the Dynamics of Cultural Change in Tudor-Stuart England-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: The title Translating Investments, a manifold pun, refers to metaphor and clothing, authority and interest, and trading and finance. Translation, Latin translatio, is historically a name for metaphor, and investment, etymologically a reference to clothing, participates both in the complex symbolism of early modern dress and in the cloth trade of the period. In this original and wide-ranging book, Judith Anderson studies the functioning of metaphor as a constructive force within language, religious doctrine and politics, literature, rhetoric, and economics during the reigns of the Tudors and early Stuarts. Invoking a provocative metaphorical concept from Andy Clark's version of cognitive science, she construes metaphor itself as a form of scaffolding fundamental to human culture. A more traditional and controversial conception of such scaffolding is known as sublation-Hegel's Aufhebung, or raising,as the philosophers Jacques Derrida and Paul Ricoeur have understood this term. Metaphor is the agent of raising, or sublation, and sublation is inseparable from the productive life of metaphor, as distinct in its death in code or clich. At the same time, metaphor embodies the sense both of partial loss and of continuity, or preservation, also conveyed by the term Aufhebung. Anderson's study is simultaneously critical and historical. History and the theory are shown to be mutually enlightening, as are a wide variety of early modern texts and their specific cultural contexts. From beginning to end, this study touches the present, engaging questions about language, rhetoric, and reading within post-structuralism and neo-cognitivism. It highlights connections between intellectual problems active in our own culture and those evident in the earlier texts, controversies, and crises Anderson analyzes. In this way, the study is bifocal, like metaphor itself. While Anderson's overarching concern is with metaphor as a creative exchange, a source of code-breaking conceptual power, each of her chapters focuses on a different but related issue and cultural sector. Foci include the basic conditions of linguistic meaning in the early modern period, instantiated by Shakespeare's plays and related to modern theories of metaphor; the role of metaphor in the words of eucharistic institution under Archbishop Cranmer; the play of metaphor and metonymy in the writings of Luther, Zwingli, and Calvin and in John Donne's Devotions; the manipulation of these two tropes in the politics of the controversy over ecclesiastical vestments and in its treatment by John Foxe; the abuse of figuration in the house of Edmund Spenser's Busirane, where catachresis, an extreme form of metaphor, is the trope du jour; the conception of metaphor in the Roman rhetorics and their legacy in the sixteenth century; and the concept of exchange in the economic writing of Gerrard de Malynes, merchant and metaphorist in the reigns of Elizabeth and James. What emerges at the end of this book is a heightened critical sense of the dynamic of metaphor in cultural history.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x05b5">Translating Investments: Metaphor and the Dynamics of Cultural Change in Tudor-Stuart England</a><br>
  Abstract: This book studies the functioning of metaphor in Tudor and early Stuart culture. Accordingly, its chapters treat a range of disciplines, including language, religion, rhetoric, politics, literature, and economics. Also and inevitably, it touches the present, raising questions about the position of language and rhetoric within post-structuralism and neo-cognitivism and doing so in a way that highlights the connection between intellectual problems active in our own culture and those manifested in the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century texts, controversies, and crises that I discuss.

  Abstract: What follows further concerns two interlocking interests: the involvement of language in history, history in language, and herein the particular role of language, especially figurative language, in the early reforms of the established church in Tudor England. Still more specifically, my concerns in this chapter will focus on explanations of eucharistic belief during the archbishopric of Thomas Cranmer.

  Abstract: That a particular outfit or a more general style of clothing should make a ‘‘statement’’ is a familiar enough idea in the twenty-first century. It assumes that clothing, like language, participates in a system of signs, and that plain clothing, such as chinos or blue jeans, can be every bit as much a statement as can a dark suit, a pink dress, or a tuxedo. But when we take clothing to be making a ‘‘statement,’’ rhetorically we are using a metaphor, or possibly a metonymy, or both.

  Abstract: Although Luther is generally viewed as the creator of a homogeneous, modern German vernacular, after even a cursory sampling of passages in his immense oeuvre, one is struck by how artificial, hybrid, and strange his language is. Luther mixes Latin and German, biblical references and vernacular idioms, and blessings and curses. This mixing of registers was not entirely unprecedented in the sixteenth century—for example, the French author Rabelais did the same—but its effect on public speech was. Trained in the liberal arts and in the canonical literature of the Church, and being a particularly astute reader and translator<br>

  Abstract: What does it mean to practice a peace activism simultaneously rooted in Judaism and in human rights, in a context in which trauma-influenced readings of Jewish identity are invoked to justify violating the rights of other people(s)?¹ How can the language of universal rights be reconciled with a belief in Jewish uniqueness that includes a history of exceptional suffering and a divinely granted claim to a Promised Land inhabited by others?

  Book Title: Committing the Future to Memory: History, Experience, Trauma-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Clift Sarah<br>
  Abstract: Whereas historical determinacy conceives the past as a complex and unstable network of causalities, this book asks how history can be related to a more radical future. To pose that question, it does not reject determinacy outright but rather seeks to explore how it works. In examining what it means to be "determined" by history, it also asks what kind of openings there might be in our encounters with history for interruptions, re-readings, and re-writings. Engaging texts spanning multiple genres and several centuries from John Locke to Maurice Blanchot, from Hegel to Benjamin Clift looks at experiences of time that exceed the historical narration of experiences said to have occurred in time. She focuses on the co-existence of multiple temporalities and opens up the quintessentially modern notion of historical succession to other possibilities. The alternatives she draws out include the mediations of language and narration, temporal leaps, oscillations and blockages, and the role played by contingency in representation. She argues that such alternatives compel us to reassess the ways we understand history and identity in a traumatic, or indeed in a post-traumatic, age.<br>

  Book Title: Divine Enticement: Theological Seductions-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): MACKENDRICK KARMEN<br>
  Abstract: Theology usually appears to us to be dogmatic, judgmental, condescending, maybe therapeutic, or perhaps downright fantastical-but seldom enticing. Divine Enticement takes as its starting point that the meanings of theological concepts are not so much logical, truth-valued propositions-affirmative or negative-as they are provocations and evocations. Thus it argues for the seductiveness of both theology and its subject-for, in fact, infinite seduction and enticement as the very sense of theological query. The divine name is one by which we are drawn toward the limits of thought, language, and flesh. The use of language in such conceptualization calls more than it designates. This is not a flaw or a result of vagueness or imprecision in theological language but rather marks the correspondence of such language to its subject: that which, outside of or at the limit of our thought, draws us as an enticement to desire, not least to intellectual desire. Central to the text is the strange semiotics of divine naming, as a call on that for which there cannot be a standard referent. The entanglement of sign and body, not least in interpretations of the Christian incarnation, both grounds and complicates the theological abstractions. A number of traditional notions in Christian theology are reconceived here as enticements, modes of drawing the desires of both body and mind: faith as "thinking with assent"; sacraments as "visible words" read in community; ethics as responsiveness to beauty; prayer as the language of address; scripture as the story of meaning-making. All of these culminate in a sense of a call to and from the purely possible, the open space into which we can be enticed, within which we can be divinely enticing.<br>

  Abstract: Theology seduced me. I wanted to resist being drawn into its constant uncertainty and intellectual discomfort, but was enticed by its history of gorgeous writing (whether poetically extravagant or mathematically precise) and by the willingness of theological thinkers to take up thought at the limits of thinking, to say at the limits of language, to experience at the limits of the subject. My response has been to try to theorize that seduction—not as a defense, but as a response, as every seduction requires. Theology reaches for our limits, and it opens in our midst, not least in the middle<br>

  Book Title: Terms of the Political: Community, Immunity, Biopolitics-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Campbell Timothy<br>
  Abstract: Terms of the Political: Community, Immunity, Biopolitics presents a decade of thought about the origins and possibilities of political theory from one of contemporary Italy's most prolific and engaging political theorists, Roberto Esposito. He has coined a number of critical concepts in current debates about the past, present, and future of biopolitics-from his work on the implications of the etymological and philosophical kinship of community (communitas) and immunity (immunitas) to his theorizations of the impolitical and the impersonal. Taking on interlocutors from throughout the Western philosophical tradition, from Aristotle and Augustine to Weil, Arendt, Nancy, Foucault, and Agamben, Esposito announces the eclipse of a modern political lexicon-"freedom," "democracy," "sovereignty," and "law"-that, in its attempt to protect human life, has so often produced its opposite (violence, melancholy, and death). Terms of the Political calls for the opening of political thought toward a resignification of these and other operative terms-such as "community," "immunity," "biopolitics," and "the impersonal"-in ways that affirm rather than negate life. An invaluable introduction to the breadth and rigor of Esposito's thought, the book will also welcome readers already familiar with Esposito's characteristic skill in overturning and breaking open the language of politics.<br>

  Abstract: Foucault once said that political theory had still not reckoned with the end of sovereign power. In like fashion, one can say that political theory is only just now starting to confront itself and its languages with the consequences caused by the entrance of biology and biological considerations into questions of government. Roberto Esposito is perhaps the contemporary thinker who has gone furthest in questioning the traditional categories of political thought in light of the emergence of biopolitics. In this accessible collection of essays, he presents his own philosophical enterprise in terms of bridging deconstruction with biopolitics. Esposito is perhaps<br>

  Abstract: Before taking up how the theme of freedom relates to community, I would like to consider something even more fundamental that involves the entire political lexicon and the growing difficulty such a lexicon faces in signifying its own object—namely, the political.¹ A true barrier seems to have been erected between language and politics. It is as if politics has escaped from language, as if language no longer has any words with which to name politics. As early as the 1930s, Simone Weil wrote, “On inspection, almost all the words and phrases of our political vocabulary turn out to be<br>

  Book Title: Phenomenologies of the Stranger: Between Hostility and Hospitality-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: What is strange? Or better, who is strange? When do we encounter the strange? We encounter strangers when we are not at home: when we are in a foreign land or a foreign part of our own land. From Freud to Lacan to Kristeva to Heidegger, the feeling of strangeness-das Unheimlichkeit-has marked our encounter with the other, even the other within our self. Most philosophical attempts to understand the role of the Stranger, human or transcendent, have been limited to standard epistemological problems of other minds, metaphysical substances, body/soul dualism and related issues of consciousness and cognition. This volume endeavors to take the question of hosting the stranger to the deeper level of embodied imagination and the senses (in the Greek sense of aisthesis). This volume plays host to a number of encounters with the strange. It asks such questions as: How does the embodied imagination relate to the Stranger in terms of hospitality or hostility (given the common root of hostis as both host and enemy)? How do we distinguish between projections of fear or fascination, leading to either violence or welcome? How do humans sensethe dimension of the strange and alien in different religions, arts, and cultures? How do the five physical senses relate to the spiritual senses, especially the famous sixthsense, as portals to an encounter with the Other? Is there a carnal perception of alterity, which would operate at an affective, prereflective, preconscious level? What exactly do embodied imaginariesof hospitality and hostility entail, and how do they operate in language, psychology, and social interrelations (including racism, xenophobia, and scapegoating)? And what, finally, are the topical implications of these questions for an ethics and practice of tolerance and peace?<br>

  Abstract: By the gates of Thebes the stranger has no name. For to be given a name, or to give oneself a name, is to identify oneself as someone, and therefore as not a stranger anymore. Naming the stranger amounts to depriving him of his strangeness and appropriating him to the familiar, to ourselves. A stranger who can be named by this or that name is no longer strange. He is already within. Even before he enters my city or my home, he has entered my language: as Levinas says, “language

  Book Title: Labors of Imagination: Aesthetics and Political Economy from Kant to Althusser-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mieszkowski Jan<br>
  Abstract: This book is a major new study of the doctrines of productivity and interest in Romanticism and classical political economy. The author argues that the widespread contemporary embrace of cultural historicism and the rejection of nineteenth-century conceptions of agency have hindered our study of aesthetics and politics. Focusing on the difficulty of coordinating paradigms of intellectual and material labor, Mieszkowski shows that the relationship between the imagination and practical reason is crucial to debates about language and ideology.From the Romantics to Poe and Kafka, writers who explore Kant's claim that poetry sets the imagination freediscover that the representational and performative powers of language cannot be explained as the products of a self-governing dynamic, whether formal or material. A discourse that neither reflects nor prescribes the values of its society, literature proves to be a uniquely autonomous praxis because it undermines our reliance on the concept of interest as the foundation of self-expression or self-determination. Far from compromising its political significance, this turns literature into the condition of possibility of freedom. For Smith, Bentham, and Marx, the limits of self-rule as a model of agency prompt a similar rethinking of the relationship between language and politics. Their conception of a linguistic labor that informs material praxis is incompatible with the liberal ideal of individualism. In the final analysis, their work invites us to think about social conflicts not as clashes between competing interests, but as a struggle to distinguish human from linguistic imperatives.<br>

  Abstract: The vision of the self that emerges from Kleist’s reading of Kantian ethics differs sharply from the figure of specular self-determination generally associated with Idealist thought. In forcing us to reconsider the assumption that language can be a medium of rational activity, Kleist seems to part company from those inheritors of Kant who accord ultimate primacy to the authority of reason. At the same time, one could argue that Kleist shares with both Kant and the Idealists a sense of the volatile power of literary language and a more general concern with the historical dimensions of artistic creation.

  Book Title: Written Voices, Spoken Signs-Tradition, Performance, and the Epic Text<br>
  Publisher: Harvard University Press<br>
  Author(s): KAHANE AHUVIA<br>
  Abstract: These innovative essays by leading scholars of Homer, oral poetics, and epic invite us to rethink some key concepts for an understanding of traditional epic poetry. Egbert Bakker examines the epic performer's use of time and tense in recounting a past that is alive. Tackling the question of full-length performance of the monumental
         Iliad, Andrew Ford considers the extent to which the work was perceived as a coherent whole in the archaic age. John Miles Foley addresses questions about spoken signs and the process of reference in epic discourse, and Ahuvia Kahane studies rhythm as a semantic factor in the Homeric performance. Richard Martin suggests a new range of performance functions for the Homeric simile. And Gregory Nagy establishes the importance of one feature of epic language, the ellipsis. These six essays centered on Homer engage with fundamental issues that are addressed by three essays primarily concerned with medieval epic: those by Franz BÃƒÂ¤uml on the concept of fact; by Wulf Oesterreicher on types of orality; and by Ursula Schaefer on written and spoken media. In their Introduction the editors highlight the underlying approach and viewpoints of this collaborative volume.Reviews of this book:"Despite its wide range of topics and approaches, the volume has a clear thematic focus. All contributors seek to leave behind the more formal concerns of past generations of scholars and aim instead at an understanding of orality as that which is (conceptually or actually) close, immediate, or performed. In their joint search for the new picture, classicists, linguists, and medievalists discover a range of different 'oralities'."<br>

Recent studies of oral formulaic language, as represented elsewhere in this volume, have shown it to be capable of many subtly expressive effects and structural patternings.¹ But if we are approaching a time when it will make little difference whether the Homeric poems were composed orally or not (Martin 1989: 1), another, and older, question becomes more pressing: how could such large-scale poems as the Homeric epics<br>

This refers, first and foremost, to the deployment of a highly codified mode of expression which favors a shared “visual language”¹ over idiosyncratic style and narration. It also entails an enormous variety of page layouts, the inclusion of speed<br>

  Abstract: Jauss (

The word recurs frequently in many chapters, particularly the last one. That chapter shares its title with the volume as a whole, explicating the leitmotif ofdéclosionand carrying it to the brink of a further dialectical sublation .

  Author(s) CARROLL NOËL<br>
  Abstract: In the normal course of affairs, when confronted with an utterance, our standard cognitive goal is to figure out what the speaker intends to say. And, on one very plausible theory of language, the meaning of an utterance is explicated in terms of the speaker’s intention to reveal to an auditor that the speaker intends the auditor to respond in a certain way.¹ That is, the meaning of a particular language token is explained by means of certain of a speaker’s intentions.<br>

  Book Title: The Roots Of Thinking-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): Sheets-Johnstone Maxine<br>
  Abstract: "A significant contribution to the study of early humans, this book is a philosophical anthropology.... it makes genuinely novel, and highly persuasive, claims within the field itself." --David Depew In this ground-breaking interdisciplinary study about conceptual origins, Maxine Sheets-Johnstone shows that there is an indissoluble bond between hominid thinking and hominid evolution, a bond cemented by the living body. Her thesis is concretely illustrated in eight paleoanthropological case studies ranging from tool-using/tool-making to counting, sexuality, representation, language, death, and cave art. In each case, evidence is brought forward that shows how thinking is modeled on the body-specifically, how concepts are generated by animate form and the tactile-kinesthetic experience. Later chapters critically examine key theoretical and methodological issues posed by the thesis, Sheets-Johnstone demonstrates in detail how and why a corporeal turn in philosophy and the human sciences can yield insights no less extraordinary than those produced by the linguistic turn. In confronting the currently popular doctrine of cultural relativism and the classic Western metaphysical dualism of mind and body, she shows how pan-cultural invariants of human bodily life have been discounted and how the body itself has not been given its due. By a precise exposition of how a full-scale hermeneutics and a genetic phenomenology may be carried out with respect to conceptual origins, she shows how methodological issues are successfully resolved. "Ranging across the humanities and sciences, this thoroughly original book challenges both traditional metaphysics and contemporary cultural relativism. In their place, it persuasively develops a phenomenonological, tactile-kinesthetic account of the origins of thinking. This philosophical anthropology could not be more timely. It replaces the 'linguistic turn' with a promising new 'corporeal turn.'" --John J. Stuhr, University of Oregon "This work takes a much-needed stand in the inter-disciplinary field of philosophical anthropology. Sheets-Johnstone is well-read in the history of philosophy and in contemporary anthropology. The point of view she offers is inventive, insightful, well-established, and fruitful." --Thomas M.

  Abstract: Harry Stottlemeier's Discovery, created by Matthew Lipman in 1969, is now a widely used and highly successful tool for teaching philosophy to children. As the original novel of the Philosophy for Children program, its goal is to present major ideas in the history of philosophy, nurturing children's ability to think for themselves. At present, it is taught in 5,000 schools in the United States and has been translated into eighteen languages worldwide. This collection of essays reflects upon the development, refinement, and maturation of Philosophy for Children and on its relationship to the tradition of philosophy itself.<br>

However, the logical discoveries—exemplified by the persistence and single-mindedness of the central character, Harry—constitute a recurring theme that weaves its way through the overall story, and thereby into the thought and talk of the classroom community of inquiry. For it is logic that holds our thinking together—the rules and principles of logic provide criteria for distinguishing better thinking from worse. It is logic in language that makes reasoning possible.<br>

  Abstract: The metaphorical in language is now a starting place for any of us who wish to write. When one wishes to write about the Pacific, the challenge may be to acknowledge some of the old metaphors—and then to add a new one, or more, for the sake of understanding and further work. When we think of the Pacific we can think in diagrammatic terms, for example, of circles, circles within circles, webs of open space; we can think of more pictorial metaphors, like far-reaching ropes, nets of enormous size, waves or nested ripples of ocean water; we can think<br>

Of the estimated 300 North American indigenous languages spoken when the explorer Christopher Columbus arrived in 1492, some 210 survive; of the 210, about 175 are in the United States (Krauss 1996). Young, fluent speakers of a language are key to its continuing vitality among future generations. Of the 175 surviving indigenous languages in the United States, only about 20 have speakers<br>

  Abstract: Words are not the same thing as concepts. While concepts make things accessible to reason and thought, words make them accessible to speech (
                  parole). In ordinary language there may not be much need to differentiate neatly between the two, especially since speech and thought are closely interrelated, perhaps even closer than language (langue) and thought. But, at least in part, their interrelatedness is due to their common opposition to what in ordinary language is called reality. Speech and thought are among the most important devices of the human soul for conceptualizing reality. It may be naïve to identify reality with<br>

  Book Title: Resisting history-Religious transcendence and the invention of the unconscious<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hayward Rhodri<br>
  Abstract: How can historians make sense of visions, hauntings and demonic possession? Do miraculous events have any place in a world governed by cause and effect? In Resisting history, Rhodri Hayward examines the cumulative attempts of theologians, historians and psychologists to create a consistent and rational narrative capable of containing the inexplicable. This lucid and provocative account argues that the psychological theories we routinely use to make sense of supernatural experience were born out of struggles between popular mystics and conservative authorities. Hayward’s lively analysis of the Victorian disciplines of Christology, psychology and psychical research reveals how our modern concept of the subconscious was developed as a tool for policing religious inspiration. He concludes his argument with a vivid study of the Welsh Revival of 1904-5, in which the attempt of thousands of converts to cast off their everyday identity was diffused and defeated using the language of the new psychology. By revealing the politics inherent in such language, Hayward raises questions about its deployment in the work of today’s historians. Written in a clear and accessible style, Resisting history provides a fresh and entertaining perspective for anyone interested in questioning the concepts that underlie historical writing and psychological thought today.<br>

  Book Title: Acceptable words-Essays on the poetry of Geoffrey Hill<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): WAINWRIGHT JEFFREY<br>
  Abstract: Geoffrey Hill has said that some great poetry 'recognises that words fail us'. These essays explore Hill's struggle over fifty years with the recalcitrance of language. This book seeks to show how all his work is marked by the quest for the right pitch of utterance whether it is sorrowing, angry, satiric or erotic. It shows how Hill's words are never lightly 'acceptable' but an ethical act, how he seeks out words he can stand by - words that are 'getting it right'. This book is the most comprehensive and up-to-date critical work on Geoffrey Hill so far, covering all his work up to ‘Scenes from Comus’ (2005), as well as some poems yet to appear in book form. It aims to contribute something to the understanding of his poetry among those who have followed it for many years and students and other readers encountering this major poet for the first time.<br>

  Abstract: The first wonder of poetry lies in the immediate effects of language. How words are drawn from the myriad, their particular sounds heard and then associated by rhythm, and sometimes their visual appearance, constitutes the primary pleasure and amazement of verse. However great the repayments of re-reading and research might be, the experience of sensing the extraordinary in this dimension of language persists. It is the quality which led Milton in his pamphlet

  Book Title: "Insubordinate Irish"-Travellers in the Text<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): hAodha Mícheál Ó<br>
  Abstract: This book traces a number of common themes relating to the representation of Irish Travellers in Irish popular tradition and how these themes have impacted on Ireland’s collective imagination. A particular focus of the book is on the exploration of the Traveller as “Other", an "Other" who is perceived as both inside and outside Ireland’s collective ideation. Frequently constructed as a group whose cultural tenets are in a dichotomous opposition to that of the “settled" community, this book demonstrates the ambivalence and complexity of the Irish Traveller “Other" in the context of a European postcolonial country. Not only has the construction and representation of Travellers always been less stable and “fixed" than previously supposed, these images have been acted upon and changed by both the Traveller and non-Traveller communities as the situation has demanded. Drawing primarily on little-explored Irish language sources, this volume demonstrates the fluidity of what is often assumed as reified or “fixed". As evidenced in Irish-language cultural sources the image of the Traveller is inextricably linked with the very concept of Irish identity itself. They are simultaneously the same and “Other" and frequently function as exemplars of the hegemony of native Irish culture as set against colonial traditions. This book is an important addition to the Irish Studies canon, in particular as relating to those exciting and unexplored terrains hitherto deemed “marginal" - Traveller Studies, Romani Studies and Diaspora/Migration Studies to name but a few.<br>

  3  Irish Travellers and the bardic tradition from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155j9t5">"Insubordinate Irish"</a><br>
  Abstract: The initial Gypsilorist interest in Irish Travellers/tinkers was a short-lived phenomenon and it faded away after a few years. More than three decades passed before the subject was revived again as a source of interest. Once again, philology and its relation with cultural categorisation would prove the catalyst. It was not until the late 1930s that an interest in Traveller culture resurfaced once more and on this occasion it was the Traveller language known as Cant/Gammon and Shelta which acted as a catalyst for this renewed interest.<br>

  Abstract: As evidenced in the Irish language archive from which these narratives have been sourced, the tradition of representation as a whole whether hostile or a favourable as regards Travellers is an element of native Irish cultural tradition. The narratives are exemplars of the hegemony of native Irish culture as set against British colonial traditions. The stories are an element of both the settled Irish narrative traditions and the Traveller community’s tradition. They are simultaneously the same and ‘Other’. They are both inside and outside in the same way as the guardians and tellers of these stories were, whether Traveller or<br>

  Book Title: Aesthetics and subjectivity-  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): BOWIE ANDREW<br>
  Abstract: New, completely revised and re-written edition. Offers a detailed, but asccesible account of the vital German philosophical tradition of thinking about art and the self. Looks at recent historical research and contemporary arguments in philosophy and theory in the humanities, following the path of German philosophy from Kant, via Ficthe and Holderlin, the early Romantis, Schelling, Hegel, Scleimacher, to Nietzsche. Develops the approaches to subjectivity, aesthetics, music and language in relation to new theoretical developments bridging the divide between the continental and analytical traditions of philosophy. The huge growth of interest in German philosophy as a resource for re-thinking both literary and cultural theory, and contemporary philosophy will make this an indispensible read.<br>

  INTRODUCTION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jcnj">Aesthetics and subjectivity</a><br>
  Abstract: In recent years it has become apparent that many questions which first became manifest during the emergence of philosophical aesthetics at the end of the eighteenth century play a decisive role both in mainstream philosophy and in literary theory. The critiques of the idea that the world is ‘ready-made’ by Hilary Putnam and other pragmatically oriented thinkers, the concomitant attention by Nelson Goodman, Richard Rorty and others to the ‘world-making’ aspects of language, the related moves in the philosophy of language on the part of Donald Davidson and others towards holistic accounts of meaning, and the orientation in post-structuralism towards<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jcnj">Aesthetics and subjectivity</a><br>
  Abstract: The divergent interpretations of the relationship between music and language in modernity are inseparable from the main divergences between philosophical conceptions of language. The attempt to explain language in representational terms in the empiricist tradition that eventually leads to analytical philosophy, and the understanding of language as a form of social action and as constitutive of the world we inhabit in the hermeneutic tradition give rise to very different conceptions of music. One paradigmatic contrast has emerged in the preceding chapters, which can somewhat crudely be summarised as follows. On the one hand, music can be regarded as a deficient<br>

  Book Title: Rhetoric and the Writing of History, 400-1500-  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kempshall Matthew<br>
  Abstract: This book provides an analytical overview of the vast range of historiography which was produced in western Europe over a thousand-year period between c.400 and c.1500. Concentrating on the general principles of classical rhetoric central to the language of this writing, alongside the more familiar traditions of ancient history, biblical exegesis and patristic theology, this survey introduces the conceptual sophistication and semantic rigour with which medieval authors could approach their narratives of past and present events, and the diversity of ends to which this history could then be put. By providing a close reading of some of the historians who put these linguistic principles and strategies into practice (from Augustine and Orosius through Otto of Freising and William of Malmesbury to Machiavelli and Guicciardini), it traces and questions some of the key methodological changes that characterise the function and purpose of the western historiographical tradition in this formative period of its development.<br>

  Author(s) Zachman Randall C.<br>
  Abstract: John Calvin (1509–1564) was born in Noyon, France, and studied law at Orleans and Bourges. During his legal studies, Calvin also developed a love of Latin and Greek classical literature. After his sudden conversion to the evangelical movement started by Martin Luther, Calvin used his skill in languages to teach doctrine and interpret scripture for the evangelicals in France. Calvin was called to be a reader of scripture and pastor in Geneva in 1536. He and his colleague Guiaumme Farel were expelled from Geneva in 1538, and Calvin spent the next three years in Strasbourg, where he taught in<br>

  Abstract: Jesus is reported to have uttered several cries while being crucified. One of them is especially memorable. Jesus quotes in Aramaic—the vernacular language of the Jews of Palestine at that time—Ps 22:1, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” (
                     eloi, eloi, lemah savakthani; in Hebrew,eli, eli, lamah ‘azavthani).² These moving words are fraught with their own set of problems, starting with the hard-to-believe note that the crowd thought Jesus was calling the prophet Elijah.³<br>

  Author(s) Grabska Katarzyna<br>
  Abstract: Cairo, representative of many different faces, nationalities, traditions, languages, and cultures, has enjoyed the status of a cosmopolitan city throughout its history. Egypt also has been sought as a place of exile by sizeable refugee populations, including Palestinians after 1948 and Armenians who fled the 1915 massacre under the Ottomans. Traditionally, Palestinians constitute the largest proportion of exiled residents, today numbering between fifty and seventy thousand (el-Abed 2003).¹ In the 1950s and 1960s, Cairo was host to exiles from liberation movements in Africa and the Middle East, mainly small numbers of political activists.<br>

  Abstract: Nature is unruly, continually causing problems through flooded rivers and perfect storms and, of course, receding glaciers and global warming. In the modernist language of mainstream ecology, things spin out of control, beyond steady states and tipping points. While some of these events may be less surprising than they used to be, they often pose spectacular problems for human society and, as a result, demand close attention and concerted action. Wetlands have repeatedly provided apt examples, refusing to “behave”. Representing a substantial part of the earth’s land surface (about 6%), wetlands occur practically everywhere, on every continent (except Antarctica), in<br>

  Author(s) KAPLAN EDWARD K.<br>
  Abstract: This chapter traces the inception of André Neher’s significant role in the renewal of French Jewish intellectual and spiritual life after the Shoah. Born in 1914 in Obernai, in the Bas Rhin region of France, he was educated as both a secular intellectual and a religiously observant Jew. (His family moved to Strasbourg, which became French in 1918.) In 1936, aged twenty-two, he began to teach German language and literature at the Collège de Sarrebourg while also pursuing yeshiva studies in Montreux, Switzerland.¹ Mobilized in 1939, Neher made a crucial life decision when the Vichy government removed him from teaching<br>

  3  Gendered Narratives of Self, Addiction, and Recovery among Women Methamphetamine Users from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt15r3xt2">Narrative Criminology</a><br>
  Author(s) GUNDERMAN MIKH V.<br>
  Abstract: Narrative criminology, with its ethnomethodological influences, has much in common with feminist theoretical frameworks that concern themselves with uncovering the constitutive nature of gendered practices, including speech (Butler 1990; Connell 2002; Stokoe 2006; West and Zimmerman 1987). If narratives provide us, as analysts, a window into how individuals “organize views of themselves, of others, and of their social worlds” (Orbuch 1997, 455), then a critical facet of narrative analysis involves investigating how “women are constructed or construct themselves” within them (Daly and Maher 1998, 4).

The fine tissue of the life of spirit needs constant attention and regular revising of its language to express what is sometimes so faintly felt, so easily swamped, and yet is at the core of human life. We need words that move us, words of wonder, words of wisdom. It can happen, though, that what sounds right at one moment may have implications that in the long term are not right.

In 1985, I entered a plea for the right of the human analogy to be given full value as a paradigm for language about God: in a nutshell, it is unlikely to be appropriate or helpful to speak of God’s action upon a human person in ways that could not be applied to the action of another human person. In 1986, I appealed to the story of David and<br>

  Abstract: Encountering Morocco introduces readers to life in this North African country through vivid accounts of fieldwork as personal experience and intellectual journey. We meet the contributors at diverse stages of their careers-from the unmarried researcher arriving for her first stint in the field to the seasoned fieldworker returning with spouse and children. They offer frank descriptions of what it means to take up residence in a place where one is regarded as an outsider, learn the language and local customs, and struggle to develop rapport. Moving reflections on friendship, kinship, and belief within the cross-cultural encounter reveal why study of Moroccan society has played such a seminal role in the development of cultural anthropology.<br>

  Abstract: How close does the experience of language let reading get? How close is close reading? Taking close reading as its point of departure, this chapter will then widen its focus in order to consider the experience of language with some reference to art, interpretation, and what we are now accustomed to calling archi-writing. This last will also be called telescripture, written in the lower case, so that through its first and second syllables, derived not from “
                  telos,” end, but from “tēle,” distant, far, and through the allusion to uppercase (Holy) Scripture which its third and fourth syllables make, we do<br>

  Abstract: When Gadamer wrote the last part of
                  Truth and Method,language had not yet reached the leading role on the philosophical stage that it would later come to have. The “linguistic turn” of the twentieth century, the point at which the most varied of philosophical currents run together, had not yet occurred. These currents go from logical positivism to Wittgenstein, from american pragmatism to structuralism and psychoanalysis, from heidegger to the transcendental pragmatism of apel and habermas, from merleau-Ponty to derrida’s deconstruction. Philosophical hermeneutics contributes as well. But at that time even Gadamer could not imagine that his “turn”—the<br>

  INTRODUCTION: from:

  Author(s) Hekman Susan<br>
  Abstract: The purpose of this anthology is to bring the material, specifically the materiality of the human body and the natural world, into the forefront of feminist theory and practice. This is no small matter indeed, and we expect this collection to spark intense debate. Materiality, particularly that of bodies and natures, has long been an extraordinarily volatile site for feminist theory—so volatile, in fact, that the guiding rule of procedure for most contemporary feminisms requires that one distance oneself as much as possible from the tainted realm of materiality by taking refuge within culture, discourse, and language.

  Abstract: Language has been granted too much power. The linguistic turn, the semiotic turn, the interpretative turn, the cultural turn: it seems that at every turn lately every “thing”—even materiality—is turned into a matter of language or some other form of cultural representation. The ubiquitous puns on “matter” do not, alas, mark a rethinking of the key concepts (materiality and signification) and the relationship between them. Rather, it seems to be symptomatic of the extent to which matters of “fact” (so to speak) have been replaced with matters of signification (no scare quotes here). Language matters. Discourse matters.

  Abstract: The “linguistic turn” in postmodern and poststructural criticism has had a major impact on the landscape of the humanities and social sciences and the way we conceive and communicate our various concerns. Words such as “text,” “writing,” “inscription,” “discourse,” “language,” “code,” “representation,” and so on are now part of the vernacular in critical discussion. Indeed, over the years the textualizing of objects and methodologies has generated new interdisciplinary formations across the academy and transformed the content, approach, and even the justifications for research. On the political front we have seen similar shifts in the practices, modes of argumentation, and even<br>

  Abstract: Material Ecocriticism offers new ways to analyze language and reality, human and nonhuman life, mind and matter, without falling into well-worn paths of thinking. Bringing ecocriticism closer to the material turn, the contributions to this landmark volume focus on material forces and substances, the agency of things, processes, narratives and stories, and making meaning out of the world. This broad-ranging reflection on contemporary human experience and expression provokes new understandings of the planet to which we are intimately connected.<br>

  Book Title: The Cruelest of All Mothers: Marie de l'Incarnation, Motherhood, and Christian Tradition-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Dunn Mary<br>
  Abstract: In 1631, Marie Guyart stepped over the threshold of the Ursuline convent in Tours, leaving behind her eleven-year-old son, Claude, against the wishes of her family and her own misgivings. Marie concluded, "God was dearer to me than all that. Leaving him therefore in His hands, I bid adieu to him joyfully." Claude organized a band of schoolboys to storm the convent, begging for his mother's return. Eight years later, Marie made her way to Quebec, where over the course of the next thirty-three years she opened the first school for Native American girls, translated catechisms into indigenous languages, and served some eighteen years as superior of the first Ursuline convent in the New World. She would also maintain, over this same period, an extensive and intimate correspondence with the son she had abandoned to serve God. The Cruelest of All Mothers is, fundamentally, an explanation of Marie de l'Incarnation's decision to abandon Claude for religious life. Complicating Marie's own explication of the abandonment as a sacrifice carried out in imitation of Christ and in submission to God's will, the book situates the event against the background of early modern French family life, the marginalization of motherhood in the Christian tradition, and seventeenth-century French Catholic spirituality. Deeply grounded in a set of rich primary sources, The Cruelest of All Mothers offers a rich and complex analysis of the abandonment.<br>

  Abstract: Caring for the ill is a great moral task that brings into sharp relief our convictions about life and death. Not only does such care place the caregiver in unavoidable proximity to profound questions, but also the acts of care themselves reveal the nature of deeply held assumptions. Even the language that forms our descriptions of illness indicates some level of how we conceive of illness; our descriptions of illness also indicate how we understand the significance of life when it is in good health. In short, the words used for illness carry strong interpretive and evaluative power.<br>

  Book Title: Video Games Around the World-  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): IWATANI TORU<br>
  Abstract: Video games have become a global industry, and their history spans dozens of national industries where foreign imports compete with domestic productions, legitimate industry contends with piracy, and national identity faces the global marketplace. This volume describes video game history and culture across every continent, with essays covering areas as disparate and far-flung as Argentina and Thailand, Hungary and Indonesia, Iran and Ireland. Most of the essays are written by natives of the countries they discuss, many of them game designers and founders of game companies, offering distinctively firsthand perspectives. Some of these national histories appear for the first time in English, and some for the first time in any language.Readers will learn, for example, about the rapid growth of mobile games in Africa; how a meat-packing company held the rights to import the Atari VCS 2600 into Mexico; and how the Indonesian MMORPG
      Nusantara Onlinereflects that country's cultural history and folklore. Every country or region's unique conditions provide the context that shapes its national industry; for example, the long history of computer science in the United Kingdom and Scandinavia, the problems of piracy in China, the PC Bangs of South Korea, or the Dutch industry's emphasis on serious games. As these essays demonstrate, local innovation and diversification thrive alongside productions and corporations with global aspirations.Africa • Arab World • Argentina • Australia • Austria • Brazil • Canada • China • Colombia • Czech Republic • Finland • France • Germany • Hong Kong • Hungary • India • Indonesia • Iran • Ireland • Italy • Japan • Mexico • The Netherlands • New Zealand • Peru • Poland • Portugal • Russia • Scandinavia • Singapore • South Korea • Spain • Switzerland • Thailand • Turkey • United Kingdom • United States of America • Uruguay • Venezuela<br>

Beginning with the silent language of the divinatory lots, Werbner deciphers the everyday, metaphorical, and poetic language that is used to reveal their meaning. Through Werbner's skillful interpretations of the language of divination, a picture of Tswapong moral imagination is revealed. Concerns about dignity and personal illumination, witchcraft, pollution, the anger of dead ancestors, as well as the nature of life, truth, cosmic harmony, being, and becoming emerge in this charged African setting.<br>

  Abstract: The comparative study of moral systems is fundamental to anthropological thinking. This collection of nineteen chapters and the editors’ introduction present rich ethnographic cases from sub-Saharan Africa on a topic bearing on the definition of morality that has been at the forefront of anthropological findings drawn from research in the continent. Yet, as the editors point out, anthropologists have been hesitant to use a concept of “evil” to refer to acts and beliefs indigenously regarded as moral inversions or perversions of humanity. The term,

Nonconformism emerged as a significant cultural and social force in Welsh society in the late eighteenth century and was consolidated in the nineteenth century. Grounded in religious and cultural dissent and subject to constant schisms, the religious landscape of Welsh was dotted with a patchwork of small Protestant denominations, sects and independent congregations. Taken individually, these groups were diverse in matters of belief and politics. Taken together they constituted something rather more significant,<br>

  Abstract: The paradox of silence in literature has forever intrigued writers and philosophers. Among the many different types of silence, Beckett refers to the silence of what is being invoked indirectly, but not said explicitly, that is, the silence between phrases that we can hear in the intervals of a statement. This is a deeply literary silence not only because poetic language is generated by modes of indirection but also because, almost paradoxically, it is often this silence in the interstices of language that breathes life into literature, endowing it with the ability to engage readers with the limits of what<br>

  Abstract: This part reflects on the nature of music. It broadens its definition as a mere description in terms of a sounding structure by comparing it to language and speech. By stressing their roles in action and performance, both music and language in action establish social bonds that afford listeners and performers the feeling of a genuine and shared experience. The figure of the performer who acts as a mediator between music and audience is a crucial element in understanding the mutual relationship between theoretical approaches to music and its possible, actual performances.

  Abstract: Music and language seem, in our western conceptions, distinct spheres of human activity. Each has features that the other does not: language can refer, and is of paramount importance in our transactions with each other; music lacks any referential exactness and seem limited to the domain of affect, having powers to elicit emotions and their concomitant personal memories and meanings to a degree to which language, outwith the domain of poetry, rarely aspires. But seen, heard and understood from the perspective of cultures other than our own, the distinctness of music and language blurs. Music, for us primarily an aesthetic<br>

                  thcentury and certainly one of the most original thinkers that Western culture has ever produced.¹ The philosophy of Wittgenstein reflects on issues of logic, mathematics, language, psychology, ethics, aesthetics, religion, etc. His philosophical method combined the rejection of metaphysics and the scientific spirit with clarity and a simple, colloquial-like language, however pushed to such a level of logical precision that it seems to stretch the limits of thinking. The unorthodoxy of Wittgenstein emerges as much in his life as in his thought. For the reader unfamiliar with him, his writing<br>

Through complex and often convergent mechanisms of discourse and urban sociality, indigeneity is today going through a pro cess of redefinition in this part of the Andes, less through the application of criteria of race or language than through the following: participation in cultural per for mances such as music, dance, and private ceremonies; the deployment of new<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt183p184">Small Places, Large Issues</a><br>
  Abstract: The press occasionally brings stories about ‘feral children’ who are discovered after allegedly having spent many years in a forest or similar wilderness, isolated from culture and human society. According to such stories – Kipling’s novel about Mowgli,
                  The Jungle Book, is the most famous one (and one which does not, incidentally, claim authenticity) – these children have been raised by animals, usually monkeys, and are therefore unable to communicate with humans. Normally, ‘feral children’ are said to reveal a pattern of acting similar to animal behaviour; they growl, they are terrified of humans and they lack human language, table<br>

  Abstract: Some of the previous chapters have examined different forms of political organisation, world-views and systems of economic production and distribution. It has been noted for decades that the ethnographic present, the tense conventionally used when anthropologists talk about different societies, is increasingly, and more and more rapidly, becoming a past tense. In Australia, 250 languages were spoken in the late eighteenth century. At the outset of the twenty-first century, there were about 30 still regularly spoken, and few of them seemed likely to survive for another generation in Australia. Virtually all inhabitants of the world live in states which define<br>

  Abstract: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, formerly known as North-Western Province, in Pakistan occasionally makes international news in ways which indicate that this mountainous and remote region is even today only partly under the control of the state. The area is wedged between the borders to Afghanistan and Kashmir, and in cultural terms the Pashto speakers of Swat, Pathans or Pakthuns, have more in common with many Afghans than with most Pakistanis. The language belongs to a different branch of the Indo-European tree than Punjabi and Sindhi, the largest language communities in Pakistan; and most Taliban leaders are Pashto speakers..<br>

  Book Title: Forbidden Fictions-Pornography and Censorship in Twentieth-Century French Literature<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Phillips John<br>
  Abstract: ‘Phillips discusses texts by Apollinaire, Pierre Loüys, Georges Bataille, Pauline Réage, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Tony Duvert, Elizabeth Barillé and Marie Darrieussecq, engaging in different levels of critical analysis so as to emphasize intertextual and parodic elements in one case, or points of possible identification in another.’ TLS French culture has long been perceived by the English-speaking reader as somehow more ‘erotic’ than its Anglo-Saxon equivalent. Forbidden Fictions is the first English-language study devoted exclusively to the wide spectrum of French literary pornography in the twentieth century. John Phillips provides a broad history of the genre and the associated moral and political issues. Among the texts examined in detail – all selected for their literary or sociopolitical importance – are landmark works by Apollinaire, Louÿs, Bataille, Réage, Robbe-Grillet, Arsan, and Duvert. Phillips challenges current politically correct trends in literary criticism and stereotyped censoring discourses about pornography to provide a new reading of each text and to illustrate the genre’s potential for social subversion. Forbidden Fictions addresses the most controversial issues of contemporary sexual politics, such as objectification, sadomasochism, homoeroticism and paedophilia, with particular emphasis on the feminist debate on pornography. In the light of current controversy over the control of pornography, this is a timely and scholarly review of the ethical, moral and social arguments surrounding the censorship of sexually explicit material.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt18fs9q6">Locating Cultural Creativity</a><br>
  Author(s) Fernandez James W.<br>
  Abstract: I begin with two important modern philosophers, Wittgenstein and Rorty, as a context for more grounded anthropological discussion. These philosophers are both intensely interested in language (and particularly figurative language) and sympathetic to the anthropological project.² I refer to the project dating at least back to Vico which understands culture as something reconstructed, largely out of the building materials of language, from that which is long given.<br>

  Author(s) Howell Signe<br>
  Abstract: Following independence in 1949, the new nation state of Indonesia faced the formidable task of uniting a population scattered over several thousand islands and consisting of several hundred distinct cultural groupings – each with its own language and cultural practices. The new motto became ‘unity through diversity’ and the national charter emphasized democracy, social justice and the belief in ‘the unique Godhead’. Indonesian law recognizes five monotheistic world religions and has made the adherence to one of these a legal requirement. Moreover, Indonesian (
                  bahasa Indonesia) was declared the national language, to be employed in schools everywhere and as the language<br>

  Author(s) SOMOFF VICTORIA<br>
  Abstract: In a lecture entitled “From the Introduction to Historical Poetics,” Alexander Veselovsky makes an unusually casual reference, with no precise attribution, to a certain “erudite German [who] has dedicated a special monograph to a single poetic formula, tracing it from popular song to new manifestations in refined literature:
                  Wenn ich ein Vöglein wär!There are many formulas like this.”¹ Here the word “formula” stands for any preexisting pattern of verbal expression, from apparently dead meta phors of everyday language (e.g.,the sun rises) to artistic topoi, motifs, and plots. Once created, formulas carry on and endure, albeit in a multitude<br>

  Book Title: Practicing the City: Early Modern London on Stage-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Levine Nina<br>
  Abstract: In late-sixteenth-century London, the commercial theaters undertook a novel experiment, fueling a fashion for plays that trafficked in the contemporary urban scene. But beyond the stage's representing the everyday activities of the expanding metropolis, its unprecedented urban turn introduced a new dimension into theatrical experience, opening up a reflexive space within which an increasingly diverse population might begin to "practice" the city. In this, the London stage began to operate as a medium as well as a model for urban understanding. Practicing the City traces a range of local engagements, onstage and off, in which the city's population came to practice new forms of urban sociability and belonging. With this practice, Levine suggests, city residents became more self-conscious about their place within the expanding metropolis and, in the process, began to experiment in new forms of collective association. Reading an array of materials, from Shakespeare and Middleton to plague bills and French-language manuals, Levine explores urban practices that push against the exclusions of civic tradition and look instead to the more fluid relations playing out in the disruptive encounters of urban plurality.<br>

  Abstract: The sites of translation from indigenous to European languages, considered in this chapter as further and particular spaces of writing and reading hybridity between cultures, derive from different periods of New Caledonian post-contact history. They also come from different areas of an archipelago that includes the main island of

  Book Title: Medium, Messenger, Transmission-An Approach to Media Philosophy<br>
  Publisher: Amsterdam University Press<br>
  Author(s): Krämer Sybille<br>
  Abstract: Medium, Messenger, Transmissionuses the figure of the messenger as a key metaphor for the function of all transmission media. Sybille Krämer illustrates this argument with a diverse range of situations involving some form of transmission, including the circulation of money, the translation of languages, the spread of infectious diseases, processes of transference and countertransference as seen in psychoanalysis, and even the development of cartography. This rich study provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of media philosophy while illuminating transmission media as active mediators in all systems of exchange.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt19jcj20">Rethinking the "Romance of the Rose"</a><br>
  Author(s) Nichols Stephen G.<br>
  Abstract: Ekphrasis no longer enjoys the name recognition it once did. In the terminology of classical rhetoric, ekphrasis “was the elaborate ‘delineation’ (έκΦρασις,
                  descriptio, description), of people, places, buildings, works of art. Late antique and medieval poetry used it lavishly” (Curtis, 69). But, along with figurative language generally, it fell victim to the hostility toward classical rhetoric manifested by literary movements from romanticism to modernism. Indeed, one history of rhetoric still in use claims authoritatively: “ekphrasis . . . perverts descriptions because it frustrates narrative movement; [and] . . . confirms a decadent habit of literature” (Baldwin, 19).

  Abstract: Quiet Powers of the Possible offers an excellent introduction to contemporary French phenomenology through a series of interviews with its most prominent figures. Guided by rigorous questions that push into the most important aspects of the latest phenomenological research, the book gives readers a comprehensive sense of each thinker's intellectual history, motivations, and philosophical commitments. The book introduces readers to debates that have not previously been accessible to the English-speaking world, such as the growing interest in the phenomenological concept of life in its affective and even vital dimensions, the emerging dialogue with the analytic philosophy of mind and language, and reassessments of the so-called theological turn. The diversity of approaches collected here has its origin in a deeper debate about the conceptual and historical foundations of phenomenology itself. In this way the book offers the most accessible and wide-ranging introduction to French phenomenology to have appeared in the English-speaking world to date.<br>

  Book Title: Quiet Powers of the Possible: Interviews in Contemporary French Phenomenology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): HACKETT W. CHRIS<br>
  Abstract: Quiet Powers of the Possible offers an excellent introduction to contemporary French phenomenology through a series of interviews with its most prominent figures. Guided by rigorous questions that push into the most important aspects of the latest phenomenological research, the book gives readers a comprehensive sense of each thinker's intellectual history, motivations, and philosophical commitments. The book introduces readers to debates that have not previously been accessible to the English-speaking world, such as the growing interest in the phenomenological concept of life in its affective and even vital dimensions, the emerging dialogue with the analytic philosophy of mind and language, and reassessments of the so-called theological turn. The diversity of approaches collected here has its origin in a deeper debate about the conceptual and historical foundations of phenomenology itself. In this way the book offers the most accessible and wide-ranging introduction to French phenomenology to have appeared in the English-speaking world to date.<br>

  CHAPTER 3  Eucharistic Angels: from:

  Author(s) Butler Matthew<br>
  Abstract: On October 9, 1924, Catholic lawyer Miguel Palomar y Vizcarra addressed Mexico City’s Eucharistic Congress on the topic of men and Holy Communion. Palomar’s underlying theme was the affinity between Eucharistic participation and Catholic militancy, yet he described this relationship in masculine language: the Eucharist, Palomar stated, was an “ESSENTIALLY VIRILE SACRAMENT,” an invigorating banquet of Christ’s flesh that should fortify Catholics in the struggle to reconquer Mexican society. The Eucharist was also constitutive of Catholic manhood: “I have not come here to tell you that men should take communion because they are men,” Palomar continued, “but that they must<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt19rmckz">Local Church, Global Church</a><br>
  Author(s) Pensado Jaime M.<br>
  Abstract: The 1950s saw the rise of a new generation of leftist, conservative, and Catholic students in Latin America that began calling for a unique form of hemispheric solidarity. Their efforts reflected concerns about momentous contemporary events that had a profound impact at their universities, like the anticolonial war in Algeria, the rise of military dictatorships in Guatemala, and the “ iron fist” following the Hungarian insurrection. But these students also harkened back to the “arielista” language that characterized the first two decades of the twentieth century.¹ Asserting their ideological positions during the incipient cold war, they participated throughout the 1950s<br>

Indeed, the “theology of Israel” that comes to fruition in theSystematic Theologydisplays Jenson’s determination to work through the implications of a “newly demanding” confrontation with the fact of Judaism.²<br>

  Book Title: Theology in the Flesh-How Embodiment and Culture Shape the Way We Think about Truth, Morality, and God<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Sanders John<br>
  Abstract: Metaphors and other mental tools are used to reason (not just speak) about God, salvation, truth, and morality. Figurative language structures our theological and moral reasoning in powerful ways. This book uses an approach known as cognitive linguistics to explore the incredibly rich ways our conceptual tools, derived from embodied life and culture, shape the way we understand Christian teachings and practices. The cognitive revolution has generated amazing insights into how human minds make sense of the world. This book applies these insights to the ways Christians think about topics such as God, justice, sin, and salvation. It shows that Christians often share a set of very general ideas but disagree on what the Bible means or the moral stances we should take. It explains why Christians often develop a number of appropriate but sometimes incompatible ways to understand the Bible and various doctrines. It assists Christians in understanding those with whom they disagree. Hopefully, simply better understanding how and why people think the way they do will foster better dialogue and greater humility.<br>

  1  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1b3t7k7">Theology in the Flesh</a><br>
  Abstract: One might wonder what difference it makes whether we think of divine transcendence as God “above” us or as God “ahead of” us. It matters because we use these simple words to construct deep theological meaning. In this case, they are distinctive metaphors that lead us to very different ways of thinking about God’s relationship to us. Those who think of God as above us tend to conclude that our language never “reaches” up to God, and so, God is fundamentally unknowable. However, if one thinks of God as ahead of us on a path, then, though we may never<br>

  2  From Embodiment to Mental Models from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1b3t7k7">Theology in the Flesh</a><br>
  Abstract: The recent revolution in cognitive science has investigated how human minds make sense of our experience, uncovering the ways we find meaning in everything from various shapes to blinking lights. Cognitive linguistics is part of this revolutionary discovery. The study of cognitive linguistics began in the 1970s and is an influential approach to meaning construction used by an international body of scholars.¹ Cognitive linguistics examines how we think about the entire range of human experience, including causation, motion, time, relationships, entities, and emotions.² The research is interdisciplinary in nature, involving fields such as psychology, anthropology, neuroscience, philosophy, sign language, and<br>

  Abstract: Biblical writers used the same cognitive processes available to us. They made use of image schemas, frames, idealized cognitive models, prototypes, conceptual metaphors, metonymy, and conceptual blending. Biblical texts manifest the conceptual conventions present in their languages and cultures. This includes everything from grammar to moral reasoning to cosmology. Much can be learned about how different biblical writers conceived various topics by paying attention to the conceptual structures prompted by the texts.<br>

  Book Title: Moments of Silence-Authenticity in the Cultural Expressions of the Iran-Iraq War, 1980-1988<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Vatanabadi Shouleh<br>
  Abstract: The Iran-Iraq War was the longest conventional war of the 20th century. The memory of it may have faded in the wake of more recent wars in the region, but the harrowing facts remain: over one million soldiers and civilians dead, millions more permanently displaced and disabled, and an entire generation marked by prosthetic implants and teenage martyrdom. These same facts have been instrumentalized by agendas both foreign and domestic, but also aestheticized, defamiliarized, readdressed and reconciled by artists, writers, and filmmakers across an array of identities: linguistic (Arabic, Persian, Kurdish), religious (Shiite, Sunni, atheist), and political (Iranian, Iraqi, internationalist). Official discourses have unsurprisingly tried to dominate the process of production and distribution of war narratives. In doing so, they have ignored and silenced other voices.Centering on novels, films, memoirs, and poster art that gave aesthetic expression to the Iran-Iraq War, the essays gathered in this volume present multiple perspectives on the war's most complex and underrepresented narratives. These scholars do not naively claim to represent an authenticity lacking in official discourses of the war, but rather, they call into question the notion of authenticity itself. Finding, deciding upon, and creating a language that can convey any sort of truth at all-collective, national, or private-is the major preoccupation of the texts and critiques in this diverse collection.<br>

  Abstract: The role of language in shaping collective and national identities is of prime importance in socio-linguistic studies. The issue gains special significance in the case of Iran. There are at least three reasons for this. The first is that Iran has historically been in constant contact with
                  the foreignthrough political as well as economic, literary, and cultural interactions. The second is that it accommodates a variety of ethnic groups, minority languages, and dialects still spoken in different parts of the country.

  Completion Instead of Revelation: from:

  Author(s) FENVES PETER<br>
  Abstract: This essay is concerned with the act of the Messiah. According to a brief sketch that Walter Benjamin read to Theodor and Gretel Adorno in the winter of 1937–1938 and that has since acquired the title of “Theological-Political Fragment,” there is a single messianic act, the description of which requires three separate terms. Two of these terms can be easily translated into English, for they belong to a long tradition of theological speculation that encompasses a broad group of languages, including German and English. But the word through which Benjamin identifies

  Abstract: As enigmatic as it is at times, Walter Benjamin’s retrieval of Jewish theological language has perhaps done more for postwar German Christian theology than it could do for itself after the Holocaust, even though, admittedly, only a few theologians marked the Holocaust as a radical rupture of their tradition.¹ My reading of Benjamin engages specifically with two texts: “Critique of Violence” and “Theological-Political Fragment.”² I will demonstrate how an analysis sensitive to theological concepts may further inform a reading of Benjamin’s essays, before turning to Johann Baptist Metz’s reinterpretation of Christian theology as a new political theology.

  Abstract: The earliest cinema of Méliès and Lumière has more than once been likened to the current state-of-the-art interactive ‘new media’, and more specifically to non-linear interactive movies. Implicit in this observation is the fact that the sophistication of interactive movie language is awaiting the passage of time and the development of technology before it matures. It has been frequently noted that computers are still waiting for the first great visionary genius to take us into a new dimension.<br>

  Abstract: Despite the seemingly uncanny pithiness of Al Jolson’s famous lines, “Wait a minute! Wait a minute! You ain’t heard nothin’ yet”, in 1927, speech was not new to the cinema. In fact, speech had played a substantial role in silent films for nearly two decades. Dialogue intertitles and character-written inserts allowed cinematic representations to extend beyond the pictorial exterior and into the linguistic consciousness of characters. Silent film dialogue, however, brought more than a symbolic image of individual consciousness to the cinema. Reflecting a broader social matrix of language and power, written dialogue gave voice to the cultural politics endemic<br>

  Abstract: Anyone with more than a passing scholarly interest in things French will have encountered the notion that France is different from other countries.¹ We might disagree about the usefulness of this idea, we might think it is inaccurate or even trivial, but we have all been exposed to the view that important aspects of French society, French politics, French thought, French language and French culture are strikingly unique.

  Abstract: ‘

Ever since the dawn of the postmodern era, however, we are constantly offered new theoretical arguments to persuade us of the plurality and the frailness of the I. It is commonplace nowadays to talk of the individual as a representational construct that is conditioned, manufactured and manipulated by language, images and society, a construct that can even be artificially portrayed. The subject, so the argument runs, emerges precisely because it issubjectedto<br>

  Abstract: When we create arguments, when we act as rhetoricians, we reveal ourselves by the words and ideas we choose to employ. Verbal structures that are used widely and persistently are especially worth examination. Arguments made with repeated, almost formulaic, sets of words suggest a second argument flowing beneath the apparent argument. Beneath the apparently abstract language and the syllogistic form of these arguments, we may discover the deeper currents that explain, at least in part, why we seem so attached to these verbal structures.<br>

  Book Title: Death's Following: Mediocrity, Dirtiness, Adulthood, Literature-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): LIMON JOHN<br>
  Abstract: Almost all twentieth-century philosophy stresses the immanence of death in human life-as drive (Freud), as the context of Being (Heidegger), as the essence of our defining ethics (Levinas), or as language (de Man, Blanchot). In Death's Following, John Limon makes use of literary analysis (of Sebald, Bernhard, and Stoppard), cultural analysis, and autobiography to argue that death is best conceived as always transcendentally beyond ourselves, neither immanent nor imminent. Adapting Kierkegaard's variations on the theme of Abraham's near-sacrifice of Isaac while refocusing the emphasis onto Isaac, Limon argues that death should be imagined as if hiding at the end of an inexplicable journey to Moriah. The point is not to evade or ignore death but to conceive it more truly, repulsively, and pervasively in its camouflage: for example, in jokes, in logical puzzles, in bowdlerized folk songs. The first of Limon's two key concepts is adulthood: the prolonged anti-ritual for experiencing the full distance on the look of death. His second is dirtiness, as theorized in a Jewish joke, a logical exemplum, and T. S. Eliot's "Ash Wednesday": In each case, unseen dirt on foreheads suggests the invisibility of inferred death. Not recognizing death immediately or admitting its immanence and imminence is for Heidegger the defining characteristic of the "they," humanity in its inauthentic social escapism. But Limon vouches throughout for the mediocrity of the "they" in its dirty and ludicrous adulthood. Mediocrity is the privileged position for previewing death, in Limon's opinion: practice for being forgotten. In refusing the call of twentieth-century philosophy to face death courageously, Limon urges the ethical and aesthetic value of mediocre anti-heroism.<br>

  Book Title: Carnal Hermeneutics-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): TREANOR BRIAN<br>
  Abstract: Building on a hermeneutic tradition in which accounts of carnal embodiment are overlooked, misunderstood, or underdeveloped, this work initiates a new field of study and concern. Carnal Hermeneutics provides a philosophical approach to the body as interpretation. Transcending the traditional dualism of rational understanding and embodied sensibility, the volume argues that our most carnal sensations are already interpretations. Because interpretation truly goes "all the way down," carnal hermeneutics rejects the opposition of language to sensibility, word to flesh, text to body. In this volume, an impressive array of today's preeminent philosophers seek to interpret the surplus of meaning that arises from our carnal embodiment, its role in our experience and understanding, and its engagement with the wider world.<br>

  Author(s) de VRIES HENT<br>
  Abstract: That Hölderlin’s poetry revolves around certain notions of the divine, of gods, and of the holy is almost a commonplace, though it does so in a manner very different from the discourses on the coming god familiar from the Romantics through the later Heidegger.¹ The notion of the divine is often introduced in Hölderlin in a language that invokes topological images, theophanic heavens, and semigodly rivers, each of which seems to mark a specific manifestation or presence that is at once ineluctable and elusive, inscribed on the face of the earth and the sky but also “immediate” in an utterly<br>

  Author(s) Alexandrova Alena<br>
  Abstract: Whereas Part III deals with how the self-deconstruction of monotheism and Christianity entails a poetic mode of language and sense, this part examines how this self-deconstructive moment plays out in art and the image. Nancy suggests that art does not merely illustrate religion. Instead, the two are involved in the same self-deconstructive movement or in a process of a mutual dis-enclosure. Whereas art provides the sensible articulation of the internal destabilization of the religious mode, the unstable core in religion—an origin in its displacement—forms an integral part of the condition of art.<br>

  Abstract: Describing feelings is a notoriously difficult thing to do.

  Abstract: Jesus is not the first to travel to heaven in the Jewish scriptures, nor in the wider Jewish tradition,¹ to say nothing of Graeco-Roman traditions.² The question that naturally arises is to what extent, if at all, these earlier traditions have influenced Luke’s telling of the ascension of Jesus. This essay focuses on two key narrative traditions from the Old Testament (OT) of people travelling to heaven, namely, Elijah (2 Kgs 2:1–18) and, much more briefly, Enoch (Gen 5:24). We shall review these traditions and consider how far their language and themes are echoed in Luke’s accounts of Jesus’s<br>

  Book Title: On the Anarchy of Poetry and Philosophy-A Guide for the Unruly<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRUNS GERALD L.<br>
  Abstract: Marcel Duchamp once asked whether it is possible to make something that is not a work of art. This question returns over and over in modernist culture, where there are no longer any authoritative criteria for what can be identified (or excluded) as a work of art. As William Carlos Williams says, A poem can be made of anything,even newspaper clippings.At this point, art turns into philosophy, all art is now conceptual art, and the manifesto becomes the distinctive genre of modernism. This book takes seriously this transformation of art into philosophy, focusing upon the systematic interest that so many European philosophers take in modernism. Among the philosophers Gerald Bruns discusses are Theodor W. Adorno, Maurice Blanchot, Arthur Danto, Stanley Cavell, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Franois Lyotard, Jean-Luc Nancy, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, and Emmanuel Levinas.As Bruns demonstrates, the difficulty of much modern and contemporary poetry can be summarized in the idea that a poem is made of words, not of any of the things that we use words to produce: meanings, concepts, propositions, narratives, or expressions of feeling. Many modernist poets have argued that in poetry language is no longer a form of mediation but a reality to be explored and experienced in its own right. But what sort of experience, philosophically, might this be? The problem of the materiality or hermetic character of poetic language inevitably leads to questions of how philosophy itself is to be written and what sort of communitydefines the work of art-or, for that matter, the work of philosophy.In this provocative study, Bruns answers that the culture of modernism is a kind of anarchist community, where the work of art is apt to be as much an event or experience-or, indeed, an alternative form of life-as a formal object. In modern writing, philosophy and poetry fold into one another. In this book, Bruns helps us to see how.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c84gmm">On the Anarchy of Poetry and Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: Modernism Once More. Fredric Jameson has usefully proposed that we think of modernism not as a period concept but, more loosely, as a “narrative category” in which topics like nineteenth-century realism, self-reflexive language, and the impersonality of the artist get articulated and rearticulated in multifarious ways.¹ It is certainly the case that modernism is often defined more clearly by examples than by theories—serial music, cubism, nonlinear or fragmentary texts like Stein’sTender Buttons(or Wittgenstein’sTractatus), as well as avant-garde groups like the Surrealists whose aim was often less to produce works of art than to develop new forms<br>

  Abstract: Emmanuel Levinas’s writings are rich in comments and reflections on art, poetry, and the relations between poetry and ethical theory.¹ Of particular importance is the question of language, because there appears to be a kind of symmetry between language as an ethical relation and the language of poetry, both of which expose us to regions of subjectivity or existence on the hither (anarchic) side of cognition and being. The ethical and the poetic are evidently species of saying (
                  le Dire) in contrast to the propositional character of the said (le Dit), yet neither one is translatable into the other, and<br>

  Abstract: Citizens of the former Soviet Union, the men and women who grew up under Communism, share many extraordinary experiences of hardship, violence, and trauma. They have also spent the greater part of their lives interpreting and discussing their experience in a language almost entirely shaped by ideology. These aspects of their mental world lend special resonance to the work of collecting and analyzing their memories. In their case, too, the controversial term “collective memory” has real meaning. The Soviet state was very largely sealed from outside influences for several decades beginning in the 1930s. Official discourse was carefully shaped and<br>

  Book Title: Provocations to Reading: J. Hillis Miller and the Democracy to Come-J. Hillis Miller and the Democracy to Come<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kujundžić Dragan<br>
  Abstract: This book is a marker of the state of theorytoday. Its rich array of wideranging essays explores the dimensions and implications of the work of J. Hillis Miller, one of the most eminent literary scholars in America. For nearly half a century, Miller has been known for his close and imaginative engagement with the implications of European philosophical thought and for his passionate advocacy of close reading.Building on this intellectual legacy, the contributors instantiate and extend the practice and ethics of sustained close reading that is Miller's hallmark. The book culminates in a moving piece by Jacques Derrida, Miller's close friend of forty years, who engages Miller's readings of Gerard Manley Hopkins in a historic encounter between French philosophy and American reading practices.A provocation to reading for new generations of students and teachers, these essays offer important resources for grasping the question of language in historical perspective and in contemporary life-a task essential for any democratic future. Barbara Cohen is Director of HumaniTech at the University of California, Irvine. She is co-editor of Material Events: Paul de Man and the Afterlife of Theory. Dragan Kujunzic is Professor of Russian and Comparative Literature and Director of Russian Studies at the University of California, Irvine.

  Abstract: For me, the most valuable aspect of J. Hillis Miller’s work is his persistent questioning of literary language in the context of a widely ranging philosophical inquiry into the human (and lately the inhuman) conditions in which literature emerges. From his first to his most recent books, we find Miller courageously confronting whatever the mind has thought unfathomable. Indeed, Hillis Miller is one of the few great critics of our time to underscore precisely the

  Abstract: Art is a radical critique of representation, and as such is bound to compete with theology and other, ritual or clinical, modes of purification. “The pure products of America / go crazy,” William Carlos Williams wrote; and it is necessary to admit from the outset that the word “pure” has many meanings, some ambiguous, some downright deceptive. Though my theme is purity, and more specifically language purification in American poetry, one could easily write on “Seven Types of Purity.” Empson’s

  Abstract: The literature of criticism exists, yet we show it ambivalence and condescension. Literary devices when found in the language of critics are viewed as a breach of decorum: we like our criticism neat, a secondary and clearly separated activity in style and function. We could echo the reply of Thamus to Egyptian Theuth, in Plato’s
                     Phaedrus, after Theuth has extolled Writing, which he has invented. “O most ingenious man,” says Thamus, “to one is given to create the things of art, and to another to judge what measure of harm and profit they have for those that employ them.”<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cd0kz3">Twentieth Century Theories of Art</a><br>
  Abstract: In the English-speaking world, roughly from the 1950s to the 1970s, academic discussion of art and theory was dominated by this approach. The origin is largely in the work of English philosophers who became prominent in the forties and fifties and whose approach has been variously described as linguistic philosophy, philosophical analysis and philosophy of language. The name most prominent is that of Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889- 1951). His
                  Philosophical Investigationswas published in 1954 though his views had become widely known during the forties through the writings of other philosophers. Other seminal influences come from John Austin, Gilbert Ryle and<br>

  3  Revising Yoderʹs Theology of Violence from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cg4k49">Principalities and Powers</a><br>
  Abstract: The social and spiritual context of human beings suggests that the refusal of grace, as much as its acceptance, is not just an inner or individual phenomenon. Yoder’s sociological theology unsurprisingly casts sin in broad structural and cosmic terms. The powers are fallen, meaning, the created social structures are now badly malformed. God’s intended peaceful order has been disrupted and violence is the norm. As a Christian pacifist, Yoder was concerned to expose how violence is implicated in the everyday language and practices of Christians. Some critics argue that he was so focused on violence that he lost sight of<br>

  Abstract: Julian of Norwich has a high profile these days. This is surely no accident. In an age that has become sensitive to the wisdom sounding in voices historically less heeded, she speaks as a medieval woman. In an age that has learned to wonder whether the systematic discourses of reason penetrate to those mysteries lying at the very heart of things, she speaks in the language of mystical revelation. Moreover, among the female, medieval, and mystical voices we have been minded to listen to anew, hers is one of the most mellifluous. I mean that her voice attracts us. It<br>

  Abstract: Elhanan Winchester was born on September 30, 1751, in Muddy Water Village (later renamed Brookline) outside of Boston, New England—a fifth-generation American colonist. As a boy Elhanan received a common education and did not go to university but he was blessed with a good memory and a capacity for languages. He mastered Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and French, all of which he put to use in his later ministry. He grew up imbibing moderate Calvinist theology in the local Congregational church and while he later came to repudiate aspects of this theology, it continued to inform his Christian thinking until<br>

  Abstract: In what language was the NT originally written? Almost all of the NT authors were Jews, but not a single book was written in Hebrew or Aramaic (a related Semitic language).¹ All of the NT books were written when Rome ruled the Mediterranean world, but none were written in Latin. Therefore we must turn to the one language prevalent during that period: ancient Greek. We have over five thousand manuscript copies of the NT written in Greek from the mid-second to the twelfth centuries. The earliest versions of the NT were in Syriac, Coptic, and Latin (as early as the<br>

  Book Title: Storied Revelations-Parables, Imagination and George MacDonald’s Christian Fiction<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Peterson Eugene H.<br>
  Abstract: George MacDonald, the Victorian poet and theologian, observed that his was a culture saturated with Christian jargon but often void of a profound understanding of the gospel for its own time and culture. The language of Scripture no longer penetrated people’s hearts, thoughts, and attitudes; it no longer transformed people’s lives. MacDonald, called to be a pastor, turned to story and more specifically the "parabolic" as a means of spiritual awakening. He created fictive worlds in which the language of Jesus would find a new home and regain its revelatory power for his particular Victorian audience. 'Storied Revelations' explores the interface between the Bible and George MacDonald’s fiction. The way Jesus uses language in the parables sheds light on our understanding of MacDonald’s careful use of language in his fiction. Further still, many of MacDonald’s stories are infused with the language of the Bible, often in rather surprising ways.<br>

  Abstract: Parables—used by Jesus to reveal to us the Kingdom of God, used to move us from being bystanders to active recipients of God’s work of revelation—are constantly at risk of being buried into “mummies of prose” as George MacDonald puts it. We become so familiar with the language of Scripture and are so far removed from the context in which these parables had their meaning that Jesus’ parables no longer work on us in this revelatory and transforming way. Each new generation must recover the vibrant, often shocking dimension of Jesus’ parables and create a new context in<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgdztj">Storied Revelations</a><br>
  Abstract: George MacDonald’s theological rationale for story and the “parabolic” is closely connected to his understanding of Scripture, language, creation, and how God reveals himself in and through it. In order to understand MacDonald’s view of Scripture, especially as related to the “parabolic” and the role Scripture plays in his understanding of revelation and spiritual transformation, it is important to locate him in his historical context. Only by outlining the general attitude towards Scripture and closely related questions such as the role of science in Victorian Britain can we properly understand MacDonald’s response to the challenges of his time and the<br>

  Book Title: In the Eyes of God-A Metaphorical Approach to Biblical Anthropomorphic Language<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Howell Brian C.<br>
  Abstract: Anthropomorphic language has provided a conundrum for exegetes and theologians for millennia. Attempting to use human language to describe the divine presents ontological and epistemological problems that push our speech to the breaking point. In this new work, Howell shows that instances of divine action should not automatically be reduced simply to theological categories such as omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence, immutability, etc., nor to criteria such as personhood, life, and approachability. Rather, he introduced readers to two unique approaches to “anthropomorphic expressions".<br>

Whilst the theories of Lakoff and Grady propose a transference from the source to the target domain, in biblical anthropomorphic language it becomes difficult to discern which is which.

  Book Title: Sacramental Presence after Heidegger-Onto-theology, Sacraments, and the Mother's Smile<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Sweeney Conor<br>
  Abstract: "Theology after Heidegger must take into account history and language as elements in the pursuit of meaning. Quite often, this prompts a hurried flight from metaphysics to an embrace of an absence at the center of Christian narrativity. Conor Sweeney here explores the “postmodern" critique of presence in the context of sacramental theology, engaging the thought of Louis-Marie Chauvet and Lieven Boeve. Chauvet is an influential postmodern theologian whose critique of the perceived onto-theological constitution of presence in traditional sacramental theology has made big waves, while Boeve is part of a more recent generation of theologians who even more wholeheartedly embrace postmodern consequences for theology. Sweeney considers the extent to which postmodernism à la Heidegger upsets the hermeneutics of sacramentality, asking whether this requires us to renounce the search for a presence that by definition transcends us. Against both the fetishization of presence and absence, Sweeney argues that metaphysics has a properly sacramental basis, and that it is only through this reality that the dialectic of presence and absence can be transcended. The case is made for the full but restless signification of the mother’s smile as the paradigm for genuine sacramental presence."<br>

                     Seinsfrageand his subsequent turn to time and language as the horizon of Being, philosophers and theologians courageous—or perhaps naïve—enough to grapple with the Heideggerean corpus have been struggling to come to grips with the implications of Heidegger’s claims. According to many commentators, this is a task that in the Catholic world has only just begun.<br>

  5  Healing as an Image for the Atonement: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf32j">Justification in a Post-Christian Society</a><br>
  Author(s) PETERSON CHERYL M.<br>
  Abstract: In Western theology, the doctrine of the atonement has been dominated by forensic language and the image of the courtroom. Forensic language has been particularly important to a Lutheran understanding of justification: where, by grace through faith, sinners are “declared righteous” on account of Christ. Such language has been criticized, however, for not doing justice to a fuller New Testament understanding of salvation which includes the forgiveness of sins, healing, reconciliation, restoration, and wholeness, and which is experienced communally as well as individually. By so strongly emphasizing forensic imagery in both the doctrine of justification and the atonement, Lutheranism is<br>

  Abstract: ‘The main thrust of what I want to say is that translating the Bible is an art that we seem to have lost, for mysterious reasons.’ So said David Daniell, the distinguished Tyndale scholar, at a conference in London in February 1995. There has been, to my knowledge, no decisive answer offered to the question implied by his statement. Daniell himself points out some of the central paradoxes of this situation. The ‘we’ of his statement refers, of course, to the community of English-speakers, a language which ‘has never been in better shape … It is healthier than ever before,<br>

  Chapter Two  Challenging the Holy Marriage: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf395">Translating the English Bible</a><br>
  Abstract: Relevance Theory is a development of communication theory springing from Paul Grice’s notion that there must be a ‘Co-operative Principle’ at work in conversation. This principle underwrites Maxims of Conversation underlying our ability to communicate. One of these, the so-called Maxim of Relation, simply specifies this: Be Relevant. Grice observed that speakers in conversation seem to observe this maxim, both in speaking and in interpreting, and that it is this ‘unspoken agreement’ which allows communication to take place, despite the indeterminacy of reference which is characteristic of language. Two linguists, Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson picked up this ball in<br>

  Book Title: Theology in Language, Rhetoric, and Beyond-Essays in Old and New Testament<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Lundbom Jack R.<br>
  Abstract: Theology in Language, Rhetoric, and Beyond' places before a broad audience of students and general readers theological essays on both the Old and New Testaments. Theology is seen to derive from a number of sources: the biblical language, biblical rhetoric and composition, academic disciplines other than philosophy, and above all a careful exegesis of the biblical text. The essay on Psalm 23 makes use of anthropology and human-development theory; the essay on Deuteronomy incorporates Wisdom themes; the essay called "Jeremiah and the Created Order" looks at ideas not only about God and creation but also about the seldom-considered idea of God and a return to chaos; and the essay on the "Confessions of Jeremiah" examines, not the words that this extraordinary prophet was given by God to preach, but what he himself felt and experienced in the office to which he was called. One essay on "Biblical and theological themes" includes a translation into the African language of Lingala, which weaves together the story of early Christianity with the more recent founding of churches in Africa and Asia. Jack R. Lundbom argues eloquently through these essays that theology is rooted in biblical words, in themselves, in rhetoric and their different contexts.<br>

  Book Title: God's Wounds-Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of the Divine Suffering, Volume 2. Evil and Divine Suffering<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Pool Jeff B.<br>
  Abstract: This book constitutes the second volume of a three-volume study of Christian testimonies to divine suffering: God's Wounds: Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of Divine Suffering, vol. 2, Evil and Divine Suffering. The larger study focuses its inquiry into the testimonies to divine suffering themselves, seeking to allow the voices that attest to divine suffering to speak freely, then to discover and elucidate the internal logic or rationality of this family of testimonies, rather than defending these attestations against the dominant claims of classical Christian theism that have historically sought to eliminate such language altogether from Christian discourse about the nature and life of God. This second volume of studies proceeds on the basis of the presuppositions of this symbol, those implicit attestations that provide the conditions of possibility for divine suffering-that which constitutes divine vulnerability with respect to creation-as identified and examined in the first volume of this project: an understanding of God through the primary metaphor of love (God is love); and an understanding of the human as created in the image of God, with a life (though finite) analogous to the divine life-the imago Dei as love. The second volume then investigates the first two divine wounds or modes of divine suffering to which the larger family of testimonies to divine suffering normally attest: (1) divine grief, suffering because of betrayal by the beloved human or human sin; and (2) divine self-sacrifice, suffering for the beloved human in its bondage to sin or misery, to establish the possibility of redemption and reconciliation. Each divine wound, thus, constitutes a response to a creaturely occasion. The suffering in each divine wound also occurs in two stages: a passive stage and an active stage. In divine grief, God suffers because of human sin, betrayal of the divine lover by the beloved human: divine sorrow as the passive stage of divine grief; and divine anguish as the active stage of divine grief. In divine self-sacrifice, God suffers in response to the misery or bondage of the beloved human's infidelity: divine travail (focused on the divine incarnation in Jesus of Nazareth) as the active stage of divine self-sacrifice; and divine agony (focused on divine suffering in the crucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth) as the passive stage of divine self-sacrifice.<br>

  Book Title: Facing the Other-John Paul II, Levinas, and the Body<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): de Malherbe Brice<br>
  Abstract: What is the significance of the body? What might phenomenology contribute to a theological account of the body? And what is gained by prolonging the overlooked dialogue between St. John Paul II and Emmanuel Levinas? Nigel Zimmermann answers these questions through the agreements and the tensions between two of the most important thinkers of the twentieth century. John Paul II, the Polish pope, philosopher, and theologian, and Emmanuel Levinas, the French-Jewish philosopher of Lithuanian heritage, were provocative thinkers who courageously faced and challenged the assumptions of their age. Both held the human person in high regard and did their thinking with constant reference to God and to theological language. Zimmermann does not shirk from the challenges of each thinker and does not hide their differences. However, he shows how they bequeath a legacy regarding the body that we would overlook at significant ethical peril. We are called, Zimmermann argues, to face the other. In this moment God refuses a banal marginalisation and our call to responsibility for the other person is issued in their disarming vulnerability. In the body, philosophy, theology, and ethics converge to call us to glory, even in the paradox of lowly suffering.<br>

  Abstract: This book adds to a litany of works in recent years that argue for a theological significance of the body. It shares the sentiment of Matthew’s gospel that the theological meaning of the body exceeds outer apparel, even the language used to describe it or the metaphors with which it is dressed. It is indeed “more than clothes.” However, this book resists the temptation to merely propose a carnivalesque or reductionist postmodern account of the human person in which goodness and truth are tied to the pleasures of the body.

  Book Title: Facing the Other-John Paul II, Levinas, and the Body<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): de Malherbe Brice<br>
  Abstract: What is the significance of the body? What might phenomenology contribute to a theological account of the body? And what is gained by prolonging the overlooked dialogue between St. John Paul II and Emmanuel Levinas? Nigel Zimmermann answers these questions through the agreements and the tensions between two of the most important thinkers of the twentieth century. John Paul II, the Polish pope, philosopher, and theologian, and Emmanuel Levinas, the French-Jewish philosopher of Lithuanian heritage, were provocative thinkers who courageously faced and challenged the assumptions of their age. Both held the human person in high regard and did their thinking with constant reference to God and to theological language. Zimmermann does not shirk from the challenges of each thinker and does not hide their differences. However, he shows how they bequeath a legacy regarding the body that we would overlook at significant ethical peril. We are called, Zimmermann argues, to face the other. In this moment God refuses a banal marginalisation and our call to responsibility for the other person is issued in their disarming vulnerability. In the body, philosophy, theology, and ethics converge to call us to glory, even in the paradox of lowly suffering.<br>

  5  Bede and Frank Ankersmit: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgfb0w">Allegorizing History</a><br>
  Abstract: Up to this point, I have tried to show how Bede’s practice of history was deeply theological yet ran into some difficulties that someone like Augustine was able to avoid when he came to the literal sense of Genesis 1. One of these problems revolves around how language refers in its literal and historical usage. Recall that Bede read the days in Genesis 1 as literal 24-hour days, despite Augustine’s unwillingness to affirm such a reading in his literal commentary on Genesis. For Bede the literal and the allegorical were in tension with each other; when one moves to allegory,<br>

  Book Title: God's Wounds-Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of Divine Suffering, Volume 1. Divine Vulnerability and Creation<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Pool Jeff B.<br>
  Abstract: This book constitutes the first volume of a three-volume study of Christian testimonies to divine suffering: God's Wounds: Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of Divine Suffering, Divine Vulnerability and Creation. This study first develops an approach to interpreting the contested claims about the suffering of God. Thus, the larger study focuses its inquiry into the testimonies to divine suffering themselves, seeking to allow the voices that attest to divine suffering to speak freely, to discover and elucidate the internal logic or rationality of this family of testimonies, rather than defending these attestations against the dominant claims of classical Christian theism that have historically sought to eliminate such language altogether from Christian discourse about the nature and life of God. Through this approach, this volume of studies into the Christian symbol of divine suffering then investigates the two major presuppositions that the larger family of testimonies to divine suffering normally hold: an understanding of God through the primary metaphor of love (God is love); and an understanding of the human as created in the image of God, with a life (though finite) analogous to the divine life - the imago Dei as love. When fully elaborated, these presuppositions reveal the conditions of possibility for divine suffering and divine vulnerability with respect to creation.<br>

  Abstract: Immersion education in both the Republic of Ireland and Canada in the 21
                  stcentury entails education through indigenous but minority languages within the context of dominant anglophone cultures. “Immersion education” is a broad term used to describe various educational approaches. In Canada the term describes education in which at least 50 percent of the curriculum is delivered through the medium of a language other than that normally spoken by students (Genesee 1999). In Ireland the term describes education where all subjects other than English are taught through Irish. In both Canada and Ireland, English is the dominant language of the<br>

  Abstract: Within plurilegal and plurilingual legislative contexts, statutes should convey the same meaning to all citizens and should be construed by judges in a way comprehensible to all parties concerned. In jurisdictions where two or more legal traditions are merged, quite often expressed in more than one legal language, it is necessary for laws to be drafted, implemented and interpreted in accord with these different legal traditions and languages. Except for situations where one legal tradition is articulated in one language, there are a number of instances where bijuralism and/or multilingualism are operative: a few cases in point are the legal<br>

  8  Meganarratives of Supermodernism: from:

  Author(s) Kingwell Mark<br>
  Abstract: It is a truism, but a worthwhile one, to note that the concept of postmodernism was adumbrated in architecture before appearing elsewhere, a language and a style before it was a condition or a form of knowledge suitable to, or demanding of, report (Jencks, 1978; Lyotard, 1984). To be sure, as Jameson (1984) acknowledges in his preface to the English translation of the latter text, the specifically architectural use of the adjective is distinct, indeed narrower, in referring mostly (and often indeterminately) to a cluster or trend of building designs that sought release from the rigid sleekness of normative architectural<br>

  Abstract: It is a truism, but a worthwhile one, to note that the concept of postmodernism was adumbrated in architecture before appearing elsewhere, a language and a style before it was a condition or a form of knowledge suitable to, or demanding of, report (Jencks, 1978; Lyotard, 1984). To be sure, as Jameson (1984) acknowledges in his preface to the English translation of the latter text, the specifically architectural use of the adjective is distinct, indeed narrower, in referring mostly (and often indeterminately) to a cluster or trend of building designs that sought release from the rigid sleekness of normative architectural<br>

  Book Title: Philosophical Theory and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights-  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>
  Author(s): Sweet William<br>
  Abstract: Philosophical Theory and the Universal Declaration of Human Rightsexamines the relations and interrelations among theoretical and practical analyses of human rights. Edited by William Sweet, this volume draws on the works of philosophers, political theorists and those involved in the implementation of human rights. The essays, although diverse in method and approach, collectively argue that the language of rights and corresponding legal and political instruments have an important place in contemporary social political philosophy.<br>

  Eleven  MODERATING THE PHILOSOPHY OF RIGHTS from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1ckpdx6">Philosophical Theory and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a><br>
  Author(s) Nelson Ralph<br>
  Abstract: Surely one of the most remarkable occurrences in the last half of the twentieth century was the revival of human–formerly natural–rights theory. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948; the emergence of notions of human rights in political philosophy, especially liberal political philosophy; the use of the rhetoric of rights in international relations; the entrenchment of rights in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms; and last, but not least, the adoption by Pope John Paul II of the language of human rights bear testimony to this renewed interest.<br>

  CHAPTER THREE  THE SHROUDING OF AMBIGUITY from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cn6rz3">Myth, Symbol, and Colonial Encounter</a><br>
  Abstract: Why is it that the British colonial language of inclusion (paternalistic and morally degrading though it was) was at such variance with colonial practice? The answer may lie in the British assertion of cultural purity that sought to create the colonial human being and Acadia itself, and that, paradoxically, constituted the foundation of calls for the civilization of aboriginal peoples. The claim to be firmly British was clearly problematic. These peoples’ European identity had been transformed in the process of becoming colonials. Western Europeans, for instance, were not scalpers; the British in eighteenth century Acadia were. After announcing in 1749<br>

Succinctly stated, description deals with things as they relate to us; explanation with things as they relate to each other.¹ So, for instance, to speak of a wheel as round is to

Bakhtin’s primary significance lies in his dialogism, that theory of discourse which enables him to establish, chart, and identify so many of the ways in which literary forms coincide with other diachronic systems of human communication.

  Abstract: Settling and writing the New World means coming to terms with its ontological status and constructing its discourse. There is a pause or stillpoint in the migration from the fixed and placed culture of Europe to the new setting, in this case Canada—a moment which is disconnected from the Old World and as yet unconnected to the New. That stillpoint between cultures is charged with questions of structure and meaning, and finds a reflection in literature, in language, in human being itself.

  Abstract: While Heidegger takes a general ontological perspective, Blanchot deals with the question of the event as an interrogation that mainly concerns the being of literature. Language is no longer the channel through which Being and man come to belong to one another; the fictive essence of language according to Blanchot deprives the subject of self and robs the real of sense. If Heidegger regards poetry as a truthful principle that is the source and foundation of man’s dwelling, Blanchot assigns it an illusory principle that affects both the experience of the writer and the written work itself.

Born in 1953 in German-speaking Nitzkydorf—a Banat-Swabian village in southwestern Romania—Müller grew up as part of a linguistic and ethnic minority in a Communist state. Her writing career began with a fictionalized portrayal of the village of her childhood, an isolated backward community deeply influenced by National Socialism and characterized by narrow-minded ethnocentrism. Romanian literary censorship, which had dramatically increased in the 1980s, delayed the publication of Müller’s first collection of short stories for<br>

  Abstract: The novel
                  Atemschaukel[The Hunger Angel] marks an important turning point in the career of Herta Müller— an author who fought her way from writing literary texts with the regional touch of a small minority into the center of German mainstream literature. In 2009, the year of its publication,Atemschaukelbecame the focus of attention for the most prestigious German-language newspapers:Die Zeit,Süddeutsche Zeitung,Neue Zürcher Zeitung,Frankfurter Rundschau, andtaz. Its reception intensified further when Müller received the Nobel Prize for literature in the same year. In this chapter I will discuss the novel’s success in connection with<br>

These objects, which transcend genres and languages, relentlessly reappear dispersed (and broken) throughout her oeuvre (regardless of their disfiguration) and map out a visible path to Müller’s process of remembering. In addition to empowering particular objects, this method highlights the new, more effortless mobility across borders, which resulted from the opening of the former Communist countries in Eastern Europe.

  Abstract: In
      Born in the Blood, noted translator and writer Brian Swann gathers some of the foremost scholars in the field of Native American translation to address the many and varied problems and concerns surrounding the process of translating Native American languages and texts. The essays in this collection address such important questions as, what should be translated? how should it be translated? who should do translation? and even, should the translation of Native literature be done at all? This volume also includes translations of songs and stories.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1df4gp3">Born in the Blood</a><br>
  Author(s) Swann Brian<br>
  Abstract: Translating Native American languages is a very different process from translating European languages. For one thing, the translation of European languages does not usually present real physical and spiritual dangers.¹ For another, there are the complexities of collaboration between non-Native academics and Native American culture-bearers, formerly “informants.” Moreover, translators have to decide how to transform oral expression into a written form, and in addition they may have to produce their own grammars and dictionaries, as part of what Julie Brittain and Marguerite MacKenzie in this volume term “a unique constellation of factors.” This constellation can also include “the interaction of<br>

  Author(s) Jancewicz Bill<br>
  Abstract: While some theorists have suggested that translation is impossible (Payne 1971), to a large degree Western civilization and culture has depended upon translated documents originally written in one language into some other, usually more common, language. A large portion of our current understanding of philosophy, history, mythology, and religion comes to us through translated documents. What could we know of Aristotle, Plato, Moses, or Muhammad without contemporary translations of their writings into our mother tongue? From the philosophy of Immanuel Kant to the literature of Victor Hugo, the breadth of human knowledge is inextricably linked to the translation of documents<br>

  Author(s) MacKenzie Marguerite<br>
  Abstract: In this chapter we discuss a number of issues pertinent to the translation of Canadian Aboriginal oral literature, specifically that of the Algonquian peoples of the Quebec-Labrador peninsula (eastern Canada). Our discussion focuses on a collection of “oral texts” (the Innu-Naskapi collection) with which we have been involved as translators since 1985 (MacKenzie) and 1996 (Brittain).¹ Working collaboratively with native speakers of the Aboriginal language, we have now published English translations of several stories from this collection (e.g., MacKenzie 2004; Brittain and Mac-Kenzie et al. 2004, 2005). The Innu-Naskapi collection was recorded on cassette tape in 1967 and 1968. It<br>

  Abstract: The significant development concerning traditional Native American literature and Native American cultural research has invoked attention to the intricacies of Native languages that previously had been ignored, if even considered at all (Basso 1984; Bringhurst 1999; Hymes 1981; Kroeber 1981; Kroskrity 1986; Swann 1992; Tedlock 1972). This attention has sparked a review of the volumes amassed during the early part of the twentieth century by the premier anthropologist Franz Boas and his protégés (1911, 1922). This return—to the texts gathered by Boasians as well as other collections—is replete with stories and songs of the tribes of North America.<br>

  Author(s) Haag Marcia<br>
  Abstract: The central problem of translation, namely, the competition between faithfulness to meaning and preservation of form, grows more attenuated as translation moves from simple conveyance of information to artistic forms. Generally, in working with translations among European languages, the translator struggles with word choices when one language contains a particular word that denotes or connotes an idea that the other language does not. Then the translator seeks synonyms, or may resort to a phrase that more completely captures the sense intended. The translator may also have to deal with problems of grammatical structure: a language may lack a particular verbal<br>

  Abstract: The Grecanici are a Greek linguistic minority in the Calabria region of Italy, remnants of a population that has resided there since late antiquity. Their language represents a holdover from the Middle Ages, at least, and possibly even to the Greek colonies of the classical period. For decades the Grecanici passionately fought to be recognized by the Italian state as an official linguistic minority, finally achieving this goal in 1999. Violence, corruption, and mismanagement are inextricable parts of the social fabric, but Grecanici have crafted the means to invert hegemonic culture and participate in the power games of minority politics.<br>

They ask questions such as: How can women successfully re-territorialize their violated bodies within the intimate spaces from which they have been exiled? How can they overcome linguistic limitations in expressing pain? Beyala sees linguistic violence as<br>

  Book Title: Views from the Margins-Creating Identities in Modern France<br>

  Abstract: What does it mean to be French? What constitutes "Frenchness"? Is it birth, language, attachment to republicanism, adherence to cultural norms? In contemporary France, these questions resonate in light of the large number of non-French and non-European immigrants, many from former French colonies, who have made France home in recent decades. Historically, French identity has long been understood as the product of a centralized state and culture emanating from Paris that was itself central to European history and civilization. Likewise, French identity in terms of class, gender, nationality, and religion mainly has been explained as a strong, indivisible core, against which marginal actors have been defined.<br>

As a result of the Second Vatican Council, the Roman Catholic Church significantly changed its practices. These innovations included the use of vernacular languages during church services, the full endorsement of democratic institutions, and the abandonment of earlier views deemed as overtly anti-Semitic.

They remain doubly marginalized because their claims to land, language, ethnogenetic survival, or even sovereignty are often at odds with the interests not only of the respective dominant society but also of<br>

      Local Knowledge, Global Stage, examines worldwide historical trends of anthropology ranging from the assertion that all British anthropology is a study of the Old Testament to the discovery of the untranslated shorthand notes of pioneering anthropologist Franz Boas. Other topics include archival research into the study of Vancouver Island's indigenous languages, explorations of the Christian notion of virgin births in Edward Tylor'sThe Legend of Perseus, and the Canadian government's implementation of European-model farms as a way to undermine Native culture. In addition to Boas and Tylor, the essays explore the research and personalities of Susan Golla, Edwin Sydney Hartland, and others.<br>

  Author(s): Schwabe Claudia<br>
  Abstract: New Approaches to Teaching Folk and Fairy Talesprovides invaluable hands-on materials and pedagogical tools from an international group of scholars who share their experiences in teaching folk- and fairy-tale texts and films in a wide range of academic settings.This interdisciplinary collection introduces scholarly perspectives on how to teach fairy tales in a variety of courses and academic disciplines, including anthropology, creative writing, children's literature, cultural studies, queer studies, film studies, linguistics, second language acquisition, translation studies, and women and gender studies, and points the way to other intermedial and intertextual approaches. Challenging the fairy-tale canon as represented by the Brothers Grimm, Charles Perrault, Hans Christian Andersen, and Walt Disney, contributors reveal an astonishingly diverse fairy-tale landscape.The book offers instructors a plethora of fresh ideas, teaching materials, and outside-the-box teaching strategies for classroom use as well as new and adaptable pedagogical models that invite students to engage with class materials in intellectually stimulating ways. A cutting-edge volume that acknowledges the continued interest in university courses on fairy tales,New Approaches to Teaching Folk and Fairy Talesenables instructors to introduce their students to a new, critical understanding of the fairy tale as well as to a host of new tales, traditions, and adaptations in a range of media.<br>

This is not to suggest that scholars have ignored discussions about metaphor in their work on Revelation; rather, there has been little systematic analysis of the metaphorical language in the text.

  KNOWING IS SEEING: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1f5g5j7">Foundations for Sociorhetorical Exploration</a><br>
  Author(s) Huber Lynn R.<br>
  Abstract: As we saw in chapter 1,¹ since the earliest centuries of the church, interpreters have acknowledged the imagistic or metaphorical nature of the book of Revelation, although they disagree about what this characterization means. This suggests that bringing the insights of metaphor theory to bear on Revelation would be an appropriate and fruitful endeavor, especially contemporary theories of metaphor that emphasize the cognitive nature of this phenomenon. This is not to suggest that scholars have ignored discussions about metaphor in their work on Revelation; rather, there has been little systematic analysis of the metaphorical language in the text. Scholars who<br>

  TWO  “My Self,” “My Own”: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1f89tnz">Citizen Subject</a><br>
  Abstract: In this lecture, I would like to tell a story about words. Or rather, two stories at once. The first is a public story, that of one moment within the great history of “personal” and “possessive” pronouns, which traverses the entire history of “Western culture,” thanks to what has been called its colingualism, and determines its understanding of subjectivity.¹ The second and much more modest story is a private one, although it owes every thing to public institutions of teaching and research: it concerns a stage in my own journey of initiation into the English language, from which, without indulging<br>

  TEN  Judging Self and Others: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1f89tnz">Citizen Subject</a><br>
  Abstract: In French and several other languages, the notion of judgment designates both a “faculty” or “capacity” and an action that takes place within the sphere of public or private relations. It can have a general neutral signification (that of an evaluation about the adequacy of means to ends or to the quality of the ends themselves). But more often it designates, in dissymmetrical fashion, the determination of a deserved or undeserved sanction upon the action of a subject, especially when the action in question is a “crime” or a “delict.”<br>

  Abstract: While the Virginian Lucian Minor could praise “Yankee hospitality” during the early years of the sectional crisis in the 1830s, by the 1850s sectional tensions had caused regional prejudices, stereotypes, and suspicions to harden to such an extent that such praise would have seemed impossible. The language of “southern hospitality” emerged in the 1830s amid the growing sectional crisis that began to consume American culture, and it would only proliferate as the crisis intensified in the decades leading up to the Civil War.

  Book Title: Indebted-Capitalism and Religion in the Writings of S. Y. Agnon<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Sagiv Yonatan<br>
  Abstract: This is the first book to examine the oeuvre of Shmuel Yosef Agnon, 1966 Nobel laureate in literature, through a reading that combines perspectives from economic theory, semiotics, psychoanalysis, narrative theory, and Jewish and religious studies. Sagiv outlines the vital role economy plays in the construction of religion, subjectivity, language, and thought in Agnon's work, and, accordingly, explores his literary use of images of debt, money, and economy to examine how these themes illuminate other focal points in the canonical author's work, excavating the economic infrastructure of discourses that are commonly considered to reside beyond the economic sphere.Sagiv's analysis of Agnon's work, renowned for its paradoxical articulation of the impact of modernity on traditional Jewish society, exposes an overarching distrust regarding the sustainability of any economic structure. The concrete and symbolic economies surveyed in this project are prone to cyclical crises. Under what Sagiv terms Agnon's "law of permanent debt," the stability and profitability of economies are always temporary. Agnon's literary economy, transgressing traditional closures, together with his profound irony, make it impossible to determine if these economic crises are indeed the product of the break with tradition or, alternatively, if this theodicy is but a fantasy, marking permanent debt as the inherent economic infrastructure of human existence.<br>

  Abstract: Even a superficial reading of the Gospels will suffice to convince the reader that incarnation is the alpha and—as resurrection of the flesh—the omega of Christian faith. And with the body, involvement in the human world and its history is part of God’s self-revelation in his Word through the Spirit. The Christian community, whose faith is corporeal, communicative, communitarian, and sacramental, participates in this involvement. None of its activities is possible in the ether of incorporeal ghosts or spirits. All prophecies and fulfillments are facts of language; the entire liturgy is visible, tactile, and resounding; rituals have the<br>

  7  Bonaventure’s Contribution to the Twentieth-Century Debate on Apophatic Theology from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1g2kn48">The Quest for Meaning</a><br>
  Abstract: God has died, at least in science and philosophy. He is agonizing in religious study, perhaps even in some divinity schools. Atheism and a careful sequestration of God from current business are the two main forms in which academia deals with the long history of religion, which, notwithstanding academic reservations, goes on. For scholarship, faith, God, and religion have become curiosa. The theoretical intention has separated itself from religious commitments; it abhors edifying language and has forgotten or rejected the long history of its association with contemplation.

  Abstract: The Gift of Love builds upon recent scholarship and reads Augustine’s De Trinitate as a rational study of the limits of theological language and the possibility of knowing the Trinity because of those limits. Marion’s description of the gift of love offers to Augustine’s theology a phenomenological texture by which the trinitarian love given might be made incarnate in one’s life.

Casting a belief shared by many contemporaries in the language of Constructivism, Moholy announces that photography and film are poised to displace literature as a medium of communication in virtue of their superior clarity, simplicity, and exactness. Photography’s exactness, in particular, is the source of its striking narrative power, which dispenses with the vagaries<br>

  Abstract: Djebar’s trajectory and development as a writer can be conceived as a gradual movement away from any specific form of identification with Algeria towards a new configuration of her native land as severed, diverse and haunted by its past. The lingering traces of a search for the specific in the earlier works give way, by the time of

My aim in this paper is to argue that Adorno’s engagement with the nature of language is informed by an implicit attempt at a revaluation of the language of philosophy, a revaluation that has significant consequences for a global understanding of how we conceive the world of objects, in general, and how philosophy’s configurative use of<br>

  Book Title: The Resounding Soul-Reflections on the Metaphysics and Vivacity of the Human Person<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Kimbriel Samuel<br>
  Abstract: It is surely not coincidental that the term “soul" should mean not only the centre of a creature’s life and consciousness, but also a thing or action characterized by intense vivacity (“that bike’s got soul!"). It also seems far from coincidental that the same contemporary academic discussions that have largely cast aside the language of “soul" in their quest to define the character of human mental life should themselves be so – how to say it? – bloodless, so lacking in soul. This volume arises from the opposite premise, namely that the task of understanding human nature is bound up with and in important respects dependent upon the more critical task of learning to be fully human, of learning to have soul. The papers collected here are derived from a conference in Oxford sponsored by the Centre of Theology and Philosophy and together explore the often surprising landscape that emerges when human consciousness is approached from this angle. Drawing upon literary, philosophical, theological, historical, and musical modes of analysis, the essays of this volume vividly remind the reader of the power of the ancient language of soul over against contemporary impulses to reduce, fragment, and overly determine human selfhood.<br>

  Author(s) Zimmermann Nigel<br>
  Abstract: The problem of the body-soul relationship is treated by Emmanuel Levinas and St. John Paul II as one of describing the manifestation of the other person in terms of the gift. The soul, assuming such an objective reality exists, is taken to bear itself in the world only in so far as it is manifested in the body. However, in describing the significance of the body in Levinas and John Paul II, two differing trajectories of the gift emerge, which meet in convergence and departure. Both thinkers draw upon a phenomenologically informed set of intellectual commitments, and both incorporate language<br>

  Abstract: While there is such a thing as “soul music,” there is no such thing as “self music.” Why is this? What is the difference between the two? And is not the language of “self” all pervasive in our cultures, while the language of soul seems to have gone into eclipse, especially among the more modernly educated persons? Why is this? What might be at issue in the music of the soul in soul music, and the music-less self without soul. “Oh self, self, self. At every turn nothing but self”—so expostulates Charles Dickens’s Martin Chuzzlewit.¹ And yet for all<br>

  Author(s) SENGHOR LÉOPOLD SÉDAR<br>
  Abstract: During the last thirty or so years that we have been proclaiming negritude, it has become customary, especially among English-speaking critics, to accuse us of
                  racialism.This is probably because the word is not of english origin. But, in the language of Shakespeare, is it not in good company with the words humanism and socialism? Mphahleles¹ have been sent about the world saying, “negritude is an inferiority complex”; but the same word cannot mean both racialism and inferiority complex without contradiction. The most recent attack comes from ghana, where the government has commissioned a poem entitled “I hate negritude”—as<br>

  Abstract: While women from industrialized countries are focusing their attention on the problem of creating a typically female language, the daughters of black Africa are still at the stage of seeking their own dignity, for the recognition of their own specificity as human beings. This specificity has always been refused them by white colonialists or neocolonialists and by their own black males. One only needs to glance briefly at history to realize this. Africa in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries was the source of human merchandise, the “black gold” of the time: slaves to be scattered all over America and the<br>

But strikingly little movement has occurred in socioecological thinking about capital accumulation and its crises, a quarter-century after James O’Connor’s groundbreaking theory of the second contradiction (1998), which finds in the expanded accumulation of capital an exhaustion of the relations and conditions of (re) production.

  Abstract: Emphasizing the social nature of language, Mikhail Bakhtin writes that when we speak, we do not find words in a dictionary but rather take them from other people’s mouths (1994, 77). To use a word is always to reproduce, adapt, or resist the meanings it acquires as it circulates through other people’s conversations. This is true for all words but particularly so for

  Abstract: Ireland, with its reputation as the “Land of Song,” is the only country in the world to have a musical instrument as its national symbol. It is thus not surprising that music is so intimately involved in the collective remembering of events in Irish history. When in the eighteenth century a decline in the numbers of Irish speakers occurred, the Irish language could no longer serve to transmit cultural memory as it once had; during this period, music became central to national expression. Charles Hamilton Teeling, a member of the United Irishmen, noted that throughout the time surrounding the 1798<br>

  Abstract: It has been noted that “the language of memory does seem to be above all a language of images” (Kuhn 2000, 188). Susan Sontag argues that photography’s preeminence within the “language” of memory stems from the mechanics of how memory operates, in that it “freeze-frames”; its “basic unit is the single image” (2004, 19). If we accept that “there is no such thing as an authentic origin of memory, since all memory, whether preserved in image, word, or sound, is grounded in representation” (van Dijik 2004, 268), we must accept too that there is no such thing as an authentic<br>

  Abstract: This chapter will look at the ambiguous relationship between place and writing in the thinking of Seamus Heaney. In the last chapter, we looked at how the aesthetic can be used to validate a monological, monofocal, and motivated connection between a people, a language, and a place. In this chapter, we will examine the careful and nuanced manner in which Heaney treats the connections between place and people in his work. Heaney is well aware of the attenuating influence of the “appetites of gravity” as he describes them (Heaney 1975, 43), which fuse a people to a place, and he<br>

  Book Title: Memory Ireland-History and Modernity, Volume 1<br>
  Publisher: Syracuse University Press<br>
  Author(s): Frawley Oona<br>
  Abstract: Despite the ease with which scholars have used the term "memory" in recent decades, its definition remains enigmatic. Does cultural memory rely on the memories of individuals, or does it take shape beyond the borders of the individual mind? Cultural memory has garnered particular attention within Irish studies. With its trauma-filled history and sizable global diaspora, Ireland presents an ideal subject for work in this vein. What do stereotypes of Irish memory—as extensive, unforgiving, begrudging, but also blank on particular, usually traumatic, subjects—reveal about the ways in which cultural remembrance works in contemporary Irish culture and in Irish diasporic culture? How do icons of Irishness—from the harp to the cottage, from the Celtic cross to a figure like James Joyce—function in cultural memory? This collection seeks to address these questions as it maps a landscape of cultural memory in Ireland through theoretical, historical, literary, and cultural explorations by top scholars in the field of Irish studies. In a series that will ultimately include four volumes, the sixteen essays in this first volume explore remembrance and forgetting throughout history, from early modern Ireland to contemporary multicultural Ireland. Among the many subjects addressed: Guy Beiner disentangles "collective" from "folk" memory in "Remembering and Forgetting the Irish Rebellion of 1798," and Anne Dolan looks at local memory of the civil war in "Embodying the Memory of War and Civil War." The volume concludes with Alan Titley’s "The Great Forgetting," a compelling argument for viewing modern Irish culture as an artifact of the Europeanization of Ireland and for bringing into focus the urgent need for further, wide-ranging Irishlanguage scholarship.<br>

He was interested in old sayings, or prayers, or words, or whatever he could find. Although Irish was still the language of the older generation, it had not been passed on, and it was effectively dead as a community language. During the course of his enquiries, he was told that there was a man living on his own out the road, and that he was a good Irish speaker. He hoped to collect some items from<br>

Saying this, however, introduces static. Who owns and what constructs—what owns and who constructs—the disabled body? In order to assert that

His fictional works from 1971 to his death in 2016 express the desire to keep his native Kabylian culture present and alive, to use the Berber language, which he spoke before he knew French, and to break apart the codified structures of all languages.

  Abstract: In contemporary anthropology, much is made of the ways in which meaning is constructed by a culture’s members. The interpretive act by which sense is asserted, such as in the interpretation of art or dreams or language, is a moment m which such constructions of meaning become particularly clear. It seems therefore a particularly vital point at which to observe a culture’s workings. The meeting of individuals and events that interpretation implies is a reapplication of principles, occasionally a revision, rarely, in Java at least, a radical reconsideration of them.

  Abstract: The archetypalist position is a very familiar one in literary studies, where it has sanctioned a long history of interpretation as the art of translating symbols into universal archetypes. From this we learn, according to Jung, that the creative process “consists in the unconscious activation of an archetypal image, and in elaborating and shaping this image into the finished work. By giving it shape, the artist translates it into the language of the present, and so makes it possible for us to find our way back to the deepest springs of life.”³ Jung is clearly the most influential figure in<br>

  CHAPTER 3  MYTHIC INVERSION AND ABSTRACTION: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1m3225s">Mythical Intentions in Modern Literature</a><br>
  Abstract: In the last two chapters, we have seen that there is a progression from the ontological conditions of myth as language to more functional terms for its existence.

  Book Title: Mythical Intentions in Modern Literature-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Gould Eric<br>
  Abstract: Eric Gould revises some current assumptions in literary myth criticism, especially Jungian notions of the archetype and myth's immanence in literature that have dominated literary studies for so long. Working from structuralist theories of language, myth, and psyche, he defines myth as part of the symbolic order of language which grows out of the duplicity of the sign.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1m3225s">Mythical Intentions in Modern Literature</a><br>
  Abstract: The archetypalist position is a very familiar one in literary studies, where it has sanctioned a long history of interpretation as the art of translating symbols into universal archetypes. From this we learn, according to Jung, that the creative process “consists in the unconscious activation of an archetypal image, and in elaborating and shaping this image into the finished work. By giving it shape, the artist translates it into the language of the present, and so makes it possible for us to find our way back to the deepest springs of life.”³ Jung is clearly the most influential figure in<br>

  Abstract: In the last two chapters, we have seen that there is a progression from the ontological conditions of myth as language to more functional terms for its existence. Mythicity may be revealed in the play of language, but it is also a systematic attempt to grasp the world as fact and metaphor, as a synchronic and diachronic whole. We can see the relevance to a theory of myth of Saussure, Gadamer, and Lacan, on the one hand, and Levi-Strauss and Barthes on the other.

Believing that language possesses its own reality, I intend to follow, in O’Connor’s phrase, “words moving secretly toward some goal of their own.” Her metaphors are rarely simple resemblances or satisfying correspondences between man and a natural order, as those of Eudora Welty and Wallace Stevens often are.

  Abstract: It is not hardto account for the note of barely restrained impatience audible in Coleridge’s refutation of Wordsworth’s notions of poetic language and form. In the Preface toLyrical Balladsthe almost casual dismissal of meter and related aspects of prosodic structure affronted Coleridge’s dearest experiences as reader and poet as much as they clashed with his reasoned ideas about poetry. No aspect of the poet’s art interested him more than its technique. Virgil, whose versification he admired “beyond measure,” delighted him for that reason alone. To his rapt young audience at Highgate he complained of the neglect of<br>

  Abstract: Of Wordsworth’s declarationsthat the language of good poetry is ideally derived from rustic speech, and that there is no essential difference between the languages of poetry and prose, Coleridge provided the readers of theBiographia Literariawith a bi-level refutation. On the first level, which has received the bulk of critical attention since, are several more or less direct denials of these assertions themselves or of assumptions they seem to entail. Thus he retorts that the best part of any language comes not from the countryman’s daily communion with nature but from the intellectual and imaginative activity of educated<br>

  Abstract: Following Freud, Lacan questions the Cartesian identification of our conscious mental processes with our identity as a “self” (
                  cogito ergo sum). Going somewhat beyond Freud, he suggests too that the language in which we can express the existence of self is also the condition of our alienation from self. The processes of substitution implied in language make civilized life possible, but at the cost of our alienation from the primary “knowledge” of ourselves hidden in the unconscious.¹ Language is itself part of a series of absences through which the unconscious leaves its mark.

  Book Title: The humanities and the Irish university-Anomalies and opportunities<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): O’Sullivan Michael<br>
  Abstract: This is the first book-length study of the humanities and the Irish university. Ireland was a deeply religious country throughout the twentieth century but the colleges of its National University never established a religion or theology department. The official first language of Ireland is Irish but the vast majority of teaching in the arts and humanities is in English. These are two of the anomalies that long constrained humanities education in Ireland. This book charts a history of responses to humanities education in the Irish context. Reading the work of John Henry Newman, Padraig Pearse, Sean O Tuama, Denis Donoghue, Declan Kiberd, Richard Kearney and others, it looks for an Irish humanities ethos. It compares humanities models in the US, France and Asia with those in Ireland in light of work by Immanuel Kant, Pierre Bourdieu and Jacques Derrida. It should appeal to those interested in Irish education and history.The first book-length study of the humanities and the Irish university<br>

  Abstract: Ireland was a deeply religious country throughout the twentieth century,¹ but its National University never established, or provided public support for, a theology or religion department. The of ficial first language of Ireland is Irish but virtually all teaching in the universities is done in English.² These are two of the paradoxes that lay at the heart of the Irish university experience in the humanities in the twentieth century.

  Abstract: Because the language question was such an important issue for education policy especially in the early years of the State, it is important to look at the work of some of the educationalists and university academics who worked extensively on Irish language literature. One of the first professors of English at University College Cork (UCC), Daniel Corkery, who later spent a great deal of time working on Irish literature, writes in

  Abstract: Thinking of history as travelling along a line, rather than round in a completed circle, is an alternative way of interpreting the experience of time. The seasons go round; but each spring is a new one, not an old spring revived. Life is viewed as a journey from youth to old age, which is halted only at the ‘journey’s end’ by death. ‘An individual is a four-dimensional object of greatly elongated form. In ordinary language, we say that he [or she] has considerable extension in time and insignificant extension in space,’ explained physicist Arthur Eddington kindly. Not all, of course,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1npn08">In Search of the Early Christians</a><br>
  Abstract: The uniqueness of the Fourth Gospel in early Christian literature consists above all in the special patterns of language which it uses to describe Jesus Christ. Fundamental among these patterns is the description of Jesus as the one who has descended from heaven and, at the end of his mission which constitutes a

Not the least of Rudolf Bultmann’s enduring contributions to Johannine studies was his recognition and insistence that any attempt to solve the “Johannine puzzle” must begin with this picture of the descending/ascending redeemer.

This is useful language: it helps us avoid some kinds of anachronism, and it may assist Christians to approach the painful history of Jewish-Christian relations with appropriate humility. Moreover, there is ancient support for this terminology. It was Josephus who depicted the “Jewish philosophy” as made up of three or four “sects” (αìρέσεις,

  Author(s): Bloom Harold<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging discussion of Kabbalah-from the mystical trends of medieval Judaism to modern Hasidism-one of the world's foremost scholars considers different visions of the nature of the sacred text and of the methods to interpret it. Moshe Idel takes as a starting point the fact that the postbiblical Jewish world lost its geographical center with the destruction of the temple and so was left with a textual center, the Holy Book. Idel argues that a text-oriented religion produced language-centered forms of mysticism.Against this background, the author demonstrates how various Jewish mystics amplified the content of the Scriptures so as to include everything: the world, or God, for example. Thus the text becomes a major realm for contemplation, and the interpretation of the text frequently becomes an encounter with the deepest realms of reality. Idel delineates the particular hermeneutics belonging to Jewish mysticism, investigates the progressive filling of the text with secrets and hidden levels of meaning, and considers in detail the various interpretive strategies needed to decodify the arcane dimensions of the text.<br>

  Book Title: Becoming Human Again-The Theological Life of Gustaf Wingren<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Olson Daniel M.<br>
  Abstract: One of the most influential Swedish theologians of the twentieth century, Gustaf Wingren’s career spanned more than forty years of upheaval both in his field and around the globe. Provocative and challenging, Wingren revelled in a good argument and this attitude set the tone for much of his scholarship. A Swedish Lutheran, he made his name through his research into the theology of Martin Luther, breaking away from both traditional interpretations of Luther and the theology of his famous teachers, Karl Barth and Anders Nygren, before shifting his focus onto systematic theology. In a fresh take, Bengt Kristensson Uggla delves into the influence of Wingren’s second wife, Greta Hofsten, on the direction of his theology. Hofsten, a left-wing political activist who was searching for a new language of faith, wove Wingren’s work together with her own political philosophy to create an unusual kind of Christian socialism. Her thinking had a profound effect on Wingren, causing him to recontextualise his older work entirely. In Becoming Human Again, Uggla examines how Wingren’s combative nature often served him well as a theologian, driving him to engage with innovations in the field and re-examine his older views.<br>

  Abstract: Poets and poetry have been drawn on already throughout this book for certain poets seem able to articulate so well aspects of the child mind. This chapter explores why this might be and focuses on the characteristics of the language of poetry. For as a form of expression poetry usually communicates authenticity. Poets speak and write of a way of looking at the everyday with a sensitivity that can take the hearer and reader beyond that everyday into another level of consciousness. Perhaps there are ways that some poetry can tap directly into the unconscious of the reader or hearer<br>

  Abstract: Since the beginning of the twentieth century, one common complaint about western literary fiction has been that its overabsorption with artistry prevents it from “telling a good story.” Summarizing this view in his “Reader’s Manifesto,” critic B. R. Myers groused that “any accessible, fast-moving story written in unaffected prose is deemed to be ‘genre fiction’ [. . . ] never literature with a capital L.”¹ Given that several touchstone twentieth-century theories of the novel significantly deemphasized story in favor of character or language—think of E.

  Book Title: Bearing Witness-Perspectives on War and Peace from the Arts and Humanities<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Johnstone Tiffany<br>
  Abstract: As the centenary of the Great War approaches, citizens worldwide are reflecting on the history, trauma, and losses of a war-torn twentieth century. It is in remembering past wars that we are at once confronted with the profound horror and suffering of armed conflict and the increasing elusiveness of peace. The contributors to Bearing Witness do not presume to resolve these troubling questions, but provoke new kinds of reflection. They explore literature, the arts, history, language, and popular culture to move beyond the language of rhetoric and commemoration provided by politicians and the military. Adding nuance to discussions of war and peace, this collection probes the understanding and insight created in the works of musicians, dramatists, poets, painters, photographers, and novelists, to provide a complex view of the ways in which war is waged, witnessed, and remembered. A compelling and informative collection, Bearing Witness sheds new light on the impact of war and the power of suffering, heroism and memory, to expose the human roots of violence and compassion. Contributors include Heribert Adam (Simon Fraser University), Laura Brandon (Carleton University), Mireille Calle-Gruber (Université La Sorbonne Nouvelle), Janet Danielson (Simon Fraser University), Sandra Djwa (emeritus, Simon Fraser University), Alan Filewod (University of Guelph), Sherrill Grace (University of British Columbia), Patrick Imbert (University of Ottawa), Tiffany Johnstone (PhD Candidate, University of British Columbia), Martin Löschnigg (Graz University), Lauren Lydic (PhD, University of Toronto), Conny Steenman Marcusse (Netherlands), Jonathan Vance (University of Western Ontario), Aritha van Herk (University of Calgary), Peter C. van Wyck (Concordia University), Christl Verduyn (Mount Allison University), and Anne Wheeler (filmmaker).<br>

  Book Title: Textual Silence-Unreadability and the Holocaust<br>
  Publisher: Rutgers University Press<br>
  Author(s): LANG JESSICA<br>
  Abstract: There are thousands of books that represent the Holocaust, but can, and should, the act of reading these works convey the events of genocide to those who did not experience it? In
      Textual Silence, literary scholar Jessica Lang asserts that language itself is a barrier between the author and the reader in Holocaust texts-and that this barrier is not a lack of substance, but a defining characteristic of the genre.Holocaust texts, which encompass works as diverse as memoirs, novels, poems, and diaries, are traditionally characterized by silences the authors place throughout the text, both deliberately and unconsciously. While a reader may have the desire and will to comprehend the Holocaust, the presence of "textual silence" is a force that removes the experience of genocide from the reader's analysis and imaginative recourse. Lang defines silences as omissions that take many forms, including the use of italics and quotation marks, ellipses and blank pages in poetry, and the presence of unreliable narrators in fiction. While this limits the reader's ability to read in any conventional sense, these silences are not flaws. They are instead a critical presence that forces readers to acknowledge how words and meaning can diverge in the face of events as unimaginable as those of the Holocaust.<br>

  Abstract: Paradoxically, the more time that separates the Holocaust from the present, and so the less available the Holocaust is in terms of eyewitness testimony, the more accessible it becomes to readers and writers of Holocaust fiction and the more it becomes historically normalized.¹ Whereas eyewitness authors overtly acknowledge the impossibility of reading their texts in the truest sense of the word—a consequence of reaching the limits of language and representation—contemporary authors, often in an effort to shorten the distance between themselves and the historical event at hand, create a version of the Holocaust that is increasingly available as<br>

  Abstract: For Wallace Stevens, the most dangerous residue of religion for aesthetics lay in the tendency of poetic language to generate religious metaphors and anthropomorphisms. The fiction of Virginia Woolf discloses another danger for aesthetics: the propensity of modern experiences of beauty and sublimity to engender religious modes of thought and desire that are no longer intelligible within a secular conception of the world. For Woolf’s characters, the beautiful (and its modern cousin, the sublime) is suspended in the uncertain space between religious and secular ontologies. The intensity of experiences of beauty

  Abstract: The great power of words consists in their ability to represent thought as language, enabling the speaker to communicate complicated intellectual processes and extensive discursive descriptions. No other sign system achieves this. The image, although more effective than the word in presenting in a solitary, contained way what it represents, cannot comment on its object or analyze its own method of representation as language can. Similarly, gesture, or enactment, while performing what it represents and, in this sense, closer to its object, cannot reflect upon itself or the nature of its own operation. Words can talk about words; images and<br>

  Abstract: Sensitive language, remembrance photography, and mementos have become integrated into stillbirth care practices in North American health care institutions for parents and families who have experienced the death of an infant. While representations reflect how families, caregivers, and society understand stillbirth, they also help shape our relationship with birth, death, and both as they occur together. From both subjective and objective points of view, this chapter will explore how words, images, and artifacts come to represent multiple meanings of stillbirth in a way that can both challenge and contribute to the silence, stigma, and emancipation of bereaved parents from ambiguity<br>

  Book Title: Red Legacies in China-Cultural Afterlives of the Communist Revolution<br>
  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Zhang Enhua<br>
  Abstract: What has contemporary China inherited from its revolutionary past? How do the realities and memories, aesthetics and practices of the Mao era still reverberate in the post-Mao cultural landscape? The essays in this volume propose “red legacies" as a new critical framework from which to examine the profusion of cultural productions and afterlives of the communist revolution in order to understand China’s continuities and transformations from socialism to postsocialism. Organized into five parts—red foundations, red icons, red classics, red bodies, and red shadows—the book’s interdisciplinary contributions focus on visual and performing arts, literature and film, language and thought, architecture, museums, and memorials. Mediating at once unfulfilled ideals and unmourned ghosts across generations, red cultural legacies suggest both inheritance and debt, and can be mobilized to support as well as to critique the status quo.<br>

  Book Title: Love and its Critics-From the Song of Songs to Shakespeare and Milton’s Eden<br>
  Publisher: Open Book Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Movsesian Arpi<br>
  Abstract: This book is a history of love and the challenge love offers to the laws and customs of its times and places, as told through poetry from the Song of Songs to John Milton’s Paradise Lost. It is also an account of the critical reception afforded to such literature, and the ways in which criticism has attempted to stifle this challenge.

  Book Title: Love and its Critics-From the Song of Songs to Shakespeare and Milton’s Eden<br>
  Publisher: Open Book Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Movsesian Arpi<br>
  Abstract: This book is a history of love and the challenge love offers to the laws and customs of its times and places, as told through poetry from the Song of Songs to John Milton’s Paradise Lost. It is also an account of the critical reception afforded to such literature, and the ways in which criticism has attempted to stifle this challenge. Bryson and Movsesian argue that the poetry they explore celebrates and reinvents the love the troubadour poets of the eleventh and twelfth centuries called fin’amor: love as an end in itself, mutual and freely chosen even in the face of social, religious, or political retribution. Neither eros nor agape, neither exclusively of the body, nor solely of the spirit, this love is a middle path. Alongside this tradition has grown a critical movement that employs a 'hermeneutics of suspicion', in Paul Ricoeur’s phrase, to claim that passionate love poetry is not what it seems, and should be properly understood as worship of God, subordination to Empire, or an entanglement with the structures of language itself – in short, the very things it resists.

  THIRTEEN  Ghost writers: from:

  Author(s) Temple Bogusia<br>
  Abstract: What this volume demonstrates, as did
                  The turn to biographical methods in social science(Chamberlayne et al, 2000), is that there are undoubted benefits in research with people who are different to you in terms of widening perspectives and horizons. When language is a barrier to communication, many researchers and service providers employ translators and interpreters to try to harvest these benefits. However, ensuring that perspectives other than that of the researcher can be heard is not a straightforward task. In this chapter, I am interested in the implications, when translating, of Spivak’s (1993, p 189) call to “discriminate on<br>

  Author(s) Gunaratnam Yasmin<br>
  Abstract: Concerns about how to work with and across differences of ethnicity, culture, language and religion are central to discussions on policy and practice development in the health and social care services in Britain (Alexander, 1999), where references to the need for cultural ‘awareness’, ‘sensitivity’ and ‘competence’ are commonplace. These concerns have taken on further meaning with the renewed attention to ‘institutional racism’ (Macpherson, 1999) in public sector services, and with the extension of race relations legislation (2000 Race Relations [Amendment] Act) to these services. However, despite the increasing attention being given to the need for culturally sensitive and anti-discriminatory professional<br>

  Abstract: Although speakers in historiography do much of their reasoning through citation and application of the

TheZuozhuanandGuoyushow a more sustained interest in the workings of the natural and supernatural worlds than any extant earlier works and go well beyond early Zhou texts in reasoning about the cosmos and its principles. When speeches incorporate this sort of knowledge, they put it to political and moral use, if only because the position defined for speeches within this system requires such use.<br>

  Abstract: The Histories of Anthropology Annual presents diverse perspectives on the discipline's history within a global context, with a goal of increasing awareness and use of historical approaches in teaching, learning, and conducting anthropology. The series includes critical, comparative, analytical, and narrative studies involving all aspects and subfields of anthropology.Volume 11,
      Historicizing Theories, Identities, and Nations, examines the work and influence of scholars, including Franz Boas, Ruth Benedict, John Dewey, Randolph Bourne, A.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1trkjsq">Historicizing Theories, Identities, and Nations</a><br>
  Author(s) LYONS ANDREW P.<br>
  Abstract: Cultural relativism is arguably an older concept than institutionalized anthropology. There are foreshadowings of it in the work of Herodotus, Protagoras, Sextus Empiricus, Johann Gottfried Herder, and Wilhelm von Humboldt. However, the genealogy of the concept in modern American anthropology may, as Regna Darnell shows (2001: 39, 40), be correctly traced back to Boas’s 1889 article, “On Alternating Sounds,” which drew attention to the ethnocentrism that can result when scholars from our speech community apperceive one sound in another supposedly primitive language as two alternating sounds (e.g., Inuit

But if we wish to describe or explain or interpret these genres we use language—descriptive explanations and interpretation are themselves genres.

  Book Title: Imagining the popular in contemporary French culture-  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): LOOSELEY DAVID<br>
  Abstract: This groundbreaking book is about what ‘popular culture’ means in France, and how the term’s shifting meanings have been negotiated and contested. It represents the first theoretically informed study of the way that popular culture is lived, imagined, fought over and negotiated in modern and contemporary France. It covers a wide range of overarching concerns: the roles of state policy, the market, political ideologies, changing social contexts and new technologies in the construction of the popular. But it also provides a set of specific case studies showing how popular songs, stories, films, TV programmes and language styles have become indispensable elements of ‘culture’ in France. Deploying yet also rethinking a ‘Cultural Studies’ approach to the popular, the book therefore challenges dominant views of what French culture really means today.French Studies, Cultural Studies, Media Studies, Cultural Sociology, History/Cultural History. Specific chapters will be of relevance to: Cultural Policy, Popular Music Studies, Literary Studies, Film and TV Studies, Linguistics<br>

  Author(s) Armstrong Nigel<br>
  Abstract: The phenomenon of what might be called ‘social convergence’– the nexus of attitudes that in the last four decades or so has tended to erode hierarchical structures, emphasise the worth of the individual, promote the values of youth and working-class culture and accelerate the ‘decline of deference’– tends to be assumed as a given in the study of popular culture. Social convergence or levelling has had important effects on language in this period. In language, social convergence can be seen as standing in opposition to the ‘ideology of the standard’, a term in sociolinguistics used to refer to the attitude<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1vxm8w9">A Political Companion to James Baldwin</a><br>
  Author(s) Lloyd Vincent<br>
  Abstract: Religious language, ideas, and images pervade the essays, plays, stories, and novels of James Baldwin. A product of Black Pentecostalism and a teenage preaching prodigy, Baldwin describes his writing style as influenced by the King James Bible and the storefront church.¹ Verses from the Bible and snippets of gospel music pervade Baldwin’s texts. Yet religion also appears in Baldwin’s work as something he has overcome, a distasteful encounter with authoritarianism that he passed through to reach his present secular, democratic enlightenment. If this is the case, the religious language that appears in Baldwin’s texts could be read as rhetorical flourish,<br>

Both putatively reject the hierarchies of race, class, gender, language, religion, and nation in favour of a more fundamental understanding of human equality. Yet, as with cosmopolitanism, critics have linked philanthropy to the expansion of capital and the spread of exploitation. The correlation between capitalist and philanthropic expansion is clearest in the age of Empire. In fact, the

  Abstract: Literacy, in a traditional sense, is the ability to decode written texts and to encode oral language into writing. Yet many researchers and theorists argue that learning to read and write involves social activities influenced by interactions¹ and mediated by class affiliations.² In addition, gender, race, and ethnicity impact how individuals compose internal narratives driving motivation and academic performance.³ Therefore, the narratives we construct through our exchanges with families, teachers, and peers frame our literate identities.

Public symbols are neither a cause nor a consequence of the present international preoccupation with memory, however, but the very language with which these societies transmit and negotiate their pasts.

  Abstract: Among the many radical innovations that Emmanuel Levinas has introduced into phenomenology, or imposed on it, there is one which seems most important: that of the appeal. In effect, the appeal has achieved the rank of a concept, or more precisely, to speak the language of the early Husserl, it is a founding phenomenological act (and thus is itself not founded). This imposition became virtually inevitable as soon as Levinas had accomplished two prior revolutions. First was a reversal of centrifugal intentionality, which moves from the ego to the object, into a counter-intentionality moving back toward the ego. Next was<br>

  Author(s): Thatamanil John<br>
  Abstract: Spiritual Grammar identifies a genre of religious literature that until now has not been recognized as such. In this surprising and theoretically nuanced study, F. Dominic Longo reveals how grammatical structures of language addressed in two medieval texts published nearly four centuries apart, from distinct religious traditions, offer a metaphor for how the self is embedded in spiritual reality. Reading The Grammar of Hearts (Nahw al-qulūb) by the great Sufi shaykh and Islamic scholar 'Abd al-Karīm al-Qushayrī (d. 1074) and Moralized Grammar (Donatus moralizatus) by Christian theologian Jean Gerson (d. 1429), Longo reveals how both authors use the rules of language and syntax to advance their pastoral goals. Indeed, grammar provides the two masters with a fresh way of explaining spiritual reality to their pupils and to discipline the souls of their readers in the hopes that their writings would make others adept in the grammar of the heart.<br>

  Abstract: Sexual Disorientations brings some of the most recent and significant works of queer theory into conversation with the overlapping fields of biblical, theological and religious studies to explore the deep theological resonances of questions about the social and cultural construction of time, memory, and futurity. Apocalyptic, eschatological and apophatic languages, frameworks, and orientations pervade both queer theorizing and theologizing about time, affect, history and desire. The volume fosters a more explicit engagement between theories of queer temporality and affectivity and religious texts and discourses.<br>

  Abstract: Edgar Allan Poe’s failure as a poet appears to be a matter of consensus among his English and American readers, who find it difficult to account for his exalted status in France. Yet he is best placed in a transatlantic context, for his failure—and his success—directly stem from his American displacement. Poe not only inaugurates a species of estheticism that modulates into Symbolism, but sounds an abiding inflection of American poetic language, which is heard in the modernism of T. S.

  Chapter Two  T. S. Eliot and the Archaeology of Poetry from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xp3scx">American Poetry</a><br>
  Abstract: In a lecture presented at the Library of Congress in 1948, T. S. Eliot acknowledges so early an acquaintance with Poe that he cannot be sure whether his own work has been influenced by him. He then distances himself from his predecessor by focusing on Poe’s relation to the French Symbolists Baudelaire, Mallarmé, and Valéry.¹ This detour through another country and another language is the standard reading of the Eliot-Poe connection: Poe’s insistence on the poem as a formal artifact, as well as his critical self-consciousness, influenced the French Symbolists, who in turn influenced Eliot. Clearly, Eliot shares the Symbolists’<br>

  Book Title: The Multiplicity of Dreams-Memory, Imagination, and Consciousness<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hunt Harry T.<br>
  Abstract: This book is richly rewarding to both scientists and the general public, for it proposes a pluralistic interpretation of dreams that will be of great interest to experts and at the same time explains in language accessible to nonprofessional readers what we know about dreams-those absorbing creations of our own minds.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xp3sfz">The Multiplicity of Dreams</a><br>
  Abstract: Evidence of creative imagistic activity in dream formation does not encourage us to assimilate all dreaming to representational language. Still, the difficulty in evaluating when dream imagery goes beyond prior verbal understanding suggests that imagery and language must continuously interact anyway. The linguistic processes that enter dreams most readily are more presentational than representational—in that “the whole domain of verbal wit is put at the disposal of the dreamwork” (Freud, 1900, p. 376). Certainly, in many of Freud’s own dreams ordinary language has been spontaneously rearranged in the form of rebuslike wordplay, visual hieroglyphics based on special turns of<br>

  CHAPTER 11  Narrative Structures: from:

  Abstract: Any cognitive psychology of dreaming must encounter and reconcile two statements: “the dream is a story” and “the dream is imagery.” Neither statement is as obvious as it initially appears, I I because there is no agreement in contemporary cognitive psychology on the ultimate relation between visual-spatial imagery and language. Much evidence and theory supports both the view that a visual-spatial imagistic intelligence rests directly on and creatively reorganizes the processes of perception and the view that mental imagery is a surface paraphrase of abstract propositional knowledge, whose deep structure is accordingly far closer to verbal syntax than visual imagery.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xp3sjh">Heidegger's Estrangements</a><br>
  Abstract: My purpose in what follows will simply be to work through Martin Heidegger’s later writings on language and poetry in order to give as clear an account as I can of what he has to say, as well as of the way in which his “saying” has to be enclosed in quotation marks. As Habermas says, “Communication does not belong to the basic vocabulary of this philosophy.”¹ By “work through” I mean roughly, or loosely, what my discipline calls a close reading that lends special attention to the language of the dark or recalcitrant text. So what follows is also<br>

  Chapter One  The Aesthetics of Estrangement: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xp3sjh">Heidegger's Estrangements</a><br>
  Abstract: For me the crucial text for the study of the later Heidegger is “The Origin of the Work of Art,” in which language is hardly mentioned. This is the<br>

  Chapter Three  The Abandonment of Philosophical Language from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xp3sjh">Heidegger's Estrangements</a><br>
  Abstract: The question remains, or continues to draw us out: What is it to speak? That is, what is it for speaking to occur when no one speaks but only language? “Language speaks [
                     Die Sprache spricht].” We are very far from understanding what this can mean. All we can say is that Heidegger encourages us, allows us, to think of speaking in terms of calling rather than as signifying. But where does this leave us?<br>

  Chapter Four  The Poetic Experience with Language from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xp3sjh">Heidegger's Estrangements</a><br>
  Abstract: One therapeutic effect of Heidegger’s first essay on language is that it disconnects us—estranges or alienates us—from the very idea of language, especially as this comes down to us in idealist and analytic philosophies of language, linguistics, semiotics, various criticisms, and so on; and this also means alienation from what we might call the social theory of language, where the idea is not to retrieve the deep grammatical, semantic, or propositional structure of human expression, but just to study how people talk, what they say when, their language games, their discursive practices and institutions, their forms of life.<br>

  Chapter Five  Words and Sounds in Heidegger from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xp3sjh">Heidegger's Estrangements</a><br>
  Abstract: I said at the end of the last chapter that “thinking needs to link itself up with poetry,” but obviously this is a careless way of talking — and misleading in the bargain, especially if we go on to imagine that if language cannot avail itself to us logically, then it must do so preconceptually, intuitively, practically, or by some primordial process of knowing that logic might subsequently come along to verify; but this isn’t what Heidegger is talking about at all. It is not that there are, for example, two categories of mental operation, one primitive and one enlightened, one<br>

  Book Title: Norms of Rhetorical Culture-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Farrell Thomas B.<br>
  Abstract: Rhetoric is widely regarded by both its detractors and advocates as a kind of antithesis to reason. In this book Thomas B. Farrell restores rhetoric as an art of practical reason and enlightened civic participation, grounding it in its classical tradition-particularly in the rhetoric of Aristotle. And, because prevailing modernist world views bear principal responsibility for the disparagement of rhetorical tradition, Farrell also offers a critique of the dominant currents of modern humanist thought.Farrell argues that rhetoric is not antithetical to reason but is a manner of posing and answering questions that is distinct from the approaches of analytic and dialectical reason. He develops this position in a number of ways: through a series of bold reinterpretations of Aristotle's
      Rhetoric; through a detailed appraisal of traditional rhetorical concepts as seen in modern texts from the Army-McCarthy hearings to Edward Kennedy's memorial for his brother, Mario Cuomo's address on abortion, Betty Friedan'sFeminine Mystique, and Vaclav Havel's inaugural address; and through a fresh appraisal of theories on the character of language and discourse found in contemporary philosophy, literary criticism, anthropology, deconstructionism, Marxism, and especially in Habermas's critical theory of communicative action.<br>

  4  After Rhetorical Culture: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xp3sn2">Norms of Rhetorical Culture</a><br>
  Abstract: It is a fact that not all stories are told. And if they could all be told, there is no imaginable forum that could encompass all the needs, themes, and moral concerns which deserve expression. Even if, as some of us once thought, the whole world is watching, its attention span seems limited to one thing at a time. This is, in less humble language, the modernist dilemma. It is all too easy to universalize wants, needs, interests, and norms. In a world of unequal chances, such categories exist only as a fragile language of development begging for yet another<br>

  Publisher: University of Iowa Press<br>
  Author(s): Miller Cristanne<br>
  Abstract: Whitman & Dickinsonis the first collection to bring together original essays by European and North American scholars directly linking the poetry and ideas of Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson. The essays present intersections between these great figures across several fields of study, rehearsing well-established topics from new perspectives, opening entirely new areas of investigation, and providing new information about Whitman's and Dickinson's lives, work, and reception.Essays included in this book cover the topics of mentoring influence on each poet, religion, the Civil War, phenomenology, the environment, humor, poetic structures of language, and Whitman's and Dickinson's twentieth- and twenty-first-century reception-including prolonged engagement with Adrienne Rich's response to this "strange uncoupled couple" of poets who stand at the beginning of an American national poetic.Contributors Include:Marina Camboni Andrew Dorkin Vincent DussolBetsy Erkkilä Ed FolsomChristine GerhardtJay GrossmanJennifer LeaderMarianne NobleCécile RoudeauShira Wolosky<br>

                  Leaves of Grass, she develops a complex vision of American poetry while also building the genealogical line that would ultimately include her own work.² That location maps the plural logic of the poet who is not only committed to the truth of a “language intensified, intensifying our sense of possible reality,” but whose “poetic imagination” is “radical, meaning root-tangled in the grit of human arrangements and relationships:how we are with<br>

  Abstract: Introductions to books and collections about Alexander Pushkin tend to begin, especially when their origin is not Russian,
                  with de rigueurnods to the poet’s massive presence in, and seminal influence on, the native culture. Such expository scaffolding falls under the category of preemptive advertising for a figure who, outside his context and more importantly outside his language, has difficulty translating. Thus, from the operas of Glinka, Tchaikovsky, Musorgsky and Rimsky-Korsakov to the stylish illustrations and set designs of Benois, Bilibin, and Dobuzhinsky; from endlessly anthologized paintings by Kiprensky and Repin to ghosts of allusion in better known works by<br>

Stoic toward the arbitrariness of the world order (or disorder), deeply melancholic (if not corrosively skepti cal) about “human nature,” yet passionately be lieving in language’s ontological priority as the only
                  thing(note this word) in human existence approaching a genuine God-term, Brod sky could be maddening in the sheer outrageousness, the “demanding-the maximum-and-the-hell-with-the-rest” quality, of his metaphorical thinking. But that is what poets, especially<br>

  Abstract: Central to any understanding of Joseph Brodsky as poet and thinker is his myth of language, his belief in words, and not just any words but specifically poetic words, ability to restructure time and to outwit states, tyrants, history itself. “Prosody is simply a repository of time within language,”² writes Brodsky in a statement repeated many times over in different guises and contexts. Poetic words, by their very nature, got there, and are always still getting there, first. Indeed, what makes this idea a myth in the first place, that is, something larger than the life it explains, is these<br>

  Book Title: The Translator’s Doubts-Vladimir Nabokov and the Ambiguity of Translation<br>
  Publisher: Academic Studies Press<br>
  Author(s): TRUBIKHINA JULIA<br>
  Abstract: Using Vladimir Nabokov as its “case study," this volume approaches translation as a crucial avenue into literary history and theory, philosophy and interpretation. It attempts to bring together issues in translation and the shift in Nabokov studies from its earlier emphasis on the “metaliterary" to the more recent “metaphysical" approach. Addressing specific texts (both literary and cinematic), the book investigates Nabokov’s deeply ambivalent relationship to translation as a hermeneutic oscillation on his part between the relative stability of meaning, which expresses itself philosophically as a faith in the beyond, and deep metaphysical uncertainty. While Nabokov’s practice of translation changed profoundly over the course of his career, his adherence to the Romantic notion of a “true" but ultimately elusive metaphysical language remained paradoxically constant.<br>

  Conclusion from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1zxsjwj">The Translator’s Doubts</a><br>
  Abstract: In this conclusion, I would like to provide an overview that situates Nabokov vis-à-vis the Russian and Western traditions of translation, and to bring together in this context the central issues of Nabokov’s ambivalent relationship to translation. These issues include his origin—his own “secret stem,” leading back to Russian Romanticism—as well as translation as a vehicle for expressing Nabokov’s own strongly held ideas about art. While Nabokov’s practice of translation undergoes significant changes in the course of his career, his adherence to the idea of some “true,” “metaphysical” language—ever elusive and ever present—remains surprisingly constant.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1zxz0fb">The Cinema of the Soviet Thaw</a><br>
  Abstract: The cinematic scrutiny of space in Soviet culture of the 1950s and 1960s was rooted in an urgency to find new forms of social engagement. It was also propelled by a need to redefine the role of cinema in the wake of Stalin’s death. Rethinking the language of cinema, Soviet filmmakers began to emphasize the production of the environment as a social and filmic problem, creating spatial experiences within theatrical walls that differed significantly from those of established socialist practices. These filmmakers reorganized the spaces of familiar cities, landscapes, and public and private interiors, opening them up to dialogical interactions<br>

  1.1  Semiotics and the Philosophy of Language from:

  Author(s) Eco Umberto<br>
  Abstract: There are many disciplines–such as linguistics or iconography or musicology–that are concerned with different semiotic systems, of which they represent the rules of functioning. We will call these disciplines
                  grammars. In this sense Italian linguistics is a grammar, as is the study of gestural languages, or as it can be the study of different types of road signals. Any theory of signs that assumed to be a general or universal grammar would be a grammar in the above sense in so far as it takes into account only these rules that are allegedly at work in every sign-system,<br>

  Author(s) Rauch Irmengard<br>
  Abstract: The origin and nature of language as an object of human curiosity is entering its third millenium of study in the Western world. Discussion of this premier semiotic system, language, has ever been suspended in a tension between historiographically so-called Analogists and Anomalists (cf. Colson 1919), be they from among, e.g., the Greek Ancients or from among, e.g., the contemporary Cognitivists. Whether to understand the nature of language as natural or conventional, rule driven or usage bound, regular or irregular and the myriad proximate and distal implications deriving from these Western metaphysical bifurcations remains thus an unabated subliminal, if not<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2005sns">Signs and Society</a><br>
  Abstract: One of the puzzles of the intellectual history of the “pragmatic” turn in contemporary linguistics is the fact that the American mathematician and philosopher Charles S. Peirce (1839–1914), who developed a graphic formalism for evaluating the logical precision of scientific concepts, continues to be an important inspiration for the development of approaches to language that move beyond the synchronic, descriptive, and generative perspectives characteristic of the mainstream of linguistics scholarship. Many students of language first encountered Peirce’s semiotic ideas in the early 1920s in the ten pages of excerpts printed as an appendix to Ogden and Richards’s

  Abstract: Charles S. Peirce (1839–1914) and Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–1913) spent considerable effort trying to clarify and articulate what they meant by signs and the ideas, or concepts, associated with them. There are many attempts in the scholarly literature to align Peircean and Saussurean terminologies, as well as several valiant efforts to create new synthetic models encompassing their differences. My task here is different: to point out several ways in which Peirce, an American experimental physicist and logician (trained as a chemist), and Saussure, a Swiss linguist (trained as a philologist of Indo-European languages), have fundamentally opposed views stemming<br>

Both refer to the so-called broken men, veterans who had suffered severe and dramatically visible bodily disfigurement. In the “postscript” to
                  Zoo, or Letters Not about Love(written and published in Berlin), Shklovsky notes that the “streets are filled with terribly subdued cripples.”¹ The protagonist of Bergelson’s “Among Refugees,” a<br>

  Book Title: Comics and Narration-  Publisher: University Press of Mississippi<br>
  Author(s): Miller Ann<br>
  Abstract: This book is the follow-up to Thierry Groensteen's ground-breaking
         The System of Comics, in which the leading French-language comics theorist set out to investigate how the medium functions, introducing the principle of iconic solidarity, and showing the systems that underlie the articulation between panels at three levels: page layout, linear sequence, and nonsequential links woven through the comic book as a whole. He now develops that analysis further, using examples from a very wide range of comics, including the work of American artists such as Chris Ware and Robert Crumb. He tests out his theoretical framework by bringing it up against cases that challenge it, such as abstract comics, digital comics and sh?jo manga, and offers insightful reflections on these innovations.<br>

  INTRODUCTION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt24hvcv">Comics and Narration</a><br>
  Abstract: The System of Comics, published in the original French in 1999 and in English translation in 2007, set out to theorize the foundations of the language of comics. This theory was macrosemiotic in its scope: it was not concerned with the details of single images, but with the articulation of images within the space of the page and across that of the book as a whole. The principle oficonic solidaritywas shown to be applicable to three major operations: breakdown, page layout, and braiding. The book had the further aim of describing the formal apparatus through which meaning is<br>

  CHAPTER TWO  New Insights into Sequentiality from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt24hvcv">Comics and Narration</a><br>
  Abstract: Several authors who have tried to apply the concepts defined in
                  System 1to a particular comic or to a larger corpus have taken me to task for the fact that they could not find in it adequate tools to describe certain specific mechanisms that had caught their attention. This does not surprise me asSystem 1was never intended to be a textbook offering a ready-to-use analytical grid. And neither did it offer a research methodology. Its goal was to interrogate the basic principles of the language of the medium, to identify its functions, to study its articulations, at<br>

  CHAPTER THREE  On a Few Theories of Page Layout from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt24hvcv">Comics and Narration</a><br>
  Abstract: It was established in
                     System 1that page layout is, along with breakdown, one of the two fundamental operations of the language of comics—it comes into force at the level of the panels, defining their surface area, their shape, and their placement on the page. In other words, it establishes the relative position and proportions of panels that are co-present on the same page and assigns compatible shapes to them.<br>

  CHAPTER FOUR  An Extension of Some Theoretical Propositions from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt24hvcv">Comics and Narration</a><br>
  Abstract: In
                  System 1, I devoted myself at some length to the description and examination of the basic units of comics language: the balloon, the panel, the strip, and the page, analyzing how they are deployed and interact with each other; the actualization of these units in the spaces, frames and sites of the album makes up what I have proposed to call a spatio-topical system. When I drew out those observations, I claimed only that they applied to comics, more specifically to Western comics, and to comics appearing in the sole format that we were familiar with at that time,<br>

  Abstract: Thus let me remind the gentle reader that in English, unlike in other languages, the word 
                  culture serves a variety of purposes. It is often used in order to designate a society as a whole, with its habits, its politics, its social customs and norms, and its historical and geographical outlines, large or small, as the case may be. On other occasions, the word is used to refer to “canonical” or “high culture”—the best<br>

  Abstract: To describe the awareness of the crisis of the humanities already expressed by Plato, I have quoted Callicles’ statements on philosophy. But humanities and philosophy are not synonymous terms; we rather associate the humanities with “Letters,” which until the nineteenth century, when the vernacular languages and literatures were introduced as disciplines at the universities, meant basically Latin and Greek philology.

  Abstract: We shall now describe the humanistic disciplines, beginning with language. “If language is the essential thing that makes us human beings, linguistics ought to be considered, to an eminent degree, as a science of man, and, therefore, as a humanistic discipline, perhaps the most genuine of them all.”¹ These words by the Swedish linguist Bertil Malmberg present a thesis, but his defensive tone (“ought to be considered”) indicates that the idea is not universally shared. Linguistics is indeed a humanistic discipline, but not all branches of linguistics use the humanistic discourse. On the basis of the distinction between the nucleus<br>

  Abstract: In the preceding chapter we have tried to practice and describe the mysterious leap that leads from the first reading, which confronts the text as an ambiguous signifier, into the meaning of that text. Now we need to analyze how that outburst of meaning takes place. The observation that to read is to translate a text into its own language might come across as a joke. But to read is literally to translate a discourse that is more or less obscure (the text as a complex signifier) into one’s own discourse, in which the signifieds or meanings of the text<br>

  Author(s) Donougho Martin<br>
  Abstract: Theodor W. Adorno remarks of Hegel that “for a contemporary of Humboldt it is striking how little he is concerned with language.”¹ The same could hardly be said of Adorno, who in stark contrast presents himself as the self-conscious stylist, ever alert to the subtleties of form and attitude. Yet his own practice was often to set language 
                  against itself, to push the envelope of intelligibility, the opposite of transparent communication. And this, oddly enough, was the trait he admired above all in Hegel. For example, a few pages after the above we read: “The dialectic’s protest against language cannot<br>

  Abstract: Fred Norris has made major contributions to understanding the Trinitarian theology of Gregory of Nazianzus, and in tribute to him I want to give further consideration to Gregory’s baptismal theology, for which he is a principal fourth-century source.¹ Gregory of Nazianzus shares much in common with his fellow Cappadocians Basil the Great and Gregory of Nyssa, but for this chapter I want to note his commonalities with the Alexandrians, principally Clement of Alexandria and Origen.² Gregory’s indebtedness to Origen is well recognized,³ and Fred noted Gregory’s view of language was the same as Clement’s and Origen’s.⁴<br>

  Abstract: Father Antonio López has given us a comprehensive study of an original thinker whose work is too little known in English language scholarship. He has traced with firmness and clarity both the development and the final expression of his subject’s thought. Claude Bruaire’s originality is not impaired by the wealth of philosophical and theological sources from which he weaves his reflection on being-as-spirit-and-as-gift. As Professor López keeps before the reader’s attention, the horizon within which Bruaire develops his thought is derived above all from Hegel, though not without a fundamental transformation which the present careful study continually makes clear.

  Abstract: The nature of nationalist movements and how to address them became key issues of world politics with the end of the cold war in the three-year period 1989 to 1991, and have remained so through the 1990s and into the new century. They are important issues both for social science theory and for practical politics. Among the variety of themes encompassed by the term 
                  nationalism, one that continues to require discussion is the ethical dimension. The language of nationalism is a language of rights and duties, which is an ethical discourse, yet it is often used to justify and encourage<br>

  Abstract: Agents—specifically, human beings—think, and they do so in accordance with 
                  rules. Saul Kripke’s provocative interpretation of Wittgenstein has inspired a rather large literature around the very question of what it would even mean to follow a rule. Yet well before considering that well-known, and vexing, difficulty, it is of some use to determine the precise (if only purported) function of a given rule, as well as its modal “status,” in order to see if any application of that rule can be justified: in Kant’s language, to establish the scope and limits of a rule and, in turn, a<br>

  Abstract: The early Heidegger’s circuitous path, from the Habilitationsschrift to Sein und Zeit ultimately moves in a single direction. The question that drives the Daseinanalytic of Sein und Zeit—the question of the being of time—first surfaces in Heidegger’s 1995 Scotus research. It reappears in the 1917–19 mysticism research, the remarks on Luther, the 1920–21 religion lectures, and the 1921–26 Aristotle research. The early Freiburg lectures document the variety of approaches Heidegger took to this problem, tentative solutions, experiments with language, and forays into the tradition, some that became lifelong projects, like the retrieval of non-Platonic Greek<br>

Spatial deixis seems to be relevant to the processes of identification at two levels: those of individual subjectivity on the one hand and those of cultural identity and differentiation on the other. In this discussion of the relationship between the perception of space and forms of identification I hope to suggest a possible connection between the numerous descriptive analyses of orientational systems in<br>

  Author(s) Thomas Philip<br>
  Abstract: Not long after beginning fieldwork in the village of Manambondro in coastal southeast Madagascar, I was called one evening to the house of the ʺheadmanʺ of the house-group in which I was domiciled. Gathered together there in the encroaching gloom of dusk were several men, to whom the purpose of my visit was being explained. When one man heard that it was my hope to learn to speak the dialect of Malagasy spoken thereabouts he interjected to the effect that I would learn the language as quickly and easily as I drank the water of the Manambondro River.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2jbjrm">The Poetic Power of Place</a><br>
  Author(s) Waterson Roxana<br>
  Abstract: In the English language ʺlandscapeʺ is a word that comes, as Olvig (1993:308) reminds us, with many layers of ʺconcealed, congealed meaningsʺ, but having a predominant association with the visual, specifically with the idea of topography as seen from a particular viewpoint; its original seventeenth century sense was of a 
                  painting of natural scenery, only subsequently of the vista itself, or of the landforms of a particular area. For anthropologists the effort to comprehend an unfamiliar way of life leads to a different kind of concern with landscape: an attempt to understand the involvement of people with the land that<br>

  Abstract: In Chapter 1 I offered a typology of religious representation—unitive, enactive, symbolic, and conceptual—to describe the ways in which religions have understood reality. The concepts of enactive, symbolic, and conceptual representation were adapted from the work of Jerome Bruner on child development. According to Bruner, who is in turn adapting his categories from Piaget, the child first learns about the world by acting on it. It is by holding, throwing, reaching for, that the children come to know the objects that surround them. In early language learning the symbol and the object are fused—the sun and the<br>

  CONCLUSION from:

  Abstract: Why did so many Punjabis insist that they never saw Partition coming? Was this the work of nostalgia or memories gone astray? Why did so many historians insist that Partition was inevitable? Were they victims of an inexorable faith in the power of historical explanation? Yet the players and writers of history often spoke the same language and frequently drifted into each other’s modes of explanation. I found the questions that were posed to me as I conducted interviews in 2002–2003 returning as I re-read my notes from the archives. I felt that a whole range of powerful emotions<br>

  Abstract: In Weimar in 1815, around three decades after the first performance of
                     Così fan tutte, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe came across translations of the medieval Persian poet Hafiz, by the orientalist Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall, some of the very first into a European language.

                  Golestan(composed in 1258), there was a king who one day in a rage ordered the execution of a foreign slave in his custody. The condemned man began cursing the king in his native tongue, for he was now convinced he would be killed, and so he let go his fears and told the monarch what he thought of him. The king did not understand the language in which the condemned man spoke, so he turned to his courtiers<br>

  1  The Dawn of an Iranian World in an Islamic Universe from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2jbwd8">The World of Persian Literary Humanism</a><br>
  Abstract: The traumatic birth of Persian language and literature in the violent aftermath of the Muslim conquest of Iran was predicated on the aggressive transmutation of the more sedentary social and economic conditions of the Sassanid empire into the far more aggressive supremacy of the nascent Islamic triumphalism that was soon consolidated in the Umayyad caliphate (661–750) and then the Abbasid empire (750–1258). The Sassanid empire (224–651), extending from central Asia to the Mediterranean, was vastly urbanized and sedentary; the Islamic triumphalism that invaded and conquered it was lightweight, agile, and initially divided along patrimonial communalism.

  Abstract: From where does a theological vision begin? What gives rise to theological insight and, in particular, to my insight? I ask these questions not only as a matter of self-reflection but out of wondrous surprise that I am a theologian because, truth be told, I never intended to be one. Unlike the typical theology student finely tuned in philosophy, theology, and classical languages, I was a hard-core student of science who took only the necessary courses in theology and philosophy to meet the requirements of my undergraduate institution.

  Abstract: Where does theology find itself on the contemporary moral landscape described by Rorty as inhabited primarily by “Kantians” and “Hegelians”? The language of human rights is problematic for theology; for certain perspectives on rights assume an adversarial view of relationships within society and can be erosive of visions and structures of communal life. An extreme “rights mentality” that views rights not as a boundary discourse in ethics but as the discourse that trumps all other ethical concerns can encourage the coexistence of disconnected subjects and the demands of narcissistic claims. A theologian may be more comfortable with a biblical vision<br>

  Abstract: This book has explored the engagement between theology and the discourse of human rights, a dialectical boundary discourse of human flourishing, positioned in ethics as “protective marginality.” As a dialectical language, human rights holds in tension the universal and the particular, the individual and the community, the religious and the secular, theory and practice.

  Book Title: Telling Stories-Language, Narrative, and Social Life<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Nylund Anastasia<br>
  Abstract: Narratives are fundamental to our lives: we dream, plan, complain, endorse, entertain, teach, learn, and reminisce through telling stories. They provide hopes, enhance or mitigate disappointments, challenge or support moral order and test out theories of the world at both personal and communal levels. It is because of this deep embedding of narrative in everyday life that its study has become a wide research field including disciplines as diverse as linguistics, literary theory, folklore, clinical psychology, cognitive and developmental psychology, anthropology, sociology, and history. In
      Telling Storiesleading scholars illustrate how narratives build bridges among language, identity, interaction, society, and culture; and they investigate various settings such as therapeutic and medical encounters, educational environments, politics, media, marketing, and public relations. They analyze a variety of topics from the narrative construction of self and identity to the telling of stories in different media and the roles that small and big life stories play in everyday social interactions and institutions. These new reflections on the theory and analysis of narrative offer the latest tools to researchers in the fields of discourse analysis and sociolinguistics.<br>

  Author(s) BAUMAN RICHARD<br>
  Abstract: FROM THE LATE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY and the first scholarly recognition of oral tradition as a cultural process, there has been a concomitant concern among students of language and expressive culture with the transformative effects of new technologies of communication on oral performance. One facet of the problem that has concerned scholars of oral narrative from the Brothers Grimm to the theorists of ethnopoetics and the orality-literacy debates is the process of remediation, specifically, the rendering of face-to-face performance forms through the mediation of another communicative technology.¹ What happens when we render oral stories in writing?

  Abstract: IN THIS CHAPTER we examine what appears to be a perfect storm related to identity work in social interaction: the use of language alternation in quoting others’ speech in the course of telling conversational, or “small,” stories. Central to language alternation is laying claim to, putting off, or otherwise constructing and negotiating social identities (Torras and Gafaranga 2002). Similarly, identity formation and construction are based in narrative forms and functions (Georgakopoulou 2006; Taylor 2006). Last, identity work is at the core of reported speech (Clift 2006; Stokoe and Edwards 2007). Here we analyze two conversational stories from group interview sessions<br>

  Book Title: The Furies-Violence and Terror in the French and Russian Revolutions<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): MAYER ARNO J.<br>
  Abstract: Although these two upheavals arose in different environments, they followed similar courses. The thought and language of Enlightenment France were the glories of western civilization; those of tsarist Russia's intelligentsia were on its margins. Both revolutions began as revolts vowed to fight unreason, injustice, and inequality; both swept away old regimes and defied established religions in societies that were 85% peasant and illiterate; both entailed the terrifying return of repressed vengeance. Contrary to prevalent belief, Mayer argues, ideologies and personalities did not control events. Rather, the tide of violence overwhelmed the political actors who assumed power and were rudderless. Even the best plans could not stem the chaos that at once benefited and swallowed them. Mayer argues that we have ignored an essential part of all revolutions: the resistances to revolution, both domestic and foreign, which help fuel the spiral of terror.<br>

  3.  After Babel: from:

  Abstract: In the earliest times, after the great flood, the Bible tells us (Genesis 11:1–9), “the whole earth had one language and few words.” The people took hold of a stretch of land in order to settle there and gain means of subsistence. They soon developed skills as artisans and craftsmen and even ventured into the fields of construction and engineering. After they had acquired sufficient competence and self-confidence, they said to each other: “Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens, so that we make a name for ourselves and not<br>

  Author(s) Clarke Deborah<br>
  Abstract: Listening to these alleged responses to why the chicken crossed the road, no one could confuse one individual for the other. Faulkner, after all, has made his name as one of the most complex of the high modernists, with an incredible sensitivity for language and an obsession with the sense of place and the role of history in determining human identity and fate. Ford, on the other hand, was the great simplifier. He made his fortune by making cars easy—easy to drive, easy to repair, and easy to assemble. He had a simple formula for success—keep the prices<br>

  Abstract: Born in tehran in 1933, Seyyed Hossein Nasr has been at the forefront of discussions of the relation between Islam and modernity for more than four decades. He has published more than five hundred articles and more than fifty books that have been translated into some twenty languages. Nasr is one of only three intellectuals who have delivered the Gifford Lectures in Natural Theology (1980–81) and also been included in the Library of Living Philosophers (2000), the others being John Dewey (Gifford 1928–29, Library 1939) and Alfred North Whitehead (Gifford 1927–28, Library 1941).

  Abstract: The work of categorization left by scholars through the ages is phenomenal. Specialists in the foundations of law and jurisprudence (
                  usul al-fiqh), who labored at this exercise of extrapolating and categorizing rules on the basis of a reading that was both careful to be faithful to the norm and profoundly rational, have bequeathed to us an unparalleled heritage. A careful reading of these works reveals that very precise modes of grasping the sources were set down very early. Consideration of the language was supported by a double process of distinguishing on the one hand between the unequivocal and the equivocal<br>

  Abstract: It is well known that late medieval literary theory owes much to Aquinas’s reconciliation of human rhetoric with the divine revelation of truth in the text of Scripture.

  Abstract: In an essay on antifoundationalism and the teaching of writing, Stanley Fish defined the term

  Author(s) Eagleton Terry<br>
  Abstract: A political literary criticism is not the invention of marxists. On the contrary, it is one of the oldest, most venerable forms of literary criticism we know. The most widespread early criticism on historical record was not, in our sense, “aesthetic”: it was a mode of what we would now call “discourse theory,” devoted to analyzing the material effects of particular uses of language in particular social conjunctures. It was a highly elaborate theory of specific signifying practices—above all, of the discursive practices of the juridical, political, and religious apparatuses of the state. Its intention, quite consciously, was systematically<br>

  Abstract: Before the end of the eighteenth century, man did not exist—any more than the potency of life, the fecundity of labour or the historical density of language. He is a quite recent creature, which the demiurge of knowledge fabricated with its own hands less than two hundred years ago; but he has grown old so quickly that it has been only too easy to imagine that he had been waiting for thousands of years in the darkness for that moment of illumination in which he would<br>

  Author(s) Gardiner Ellen<br>
  Abstract: While the work of Peter Elbow has been a powerful force in composition studies, several composition theorists have been critical of the conservative political implications of Elbow’s pedagogy. James Berlin and Lester Faigley, for example, argue that Elbow’s theory “hides the social nature of language” (Faigley 531) and teaches students how to “to assert a private vision, a vision which, despite its uniqueness, finally represents humankind’s best nature” (Berlin 487). Theorists such as Patricia Bizzell have viewed Elbow as foundationalist because he believes, she argues, that students are capable of “learning to examine [their] beliefs in light of those advanced<br>

  Abstract: Culture is the key concept in much (though not all) of human science. Yet it is more useful to think of humans first as symbolic animals, rather than cultural animals, for symbolic abilities underlie the existence of both cultures and societies. The species, at the same time that its brain physically evolved, adding a cerebral cortex to its limbic core, increasingly replaced immediate, instinctual responses with delayed, thoughtful actions, mediated through symbols. We need not examine in detail the familiar findings of recent research that tell us of the development of symbolic language, with denotative and connotative characteristics, especially as<br>

  I  On the Prehistory of Hermeneutics from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bfxq">Introduction to Philosophical Hermeneutics</a><br>
  Abstract: The development of explicit hermeneutical reflection bears the signature of modernity. As shown above with reference to Nietzsche and Habermas, what distinguishes the modern world-picture is its consciousness of being perspectival. As soon as it becomes evident that worldviews do not merely duplicate reality as it is in itself, but are instead pragmatic interpretations embraced by our language-world, then hermeneutics comes into its own. Only with the advent of modernity has this occurred. For this reason, it is hardly accidental that the Latin word
                  hermeneuticafirst emerges in the seventeenth century. Yet modern insights can be traced back to antiquity,<br>

  VI  Gadamer and the Universe of Hermeneutics from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bfxq">Introduction to Philosophical Hermeneutics</a><br>
  Abstract: In making language the essence of hermeneutics Gadamer clearly follows the later Heidegger’s radicalization of historical thrownness. His aim, however, is to reconcile this radicalization with the young Heidegger’s hermeneutical starting point, namely, understanding. Specifically, given that we are situated in a history articulated in linguistic tradition, what are the consequences for human understanding and self-knowledge? These consequences are elaborated in “The Ontological Shift of Hermeneutics Guided by Language,” the title of the last third of Gadamer’s magnum opus,
                  Truth and Method. To understand what this ontological or universal shift in hermeneutics implies, we need to return to the underlying<br>

  VII  Hermeneutics in Dialogue from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bfxq">Introduction to Philosophical Hermeneutics</a><br>
  Abstract: If anything is universal in philosophical hermeneutics, it is probably the recognition of one’s own finitude, the consciousness that actual speech does not suffice to exhaust the inner conversation that impels us toward understanding. Gadamer ties the universality of the hermeneutic process to the fact that understanding depends on this ongoing conversation: “That a conversation occurs, no matter when or where or with whom, wherever something comes to language, whether this is another person, a thing, a word, a flame (Gottfried Benn)—this is what constitutes the universality of hermeneutic experience.”¹ Only in conversation, only in confrontation with another’s thought<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bk1z">Reading Abstract Expressionism</a><br>
  Author(s) NEWMAN BARNETT<br>
  Abstract: The Kwakiutl artist painting on a hide did not concern himself with the inconsequentials that made up the opulent social rivalries of the Northwest Coast Indian scene; nor did he, in the name of a higher purity, renounce the living world for the meaningless materialism of design. The abstract shape he used, his entire plastic language, was directed by a ritualistic will toward metaphysical understanding. The everyday realities he left to the toymakers; the pleasant play of nonobjective pattern, to the women basket weavers. To him a shape was a living thing, a vehicle for an abstract thought-complex, a carrier<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bk2f">Hannah Arendt</a><br>
  Abstract: DURING THE YEARS SHE LIVED IN AMERICA, HANNAH Arendt seldom spoke about her childhood. Long before the last of her relatives had left the family’s home in Königsberg, East Prussia, and the city had been destroyed by bombs and rebuilt as Kaliningrad, USSR, she had divided her life into “Then” and “Now” several times. With each division, the first Then, childhood, became a more secret, private matter. When she was eighteen and a student of theology at Marburg University, she made her temporal divisions in the poetic language of her teacher Martin Heidegger: “No longer” and “Not yet.” As she<br>

  [PART 2: Introduction] from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bk2f">Hannah Arendt</a><br>
  Abstract: FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS, HANNAH ARENDT WAS A “STATEless person.” But this period when she had no political rights—between her flight from Nazi Germany in 1933 and her receipt of American citizenship in 1951—was her most active politically. In Paris, where she worked for organizations that helped Jewish refugees emigrate to Palestine and supplied legal aid to anti-Fascists, she left behind the apolitical intellectuality of her university circles. She found a peer group that included artists and workers, Jews and non-Jews, activists and pariahs; German was their language, but they were cosmopolitan in vision. With this group, which included<br>

  3  The Models from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bpmh">Interpreting Interpretation</a><br>
  Abstract: The eight hermeneutic thinkers I have presented often speak the same language—use the same words and concepts, images and analogies. And, indeed, some commentators take them to be holding essentially the same position.¹ Yet this is a mistake. There are at least five possible views that these hermeneutic thinkers may be holding.² I organize these five views around the hermeneuts’ position on the truth of psychoanalytic interpretations. Although a theory’s position on truth may be orthogonal to its status as a hermeneutic theory, there is value to this organization, which the reader will appreciate when I come to critique<br>

  12  Suggestion from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bpqz">Care of the Psyche</a><br>
  Abstract: As noted in the chapter on mesmerism and hypnotism, the language we associate with healing through suggestion did not emerge until the latter part of the nineteenth century. In the wake of Bernheim’s
                     suggestive therapeuticsin the 1880s, suggestion became a recognized element in psychological healing and has continued as such ever since. To some degree, though, this is misleading, as suggestive influences in healing long antedated the mesmerism and hypnotism out of which suggestion seemed to emerge.<br>

  15  Explanation and Interpretation from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bpqz">Care of the Psyche</a><br>
  Abstract: Among the meanings of
                     interpretationin the English language two definitional traditions are of particular importance for our purposes: one relating explanation or the act of explaining, and the other to translation or the act translating. Further, interpretation is the act of offering meaning, signification, or understanding—or the meaning, signification, or understanding offered—whether to another or to oneself.<br>

  Book Title: Rhetorical Invention and Religious Inquiry-New Perspectives<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): OLMSTED WENDY<br>
  Abstract: This exceptional collection of writings offers for the first time a discussion among leading thinkers about the points at which rhetoric and religion illuminate and challenge each other. The contributors to the volume are eminent theorists and critics in rhetoric, theology, and religion, and they address a variety of problems and periods.Together these writings shed light on religion as a human quest and rhetoric as the origin and sustainer of that quest. They show that when pursued with intelligence and sensitivity, rhetorical approaches to religion are capable of revitalizing both language and experience. Rhetorical figures, for example, constitute forms of language that say what cannot be said in any other way, and that move individuals toward religious truths that cannot be known in any other way. When firmly placed within religious, social, and literary history, the convergence of rhetoric and religion brings into focus crucial issues in several fields-including philosophy, psychology, history, and art-and interprets relations among self, language, and world that are central to both past and present cultures.<br>

  Author(s) CARLSON THOMAS A.<br>
  Abstract: The rhetorical modes of “negative” or “apophatic” theology — and of its twin, “mystical” theology — have since the 1970s attracted serious inquiry and extended discussion not only among theologians but also among literary theorists, and philosophers, who tend to share three interconnected concerns: the human subject’s finitude, its situation in language, and its desire. Among post-Heideggerian thinkers in particular, the fascination with textual and discursive traditions deriving from the negative theology of Pseudo-Dionysius (flourished ca. 500) almost always involves a fascination as well with the radically finite, desiring subject of language—to the point that one might suspect contemporary interest in<br>

  Book Title: Faces of History-Historical Inquiry from Herodotus to Herder<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): KELLEY DONALD R.<br>
  Abstract: In this book, one of the world's leading intellectual historians offers a critical survey of Western historical thought and writing from the pre-classical era to the late eighteenth century. Donald R. Kelley focuses on persistent themes and methodology, including questions of myth, national origins, chronology, language, literary forms, rhetoric, translation, historical method and criticism, theory and practice of interpretation, cultural studies, philosophy of history, and "historicism."Kelley begins by analyzing the dual tradition established by the foundational works of Greek historiography-Herodotus's broad cultural and antiquarian inquiry and the contrasting model of Thucydides' contemporary political and analytical narrative. He then examines the many variations on and departures from these themes produced in writings from Greek, Roman, Jewish, and Christian antiquity, in medieval chronicles, in national histories and revisions of history during the Renaissance and Reformation, and in the rise of erudite and enlightened history in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Throughout, Kelley discusses how later historians viewed their predecessors, including both supporters and detractors of the authors in question.The book, which is a companion volume to Kelley's highly praised anthology
      Versions of History from Antiquity to the Enlightenment,will be a valuable resource for scholars and students interested in interpretations of the past.<br>

  Book Title: Metaphysics in Ordinary Language-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Rosen Stanley<br>
  Abstract: In this rich collection of philosophical writings, Stanley Rosen addresses a wide range of topics-from eros, poetry, and freedom to problems like negation and the epistemological status of sense perception. Though diverse in subject, Rosen's essays share two unifying principles: there can be no legitimate separation of textual hermeneutics from philosophical analysis, and philosophical investigation must be oriented in terms of everyday language and experience, although it cannot simply remain within these confines. Ordinary experience provides a minimal criterion for the assessment of extraordinary discourses, Rosen argues, and without such a criterion we would have no basis for evaluating conflicting discourses: philosophy would give way to poetry.Philosophical problems are not so deeply embedded in a specific historical context that they cannot be restated in terms as valid for us today as they were for those who formulated them, the author maintains. Rosen shows that the history of philosophy-a story of conflicting interpretations of human life and the structure of intelligibility-is a story that comes to life only when it is rethought in terms of the philosophical problems of our own personal and historical situation.<br>

  Chapter 7  Technē and the Origins of Modernity from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bsjw">Metaphysics in Ordinary Language</a><br>
  Abstract: In this essay, I make a suggestion about the role of Platonism in the development of the modern epoch. It has become quite common to find in the scholarly literature the claim that such originators of modernity as Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Descartes were influenced by Plato’s geometrical cosmology. According to this view, the mythical description of the cosmos as constructed from a variety of pure geometrical figures, which Plato records in the
                     Timaeus, is the prototype for the late Renaissance and early modern conviction that philosophy is written in the book of nature in the languages of mathematics.<br>

  Abstract: There is more than one way in which to honor the work of a thinker. I shall try to recognize the contribution of Josef Simon, not by a summary of his achievements or even by a textual analysis of his work, but by addressing the theme which he has so subtly articulated in the two books

  Chapter 13  Philosophy and Ordinary Experience from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bsjw">Metaphysics in Ordinary Language</a><br>
  Abstract: I propose to deal with the question of the relation between philosophy and ordinary experience. This sounds quite straightforward, but I am afraid that it is actually an unusually difficult problem. It is a striking fact of our century that philosophy has become increasingly concerned with ordinary experience, ordinary language, everyday life, or the life-world, to cite four often-used expressions. This concern is evident in both wings of the two major contemporary philosophical movements, which are popularly if inaccurately designated as the analytical and the continental or phenomenological schools. Interest in everyday or ordinary language has clearly been stimulated by<br>

  Abstract: Let us assume that there is something called narrative that can exist apart from any particular method of narration or any particular narrative utterance, as we assume that there is something called the English language that exists apart from any particular form of discourse or any individual speech act in English. Narration is, first of all, a kind of human behavior. It is specifically a mimetic or representative behavior, through which human beings communicate certain kinds of message. The modes of narration may vary extraordinarily. (In passing, I should say that I am aware of our customary distinction between what<br>

  Abstract: In the nineteenth century there was nearly universal consensus that Jews in the Islamic Middle Ages—taking al-Andalus, or Muslim Spain, as the model—lived in a “Golden Age” of Jewish-Muslim harmony,¹ an interfaith utopia of tolerance and
                  convivencia.² It was thought that Jews mingled freely and comfortably with Muslims, immersed in Arabic-Islamic culture, including the language, poetry, philosophy, science, medicine, and the study of Scripture—a society, furthermore, in which Jews could and many did ascend to the pinnacles of political power in Muslim government. This idealized picture went beyond Spain to encompass the entire Muslim world, from Baghdad<br>

  Abstract: In French-language Maghrebi literature, the relationship between Jews and Muslims is a question of particular resonance, in that the colonial past weighs heavily on contemporary history. Both Jewish and Muslim writers have achieved fame in the field, weaving, in the same language, connections based on places that, despite antagonisms, have sometimes shaped shared spaces. Since the conflictual alterity of the 1950s, that literature has evolved toward new dialogical expressions imposed by the rise of the different fundamentalisms, by way of the trials of nationalism in the 1960s and the international issues associated with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

  Abstract: The Hebrew Bible has been translated many times since antiquity, by both Jews and Christians. In the third century BCE, the Torah was rendered into Greek for the Hellenophone community of Alexandria : this was the famous version known as the Septuagint. The tradition of the Targum developed concurrently in the Jewish communities of the Middle East , whose vernacular language had been Aramaic in its various dialects since the Babylonian exile in the sixth century. The biblical text was translated into Aramaic and was recited verse by verse at the synagogue, alongside the liturgical reading of the Torah. The<br>

  Abstract: Modern linguistics groups a certain number of related languages under the name “Semitic languages.” The family comprises three main branches: East Semitic, represented by Akkadian or Assyro-Babylonian; South Semitic, represented by the Ethiopian languages (Geʿez, Amharic, Tigrinya, etc.), as well as by the South Arabic languages (which are not derived from Arabic); and Central Semitic, which has two subgroups—Arabic and the Semitic languages of the northwest. It is this last subgroup that includes Aramaic, Ugaritic, and the Canaanite languages such as Hebrew, but also Phoenician and Moabite.<br>

In their youth, many of these scholars had received a traditional Jewish education, and their knowledge of Semitic languages (Hebrew and Aramaic) and rabbinic literature not only made Arabic and Islam more approachable but also enabled them to notice similarities between Judaism and Islam that were not as apparent to Christian orientalists like de Sacy, Umbreit, Fleischer, and Nöldeke.

  Abstract: Hebrew poetry in Spain, which took root in Córdoba in the tenth century under the caliphate of ʿAbd al-Rahman III, stemmed from two extremely strong cultural influences: Classical Arabic poetry and the language of the Bible. Biblical Hebrew is the raw material for the Jewish poets of Andalusia, from which they deliberately draw the linguistic tools needed for their poems. From its first appearance, Andalusian Hebrew poetry used the full variety of themes and prosody of Arabic poetry, those of the pre-Islamic period, those of the Abbasid period, and those typical of al-Andalus.<br>

  Abstract: Jews have lived in Iran for almost three millennia and became profoundly acculturated to many aspects of Iranian life. This phenomenon is particularly manifest in the literary sphere, defined here broadly to include belles lettres, as well as nonbelletristic (i.e., historical, philosophical, and polemical) writings. Although Iranian Jews spoke many local dialects and some peculiar Jewish dialects, such as the hybrid lo- Torah[i] (Heb. + Pers. suffix of abstraction), meaning “non-Torahic” (a dialect that combines both Semitic [Hebrew and Aramaic] and Persian elements), their written, literary language was Judeo-Persian (Farsi in Hebrew script), which was close to the

  Abstract: Cults of saints are a fundamental phenomenon in Egyptian popular culture. They attest to the preservation of a large share of archaic beliefs associated with magical and totemic practices and with agrarian mythologies. The cult of “saints” (

  Book Title: Nation, Language, and the Ethics of Translation-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): APTER EMILY<br>
  Abstract: In recent years, scholarship on translation has moved well beyond the technicalities of converting one language into another and beyond conventional translation theory. With new technologies blurring distinctions between "the original" and its reproductions, and with globalization redefining national and cultural boundaries, "translation" is now emerging as a reformulated subject of lively, interdisciplinary debate. Nation, Language, and the Ethics of Translation enters the heart of this debate. It covers an exceptional range of topics, from simultaneous translation to legal theory, from the language of exile to the language of new nations, from the press to the cinema; and cultures and languages from contemporary Bengal to ancient Japan, from translations of Homer to the work of Don DeLillo.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fgz7m">Nation, Language, and the Ethics of Translation</a><br>
  Author(s) BERMANN SANDRA<br>
  Abstract: There has probably never been a time when issues of nation, language, and translation have been more important or more troubling than they are today. In a world where individual nation-states are increasingly enmeshed in financial and information networks, where multiple linguistic and national identities can inhabit a single state’s borders or exceed them in vast diasporas, where globalization has its serious—and often violent—discontents, and where terrorism and war transform distrust into destruction, language and translation play central, if often unacknowledged, roles. Though the reasons for this are undeniably complex, they are, at least in broad terms, understandable.<br>

  Author(s) LEGRAND PIERRE<br>
  Abstract: Consider statutes and judicial decisions, two of the most common legal artifacts. If one accepts that statutes are not enacted by legislatures and that judicial decisions are not made by courts with a view to applying to foreign legal cultures, then legal borrowing across legal cultures is the practice of interrupting intention, which is a form of epistemic violence.¹ Statutes and judicial decisions nonetheless regularly find themselves being imported across legal cultures—that is, across cultures and languages—in order to underwrite local reforming agendas. In the process, these texts pass into new semiotic constellations. However, just as there cannot<br>

  Abstract: Though modern simultaneous interpretation with its microphones, earphones, and sound equipment is a relatively new phenomenon, it certainly has ancient analogues.¹ In the first Letter to the Corinthians St. Paul orders, “If any man speak in an unknown tongue let it be by two, or at most by three . . . and let one interpret” (14:27). At various times interpreters have served as missionaries, liaison officers, military envoys, court interpreters, business couriers, and trade negotiators.

  Abstract: If one were to search today for a way of reflecting on the destiny of language and literature in an age dominated increasingly by electronic media, there is probably no better place to start—and perhaps even to end—than with the question of translation. This might seem a somewhat surprising assertion to make, given the widespread tendency to associate the rise of electronic media with what is usually called the “audiovisual,” as distinct from the linguistic, discursive, or textual. Such an association is, of course, by no means simply arbitrary. In 1999, the dollar value produced by the sales<br>

  Abstract: What is the language of a Russian film? Of a Japanese film? The question sounds like a trick or a riddle, a children’s joke, along the lines of “Who wrote Beethoven’s Eroica Symphony?,” or “What was the date of the 1848 revolutions?” And there is an obvious answer, of course. The language of the film, in the most literal sense, is Russian or Japanese. But if we say this we need to note at once how much we have smuggled into, or taken for granted about, the meaning of the word “film.” We are probably thinking of sound films, although<br>

  Author(s) EAGLESTONE ROBERT<br>
  Abstract: Many commentators have suggested that translation is central to the ethical philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas. Not, clearly, translation from one language to another, in the sense of translating, say, German into French, nor translation in the sense of introducing intellectual developments from one national tradition into another, although Levinas is widely credited with introducing phenomenological thought into France in 1930. The commentators suggest that Levinas offers translation in a wider sense between what he calls “Hebrew” and “Greek,” where the names for the languages stand in for much wider frameworks or worldviews. However, although this is a constructive approach that<br>

  Abstract: It is often claimed today that comparative literature is a kind of translation and, being a practice less transparent than translation, should take translation as its model. This claim feels avant-garde: it resonates with the “linguistic turn” that informed most of the humanistic disciplines during the last quarter of the last century and vividly survives today in neighboring disciplines, like English, foreign languages, history, and anthropology, with their concerns for globalization, the media, and the mentalities of postcolonialism.

  Abstract: These comments are drawn from Victor Hugo’s 1865 preface to his son François-Victor’s version of Shakespeare’s works. They are worth examining, not simply because Hugo uses translation as the basis for a critique of nationalism, but because his critique at once exposes and is itself riddled with contradictions that have characterized the relations between translation and national identities, regardless of the language and culture in which the translating is performed. Formulating the contradictory implications of Hugo’s comments, then, will be a useful way to introduce my reflections on nationalist agendas in translation.<br>

  Book Title: Shattered Voices-Language, Violence, and the Work of Truth Commissions<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Phelps Teresa Godwin<br>
  Abstract: Following periods of mass atrocity and oppression, states are faced with a question of critical importance in the transition to democracy: how to offer redress to victims of the old regime without perpetuating cycles of revenge. Traditionally, balance has been restored through arrests, trials, and punishment, but in the last three decades, more than twenty countries have opted to have a truth commission investigate the crimes of the prior regime and publish a report about the investigation, often incorporating accounts from victims. Although many praise the work of truth commissions for empowering and healing through words rather than violence, some condemn the practice as a poor substitute for traditional justice, achieved through trials and punishment. There has been until now little analysis of the unarticulated claim that underlies the truth commissions' very existence: that language-in this case narrative stories-can substitute for violence. Acknowledging revenge as a real and deep human need,
      Shattered Voicesexplores the benefits and problems inherent when a fragile country seeks to heal its victims without risking its own future. In developing a theory about the role of language in retribution, Teresa Godwin Phelps takes an interdisciplinary approach, delving into sources from Greek tragedy toHamlet, from Kant to contemporary theories about retribution, from the Babylonian law codes to the South African Truth and Reconciliation Report. She argues that, given the historical and psychological evidence about revenge, starting afresh by drawing a bright line between past crimes and a new government is both unrealistic and unwise. When grievous harm happens, a rebalancing is bound to occur, whether it is orderly and lawful or disorderly and unlawful.Shattered Voicescontends that language is requisite to any adequate balancing, and that a solution is viable only if it provides an atmosphere in which storytelling and subsequent dialogue can flourish. In the developing culture of ubiquitous truth reports, Phelps argues that we must become attentive to the form these reports take-the narrative structure, the use of victims' stories, and the way a political message is conveyed to the citizens of the emerging democracy. By looking concretely at the work and responsibilities of truth commissions,Shattered Voicesoffers an important and thoughtful analysis of the efficacy of the ways human rights abuses are addressed.<br>

  Abstract: My ongoing project is to explore the question as to whether there is any reason to think, indeed hope, that the collecting and publishing of victims’ stories—the activities that surround writing a truth report—can bring an end to the cycle of revenge that threatens the stability of an emerging democracy. Is it sensible to suppose that language can carry such a burden? By examining some of the history of revenge and our troubled and ambivalent relationship to it, the early chapters have provided, I hope, a clearer understanding of what a victim such as Paulina might mean when<br>

Formal language in the informal setting of the suq does not limit meaning; rather, by embodying words and gestures customarily performed by and for men, women orators create a multivocalic and hybrid discourse in a context of heteroglossia. By appropriating the authority vested in public discourse, women marketers challenge traditional notions<br>

Although a narrative may have many functions and embody several forms, an internal hierarchy exists which determines the relative value of its components. The dominant of poetic language is the aesthetic function—its form. Poetry is oriented toward the sign, while prose narrative is directed toward the referent.¹ “Poetic evolution,” says Jakobson, “is a shift in this hierarchy.”<br>

  Abstract: In a kingdom of long ago, there was a dervish from a very strict school who was one day strolling along a river bank. As he walked he pondered great problems of morality and scholarship. For years he had studied the word of the Prophet. Through study of Prophet’s sacred language, he reasoned, he would one day be blessed with Mohammed’s divine illumination and acquire the ultimate Truth.<br>

  Book Title: Aliens and Sojourners-Self as Other in Early Christianity<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): DUNNING BENJAMIN H.<br>
  Abstract: Early Christians spoke about themselves as resident aliens, strangers, and sojourners, asserting that otherness is a fundamental part of being Christian. But why did they do so and to what ends? How did Christians' claims to foreign status situate them with respect to each other and to the larger Roman world as the new movement grew and struggled to make sense of its own boundaries?
      Aliens and Sojournersargues that the claim to alien status is not a transparent one. Instead, Benjamin Dunning contends, it shaped a rich, pervasive, variegated discourse of identity in early Christianity. Resident aliens and foreigners had long occupied a conflicted space of both repulsion and desire in ancient thinking. Dunning demonstrates how Christians and others in antiquity capitalized on this tension, refiguring the resident alien as being of a compelling doubleness, simultaneously marginal and potent. Early Christians, he argues, used this refiguration to render Christian identity legible, distinct, and even desirable among the vast range of social and religious identities and practices that proliferated in the ancient Mediterranean. Through close readings of ancient Christian texts such as Hebrews, 1 Peter, theShepherd of Hermas, and theEpistle to Diognetus, Dunning examines the markedly different ways that Christians used the language of their own marginality, articulating a range of options for what it means to be Christian in relation to the Roman social order. His conclusions have implications not only for the study of late antiquity but also for understanding the rhetorics of religious alienation more broadly, both in the ancient world and today.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fj38q">Aliens and Sojourners</a><br>
  Abstract: Given the flexibility of alien and foreign status as a trope, early Christians found further uses for it in addition to labeling themselves. As I have argued, the claim to alien status is a relational one, drawing a boundary that defines an outside in relation to an inside. In the traditional valorization of the alien topos (as seen in 1 Peter, Hebrews, and 
                  Diognetus), outsider and insider terms get reversed, so that, by claiming the name “alien,” Christians mark their insider status with a revalued language of alterity. But because of this relational dynamic, small differences in emphasis could produce<br>

I am here engaged in a practice of which I generally disapprove: writing professionally on a text in whose language of composition I am illiterate.

  Abstract: Since the early 1950s, Alain Robbe-Grillet’s writings and films have influenced that body of French literary investigative work which reflects the “suspicion” (in Nathalie Sarraute’s sense) that the real world and natural language might be arbitrary constructions. Despite the metafictional character of his de-naturing of traditional narratives, his ex-posing of the ideologies concealed behind Western myths, and his interrogation of the hidden structures of thought and feeling (Logos and Eros) in which writer and reader are enmeshed, Robbe-Grillet’s detecting project can itself be generated only from within the traditional frames of language, myth, and feeling.<br>

  Abstract: This chapter focuses on literature and the reading act as a nodal point, a relay station, in the dissemination (in space) and transmission (across generations) of cultural memory. In doing so, it draws attention to three interrelated problem areas: 1) the currency of literature is principally shaped by the language of its expression, whereas the currency of memories is principally shaped in societal or political frameworks; 2) the social and political frameworks (i.e. states and institutions) in which cultural memories are current can be less durable and more fluid than the canonicity of certain literary texts; 3) the literary evocation<br>

  Abstract: At the turn of the 20th century, cinema emerged in a context marked by the vast expansion of interest in bodily movement, at the crossroads of aesthetic and scientific preoccupations. Already developed by Enlightenment philosophers and Romantic poets, the quest for the origins of nonverbal language and mime permeated the discussion of disciplines such as psychology or anthropology,¹ which were in the process of being institutionalized. Furthermore, new images of the body were created and distributed via experimental sciences, which considered the mechanism of physical movement as stemming from circulation and energy consumption.

  Book Title: The Making of the Humanities-Volume 1- Early Modern Europe<br>
  Publisher: Amsterdam University Press<br>
  Author(s): Weststeijn Thijs<br>
  Abstract: This book is the first step towards the development of a comparative history of the humanities. Specialists in philology, musicology, art history, linguistics, literary theory, and other disciplines highlight the intertwining of the various fields and their impact on the sciences. This first volume in the series The Making of the Humanities focuses on the early modern period. Different perspectives reveal how the humanities developed from the 'liberal arts', via the curriculum of humanistic schools, to modern disciplines. The authors show in particular how discoveries in the humanities contributed to a secular world view, pointing up connections with the scientific revolution. The main themes are: the humanities versus the sciences; the visual arts as liberal arts; humanism and heresy; language and poetics; linguists and logicians; philology and philosophy; the history of history. Contributions come from a selection of internationally renowned European and American scholars, including Floris Cohen, David Cram, and Ingrid Rowland. The book offers a wealth of insights for specialists, students, and those interested in the humanities in a broad sense. This title is available in the OAPEN Library - http://www.oapen.org.<br>

  Author(s) Weststeijn Thijs<br>
  Abstract: In his treatise on painting of 1678, the Dutch artist Samuel van Hoogstraten (1627-1678), one of Rembrandt’s pupils, pleaded for the inclusion of the art of painting among the liberal arts. One of his strategies was connecting the visual arts to ideas about language and letters developed by influential philologists such as Gerardus Vossius (1577-1649) and Franciscus Junius (1591-1677). In this context, Van Hoogstraten’s book touched on the subject of pictography, the ideal of a script based on pictures rather than letters. He discussed this in connection to the art of the Chinese.

  Abstract: This paper explores some of the developments in grammar, logic and rhetoric that took place in Europe in the seventeenth century. These disciplines were traditionally seen as belonging together, as they each dealt with language in a particular way. For this reason, they were called the ‘artes sermocinales’, or arts of discourse. The seventeenth century was a period of radical changes in intellectual history at large, and this paper investigates how the arts of discourse were affected by these changes. In particular, it was a period in which the prestige of the arts of discourse declined, and in which some<br>

  Abstract: In the ceaseless interplay of disorder and order in our daily lives, it is possible (and important) to imagine that there are certain situations where this unstable interaction can be held for a moment in steady state. One such suspended moment is the poem, which freeze-frames the interplay as language so that we can contemplate it, feel it, and concentrate on it. Robert Frost once characterized poetry as “a momentary stay against confusion,” and his phrase articulates with eloquent simplicity a poem’s power to lift moments of clarified drama out of the ceaseless, discombobulating flow of experience and, by doing<br>

  Abstract: More than anyone before him, William Wordsworth (1770–1850) brought poetry down out of the high-flown literary language that so subtly served the Overculture’s class interests. The language in a poem, he said, should “consist of a selection of the real language spoken by men.” With that single, simple idea, he brought poetry closer to the average person and connected it to the urgencies in people’s lives. He insisted that a poet was neither a special, divinely inspired genius nor a spokesman for the Overculture and a propagandist for its values. Instead, the poet was simply “a man speaking to<br>

Her own Yupʹik Eskimo language, she said, is as precious a gift as the seals, fish, and other game on which people depend.

  Book Title: Seasons of Misery-Catastrophe and Colonial Settlement in Early America<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): DONEGAN KATHLEEN<br>
  Abstract: The stories we tell of American beginnings typically emphasize colonial triumph in the face of adversity. But the early years of English settlement in America were characterized by catastrophe: starvation, disease, extreme violence, ruinous ignorance, and serial abandonment.
      Seasons of Miseryoffers a provocative reexamination of the British colonies' chaotic and profoundly unstable early days, placing crisis-both experiential and existential-at the center of the story. At the outposts of a fledgling empire and disconnected from the social order of their home society, English settlers were both physically and psychologically estranged from their European identities. They could not control, or often even survive, the world they had intended to possess. According to Kathleen Donegan, it was in this cauldron of uncertainty that colonial identity was formed. Studying the English settlements at Roanoke, Jamestown, Plymouth, and Barbados, Donegan argues that catastrophe marked the threshold between an old European identity and a new colonial identity, a state of instability in which only fragments of Englishness could survive amid the upheavals of the New World. This constant state of crisis also produced the first distinctively colonial literature as settlers attempted to process events that they could neither fully absorb nor understand. Bringing a critical eye to settlers' first-person accounts, Donegan applies a unique combination of narrative history and literary analysis to trace how settlers used a language of catastrophe to describe unprecedented circumstances, witness unrecognizable selves, and report unaccountable events.Seasons of Miseryaddresses both the stories that colonists told about themselves and the stories that we have constructed in hindsight about them. In doing so, it offers a new account of the meaning of settlement history and the creation of colonial identity.<br>

  Book Title: Philosophy of Communication-  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Butchart Garnet C.<br>
  Abstract: To philosophize is to communicate philosophically. From its inception, philosophy has communicated forcefully. Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle talk a lot, and talk ardently. Because philosophy and communication have belonged together from the beginning--and because philosophy comes into its own and solidifies its stance through communication--it is logical that we subject communication to philosophical investigation. This collection of key works of classical, modern, and contemporary philosophers brings communication back into philosophy's orbit. It is the first anthology to gather in a single volume foundational works that address the core questions, concepts, and problems of communication in philosophical terms. The editors have chosen thirty-two selections from the work of Plato, Leibniz, Hegel, Husserl, Heidegger, Wittgenstein, Benjamin, Lacan, Derrida, Sloterdijk, and others. They have organized these texts thematically, rather than historically, in seven sections: consciousness; intersubjective understanding; language; writing and context; difference and subjectivity; gift and exchange; and communicability and community. Taken together, these texts not only lay the foundation for establishing communication as a distinct philosophical topic but also provide an outline of what philosophy of communication might look like.<br>

The one would be that language is

  Book Title: Translating Childhoods-Immigrant Youth, Language, and Culture<br>
  Publisher: Rutgers University Press<br>
  Author(s): ORELLANA MARJORIE FAULSTICH<br>
  Abstract: Though the dynamics of immigrant family life has gained attention from scholars, little is known about the younger generation, often considered "invisible."
         Translating Childhoods, a unique contribution to the study of immigrant youth, brings children to the forefront by exploring the "work" they perform as language and culture brokers, and the impact of this largely unseen contribution.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hj1hn">Translating Childhoods</a><br>
  Abstract: For more than a decade, I have been documenting the work that the children of immigrants do as they use their skills in two languages to read, write, listen, speak, and do things for their families.¹ I refer to a practice that has variously been called Natural Translation, family interpreting, language brokering, and
                  para-phrasing–terms I discuss further in chapter 1. Placing phone calls, taking and leaving messages, scheduling appointments, filling out credit card applications, negotiating sales purchases, soliciting social services, and communicating for their parents with teachers, medical personnel, and other authority figures are part of everyday life for<br>

  Chapter 5  Transculturations from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hj1hn">Translating Childhoods</a><br>
  Abstract: Because parent-teacher conferences offer particularly rich insights into the complexities of child language brokering on social, psychological, cultural, cognitive, and linguistic dimensions, I examine this activity setting in detail. The transactions also reveal adults’ assumptions about children and childhood, learning and development, and suggest how these beliefs influence children’s pathways.¹ They illuminate some challenges that interpreters face when they engage in interactions that would normally involve only two people. Cecilia Wadensjö,² in her extension of Erving Goffman’s concepts of participant frameworks,³ points out that the presence of translators makes dyadic exchanges into multiparty ones, but participants often continue to act<br>

  2  Signifying Revelation in Islam from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hj5wr">Theorizing Scriptures</a><br>
  Author(s) KASSAM TAZIM R.<br>
  Abstract: The wider context of this essay is to bring about an epistemic shift in theorizing about “scriptures” by making transparent the signifying process and by calling into question the methods and activities by which (scriptural) meaning is made and legitimated. This involves looking from the margins to the center where dominant discourses and frames of reference have established the hermeneutical norms and epistemic regimes for understanding and relating to “scripture(s).” Such a venture invokes the broader question of how to relate to scriptural language given the sacred status that it enjoys. What questions might one ask of “scriptures” and their<br>

  Abstract: These were the words of the U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld at a press conference. This is indeed a highly complicated use of the English language, at least equivalent to and perhaps surpassing the Bhabha-ist and Spivakian verbiage. The defense secretary may not have had the world of scriptural interpretation in mind when he uttered these profound thoughts, but what he said has some relevance to the discipline.<br>

  Abstract: Early birdcalls rode the mist as a small procession of three women and two men, slowly and silently wove through tall grasses and reeds to the edge of a tidal creek. The leader, a tall, bearded man, now slightly stooped with age, halted and gazed east toward the nearby sea. As the first pink of dawn tipped the grasses, he raised his arms and spread his fingers wide, praying in a language only one member of the group, an elderly woman, remembered from her youth. A tear coursed slowly down her cheek and the young man and woman came up<br>

  Abstract: After Representation?explores one of the major issues in Holocaust studiesùthe intersection of memory and ethics in artistic expression, particularly within literature.As experts in the study of literature and culture, the scholars in this collection examine the shifting cultural contexts for Holocaust representation and reveal how writersùwhether they write as witnesses to the Holocaust or at an imaginative distance from the Nazi genocideùarticulate the shadowy borderline between fact and fiction, between event and expression, and between the condition of life endured in atrocity and the hope of a meaningful existence. What imaginative literature brings to the study of the Holocaust is an ability to test the limits of language and its conventions.After Representation?moves beyond the suspicion of representation and explores the changing meaning of the Holocaust for different generations, audiences, and contexts.<br>

  Book Title: The King James Version at 400-Assessing Its Genius as Bible Translation and Its Literary Influence<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Towner Philip H.<br>
  Abstract: In this collection of essays, thirty scholars from diverse disciplines offer their unique perspectives on the genius of the King James Version, a translation whose 400th anniversary was recently celebrated throughout the English-speaking world. While avoiding nostalgia and hagiography, each author clearly appreciates the monumental, formative role the KJV has had on religious and civil life on both sides of the Atlantic (and beyond) as well as on the English language itself. In part 1 the essayists look at the KJV in its historical contexts—the politics and rapid language growth of the era, the emerging printing and travel industries, and the way women are depicted in the text (and later feminist responses to such depictions). Part 2 takes a closer look at the KJV as a translation and the powerful precedents it set for all translations to follow, with the essayists exploring the translators’ principles and processes (with close examinations of “Bancroft’s Rules" and the Prefaces), assessing later revisions of the text, and reviewing the translation’s influence on the English language, textual criticism, and the practice of translation in Jewish and Chinese contexts. Part 3 looks at the various ways the KJV has impacted the English language and literature, the practice of religion (including within the African American and Eastern Orthodox churches), and the broader culture. The contributors are Robert Alter, C. Clifton Black, David G. Burke, Richard A. Burridge, David J. A. Clines, Simon Crisp, David J. Davis, James D. G. Dunn, Lori Anne Ferrell, Leonard J.

  Foreword: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjgtt">The King James Version at 400</a><br>
  Author(s) Burke David G.<br>
  Abstract: The King James Bible came at the end of the Elizabethan age, between Shakespeare and Milton, when Englishmen were using words more passionately, richly, vigorously, wittily, and sublimely than ever before or since. Although none of the divines or scholars who made it were literary men, their language was touched with genius—the genius of a period when style was the common property of educated men rather than an individual achievement.¹<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjgtt">The King James Version at 400</a><br>
  Author(s) Lerer Seth<br>
  Abstract: The period from 1500 to 1650 saw the largest documented increase in the English vocabulary since the Norman Conquest.¹ It has been estimated that about 70 percent of our current, working lexicon comes from words borrowed from outside the language, and the overwhelming bulk of these words entered learned and common parlance in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Such words, too, were not simply lifted wholesale from other tongues. They were coined out of the raw material of classical example: inkhorn terms, aureate diction, denotations for scientific and technical material—all of these came to increase the vocabulary of the<br>

  Luther’s Approach to Bible Translation and the KJV from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjgtt">The King James Version at 400</a><br>
  Author(s) Tomlin Graham<br>
  Abstract: Perhaps the two most influential documents that emerged from the Reformation period were Martin Luther’s translation of the Bible into German, which finally appeared in full in 1534, and the King James Version, whose 400th anniversary the English-speaking world celebrated in 2011. Both had an extensive and profound effect on the languages into which they were translated. Luther combined the various forms of contemporary German into one common vernacular usage, which became the basis for a standardized spoken and written language for centuries to come. The King James Version shaped the English language both in England itself and also in<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjgtt">The King James Version at 400</a><br>
  Author(s) Trobisch David<br>
  Abstract: Several years ago I was invited to teach an evening class at a liberal arts college in the Midwest. The topic of the session was apocalyptic literature. We read from the book of Daniel using the New International Version. At one point a student asked, “Why are we not reading the Bible in its original language?” I was impressed by this question, especially since some chapters of Daniel are written in Hebrew, while other chapters are written in Aramaic. It took a while before I realized that the student referred to the King James Version.<br>

  The KJV New Testament: from:

  Author(s) Dunn James D. G.<br>
  Abstract: Part of the reason for taking on this subject, I guess, was the memory of teenage irritation, more than fifty years ago, when I found myself increasingly frustrated at the many occurrences of “thou,” “thee,” and “ye”; the suffixes “-eth” and “-est”; and “hath,” “spake,” “wist,” “wax,” and “brethren.” It was all so old-fashioned, out of date, not language I would use in any other context than reading the Bible. So I suppose I wanted an opportunity to say how I came to find the KJV less and less satisfactory and satisfying as a translation. Not simply for me in<br>

  The KJV and Anglo-Jewish Translations of the Bible: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjgtt">The King James Version at 400</a><br>
  Author(s) Greenspoon Leonard J.<br>
  Abstract: In a recent study of the relationship between the King James Version and English-language biblical translations by/for Jews, I concluded: “In no other language or culture does a single non-Jewish version exert such influence over Jewish translations.”¹ In order to establish a firm foundation for this declaration, two propositions must be demonstrated. The first, which is implicit in my statement, is that the KJV exerted a significant influence on subsequent Jewish English-language texts. The second, which I might term explicit, is that there are no parallels for such extensive influence by any other non-Jewish version in another language or culture.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjgtt">The King James Version at 400</a><br>
  Author(s) Alter Robert<br>
  Abstract: If there is a single attribute large numbers of readers attach almost reflexively to the King James Version, it would most likely be eloquence. The warrant for this attribution is abundantly evident.
                  Eloquence, a term often associated with oratory, perhaps especially delivered orally, suggests a powerful marshalling of the resources of language to produce a persuasive effect, and that quality is manifested in verse after verse of the 1611 translation. It is an intrinsic quality of this English rendering of the Bible that no doubt has been heightened by the virtually canonical status the King James Bible came to enjoy<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjgtt">The King James Version at 400</a><br>
  Author(s) Black C. Clifton<br>
  Abstract: In the slender space of twenty years not one but two corpora exploded the course of English language and literature. I know of no other culture in which a revolutionary convergence of such magnitude occurred. Two centuries separate Goethe (1749–1832) from Luther’s Bible (1534). Pushkin (1799–1837) consolidated Russia’s vernacular a century after East Slavic’s push and pull between Church Slavonic and Peter the Great (1672–1725). From 1590 to 1611 England witnessed the emergence of

  Author(s) Seidman Naomi<br>
  Abstract: In a field as well trodden as that of Bible translation, a would-be translator has two curiously dissimilar tasks. On the one hand, Bible translators at least since Jerome have insisted on the importance of “going back to the original text,” of coming closer to this original than previous efforts had succeeded in doing. On the other hand, new translations, particularly in the modern period, also aspire to differentiate themselves from their precursors who have worked in the same language, to gain the sort of status that accrues to new translations and is justly withheld from mere revisions.¹ Proximity and<br>

  Abstract: While the experience of being “at risk” is newly recognized as presenting a problem for language and literature, pain has long been understood to resist expression in words. At its worst, pain is unchosen, extreme, and without purpose; it obscures memory, thought, language, everything but itself. How can one communicate such an experience?

  Book Title: The Reparative in Narratives-Works of Mourning in Progress<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROSELLO MIREILLE<br>
  Abstract: The authors studied in this book can be visualized as the islands that constitute an unknown, fragile and trembling literary and cultural Francophone archipelago. The archipelago does not appear on any map, in the middle of an ocean whose name we already know. No Francophone anthology would put these authors together as a matter of course because what connects them is a narrative grammar rather than a national origin or even a language. Yet, their writing techniques and their apprehension of the real (the ways in which they know and name the world) both reflect and actively participate in our evolving perception of what Gayatri Spivak calls the “planet”. The Reparative in Narratives argues that argue that they repair trauma through writing. One description of these awe-inspiring, tender and sometimes horrifying tales is that their narrators are survivors who have experienced and sometimes inflicted unspeakable acts of violence. And yet, ultimately, despair, nihilism, cynicism or silence are never the consequences of their encounter with what some quickly call evil. The traumatic event has not killed them and has not killed their desire to write or perform, although the decidedly altered life that they live in the aftermath of the disaster forces them to become different types of storytellers. They are the first-person narrators of their story, and their narration reinvents them as speaking subjects. In turn, this requires that we accept new reading pacts. That pact is a temporal and geographical signature: the reparative narrative needs readers prepared to accept that healing belongs to the realm of possibilities and that exposure and denunciation do not exhaust the victim’s range of possibilities. Rosello contends that this context-specific yet repeating pattern constitutes a response to the contemporary figuration of both globalized and extremely localized types of traumatic memories.<br>

  Author(s) Koselleck Reinhart<br>
  Abstract: This statement from Voltaire is readily cited to underline the sovereignty of the human being said to have been unleashed in the eighteenth century, when people broke free of religion and metaphysics. The human being, it is suggested, also determines the position of God and, if needed, for reasons of social control for example, may occupy His position argumentatively. Belief in God is no longer a theologically grounded, self-evident commandment; it is universally useful or, to use more modern language, ideologically fungible.<br>

  Abstract: While past scholarship has explored at great length the inscription of the black body in Morrison’s work, recent analysis has focused on her “use of the erotic” – to take up Audre Lorde’s phrase (Turpin, 2010) – in an effort to locate her specific work with language in comparison and contrast with Audre Lorde and Dionne Brand. I wish to argue in this chapter that writing the erotic is what Morrison has been “risking” throughout her output since
                  Sula(1973) throughBeloved(1987) andJazz(1992), down toA Mercy(2008). The erotic is not a “theme,” a moment in the novels’<br>

  Book Title: Ciaran Carson-Space, Place, Writing<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): ALEXANDER NEAL<br>
  Abstract: Ciaran Carson is one of the most challenging and inventive of contemporary Irish writers, exhibiting verbal brilliance, formal complexity, and intellectual daring across a remarkably varied body of work. This study considers the full range of his oeuvre, in poetry, prose, and translations, and discusses the major themes to which he returns, including: memory and history, narrative, language and translation, mapping, violence, and power. It argues that the singularity of Carson’s writing is to be found in his radical imaginative engagements with ideas of space and place. The city of Belfast, in particular, occupies a crucially important place in his texts, serving as an imaginative focal point around which his many other concerns are constellated. The city, in all its volatile mutability, is an abiding frame of reference and a reservoir of creative impetus for Carson’s imagination. Accordingly, the book adopts an interdisciplinary approach that draws upon geography, urbanism, and cultural theory as well as literary criticism. It provides both a stimulating and thorough introduction to Carson’s work, and a flexible critical framework for exploring literary representations of space.<br>

  CHAPTER SIX  Babel-babble: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjcgf">Ciaran Carson</a><br>
  Abstract: Translation is a longstanding and recurrent component of Ciaran Carson’s work, not only as practice, process, and artefact – as his recent book-length versions of Dante’s
                  Inferno, Brian Merriman’sThe Midnight Court, and the Old Irish epic,The Táin, attest – but also as a theme or trope that relates to the multifarious effects of language itself. In this regard ‘translation’ concerns itself with the ways in which transactions between words, idioms, discourses, and languages reveal the difference that is internal to all language. Or, as Walter Benjamin expresses it, ‘all translation is only a somewhat provisional way of coming to terms<br>

  Book Title: American Creoles-The Francophone Caribbean and the American South<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): Britton Celia<br>
  Abstract: The Francophone Caribbean and the American South are sites born of the plantation, the common matrix for the diverse nations and territories of the circum-Caribbean. This book takes as its premise that the basic configuration of the plantation, in terms of its physical layout and the social relations it created, was largely the same in the Caribbean and the American South. Essays written by leading authorities in the field examine the cultural, social, and historical affinities between the Francophone Caribbean and the American South, including Louisiana, which among the Southern states has had a quite particular attachment to France and the Francophone world. The essays focus on issues of history, language, politics and culture in various forms, notably literature, music and theatre. Considering figures as diverse as Barack Obama, Frantz Fanon, Miles Davis, James Brown, Edouard Glissant, William Faulkner, Maryse Condé and Lafcadio Hearn, the essays explore in innovative ways the notions of creole culture and creolization, terms rooted in and indicative of contact between European and African people and cultures in the Americas, and which are promoted here as some of the most productive ways for conceiving of the circum-Caribbean as a cultural and historical entity.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjd80">American Creoles</a><br>

  Abstract: Édouard Glissant’s writing is deeply rooted in a strategy that challenges a hegemonic form of language use,¹ as described in detail by Celia Britton, with particular reference to his essays and novels (Britton, 1999). Miles Davis’s music, too, can be interpreted as a counter-discourse. The literature of the Caribbean and jazz music in the United States belong in fact to areas of cultural activity which have comparable histories despite their dissimilarities. A comparative approach to Glissant’s writing and the trumpet player’s improvisations can therefore allow us to reflect on the connections between strategies of resistance and, on the other hand,<br>

  Book Title: Postcolonial Thought in the French Speaking World-  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): Murphy David<br>
  Abstract: In the late 1990’s, Postcolonial Studies risked imploding as a credible area of academic enquiry. Repeated anthologization and an overemphasis on the English-language literatures led to sustained critiques of the field and to an active search for alternative approaches to the globalized and transnational formations of the post-colonial world. In the early twenty-first century, however, postcolonial began to reveal a new openness to its comparative dimensions. French-language contributors to postcolonial debate (such as Edouard Glissant and Abdelkebir Khatibi) have recently risen to greater prominence in the English-speaking world, and there have also appeared an increasing number of important critical and theoretical texts on postcolonial issues, written by scholars working principally on French-language material. It is to such a context that this book responds. Acknowledging these shifts, this volume provides an essential tool for students and scholars outside French departments seeking a way into the study of Francophone colonial postcolonial debates. At the same time, it supplies scholars in French with a comprehensive overview of essential ideas and key intellectuals in this area.<br>

  Abstract: Any artistic production inevitably involves an act of translation, a transference of a form, commodity, or idea across a boundary, be that boundary one of time, space, language, or cultural medium. Shakespeare and his works are among the most durable and flexible of translated media, and seem unlikely to be easily exhausted. Particularly interesting are the ways in which ‘Shakespeare’ operates both as an enabling medium and as an object who is himself translated. Within the economy of translation, the facilitating medium is a common point of reference, a shared experience which first makes conceivable the possibility and desirability of<br>

  Abstract: The publication of this book comes at a time when humanities in general, and the teaching of modern foreign languages in particular, feel threatened because of uncertainty in relation to financial and economic circumstances. French Studies departments already faced difficulties when, in 2004, the education department for England decided that a foreign-language GCSE was no longer required to access higher education, a decision that resulted in the dropping of language teaching in many secondary schools. Learning a foreign language is perceived in the UK as being difficult and, the subject having in essence become optional, few pupils enrol in language<br>

  Abstract: In March 2009, the Ministère des affaires étrangères et européennes held an international seminar in Sèvres, in collaboration with the Centre International d’Études Pédagogiques.¹ It emerged clearly from discussions at the seminar that French provision in UK universities contrasts with that in most other EU countries in three important respects.² First, UK French departments are relatively unusual in delivering a curriculum that includes a high volume and a wide variety of ‘content courses’, as practitioners often term them, alongside core language provision. Second, innovation in the delivery of that curriculum appears to be more widespread in UK universities. Increasing use<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjkzw">French Studies in and for the 21st Century</a><br>
  Author(s) Forsdick Charles<br>
  Abstract: Two dominant assumptions underpinning Michael Worton’s 2009 report for the Higher Education Foundation Council for England (HEFCE) on ‘Modern Foreign Languages provision in higher education in England’ are: (i) that the field is characterised by a set of persistent uncertainties regarding its present and future; and (ii) that the anxiogenic effects of this unstable context risk becoming detrimental to the sustainability of this essential area of academic activity and enquiry. Modern languages is often seen as divided between, on the one hand, the nurturing of linguistic proficiency among a broad range of students, and, on the other, the development of<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjkzw">French Studies in and for the 21st Century</a><br>
  Author(s) Wygant Amy<br>
  Abstract: This chapter seeks to explore the notion that the study of French in the UK today is framed by a series of historical assumptions about the nature of the French language, and about the implications of speaking French for those of us who are British-based. In this perspective, much of what we observe today in our university French departments may have deep-set historical roots. In the
                  longue duréeof French in the UK, the language has been represented, this chapter argues, as essentially feminine, and as alien to an English national identity constructed as masculine. A specifically English view about<br>

  Author(s) Burgwinkle William<br>
  Abstract: ‘Where are French Studies going in this era of financial constraints and cut-backs?’ This is a question that is posed repeatedly in the media as the bad news about budget cuts and falling enrolments filter out from schools and universities around the UK. Our first response is to shout out to anyone who is listening that of course university language courses are useful, necessary and enriching and that of course we should be encouraging students to pursue them in ever larger numbers. Governmental decisions in the past decade have ensured that our numbers are dropping – confirming what all the<br>

  12  French Linguistics Research and Teaching in UK and Irish HE Institutions from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjkzw">French Studies in and for the 21st Century</a><br>
  Author(s) Myles Florence<br>
  Abstract: The research and teaching of French linguistics in UK higher education (HE) institutions have a venerable history; a number of universities have traditionally offered philology or history of the language courses, which complement literary study. A deeper understanding of the way that the phonology, syntax and semantics of the French language have evolved gives students linguistic insights that dovetail with their study of the
                  Roman de Renart, Rabelais, Racine or thenouveau roman. There was, in the past, some coverage of contemporary French phonetics but little on sociolinguistic issues. More recently, new areas of research and teaching have been developed,<br>

  Author(s) Rothwell Andrew<br>
  Abstract: As is now widely recognised, translation has played a major role at key historical periods in the development of national cultures and vernacular languages across Europe, with France being no exception. The terms
                  traductionandtraducteurwere introduced into French in the sixteenth century by Etienne Dolet (1509–46), a humanist and translator regarded as the first translation theorist (and infamously burnt at the stake for a doctrinally deviant ‘mistranslation’ of Plato). Translation in the Renaissance, a preoccupation of the Pléiade poets as it was of Montaigne, served both to make Classical works available to a wider audience and to<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjkzw">French Studies in and for the 21st Century</a><br>
  Author(s) Chafer Tony<br>
  Abstract: In the 1970s, staff in the School of Languages and Area Studies (SLAS) at Portsmouth Polytechnic (as it was then) decided to develop a new type of language degree. At that time, the traditional model was the ‘lang and lit’ degree programme. Students who wanted to study languages were more or less obliged to combine the study of their chosen language(s) with the study of (mostly) the literary classics of that country. There were a few exceptions: York University, for example, offered programmes in language and linguistics, Salford and Bath specialised in translation, while Aston offered students the opportunity to<br>

  Author(s) Murphy David<br>
  Abstract: Over the past two decades, we have witnessed what Françoise Lionnet has termed the ‘becoming-transnational’ of French Studies.¹ French and the other modern languages had originally been constructed as academic subjects around the framework of the nineteenth-century European nation-state but, as the primacy of the nation state has come to be challenged in the era of globalisation, this structure has been increasingly questioned by scholars working from transnational, global and postcolonial perspectives.² The prominent North American critic Lawrence Kritzman has been prompted to ask, in light of these developments, whether the very existence of French Studies is now in question:<br>

  Author(s) Vialleton Elodie<br>
  Abstract: At the Open University, French is taught by the largest but least conventional department of languages in the UK. Numbers of language students are now approaching 10,000 a year, which translates into over 3,000 full-time equivalent student (FTEs) numbers. In terms of recruitment, whether actual students or FTEs, the Open University is also the largest French department in the UK. This chapter describes our distinctive and innovative approach to teaching French, and our related research activities. It opens by setting language learning in the context of supported distance education, and concludes by proposing wider inter-university collaboration in the context of<br>

  Abstract: Blended learning, a mix of face-to-face and virtual interactions, and online courses have been developed at the Modern Language Centre (MLC) at King’s since 2004. They are a key component of the department’s strategy for fostering autonomous learning both within credit-bearing language courses, and for students enrolled on non degree-language programmes, while adhering to Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) criteria and promoting academic excellence. Incorporating an e-learning dimension into existing face-to-face programmes, and designing specific online material and courses has been a deliberate policy choice, both in support of the college’s own strategic plan, and in the desire to enhance the<br>

  Abstract: The Association for the Study of Modern and Contemporary France (ASMCF) sees its contribution to promoting knowledge of France mainly, but not exclusively, through the area studies approach, which is broadly the study of the country including its political system, history, geography and general culture integrated with its language. That area studies is now a key term alongside languages and culture in the definition of French Studies is testimony to the achievements of the ASMCF and recognition of its place in the research and teaching of French.² The ASMCF has the largest membership of all the area studies associations in<br>

  Book Title: V. Y. Mudimbe-Undisciplined Africanism<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): FRAITURE PIERRE-PHILIPPE<br>
  Abstract: VY Mudimbe: Undisciplined Africanism is the first English-language monograph dedicated to the work of Valentin Yves Mudimbe. This book charts the intellectual history of the seminal Congolese philosopher, epistemologist, and philologist from the late 1960s to the present day, exploring his major essays and novels. Pierre-Philippe Fraiture highlights Mudimbe’s trajectory through major debates on African nationalism, Panafricanism, neo-colonialism, negritude, pedagogy, Christianisation, decolonisation, anthropology, postcolonial representations, and a variety of other subjects, using these as contexts for close readings of many of Mudimbe’s texts, both influential and lesser-known. The book demonstrates that Mudimbe’s intellectual career has been informed by a series of decisive dialogues with some of the key exponents of Africanism (Herodotus, EW Blyden, Placide Tempels), continental and postcolonial thought (Jean-Paul Sartre, Frantz Fanon, Michel Foucault, and Claude Lévi-Strauss), and African thought and philosophy from Africa and the diaspora (L.S.

The essays in this volume, written by friends and colleagues who have drawn inspiration from and shown interest in the scholarship of David Clines, engage with his work through examining interpretations of the Hebrew Bible in areas of common exploration: literary/exegetical readings, ideological-critical readings, language and lexicography, and reception history.

  Author(s) Kissling Paul J.<br>
  Abstract: Although most traditional scholarship, situated as it has been in militaristic societies, describes the battles depicted in Joshua as a “conquest,” in fact the two major phases of that “conquest” are self-defense, first against an attack by a coalition of kings from the south of Canaan against the Gibeonites, who had recently joined Israel, and then defense against an attack on all of Israel by a coalition of kings from the north.

  The Invention of Language in the Poetry of Job from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjz47">Interested Readers</a><br>
  Author(s) Greenstein Edward L.<br>
  Abstract: The book of Job, particularly its poetic core, appears to contain more unique words and linguistic usages than any comparable work from the ancient Near East. The distinctive language of Job has been attributed to a number of literary factors. For one thing, the characters and events are set in a much earlier, legendary period—the time of the patriarchs.¹ Not only does Job enjoy a lifestyle that is reminiscent of the rural, sheep-and-goat-herding Hebrew patriarchs, but the description of Job and his situation in the narrative framework of the book features language and allusions to the stories of Genesis.²<br>

  Author(s) Joosten Jan<br>
  Abstract: In an influential article published in 1974, Avi Hurvitz showed that the language of the prose tale of Job has several features aligning it with the Late Biblical Hebrew (LBH) known from Persian-period writings such as Chronicles, Ezra–Nehemiah, Esther, Ecclesiastes, and Daniel.¹ Since the book of Job, a fictional story addressing universal human problems, is otherwise hard to date, the contribution of historical linguistics was much appreciated by commentators.² More recently, however, Ian Young has argued that Hurvitz did not make a decisive argument for the lateness of the prose tale of Job.³ Part of Young’s argument is hard<br>

  Abstract: Biblical scholars in general are well provided with lexicographical resources—not least among them now the
                  Dictionary of Classical Hebrew, edited by David Clines. The inclusion by this work of new words and meanings found only in Ben Sira and the Qumran texts has been especially helpful for those of us working on late biblical materials, and students of Ecclesiastes, in particular, have had the benefit also in recent years of Antoon Schoors’s magisterial work on the language of Qoheleth, the second volume of which is devoted to a consideration of the book’s vocabulary.¹ There are many words in Ecclesiastes,<br>

  Patterns of Linguistic Forms in the Masoretic Text: from:

  Author(s) Young Ian<br>
  Abstract: All scholars agree that there is linguistic variety in the Hebrew Bible. The dominant explanation of the distribution of linguistic forms in the Masoretic Text (MT) of the Hebrew Bible in modern scholarship has been in terms of a simple equation between the language of the MT and the language of the “original author” of the text in question. Current scholarship on the textual transmission of the Hebrew Bible, however, makes this explanation only one out of several—and not one of the more likely ones.<br>

  Author(s) Machamer Peter<br>
  Abstract: One of the chief characteristics of contemporary philosophy of mind consists in the orientation toward the sciences of the mind. This feature stands in marked contrast to traditional philosophy of mind whose primary allegiance was to philosophy of language. Linguistic analysis was supposed to clarify what could sensibly be meant by the ascription of mental states. The issue was what sort of talk about the mental has a clear meaning and what, by contrast, is to be considered meaningless. This type of philosophical approach to the mind has now gone out of fashion. It was replaced by a science-based approach<br>

  Author(s) Gärdenfors Peter<br>
  Abstract: A very general answer, that I think everybody can agree on, to the question of what a semantics is, is that it specifies a relation between linguistic expressions and the referents of the expressions. But soon afterwards, opinions diverge. There is, in particular, no agreement on what kind of entities the meanings of various words are. Some say that the referents of language are things in the world, some say they are things, but maybe not in this world, and some say they are mental constructions without any posit that these constructions coalesce with reality.<br>

That is, whatever the next quarter-century might bring, from this point on, Brodsky himself would not change. He would simply become more accomplished in his own idiom; the language in which he spoke of his own universe would become increasingly more precise and sophisticated. This maturity manifested itself in the clarity with which he spoke of the world, of faith, of people, of society. This was true even of his seemingly contradictory views on Christianity<br>

                  loveand representation” may compare poorly with life itself, but that keeps neither Levin nor Tolstoy from repeatedly trying similar philosophies. Tolstoy was never convinced of his power to communicate his ideas in and through language; he often doubted the ability of literature to break through barriers of social isolation; and he used motifs of romantic betrayal, infidelity, trust, and reconciliation to test the<br>

  Abstract: For Tolstoy, love provides one with special abilities to speak and be understood, and in descriptions of love we find his most startling examples of communication. Contrariwise, the loss of love, the emergence of suspicion, infidelity, and betrayal, all take a terrible toll on communication. A jealous husband in Tolstoy’s world has a difficult time communicating with his wife. Of course, that is nothing extraordinary to anyone who has ever been in love—groundless, or even well-grounded, suspicions somehow interfere with intimate conversations. Something more significant is at stake, however: the tenuous bond in Tolstoy’s fiction between thought and language,<br>

  Book Title: Captured by Evil-The Idea of Corruption in Law<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): UNDERKUFFLER LAURA S.<br>
  Abstract: One of the most powerful words in the English language, "corruption" is also one of the most troubled concepts in law. According to Laura Underkuffler, it is a concept based on religiously revealed ideas of good and evil. But the notion of corruption defies the ordinary categories by which law defines crimes-categories that punish acts, not character, and that eschew punishment on the basis of religion and emotion. Drawing on contemporary examples-including former assemblywoman Diane Gordon and former governor Rod Blagojevich-Underkuffler explores the implications and dangers of maintaining such an archaic concept at the heart of criminal law.<br>

  INTRODUCTION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vm38s">Captured by Evil</a><br>
  Abstract: ʺCorruptionʺ is one of the most powerful words in the English language. When (for instance) we think of corruption of food, human bodies, or other physical objects, we think of something that is fundamentally or revoltingly altered, impure, rotten, or worse. When we think of corruption in government—the subject of this book—the impact of this word is equally powerful. Charges of corruption in public life have condemned men, destroyed the lives of women, and accelerated the decline and fall of governments. Corruption is something that human beings instinctively loathe, and that<br>

  Book Title: Symbolic Forms and Cultural Studies-Ernst Cassirer’s Theory of Culture<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): KROIS JOHN MICHAEL<br>
  Abstract: Cassirer thought of culture anthropologically as the entire complex of human modes of meaning and existence: it encompassed science, technology, language, and social life in addition to art, religion, and philosophy. This conception of culture and Cassirer's theory of symbolism anticipated much of later cultural theory. In this collection of essays, eminent Cassirer scholars examine the many different aspects of his thinking on this subject and demonstrate how pioneering and important it is to cultural studies.<br>

  Abstract: Since all the cultural materials discussed in this book are resolutely Occidental, I should perhaps say something about how I’ve tried to engage with the global issues facing anyone interested in these things. For my argument holds that digital technology has realized the idea of a new Library of Alexandria. That institution’s dark reciprocal, however, is the global character of the threat to memory, epitomized in the crisis of our languages. Linguists expect that by the end of this century some half of the 7,000 currently recognized languages will be extinct. In a narrow Western view, those losses occur at<br>

Literary multiplicity is widespread and, according to the Russian narrative theorist Mikhail Bakhtin, it derives from the multiplicity endemic to all language, which describes a world that is “overlain with qualifications, open to dispute, charged with value, already enveloped in an obscuring mist—or, on the contrary, by the ‘light’ of alien<br>

  Abstract: In 2001 I defined Israelite religions as “the varied, symbolic expressions of, and appropriate responses to the deities and powers that groups or communities deliberately affirmed as being of unrestricted value to them within their worldview.”¹ In this definition, I expressed my assumption that religion, like culture in general, is formed, formulated, and expressed through organized groups of people. Both are expressed semiotically and mediated through external realities such as spoken and written language, arts, and ritual. Though some elements of both culture and religion are private and subjective, most are public and objective. In the Ancient Near East, as<br>

  Abstract: The theory and method informing this study can best be described as a dialectical mediation between dissimilar cultural genres and between antagonistic scholarly traditions. The critical dialectic of sentimental postmodernism allows me to illuminate theoretical biases and blind spots in scholarship concerning both postmodernism and popular affective genres. While many theorists of postmodern culture pay lip service to the idea that postmodernism breaks down the division between high and popular culture, most of their exemplary texts are nonetheless high art or avant-garde works. Focusing on irony, self-reflexivity, avant-garde aesthetics, and poststructuralist ideas about language, many of these critics draw a<br>

  Author(s) Tihanov Galin<br>
  Abstract: Gustav Gustavovich Shpet (1879-1937) has emerged as one of the most prominent Russian philosophers of the twentieth century. The principle promoter of Husserlian phenomenology, at the same time creatively modifying Husserl and at times departing from him, Shpet was also an early advocate of hermeneutics. He left behind seminal work spanning philosophy, aesthetics, psychology, literary and theater theory, and the history of Russian thought. Significantly, many of his concerns anticipate preoccupations that have dominated the discourses of cultural theory and the philosophy of language over the last few decades.<br>

  Abstract: Gustav Shpet was one of a number of Husserl's disciples who took some of phenomenology's central principles and applied them to language theory and aesthetics. Much of the value of Shpet's contribution to philosophy derives from his introduction of phenomenology into his own country. But even though he knowingly proposed certain significant modifications to Husserl's thought, an examination of some of his major writings on language and aesthetics leads one to suspect that Shpet, apparently without knowing it, gave his own slant to those parts that he thought he was merely interpreting and passing on.

  Abstract: The works of Gustav Shpet and the Bakhtin Circle (most notably Mikhail Bakhtin and Valentin Voloshinov) represent two of the most important episodes in the Russian reception of the so-called linguistic turn in philosophy. Each recognized the paucity of systematized thought in Russian philosophy of the period and was dissatisfied with the intuitive, even mystical manner with which language was understood. While nineteenth-century Russian philology reached considerable heights, philosophical reflections on language had developed largely within the bounds of Orthodox theology and this continued to shape the spirit of secular debates on language in the twentieth century and to endow<br>

  Abstract: The conceptual foundations of Gustav Shpet's general semasiology and Valentin Voloshinov's principle of dialogic speech interaction have rarely been considered from a comparative perspective. This article purports to draw critical attention to the partly convergent, partly divergent trajectories that these two thinkers followed in their approach to language. Whereas the two methodologies and discursive practices may not appear commensurable on the surface, there emerge beneath important philosophical convergences between Shpet and Voloshinov. Notwithstanding the fact that the two thinkers developed their views on language in different directions, coextensive philosophical concerns and common intellectual backgrounds provide a certain justification for a<br>

  Book Title: Great Fool-Zen Master Ryokan--Poems, Letters, and Other Writings<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): HASKEL PETER<br>
  Abstract: Taigu Ryokan (1759-1831) remains one of the most popular figures in Japanese Buddhist history. Despite his religious and artistic sophistication, Ryokan referred to himself as "Great Fool" and refused to place himself within the cultural elite of his age. In contrast to the typical Zen master of his time, who presided over a large monastery, trained students, and produced recondite religious treatises, Ryokan followed a life of mendicancy in the countryside. Instead of delivering sermons, he expressed himself through kanshi (poems composed in classical Chinese) and waka and could typically be found playing with the village children in the course of his daily rounds of begging. Great Fool is the first study in a Western language to offer a comprehensive picture of the legendary poet-monk and his oeuvre. It includes not only an extensive collection of the master's kanshi, topically arranged to facilitate an appreciation of Ryokan's colorful world, but selections of his waka, essays, and letters. The volume also presents for the first time in English the Ryokan zenji kiwa (Curious Accounts of the Zen Master Ryokan), a firsthand source composed by a former student less than sixteen years after Ryokan's death. Although it lacks chronological order, the Curious Account is invaluable for showing how Ryokan was understood and remembered by his contemporaries. It consists of colorful anecdotes and episodes, sketches from Ryokan's everyday life.<br>

  Book Title: The Melodrama of Mobility-Women, Talk, and Class in Contemporary South Korea<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): ABELMANN NANCY<br>
  Abstract: How do people make sense of their world in the face of the breakneck speed of contemporary social change? Through the lives and narratives of eight women, The Melodrama of Mobility chronicles South Korea's experience of just such dizzyingly rapid development. Abelmann captures the mood, feeling, and language of a generation and an era while providing a rare window on the personal and social struggles of South Korean modernity. Drawing also from television soap operas and films, she argues that a melodramatic sensibility speaks to South Korea's transformation because it preserves the tension and ambivalence of daily life in unsettled times. The melodramatic mode helps people to wonder: Can individuals be blamed for their social fates? How should we live? Who can say who is good or bad? By combining the ethnographic tools of anthropology, an engagement with prevailing sociological questions, and a literary approach to personal narratives, The Melodrama of Mobility offers a rich portrait of the experience of compressed modernity in the non-West.<br>

  Book Title: Dark Writing-Geography, Performance, Design<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Carter Paul<br>
  Abstract: We do not see empty figures and outlines; we do not move in straight lines. Everywhere we are surrounded by dapple; the geometry of our embodied lives is curviform, meandering, bi-pedal. Our personal worlds are timed, inter-positional, and contingent. But nowhere in the language of cartography and design do these ordinary experiences appear. This, Dark Writing argues, is a serious omission because they are designs on the world: architects and colonizers use their lines to construct the places where we will live. But the rectilinear streets, squares, and public spaces produced in this way leave out people and the entire environmental history of their coming together. How, this book asks, can we explain the omission of bodies from maps and plans? And how can we redraw the lines maps and plans use so that the qualitative world of shadows, footprints, comings and goings, and occasions—all essential qualities of places that incubate sociality—can be registered? In short, Dark Writing asks why we represent the world as static when our experience of it is mobile. It traces this bias in Enlightenment cartography, in inductive logic, and in contemporary place design. This is the negative critique. Its positive argument is that, when we look closely at these designs on the world, we find traces of a repressed movement form. Even the ideal lines of geometrical figures turn out to contain traces of earlier passages; and there are many forms of graphic design that do engage with the dark environment that surrounds the light of reason. How can this "dark writing"—so important to reconfiguring our world as a place of meeting, of co-existence and sustaining diversity—be represented? And how, therefore, can our representations of the world embody more sensuously the mobile histories that have produced it? Dark Writing answers these questions using case studies: the exemplary case of the beginnings of the now world-famous Papunya Tula Painting Movement (Central Australia) and three high-profile public place-making initiatives in which the author was involved as artist and thinker. These case studies are nested inside historical chapters and philosophical discussions of the line and linear thinking that make Dark Writing both a highly personal book and a narrative with wide general appeal.<br>

  Abstract: Crop failure and famine have a long history in Japan. Yet the topic has received virtually no attention in English-language research on the ancient period, meaning here 670 – 1100, nor have Japanese historians specializing in those years systematically analyzed it. This chapter will address three basic and seminal questions about food shortages in that era. First, how frequent and severe were they? The story of these crises in the early modern or Tokugawa period (1600 – 1868) is well-known, and many believe that they had widespread demographic, social, and political effects.¹ Can the same be said for the ancient period?

  Book Title: The Hermes Complex-Philosophical Reflections on Translation<br>
  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>
  Author(s): Folkart Barbara<br>
  Abstract: When Hermes handed over to Apollo his finest invention, the lyre, in exchange for promotion to the status of messenger of the gods, he relinquished the creativity that gave life to his words.The trade-off proved frustrating: Hermes chafed under the obligation to deliver the ideas and words of others and resorted to all manner of ruses in order to assert his presence in the messages he transmitted. His theorizing descendants, too, allow their pretentions to creatorship to interfere with the actual business of reinventing originals in another language.Just as the Hermes of old delighted in leading the traveller astray, so his descendants lead their acolytes, through thickets of jargon, into labyrinths of eloquence without substance.Charles Le Blanc possesses the philosophical tools to dismantle this empty eloquence: he exposes the inconsistencies, internal contradictions, misreadings, and misunderstandings rife in so much of the current academic discourse en translation, and traces the failings of this discourse back to its roots in the anguish of having traded authentic creativity for mere status.<br>

  Abstract: The abuse of language has spawned innumerable errors, and the pronouncements of celebrated philosophers are all too often the product of verbal incontinence. Systematic recourse to inflated language is invariably detrimental to the ideas to be conveyed. The speaker or writer who uses the word “sincerity” at the drop of a hat is likely to be suspected of being less than sincere: the indiscriminate use of words dulls their edge. Words are cheapened through overuse; like everything else that is beautiful and rare, they gain value when held in reserve. The wise man hoards his words, rather than spending them<br>

Everwine writes with the same 'deified heart' that divines the mystery of his quotidian subjects in a language that is at once plain and poetic.

  Abstract: The Russian theorist Mikhail Bakhtin (1895–1975) provides a valuable set of tools for ecocritical analysis and a method of approaching literary works and their interrelationship with the material world. Bakhtin’s attitude toward language positions him in opposition to Ferdinand de Saussure and Saussurean linguistics. Instead, he can be aligned with his contemporary, Émile Benveniste, as well as current linguists such as George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, who have emphasized discourse over language. This emphasis leads to seeing speaking and writing as individual acts undertaken at particular moments in specific configurations of the world. That recognition of immersion leads to<br>

  Author(s): Struck Peter T.<br>
  Abstract: The book notes that Aristotle and his followers did not discuss the use of poetic symbolism. Rather, a different group of Greek thinkers--the allegorists--were the first to develop the notion. Struck extensively revisits the work of the great allegorists, which has been underappreciated. He links their interest in symbolism to the importance of divination and magic in ancient times, and he demonstrates how important symbolism became when they thought about religion and philosophy. "They see the whole of great poetic language as deeply figurative," he writes, "with the potential always, even in the most mundane details, to be freighted with hidden messages."<br>

  10  ROMANTICISM: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rmc2">Essays on Giordano Bruno</a><br>
  Abstract: On september 16, 1798, two young poets left England for Germany. Only a few days previously, they had published together a small volume of verses destined to change the course of English literature: the
                     Lyrical Ballads.However, the implications of these poems, which proposed a reevaluation of the life of the sentiments and the spirit of the individual in forceful and unadorned language, had not yet been fully appreciated. Both their departure from England and their arrival in Germany went almost unnoticed.<br>

  15  BRUNO AND METAPHOR from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rmc2">Essays on Giordano Bruno</a><br>
  Abstract: Giordano bruno was born only five years after the first publication of Copernicus’s
                  De revolutionibusin 1543, and only thirty-odd years after Martin Luther’s excommunication from the Catholic Church had divided Europe and its culture into two militantly hostile factions. Bruno’s lifetime in the second half of the sixteenth century thus covers a vital if often turbulent moment of cultural transition, which would radically affect the history of both science and the humanities. This chapter will primarily be concerned with his thinking about language, and especially with his thoughts about metaphor, thus aligning itself with an interpretative model of early<br>

  Book Title: A Theory of the Trial-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burns Robert P.<br>
  Abstract: Anyone who has sat on a jury or followed a high-profile trial on television usually comes to the realization that a trial, particularly a criminal trial, is really a performance. Verdicts seem determined as much by which lawyer can best connect with the hearts and minds of the jurors as by what the evidence might suggest. In this celebration of the American trial as a great cultural achievement, Robert Burns, a trial lawyer and a trained philosopher, explores how these legal proceedings bring about justice. The trial, he reminds us, is not confined to the impartial application of legal rules to factual findings. Burns depicts the trial as an institution employing its own language and styles of performance that elevate the understanding of decision-makers, bringing them in contact with moral sources beyond the limits of law.<br>

  Abstract: How can one grasp the nature and impact of Brahms’s musical language and communication in his own time? In the first instance one has to guard against an uncritical sense of the stability of musical texts, their meaning, and how they can be read and heard. The acoustic, cultural, and temporal habits of life of the late nineteenth century in which Brahms’s music functioned demand reconsideration if the listener in the early twentyfirst century wishes to gain a historical perspective on Brahms’s music and its significance. A biographical strategy and the history of critical reception themselves are insufficient.<br>

  Book Title: Writing Outside the Nation-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): SEYHAN AZADE<br>
  Abstract: Some of the most innovative writers of contemporary literature are writing in diaspora in their second or third language. Here Azade Seyhan describes the domain of transnational poetics they inhabit. She begins by examining the works of selected bilingual and bicultural writers of the United States (including Oscar Hijuelos, Maxine Hong Kingston, and Eva Hoffman) and Germany (Libuse Moníková, Rafik Schami, and E. S. Özdamar, among others), developing a new framework for understanding the relationship between displacement, memory, and language. Considering themes of loss, witness, translation, identity, and exclusion, Seyhan interprets diasporic literatures as condensed archives of cultural and linguistic memory that give integrity and coherence to pasts ruptured by migration.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7s8h3">Writing Outside the Nation</a><br>
  Abstract: The words of the eighteenth-century German Romantic poet Novalis (Friedrich von Hardenberg) resonate beyond the boundaries of their history and geography and are poignantly rearticulated by a contemporary master of the arts of memory. Salman Rushdie’s critical sentiment stands as a testimony to the labor of remembrance that reclaims the lost experience of another time and place in language and imagination. The work of commemoration is often the only means of releasing our (hi)stories from subjugation to official or institutionalized regimes of forgetting. Remembering is an act of lending coherence and integrity to a history interrupted, divided, or compromised by<br>

This is the problem of immigrants, and especially of their children, the problem of minorities, the problem of a minor literature, but also a problem for all of us: how to tear a minor literature away from its own language, allowing it to challenge the language and making it follow a sober revolutionary path?

  Abstract: Whether removed from the subject by one or more generations, several decades, or a few years, the memory and images of nation continue to inhabit the exilic imagination. The symbolic registers of the nation usually increase proportionately to the length of time spent outside the nation, and the loyalties that bind the “imagined community” (Anderson) diverge into smaller communities bound by gender, class, caste, religion, home region, profession, language, and dialect. The concept of a sacred mythical originary nation, Aztlán, developed at the height of the Chicano movement as a source of identification and identity formation in a diasporic community<br>

  Abstract: MY TITLE intends no metaphor in its linking of language and economy. Words, as social instruments, exemplifying what Marx calls “practical consciousness,”¹ act upon a reality which they make as much as find. If the real is in a real sense made through words, those words needs must tend to complexity, not least because speakers inherit a language always “already occupied”² by prior and unknown users and usage. Since verbal instrumentalists work with a partially known instrument, and in circumstances not of their own design, they, to adapt Marx, are practically unconscious concerning large portions of their practice.

                  recognition,authority, andextended self. It was very much the need for recognition, as noted by philosophers from Adam Ferguson and Adam Smith to G.W.F. Hegel, that formed the basis of what we are calling here the extended, or nonautonomous, self. Ferguson points to this need for approbation in noting that “what comes from a fellow-creature is received with peculiar emotion; and every language abounds with terms that express somewhat in the transactions of men different from success and disappointment.”¹ He continues: “The bosom kindles in company,<br>

  Author(s): MAZUR BARRY<br>
  Abstract: Circles Disturbedbrings together important thinkers in mathematics, history, and philosophy to explore the relationship between mathematics and narrative. The book's title recalls the last words of the great Greek mathematician Archimedes before he was slain by a Roman soldier--"Don't disturb my circles"--words that seem to refer to two radically different concerns: that of the practical person living in the concrete world of reality, and that of the theoretician lost in a world of abstraction. Stories and theorems are, in a sense, the natural languages of these two worlds--stories representing the way we act and interact, and theorems giving us pure thought, distilled from the hustle and bustle of reality. Yet, though the voices of stories and theorems seem totally different, they share profound connections and similarities.<br>

  Book Title: Writing Lovers-Reading Canadian Love Poetry by Women<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Cook Méira<br>
  Abstract: In writings by the French post-structuralists, rhetorical tropes such as speechlessness, fragmentation, and deflection testify to the writer's difficulty in broaching the subject of love. Similarly, Cook shows that love poetry proceeds out of a profound failure of language resulting from the opacity of discourse, its lack of neutrality, or the fugitive transparency of reference. Writing Lovers also explores race, ethnicity, age, and sexual identity within the context of the passionate excesses of amatory discourse.<br>

  1  The Language of Love: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zsk3">Writing Lovers</a><br>
  Abstract: In his essay “On Love,” Adam Phillips observes that since the language of love borrows its referents from the discourses of theology and epistemology, it is at once relentlessly redemptive and insistently enlightening (40). The lover, like the mystic or the paranoiac, is a reader of signs and wonders: all are terrorized and bewitched by an experience that, in the absence of a transcendental signifier, displaces our contemporary version of the sublime. If this comparison is to provide a useful analogy, then it is possible to concede that we have, in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, enshrined literature<br>

  5  Love Letters from an Unmade Bed: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zsk3">Writing Lovers</a><br>
  Abstract: If absence is the first premise of desire, then the love letter is the perfect motive of its expression because it is the form of writing that transforms the beloved’s absence into what Barthes has named “an ordeal of abandonment” through a fugitive episode of language (
                     A Lover’s Discourse13). Intercepted between the two locutions of presence and absence, the lover/writer addresses her beloved, absent to her as object, at the moment that s/he is most available, most impelling as referent.<br>

  6  On the Line: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zsk3">Writing Lovers</a><br>
  Abstract: The narrative of the love story is traditionally structured as an ordeal of abandonment prolonged by the promise of return and resolved through metaphors of seduction, the configurations of language that release the particular from its burden of meaning. Amorous discourse is characterized by the variety of narratives that follow in the wake of this abandonment. As devotees of the genre may observe, the “story” is already over by the time Heloise composes her first passionate epistle to Abelard, or, in a more contemporary example, when the narrator of “The Tennessee Waltz” begins his plaintive hurting song. The romance is<br>

  Chapter Five  THE LANGUAGE OF THE BODY from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zswgw">Gift and Communion</a><br>
  Abstract: The concept of “the language of the body” occupies an important place in John Paul II’s Wednesday catecheses on the theology of the body. Before analyzing this concept in papal thought, it is helpful to examine how it is understood in other fields of knowledge about man, for example in ethnology and psychology. In both of these disciplines, this concept signifies a nonverbal type of communication, which takes place, for example, through gestures, facial expressions, or signs.<br>

  CHAPTER FIVE  The Meta-utopian Language Problem, or Utopia as a Bump on a -log- from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7ztgwq">Russian Experimental Fiction</a><br>
  Abstract: That language and consciousness are intimately bound up with one another is a commonplace. How they interact is harder to ascertain. Post-Saussurian literary theorists claim perhaps too much for the priority of language over consciousness.¹ Philosophers concerned with this issue, such as Nietzsche or Wittgenstein, also acknowledge the impact of language on consciousness but stress the restrictions that linguistic structures and functions put on thinking. For example, in
                  Tractatus Logico-PhilosophicusWittgenstein writes: “The limits of my languagemean the limits of my world.”² Perhaps these restrictions are best characterized by tautology, the ultimate, absurd limit of language, an indication of<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7ztgwq">Russian Experimental Fiction</a><br>
  Abstract: Meta-utopian fiction written since 1987 is, as might be expected, more radically reductive than its forebears, finding naked coercion behind all but the most locally defined ideologies. It exposes a similar matrix of responses as the critical discussion about utopia. On the one hand, it harbors the same fear of the abyss as the only real alternative to stable, if oppressive, order, while, on the other, it is strongly concerned with reopening language to untried possibility, with reexamining deep social scripts, and with probing automatized readerly expectations.

Born in isolation, Russian meta-utopian fiction is certainly not an isolated phenomenon. It parallels the renewed attention to language, semiotic play, and narrative structure that has figured so importantly in the West in opening up new insight into ideological structures. Its challenge to maximalist, bipolar thinking and its argument for the middle ground makes meta-utopian fiction very much of a piece with current social, literary, and philosophical discourse.

  Author(s) Beatty John<br>
  Abstract: There is a wealth of secondary literature on Darwin’s species concept, covering many different perspectives of the topic.¹ Of the various accounts available, I have always been particularly intrigued by Frank Sulloway’s suggestion that Darwin’s choice of species concept was guided by “tactical” considerations. Among those tactical considerations was the decision to employ his fellow naturalists’ species concept, in order to speak to them “in their own language” (Sulloway 1979, p. 37). Implicit in the suggestion is that Darwin was a member of a fairly clear-cut community of naturalists. In order to communicate with them about natural history, either to<br>

  3  Brotherhood from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7ztzd7">The Social Vision of William Blake</a><br>
  Abstract: Two metaphors govern nearly all of Blake’s formulations of social life: brotherhood and membership. Membership in a body is one of the most ancient images by which individuals have tried to grasp a sense of belonging to a group, and in various forms it is a central analogy in classical, Christian, and modern political thought. Brotherhood is probably an equally ancient notion—certainly brotherhoods are found in many traditional societies—but while the language of fraternity persists into our day, the idea has attracted only occasional scrutiny by Christian thinkers and virtually none by secular theorists.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zv3n">Contemporary Majority Nationalism</a><br>
  Author(s) NOOTENS GENEVIÈVE<br>
  Abstract: In liberal democratic societies, nationalism has long been associated with minorities and opposition to the state. The phenomenon has indeed often manifested itself most visibly in challenges to the central state. The nationalism projected by states, to the contrary, has either remained relatively hidden or has been granted a legitimacy denied to minority nationalist movements. For example, it typically goes without saying from the perspective of states that they may choose an official language for the public sphere and that this choice is therefore obfuscated as a meaningful expression of nationalism. The legitimacy of a similar choice by minority nations,<br>

  Book Title: The Skeptic Disposition-Deconstruction, Ideology, and Other Matters<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Goodheart Eugene<br>
  Abstract: Eugene Goodheart examines the skeptic disposition that has informed advanced literary discourse over the past generation, arguing that the targets of deconstructive suspicion are fundamental humanistic values. "[This book] is a fair-minded, generous critique of the deconstructionist theories of Jacques Derrida, Paul de Man, and their followers. These writers have argued that language is so inherently slippery it can never express a speaker's intended meaning. The critic's role, in their view, is to explore the contradictions, subtexts, and metaphorical byways of works that may be most radically deceptive when they appear simple. Critics have castigated this language-centered skepticism as a form of nihilism geared to multiply numbingly similar readings of already familiar texts. Mr. Goodheart's objection is more subtle. He suggests that the philosophical orientation of deconstructive critics leads them to overemphasize the tricky propositional sense of words at the expense of the broader impact of literature--its power to wound, thrill, or transform us."--Morris Dickstein, The New York Times Book Review<br>

  Abstract: The deconstructive view that language, because of its figural deviousness, never coincides with meaning is not unprecedented. The ambition of science to realize itself in the notations of mathematics reflects a suspicion of the treacherous ambiguities of language dating from the seventeenth century. Exponents of the power of poetry have always made a virtue of the equivocations of its language. Meaning is a portentous term against which the literary sensibility has always had a certain prejudice. It connotes gravity and immobility, conditions inimical to imaginative freedom.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zv52h">Shakespeare and the Dramaturgy of Power</a><br>
  Abstract: The difference between Shakespeare’s early romantic comedies and his late romances can be understood, to a very considerable extent, as a difference in the ruling taste. The static dramaturgy and rhetorical virtuosity of
                  Love’s Labors Lostare a response to the fashion created by John Lyly, whose linguistic preciosity, in turn, sums up the Tudor endorsement of literacy as an innovative sign of social privilege. Evidence of a similar preoccupation with language appears in the mature romantic comedies as well, particularlyAs You Like It and Much Ado about Nothing.

  Abstract: Not all silences in the text were due to the author’s intent. Some were imposed by the deficiencies of the medium of language. The Kingdom of God and women were subjects to be included or excluded by choice. Time represents quite another category of omissions that existed by necessity. Yet, that necessity did not exist because, by thinking of events under the aspect of turning wheels—the Wheel of Fortune or Ezekiel’s concentric wheels of prophecy and fulfillment, advancing as they spun—authors negated time. Instead, the necessity existed because those metaphors, and similar ones, expressed assumptions about time and<br>

  Abstract: Life requires us to make judgments. John Dewey calls those choices to act that affect others “public” judgments.¹ How can we evaluate such public judgments? We are free to use the scale of bad, good, better, best—but this language seems more suited to judgments of exclusively personal interest, where benefits and disadvantages are simpler to weigh. For public matters a scale based on “just” suits better than one based on “good,” for justice connotes the distribution of good(s) across the commonwealth.

  Author(s) KERNAN ALVIN<br>
  Abstract: Institutionally, in the standard academic table of organization, the university catalogue—the knowledge tree of contemporary western culture—the humanities are the subjects regularly listed under that heading: literature, philosophy, art history, music, religion, languages, and sometimes history. This branch of knowledge is separated from the branch of the social sciences and from the branch of the biological and physical sciences. These three branches together form the arts and sciences, or the liberal arts, as they are sometimes known, which are as a group separated in turn from the professional disciplines—such as medicine, education, business, and law—which, at<br>

  CHAPTER FOUR  THE LANGUAGE OF THE TRIBE from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvgsp">The Tale of the Tribe</a><br>
  Abstract: “The narrative is . . . to be regarded not as an end in itself but as a vehicle for transmitting the material of the tribal encyclopedia which is . . . dispersed into a thousand narrative contexts.”³ Thus Eric Havelock describes the Homeric epics. Pound, too, was attempting to write a tribal encyclopedia, one adequate to the the needs of his own day, and thus, of necessity, incorporating far more, and often quite different kinds of, material than sufficed for the Homeric age. Pound had far too sure a grasp of language to think any poem could literally be<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvgsp">The Tale of the Tribe</a><br>
  Abstract: Thus, in 1886 Stéphane Mallarmé sought to locate the
                     minimumprecondition for the creation of literature, the unbridgeable chasm which divides two essentially incompatible deployments of language. Yet the very need to insist upon so categorical a disjunction reveals that contamination is always possible, that the chasm may prove only a threshold, a shifting margin habitually traversed by the discourse of any text. There is a sense in which the poetics Mallarmé sought was haunted at its very inception by what it would most deny, by the inherent availability of language to the public rhetoric of “les journaux.”<br>

  Abstract: In the long history of Western scholarly commentary on Bal1, the phenomena of language and literary arts have never been overlooked, indeed, in some of the earliest general accounts, such as those by Crawfurd (1820) and Fnedench (1876-1878), the possible origins and observed transmission of literary languages and manuscripts were discussed at length Subsequent generations of researchers, including van der Tuuk, Gons, and Hooykaas among the most prominent, have continued to labor in the fields of lexicography, epigraphy, and textual studies, these and many other scholars have contributed the collections of manuscripts, translations, and critical editions that form the basis<br>

  Abstract: Language, even though a universal human attribute, may not always possess universal significance across cultures. That is to say, different language groups may view the place of language in the world, and in human experience, in different ways Beliefs about language in turn reflect as well as shape the techniques a culture uses for processing and communicating knowledge. The Balinese manifest complex beliefs about language consistent with their elaborate material and ritual culture, m surveying these beliefs we are brought into contact with an equally ornate system of metaphysical interpretations. These interpretations have important bearing on vocal traditions, literary forms,<br>

  Abstract: In describing the characteristics of the discourse of Balinese shadow theater, I have drawn on diverse information bearing on language in its cultural context. “Noetic” is a term for those aspects of language form and function that indicate how culturally valued information is shaped, stored, retrieved, and communicated. In Bali, the media of the voice and the written word are shaped in unique ways to produce creations of verbal art such as the wayang.<br>

Strawson had achieved fame, like Frege earlier and Kripke later, by writing about reference. In “On Referring” (1950a) he criticized Russell's theory of definite descriptions and claimed that at least some uses of expressions of the form “TheF” are devices reference rather than a form of general quantification.¹ He moved from this to consider the question of the general relation between ordinary language formal logic, in his first<br>

  Abstract: Kripke first became known for technical work on modal logic, the logic of necessity and possibility, much of it done in the late 1950s as a high-school student, and summarized in Kripke (1963). (Among other things this work popularized a revival of the picturesque Leibnizian language according to which necessity is truth in all possible worlds.) Under the influence of Kripke's later work philosophers have come to distinguish several conceptions of necessity and possibility, in a manner to be described below; but Kripke’s early technical work was not tied to any special conception.

  Author(s) Clark Peter<br>
  Abstract: In the late 1970s and early 1980s Hilary Putnam produced a major sequence philosophical works all directed at criticism of a certain view of the relation between language and reality. Two of the most salient of those works were
                  Reason, Truth and History(1981; hereafterRTH) andMeaning and the Moral Sciences(1978). Both works were independently philosophicaltours de forceand both were enormously influential, producing a huge secondary literature.

  Abstract: The notion of a possible world is familiar from Leibniz's philosophy, especially the idea - parodied by Voltaire in
                  Candide- that the world we inhabit, theactualworld, is the best of all possible worlds. But it was primarily in the latter half of the twentieth century that possible worlds became a mainstay of philosophical theorizing. In areas as diverse as philosophy of language, philosophy of science, epistemology, logic, ethics and, of course, metaphysics itself, philosophers helped themselves to possible worlds in order to provide analyses of key concepts from their respective domains.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zw0q">Existentialist Thinkers and Ethics</a><br>
  Author(s) DESROCHES DOMINIC<br>
  Abstract: In his existential topology (aesthetic, ethical, and religious), Kierkegaard conceives of ethics as “universal” (
                  det Almene), that is to say, a sphere marked by language, where norms are universally valid. Indeed, in this scheme of the spheres of existence, Kierkegaard always conceives of ethics in its dialectical relationship with the aesthetic and religious spheres. Ethics is a transitory sphere (Gjennemgangssphære), as it is intermediate in the topology. This topology is first expressed inEither/Or, where, in the second part of the volume, Judge William writes two long letters addressed toA, the young defender of the aesthetic of the first<br>

  Abstract: Religious crises, political upheaval and decentralization, economic changes, social and scientific discoveries, and print-capitalism contributed to the development of a national consciousness and the formation of a social dynamic based on boundary-oriented and horizontal communities in Western Europe during the Renaissance.¹ The restructuring of the centripetally and hierarchically organized state accompanying the development of the new imagined community challenged the reign of the dominant language that provided “privileged access to onto logical truth” (Anderson 40).

  Abstract: As a symbol for England traditionally reserved for celebratory purposes, the edenic garden was lost to the nation’s tragic history. Seventeenth-century writers, notably Andrew Marvell and Milton, appropriated and, more specifically, feminized Eden to represent the defeat of the nation in terms of the desecration of paradise.¹ The feminized garden is the site of political strife and cultural tensions; its openness and unruliness make it especially susceptible to exploitation.² “

  Section 1  Being Too Great for Words from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt80283">Distant Relation</a><br>
  Abstract: Common conceptions of the ineffable place it at the border between what language is capable of representing and what it fails to represent, as “that which ... cannot be adequately verbalized” (Kawin 1982, 5) and as a moment experienced in a particular silence.¹ As we will see, this definition immediately opens the problem for us by prioritizing language and silence in the construal of a putative Outside that is beyond expression. In short, the relationship between the ineffable and the
                  failureof language is seen as essential, a relationship that allows Emmanuel Levinas to say that “the ego is ineffable,<br>

  Abstract: I argued above that Levinas’ employment of resemblance is based on an assumption about the “ego” and its recognition of itself. During that argument I also made the claim that Levinas’ understanding of self-identicality was squarely rooted in the priority of language as that which inserts itself between the “closed society” of the couple and as that which maintains the transcendence of the “ego” and the “other.” Both these arguments turn around a common centre: recognition. But the question remains: upon what is recognition based such that “I” could appear to itself and, having done so, could recognize the face<br>

And perhaps this refusal signifies, above all else, the unyielding reign of ontology. However, there are reasons to believe this regime is being challenged by discourses that desimplify traditional exigencies and propel thought in the direction of the unthinkable - that disturbing situation in which, or because of which, identity can no longer approach within the confines of a beyond accessible through language.

  Abstract: Blattberg's is a genuinely original philosophical voice. The essays collected here discuss how to re-conceive the political spectrum, where "deliberative deomocrats" go wrong, why human rights language is tragically counterproductive, how nationalism is not really secular, how many nations should share a single state, a new approach to the Arab-Israeli conflict, and why Canada might have something to teach about the "war on terror." We also learn about the right way to deny a role to principles in ethics, how to distinguish between the good and the beautiful, the way humor works, the rabbinic nature of modernism, the difference between good, bad, great, and evil, why Plato's dialogues are not really dialogues, and why most philosophers are actually artists.<br>

  Abstract: From the beginning of his reflections, Nietzsche is in search of “a new philosophy of language” (CM 1976, 1:340 [8, 52]), a philosophy which would wisely consent to lose its head and which could give, in a positive manner, an account of the bacchanalian revel, the festive inordinateness of the dithyramb, “this beautiful and savage folly of poetry” (CM 1976, V: 100-1). One is to understand the “nature” of language beginning with its derailment and its loss.

In a work which is replete with exaggeration couched in poetic, figurative, and metaphoric language, one fact might easily be overlooked. Nietzsche is making this claim literally and takes this claim very seriously: “Body am I entirely.” Within the context ofZarathustra, a book which is addressed to “all or no one,” Nietzsche attempts to persuade those few who are capable of actualizing<br>

  Abstract: With the mentality of a besieged city (Delumeau 1971, 44), the Council of Trent (1545-63) convened to counteract the growing influence of Protestant Reformers. Its sessions focused on doctrinal and administrative aspects of the growing Reformation. The Council first reiterated the teaching mission of the Church, which consisted of safeguarding the integrity of the two sources of faith, the Holy Scriptures and tradition. To this effect, the only version of the Bible that was to be recognized was the

  Abstract: The border/play characteristic of contemporary women’s parodic re/- writing of fictional genres reveals engagement with narrative as a critical strategy designed to expose the positioning of woman as
                  silent other, on whose mutilated body narrative is constructed in dominant (patriarchal) discourse, and to posit alternate positionings for women as subjects producing themselves in/by language. What feminist theory has shown is that strategies of writing and reading are forms of cultural resistance.

  Abstract: The doctrine of creation is at the core of any theological discussion regarding human difference. Theological distinctions regarding creaturely freedom and divine sovereignty are not always appreciated, and a tendency toward ontotheological categories can easily distort the divine and creaturely relationship. A Christian theological account of difference is most fertile and coherent when divine transcendence is understood to affirm the goodness of God’s creation and to challenge contemporary theoretical accounts of power and autonomy. However, theological accounts must also attend to the doctrinal language of the fall and original sin; otherwise whatever else we have said about creation will be<br>

  Abstract: Naming God has enormous discursive power. The implications of “masculine” terminology for God were foundational for second wave feminism. Understandably, feminist theologians have sought to destabilize the gender rigidity of language about God. And yet feminist rearticulations often bring with them the same discursive rules that are criticized in the use of masculine language. When women’s experience becomes the basis of language for God, feminists risk ascribing a fixed symbol upon the divine name. However, in practices of prayer and contemplation the sheer otherness of God draws us to the limits of language, and causes a blurring of all fixed<br>

  Book Title: The World in the Trinity-Open-Ended Systems in Science and Religion<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Bracken Joseph A.<br>
  Abstract: Joseph A. Bracken argues that the failure of theology and science to generate cohesion is the lack of an integrated system of interpretation of the Christian faith that consciously accords with the insights and discoveries of contemporary science. In The World in the Trinity, Bracken utilizes the language and conceptual structures of systems theory as a philosophical and scientific grammar to show traditional Christian beliefs in a new light that is accessible and rationally plausible to a contemporary, scientifically influenced society. This account opens new possibilities for rethinking the God-world relationship, the Trinity, incarnation, creation, and eschatology within the context of a broader ecological and cosmological system. In re-describing these articles constitutive of Christian belief, the author is conscious of the vital importance of retaining the inherent power and meaning of these concepts. This volume freshly retrieves pivotal themes and concepts constitutive of the Christian tradition in a conscious rapprochement with current scientific understandings of nature.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9m0vjs">The World in the Trinity</a><br>
  Abstract: Does language simply reflect the world in which we live, or instead shape it so that we see things differently as a result of using one language to express ourselves rather than another? On the basis both of personal experience and of the conclusions reached by some major European philosophers, I would say “yes” to the second alternative. With respect to personal experience, for example, in the 1960s after being ordained a priest at a Jesuit seminary here in the United States, I received permission from my religious superiors to do a final year of spiritual reflection and pastoral training<br>

  Abstract: Part One of this book was basically philosophical in its orientation. In chapter 1, I proposed that our understanding of the world around us is at least partly conditioned by the language we habitually employ. Given our Western emphasis on the priority of nouns to verbs in sentence construction, we tend to see the world in terms of individual things with various contingent relationships to one another. An emphasis on verbs, however, might lead us to the belief that physical reality is in flux and seems to be constituted by coordinated processes or systems. Moreover, contemporary scientists tend to think<br>

  Author(s) Adinarayanan Nalini<br>
  Abstract: “Communalism” in the political language of modern India denotes first and foremost the strivings of religious, ethnic, social, or linguistic communities to assert their particularity against the generalizing elements in the concept of the nation.¹ Thus during the course of India’s struggle for independence the communalism of the Muslims in particular distanced itself from the more broadly defined all-Indian nationalism. But other minorities, such as the Sikhs, the Tamils, the lower castes, etc., have also exhibited communalist tendencies out of fear that the postcolonial Indian state would be dominated by the Hindus, the North Indians, the upper castes, leaving them<br>

  Abstract: Just as the role of subjectivity in language is attracting increasing attention from an array of disciplines ranging across linguistics, communication, anthropology, history, philosophy, and others, the thrust of this interest appears to be headed in the opposite direction from an agenda that would place rhetoric at center stage. Rhetoric in its conventional guise has been deemed a quintessentially public enterprise, oriented to the marketplace of propositions projected to appeal to others. In the market square of civil discourse, sellers of ideas invite prospective buyers to critically test the proffered wares for plausibility and persuasiveness. In contrast, subjectivity as popularly<br>

  Abstract: In 1923, Charles K. Ogden and Ivor A. Richard published

It included, as a supplement, a paper by Bronislaw Malinowski dealing with Trobriand Islanders’ uses of language. Malinowski discussed his efforts to understand the Trobrianders’ language by asking them what a word meant, which he then entered into his homemade dictionary. To his surprise, however, his systematic effort was defied by everyday uses in which the Islanders’ language served pragmatic communal functions, such as gathering women and the elderly to shore<br>

  Abstract: A recent fruitful direction in anthropological linguistics has been the resurrection of interest in language’s deictic features, its constant function of anchoring itself in time and space by way of grammatical markers that “gesture” toward reference points in the world (see, for example, Hanks 1990; Senft 1997). We have ample evidence, especially from Papuan and Austronesian languages, of the high proportion of spatial indices in speech. In this chapter, however, I would like to argue from the opposite direction: that it is also spatial and architectural practices that themselves contour and elicit certain forms of speech; that, rather than language<br>

Apart from the use of images, music, theater, and rituals, therefore, all of which played a significant role in contemporary proselytizing strategies, great attention was paid to the ability to communicate with Indian people in their own languages.

  Abstract: The most compelling aspect of Charismatic and Pentecostal ritual is not its repertoire of specific ritual practices such as speaking in tongues, laying on of hands, or resting in the Spirit. It is not the inventory of ritual events such as prayer meetings, healing services, or revival meetings. Neither is it the integrated system of ritual language genres including prophecy, prayer, teaching, and witnessing. What is most compelling is the manner in which ritual performance has the potential, for individuals and communities, to bring about the transformation of everyday life, to generate a new habitus, indeed to subsume quotidian practices<br>

  Abstract: This chapter addresses what are often seen as the practical issues of exhibition-making as a theoretical problem of translation – with all the transformative effects of moving between languages¹ – and as a didactic device. It begins by invoking anthropological concern about recent developments in the museum world. It goes on to consider how (what are often thought of as) technical aspects the process of making a temporary exhibition at the University of Oslo Ethnographic Museum were used as a didactic device. Finally, there is a discussion of how these technical matters fit into the theoretical operation of translation that exhibition-making involves.<br>

  14  The Canonization of Ovide Decroly as a “Saint” of the New Education from:

  Author(s) Van Gorp A.<br>
  Abstract: If any Belgian educator belongs to the canon of the New Education, it is certainly Ovide Decroly (1871-1932). Particularly in southern Europe and in many Latin American countries,¹ the ideas and the work of this French-speaking Brussels doctor have been inspirational for a movement that projected itself worldwide—albeit in different modes—as the “child-oriented,” “progressive” alternative to the rigid, traditional school.² As recent research has shown,³ this movement manifested itself primarily by means of the development of its own language and discourse in which the “new school” was projected into a “new” society. However, ultimately, it turned out that<br>

  Author(s) Simon F.<br>
  Abstract: As we’ve often said in the past, historical research presents certain problems for the behavioural sciences. When we think about the history of education, can it, as the title of this book seems to suggest, be conceived of simply as a subdivision of educational research? And does the argumentative structure that is developed in this domain of knowledge automatically give rise to the construction of ‘one’, let alone, ‘the’ language of education? In our opinion, the history of education, if it wants to be valid, must in any event bear the stamp of what Michel de Certeau once called the<br>

  Abstract: This paper concerns what Freud called the ‘special characteristics’ of the unconscious. According to his metapsychological writings, unconscious mental states differ from conscious ones not just in not being conscious, but in having what he calls ‘systematic’ features, such as exemption from mutual contradiction, imperviousness to the influence of external reality, and so forth. Yet he still wants to characterise them as mental states. He is often explicit in his use of psychological language to describe them. Even when he is not, he makes it clear that the mechanistic-sounding language he sometimes uses is to be understood metaphorically. The movements<br>

  Book Title: Constructing Feminine Poetics in the Works of a Late-20th-Century Catalan Woman Poet: Maria-Mercè Marçal-  Publisher: Modern Humanities Research Association<br>
  Author(s): Vicedo Noelia Díaz<br>
  Abstract: This study focuses upon the work of the Catalan woman poet Maria-Mercè Marçal. It analyses the interaction between body and language in her first five books of poetry. Drawing on the Italian feminist thought of il pensiero della differenza sessuale, it examines the ways in which Marçal’s poetic images display her Catalan feminine subjectivity, including the function of the poet, the space of poetry and the representation of love. It also explores the potentiality of the space of poetry to reconstruct female identity and reconfigure reality. In addition, it unravels the way in which the poet uses poetry to express the love for the other whilst also extending the boundaries of the self. The central concern is to bridge the fissure between female experience and universal precepts on the art of poetry through the predominance of an embodied and natural iconography. This study presents Marçal’s poetic compositions within the international panorama of poetry and feminist studies and aims to open up new terrains of discussion in the field of language, body and writing.<br>

  Book Title: Soul-Black Power, Politics, and Pleasure<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Green Richard C.<br>
  Abstract: No other word in the English language is more endemic to contemporary Black American culture and identity than "Soul". Since the 1960s Soul has been frequently used to market and sell music, food, and fashion. However, Soul also refers to a pervasive belief in the capacity of the Black body/spirit to endure the most trying of times in an ongoing struggle for freedom and equality. While some attention has been given to various genre manifestations of Soul-as in Soul music and food-no book has yet fully explored the discursive terrain signified by the term. In this broad-ranging, free-spirited book, a diverse group of writers, artists, and scholars reflect on the ubiquitous but elusive concept of Soul. Topics include: politics and fashion, Blaxploitation films, language, literature, dance, James Brown, and Schoolhouse Rock. Among the contributors are Angela Davis, Manning Marable, Paul Gilroy, Lyle Ashton Harris, Michelle Wallace, Ishmael Reed, Greg Tate, Manthia Diawara, and dream hampton.<br>

  Abstract: The jurisprudential movements of the 1980s deepened and advanced a process of crisis and transition in modern jurisprudence. The most striking facet of this transformation has been the success of new forms of jurisprudential discourse or “law talk” in penetrating, subverting, and decentering the conventional forms of legal discourse. The proliferation of different jurisprudential discourses has erased the lines between description and advocacy, making it much more difficult for traditionalists to maintain their belief in neutral and objective law. A new understanding of language and interpretation has fired the imagination of legal scholars as they reexamined and critiqued the polar<br>

  Abstract: The Oxford English Dictionary’s(OED) definition of “body”—”the material frame of man (and animals)”—immediately sets before us one of the term’s principal controversies in children’s literature. That is, what Peter Hunt (1984) would call the adultist, not to mention the sexist, nature of theOED’s language reminds us that the matter of the corporeal is often not deemed proper for the consideration of children and is frequently bound up with questions of gender and the adult body. But when we consider theOED’s elaboration on this definition—“the material body and its properties”—the physical nature of the<br>

  Abstract: The

In the ensuing 1,500 years, “gender” appears in linguistic and biological contexts to distinguish types of words and bodies from one another, as when words in Indo-European languages were identified as masculine, feminine, or neuter, and humans were identified as male or female. It is telling that gender has historically (whether overtly or covertly) been a tool of negotiation between<br>

  Abstract: The word “home” comes into English through the Teutonic languages of northern Europe, carrying with it the multiple meanings of world, village, homestead, dwelling, and safe dwelling, as well as indicating a direction, as it continues to do in a phrase such as “go home.” The primary meaning in contemporary usages of the word is “the seat of domestic life and interests.” In this sense, the word is close to the Latin

  Abstract: Arguably no word maps the kind of cultural shifts in language that Raymond Williams (1976) was documenting better than “modernism.” At its simplest this is because of its roots in the word “modern.” Inevitably, what is modern at one time eventually becomes dated and of its time, and so from the first recorded use of that root word in 1500, through the appearance of the word “modernism” itself in 1737, to the fin de siècle, it was a shifting signifier, referring to the present of any given period, rather than a specific historical moment or movement (

                  Keywords, Raymond Williams (1983a) reports that the term “popular” was “originally a legal and political term” that first came into the English language in the late fifteenth century. Within the domain of the legal system, an “action popular” was any suit that was open to or brought forth by anyone who was part of the general public.

He traces its origins back to the Greektheoros, meaning “spectator,” with its root inthea, for “sight,” which also gave us “theater.” As more recent commentators put it, “[T]he literal sense of looking has then been metaphorized to that of contemplating or speculating” (Wolfreys et al. 2006). The term became increasingly opposed to “practice,” not only as something removed from the everyday, but also as something involved in attempts to explain and model the everyday. Although the title of Williams’s work—Keywords—implicitly underwrites the importance of language, his<br>

  Abstract: The medieval Islamic period brought about great intellectual growth and a flowering of literary creativity among the Jews. Arabic language, thought, and literature, as well as Islamic religion and politics, represented a significant challenge for the Jewish communities who came under Islamic rule and whose social and cultural structures had been forged in the classical rabbinic age. During this period, and especially throughout the 10th to 12th centuries, Judaism was consolidated, and many of its central institutions took shape. A principal religious rift also occurred during this period between traditional rabbinic Judaism (or Rabbanism) and Karaism—a new sectarian movement<br>

  Book Title: The Disarticulate-Language, Disability, and the Narratives of Modernity<br>

  Abstract: Language is integral to our social being. But what is the status of those who stand outside of language? The mentally disabled, wild children, people with autism and other neurological disorders, as well as animals, infants, angels, and artificial intelligences, have all engaged with language from a position at its borders. In the intricate verbal constructions of modern literature, the 'disarticulate' - those at the edges of language - have, paradoxically, played essential, defining roles.Drawing on the disarticulate figures in modern fictional works such asBilly Budd, The Sound and the Fury, Nightwood, White Noise,andThe Echo Maker,among others, James Berger shows in this intellectually bracing study how these characters mark sites at which aesthetic, philosophical, ethical, political, medical, and scientific discourses converge. It is also the place of the greatest ethical tension, as society confronts the needs and desires of the least of its brothers. Berger argues that the disarticulate is that which is unaccountable in the discourses of modernity and thus stands as an alternative to the prevailing social order. Using literary history and theory, as well as disability and trauma theory, he examines how these disarticulate figures reveal modernity's anxieties in terms of how it constructs its others.<br>

  Book Title: Re-imagining child protection-Towards humane social work with families<br>
  Publisher: Policy Press<br>
  Author(s): Morris Kate<br>
  Abstract: Why has the language of the child and of child protection become so hegemonic? What is lost and gained by such language? Who is being protected, and from what, in a risk society? Given that the focus is overwhelmingly on those families who are multiply deprived, do services reinforce or ameliorate such deprivations? And is it ethical to remove children from their parents in a society riven by inequalities? This timely book challenges a child protection culture that has become mired in muscular authoritarianism towards multiply deprived families. It calls for family-minded humane practice where children are understood as relational beings, parents are recognized as people with needs and hopes and families as carrying extraordinary capacities for care and protection. The authors, who have over three decades of experience as social workers, managers, educators and researchers in England, also identify the key ingredients of just organizational cultures where learning is celebrated. This important book will be required reading for students on qualifying and post-qualifying courses in child protection, social workers, managers, academics and policy makers.<br>

  Abstract: CARIBBEAN POPULAR MUSIC HAS, for centuries, articulated the opinions, the grumblings and the questions of many communities in the Caribbean region which have not been able to make their views known through the formal education system or the mass media. The Flower societies of Saint Lucia in the emancipation and post-emancipation eras, the calypso and reggae in the period of colonization, and the Antillean zouk and kadans in the post-independence era are forms of music rooted in cultural expression, political experience and indigenous languages. These forms have survived political and economic obstacles because of their relevance to the growth of<br>

  Book Title: Everyone Says No-Public Service Broadcasting and the Failure of Translation<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): CONWAY KYLE<br>
  Abstract: Quebec has never signed on to Canada's constitution. After both major attempts to win Quebec's approval - the Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords - failed, Quebec came within a fraction of a percentage point of voting for independence. Everyone Says No examines how the failure of these accords was depicted in French and English media and the ways in which journalists' reporting failed to translate the differences between Quebec and the rest of Canada. Focusing on the English- and French-language networks of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Kyle Conway draws on the CBC/Radio Canada rich print and video archive as well as journalists' accounts of their reporting to revisit the story of the accords and the furor they stirred in both French and English Canada. He shows that CBC/Radio Canada attempts to translate language and culture and encourage understanding among Canadians actually confirmed viewers' pre-existing assumptions rather than challenging them. The first book to examine translation in Canadian news, Everyone Says No also provides insight into Canada's constitutional history and the challenges faced by contemporary public service broadcasters in increasingly multilingual and multicultural communities.<br>

  Abstract: The institution of public service broadcasting is at a crossroads. Or, perhaps more accurately, institutions of public service broadcasting are at a crossroads. The audiences they serve are increasingly heterogeneous: in multicultural countries like Canada, the viewers that public broadcasters seek speak more languages and identify with a wider range of ethnic, cultural, and even national identities than they have at any time in the past. Public broadcasters face a considerable challenge in addressing this diversity. How do they reconcile their historical nation-building mandates with the new ways<br>

  Author(s) CRAWFORD NICHOLAS<br>
  Abstract: The Playboy of the Western World(1907)¹ has received much critical attention for its unlikely blending of genres, its ethnographic elements, and its striking language. The play’s dramatic mode is a puzzling hybrid, drawing as it does upon traditions of tragedy, comedy, and romance. Although the plot is marginally predicated on an anecdote familiar to Synge about “a man from Connaught who killed his father with the blow of a spade” and then sought refuge on the Western islands (Aran, Collected2: 95), the drama’s development distinguishes itself more by its departures from this local account than by its faithfulness<br>

  1  The Origin of Language from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3138/9781442695344">Herder's Political Thought</a><br>
  Abstract: Eighteenth-century philosophers were intensely interested in the question of language origination, for it raised a host of wider questions concerning the relationship between language and cognition, and the operations of the mind. Differences throughout Europe were equally evident in the disputes within the Berlin Academy. Heavily influenced by the French philosopher Étienne Bonnet de Condillac, the academy’s President Pierre Moreau de Maupertius delivered a lecture in 1756 that attempted to demonstrate how human beings naturally created and perfected language.¹ Johann Süßmilch, a skilled exponent of the Wolffian school of philosophy, responded in his

  2  Expressivism from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3138/9781442695344">Herder's Political Thought</a><br>
  Abstract: Herder’s expressivist theory of language marks a distinctive break from the designative view of language held by both rationalists and empiricists in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Put simply, according to the designative view, a word is a sign that ‘stands in for’ by serving as a substitute, or kind of proxy, for the object or idea it represents.¹ It is predicated on the long-held belief in the hierarchical dependence of language on the prior existence of thought, a position known in philosophy as ‘internalism.’ Herder rejects the very possibility of non-symbolic thought and instead develops a view of language<br>

  3  Culture, Identity, and Community from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3138/9781442695344">Herder's Political Thought</a><br>
  Abstract: The abstract study of language in the previous chapter takes on a concrete basis through Herder’s study of specific cultural communities. Both are central to his ontological position – that is, to those factors he takes as meaningful in accounting for social life.¹ Herder is now commonly credited as one of the first thinkers in the Western tradition to celebrate cultural diversity. Yet the erroneous idea that he fails to grasp sufficiently the diversity that exists
                  withincultures persists among some political theorists. The first section of this chapter begins the task of correcting this misperception by showing that Herder fully<br>

  Abstract: With the main tenets of Herder’s moral and political thought now outlined, this chapter applies the central principles of his ontology and his theories of language and culture to a number of issues that have arisen in contemporary political theory with respect to immigrant societies and long-standing communities. It is difficult to dispute that most states in the modern world are multi-cultural in a descriptive sense.¹ Despite the centralizing and homogenizing cultural policies of the modern ‘nation-state’ documented by scholars of nationalism like Gellner, many cultural minorities have been remarkably resilient. Typically states are as they were under the dynastic<br>

  Abstract: Mansfield’s relationship with France is expressed in many different ways in her short stories, one of which is the fundamental role played by the French language. Mansfield confronts English-speaking readers with a foreign language that constantly interacts with their mother tongue, creating an intriguing tension between the two languages, both of which are unsettled as a result, and lose their familiarity. This tension puzzles native speakers, whether French or English, albeit through different processes; the title of one of her most famous stories, ‘Je ne parle pas français’, through its very paradoxical nature, epitomises the issue of the interaction between<br>

  Abstract: In Chapter 11, ‘Derrida’s Language: Play,
                  Différanceand (Con)text’, Anderson defends the Derridean project against some of its most well-known and influential critics. Interrogating the notion that Derrida’s work implies the radicalisation of language as a ‘play of differences’, Anderson shows how this can be used to justify various types of readings (she notes the important influence of Richard Rorty in this context) that have reduced his work to an ‘anything goes’ philosophy. Further, other critics such as Searle and Habermas have, Anderson argues, unfairly labelled Derrida’s work as perpetuating indeterminacy and nihilism.

  Author(s) Puri Tara<br>
  Abstract: For Hélène Cixous, words are powerful, mellifluous things capable not only of evoking memories and fantasies, but creating the world and the self. Her writing constantly plays with language, breaking it up and recomposing it, widening its gaps, showing its fractures, filling it up with puns, and inventing new portmanteau words. It is this irrepressible energy that makes so much of her writing epiphanic in its effect. Her formulation of

  Abstract: Analytical philosophers in the twentieth century have produced a rich literature that includes the philosophy of religious language and practice, analyses of divine attributes, arguments for and against the existence of God, and arguments over the significance of religious diversity, religious experience, and religious values. Theists, atheists, agnostics, and adherents to both Christian and nonChristian religions have engaged in a fruitful exchange on these topics with all the hallmarks of analytical philosophy: an emphasis on conceptual clarity, the use of analyses with examples and counter-examples, concentrated arguments about whether concepts of what exists (God, the soul, the afterlife) may be<br>

  Abstract: Much of Continental philosophy of religion is reflection on faith (as response to revelation) and reason (as philosophical reflection). Having made the linguistic turn, it intersects with analytic discussion of the problem of religious language, at least if the question is understood as concerning the nature and limits of our God-talk rather than its warrant. Since philosophy often takes the form of phenomenology, the question can be put this way: does reason, so conceived, prescribe the limits within which our Godtalk must stay (as in Kant’s

  Author(s) Pattison George<br>
  Abstract: In the first decade of the twenty-first century, religion once more became a prominent topic of public discourse and the language of religion, and of atheism, became the lingua franca in which key issues of the day were formulated. Whatever might be thought of the general level on which it has been taken up in our contemporary debates, this resurgence of religion facilitates the leap of historical imagination required to take us back to the intellectual climate of the nineteenth century, especially its first half. Then, as now, religion offered a crucial focus for debating fundamental issues of human identity<br>

  Author(s) Barker Martin<br>
  Abstract: The seemingly inexorable rise of the concept of ‘discourse’ has made it almost unavoidable for cultural studies researchers, particularly since its invitation to theorise culture as ‘like a language’ coincides with so many impulses within our field. But not without substantial costs. Looking at the cultural studies field from my angle as an audience researcher, some troubling features within discourse work come into view. For all the multiplicity of approaches, and the attendant variations in attached modes of ‘discourse analysis’, there are some powerful unifying features in ‘discourse talk’; and these features presume the

  Introduction: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b49n">The Agamben Dictionary</a><br>
  Author(s) Whyte Jessica<br>
  Abstract: In 1755, Samuel Johnson published
                  A Dictionary of the English Language, which would remain the authoritative account of the language for a century to come. Johnson’s ambitious and arduous endeavour culminated in the dictionary’s 43,500 definitions – Johnson’s contribution to rectifying what he saw as the dire state of a language beset by impurity and disorder. In a letter to his patron, Lord Chesterfield, Johnson outlined the struggle he saw facing him, the possible futility of which he acknowledged, in distinctly biopolitical terms. “It remains”, he wrote, “that we retard what we cannot repel, that we palliate what we cannot cure”<br>

  CHAPTER ONE  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b4vx">Poetic Language</a><br>
  Abstract: The argument of this book is that poems encourage their readers to experience language as a dual-aspect phenomenon, as something known and understood in two different ways simultaneously. Poems make the language in which they are made appear contingent, and necessary, at once: they make their writers and readers feel a justness or truth in the poem’s language, at the same time as making those writers and readers question just how that part of the poem’s language (a rhyme, an image, the weight on a syllable, and so on) could produce the reactions it produces. The language in poems seems<br>

  CHAPTER FOUR  Measure: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b4vx">Poetic Language</a><br>
  Abstract: This chapter follows on from the last by offering an account of the differences between Wordsworth and Coleridge’s thinking on poetic diction and measure. Wordsworth’s well-known objections to poetic diction were made just before the death of Cowper, whose work Wordsworth read and admired. Wordsworth understands poetic diction as a strictly delimited and historically sanctioned set of words found frequently in poetry and infrequently in prose, and therefore an artificial deformation of language, like metre and rhyme. Unlike those deformations, however, poetic diction is unpredictable:<br>

  CHAPTER FIVE  Equivalence: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b4vx">Poetic Language</a><br>
  Abstract: Poetry can be a reflection upon what it is to be the kind of being that uses language, a reflection upon how humanity is characterised by being linguistic. This reflection, in the form it takes in several of the poems read in this book, is critical, in as much as it emanates from a crisis, a deeply unnerving realisation about the nature of being a language-using being. This unnerving realisation, I suggest, is the realisation that the language people use, and which can feel to its users so deeply intertwined with the natures of the objects it refers to, the<br>

  CHAPTER SIX  Spirit: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b4vx">Poetic Language</a><br>
  Abstract: Most of the ways in which poetic language is said to be poetic that are discussed in this book are more or less superficially or formally evident in the language, either in its metre, syntax, figurative constructions, phonological repetitions or elsewhere. This and the following chapter on Frank O’Hara focus on arguments suggesting that a force behind, and not immediately evident in, language is the source of its poeticalness. Such arguments beg the question: if the spirit (force, charge, drive) that manifests itself in poetic language is a poetic spirit, and is identifiable only in and through that language, can<br>

  CHAPTER SEVEN  Spirit: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b4vx">Poetic Language</a><br>
  Abstract: The tradition I sketched in the run-up to my discussion of ‘The Idea of Order at Key West’, that of identifying a spark or charge in poetic language, is sometimes manifested in psychologistic forms in the twentieth century: the energy expressing itself in poetic language is not that of a divine ordering spirit, nor the character of a people, nor a latent ‘chemical’ power in the language itself, but in the psyche of the poet concerned. The surrealist and poet André Breton thought this way. Adopting the language of the poet-critic Pierre Reverdy, who said that one ‘creates … a<br>

  CHAPTER TEN  Figure: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b4vx">Poetic Language</a><br>
  Abstract: Metaphor, as will already be evident from ‘Figure: Walter Ralegh’, has been thought characteristic of poetic language. A recent book on the subject states that ‘metaphor has always been, and still is, the main device of poetry’.¹ Several important accounts of metaphor have been offered from diverse quarters in recent decades, and I want to engage with three of them in this chapter: the cognitive account of metaphor as conceptual mapping; Donald Davidson’s insistence that the meaning of a metaphor is just its literal meaning; Paul de Man’s argument that knowledge about the operations of the mind has the structure<br>

  CHAPTER ELEVEN  Selection: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b4vx">Poetic Language</a><br>
  Abstract: My main concerns in this chapter are the restrictions placed upon the selection of words that make up poems, whether these restrictions are more personal or social (if that distinction makes sense), and how selection for poems relates to selectional procedures in language more generally. In relation to this last topic I consider selection in the work of the generative linguist Noam Chomsky. Whilst generative grammar and modern logic understand selection as an operation pertaining to particular terms in an individual’s lexicon, following, or refusing to follow, certain rules, other theorists of literary language have focused on the selection of<br>

  CHAPTER THIRTEEN  Epilogue: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b4vx">Poetic Language</a><br>
  Abstract: Early in the introduction to this book I quoted the Czech structuralist Jan Mukařovský’s itemisation of the supposed distinguishing formal features of poetic language, which came to the conclusion that, ‘finally, not even
                  individuality, the emphasized uniqueness of linguistic expression, characterizes poetic language in general’.¹ Whilst originality or uniqueness might characterise some instances of poetic language, only function will identify all instances. But some kind of qualification may be made to Mukařovský’s assertion. It might not be the emphasised uniqueness of expression that makes the deployment of (for want of better terminology) a highly conventional phrase poetic, precisely because the<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b4xz">Research Methods for English Studies</a><br>
  Author(s) Griffin Gabriele<br>
  Abstract: Discourse analysis is concerned with the investigation of language,¹ both written and oral,² as it is actually used (as opposed to an abstract system or structure of language). It is different from textual analysis (see Chapter 9 in this volume) in that it assumes from the outset that language is
                  invested, meaning that language is not a neutral tool for transmitting a message but rather, that all ‘communicative events’ (van Dijk 2001: 98) – whether these be, for instance, readings of novels, plays, poetry, a notice on a billboard, a conversation, or an interview – constitute ‘a particular way of talking about<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b6rb">The Edinburgh Companion to the History of Democracy</a><br>
  Author(s) Isakhan Benjamin<br>
  Abstract: In the fertile floodplains that stretch between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, humankind settled to form perhaps the earliest organised and permanent settlements anywhere in the world. By around 3500 BCE, these relatively simple agricultural societies had evolved into city-states, the first of which was Uruk (modern Al-Warka, Iraq), centred around a temple complex and populated by traders, merchants, farmers and the temple bureaucracy. The need for a sophisticated accounting system led to the development of the world’s first written language, which itself evolved into a rich corpus of literary and bureaucratic texts. However, in order to compete for and<br>

  Chapter 2  Merleau-Ponty and the Fold of the Flesh from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1n7qj2j">Immanence and Micropolitics</a><br>
  Abstract: Unlike Sartre, Merleau-Ponty moves towards a more direct ontological enquiry into the appearing of the visible-tactile field – the actual – itself, which results in an anti-humanist ontology (or
                  real humanismas he calls it) that locates perceiving bodies within a meaning-generatingfolded flesh; a folded fabric of univocal Being that is beyond any notion of a metaphysical outside or internal transcendent Other. Merleau-Ponty’s ‘fold’ signifies a necessary renewal of philosophical language that entirely bypasses dualism in vernacular form, and subsequently any evocation of transcendence – a limitation that plagues Sartre. This serves to both radicalise Sartre’s socio-political ethic of authenticity as an<br>

  Author(s) Haddock Bruce<br>
  Abstract: Contemporary political theory has never been comfortable with the idea of evil. Indeed, the gradual, sporadic, but nevertheless incomplete secularisation of political discourse since the Renaissance has made the conceptualisation of absolute value deeply problematic. One response, dominant in the liberal tradition, is simply to deny that politics is the realm of absolute value at all. The pragmatic adjustment of competing interests in a scheme of social co-operation invites, at the very least, a moderation of tone. And increasing empirical awareness of the diversity of different schemes of (merely political) co-operation has made us (rightly) guarded in the language we<br>

  Author(s) Holbrook Peter<br>
  Abstract: Of course Hotspur is speaking in character, as a bluff soldier – in a non-trivial sense these are his not Shakespeare’s words. Nevertheless it is always something of a shock to come across, in the greatest poet of the English language, such a memorable expression of the hatred of poetry. Glendower has been wittering on about his supernatural and poetic endowments, and Hotspur has had enough. The bombastic Welshman assures Hotspur he has “framèd to the harp / Many an English ditty lovely well, / And gave the tongue a helpful ornament – / A virtue that was never seen in you”<br>

  5  SHAKESPEARE ANTHOLOGIZED from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r1z12">The Edinburgh Companion to Shakespeare and the Arts</a><br>
  Author(s) Rumbold Kate<br>
  Abstract: In the twenty-first century, “Shakespeare” is not only an English cultural icon but shares some of the characteristics of a powerful global brand. This chapter shows the surprising but important role that the many books of quotations and extracts from Shakespeare’s works, published from within his own lifetime to the present day, have played in establishing that status. It argues that these anthologies have not simply reflected Shakespeare’s growing status, but actively helped to construct it. The seemingly inherent qualities for which Shakespeare is now admired – the beauty of his language, his wise understanding of human nature, his Englishness – are<br>

  Abstract: Few scholars would argue with the idea that words and worldviews are intertwined and that language and thought are related. But when we speak of language, what do we mean? Are we thinking of the language system, or the particular style or type of language used? Most sociologists, political analysts and philosophers are concerned with the ideological content of concepts.

  Abstract: One rich and wide-reaching element in language has become the focal point of much study in the past three decades: metaphor. If this element of language has aroused such interest, it is because there has been increasing recognition that all of our concepts are framed within metaphorical terms. Rather than a model of language based upon the linguistic sign (a model which implies that words designate things in the world outside of language), linguists today are more inclined to accept that there exists a figurative substructure to concepts. This in turn helps us to understand that concepts are not extra-lingual<br>

These are presented in five sections:Language and the MediaLanguage and OrganisationsLanguage and GenderLanguage and YouthMultilingualism, Identity and EthnicityWith a unique combination of selected readings and student-centred tasks in a single volume, the book covers contemporary issues in language and power, ranging from the global to the interpersonal. Each area - and each reading chosen to explore it - is substantially contextualised and discussed through a detailed introduction and then followed up with related activities.Each section comprises:*a substantial, specific introduction which draws students’ attention to key themes and issues relevant to its topic; *a set of four or five selected readings which encourages students to locate critically these issues in context; *a task, or set of tasks, obliging students to undertake ‘hands-on’ linguistic analysis of data and engage in more sophisticated discussion of pertinent issues.*In-depth exploration of a variety of approaches to the study of language and power*Unique combination of advanced readings, student-centred tasks and editorial guidance*Hands-on activities at the end of each chapter<br>

  INTRODUCTION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r24nd">Language and Power in the Modern World</a><br>
  Abstract: This book is about language and power. But what is power? How should we go about studying it in relation to language? And for that matter, why? These are not easy questions to answer. Our aim in writing this book is to get you thinking about them, and to get you thinking about the way power ‘works’ in the linguistic practices that people engage in. Power in language is certainly not just about what we might initially think of as ‘powerful language’ (drowning out the voices of others by shouting a lot, for instance). Consider the claim that:<br>

  1  LANGUAGE AND THE MEDIA from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r24nd">Language and Power in the Modern World</a><br>
  Abstract: This chapter considers the extent to which verbal interaction through the mass media differs from other kinds, such as the face-to-face interaction of individuals, and its consequences in terms of power relations. It examines the power of the media in its assertions of shared values and opinions and works through how such constructions of ‘common sense’ can be critically investigated, drawing for examples on work on racist discourse in the press. It then takes up issues specific to the mediated talk of television and radio, attending to the structuring of ‘live’ talk and to mediatised political language. This involves a<br>

  2  LANGUAGE AND ORGANISATIONS from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r24nd">Language and Power in the Modern World</a><br>
  Abstract: This chapter explores the relationship between organisational discourse practices, power and resistance. It is concerned with the ways in which language is used to create and shape an organisation, to carve out an internal structure with circumscribed roles, responsibilities and rights for its different members, and for others with whom they interact. Covering institutional documentation, work discussions and routine talk, it also explores the discursive patterns of control and challenge as struggles for identity occur. We are interested in what has been defined as ‘institutional language’ (Thornborrow 2002; Drew and Heritage 1992) – talk that has pre-inscribed participant roles; is<br>

  3  LANGUAGE AND GENDER from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r24nd">Language and Power in the Modern World</a><br>
  Abstract: In this section the focus is on patriarchal power. It attends to how patriarchal power relations are maintained in and through language. To begin, it examines the well-known claim that men and women tend to use interactional styles based on power and solidarity respectively. The section then goes on to maintain that, in order to explore patterns of male dominance effectively, we need to go beyond this polarised view and attend to discourses and practices in specific situations, institutions and genres which may establish men in positions from which they can dominate women.

  4  LANGUAGE AND YOUTH from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r24nd">Language and Power in the Modern World</a><br>
  Abstract: In advocating a change of direction for research on youth, Angela McRobbie (1994: 186) asks ‘what are the discourses within which “different, youthful, subjectivities” are constructed? How are they expressed?’ In exploring language, power and young people, this chapter maps some of the discursive constructions of self that articulate youth identities in everyday modern life. It examines the ways in which language is taken up and used as resistance to mainstream norms and values. It looks at the sorts of discourse practices drawn upon to constitute, shape and signal membership of particular youth cultures. And, as contemporary social change demands<br>

  5  MULTILINGUALISM, ETHNICITY AND IDENTITY from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r24nd">Language and Power in the Modern World</a><br>
  Abstract: The world is frequently portrayed as an increasingly uniform place from the point of view of the number of languages used on our planet, not least by some of the media in Western countries where English is the dominant language. Despite this portrayal, however, its population continues to use a huge, if diminishing, variety of languages – most estimates are of around 6,000 living languages (a figure inevitably highly dependent on the definition of ‘a language’ used – see, for example, Crystal 1997: Chapter 47, for a discussion). Nevertheless, whatever the real figure, languages are certainly disappearing all the time<br>

  Abstract: I wish to present a perspective from American culture and history, which may help to explain dominant American tendencies to resort to the unilateral use of force to resolve what Americans take to be demands of their national security. This is very far from wishing to deny the importance of international law, either as an intellectual construct or as an ideological weapon. Indeed, the wider cultural, historical analysis is intended to demonstrate the contrary.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt3fgs1g">Modernism and Magic</a><br>
  Abstract: The engagement of experimental artistic practices with the contemporary occult in the first half of the twentieth century was not so much the result of personal credulity, or of a search for new forms per se, or a straightforward mimesis of the failure of language, but was instead an attempt to represent the world other than the way it was through a magical mimesis. As I have suggested in the Introduction, this is already to move away from some current accounts of what modernism does with the world. In other accounts, the varieties of modernist experiment are often formed into<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt3fgs1g">Modernism and Magic</a><br>
  Abstract: If magic is error for modernity, then the most scandalous of its errors is its collapsing into identity of words and objects. As Randall Styers argues, one of the central themes running through scholarly work on magic from the second half of the nineteenth century is the claim that magic is fixated on the power of words (Styers 2004: 219ff.). Certainly magic is often defined as that which attempts to animate matter, but again and again writers on magic assert a particular attitude to language as central to this animation. For James Frazer, if magic originates in the human fear<br>

  Abstract: In a note devoted to the critical and the clinical in
                  DialoguesDeleuze writes that ‘criticismandthe clinicought strictly to be identical’ (D 89). The identity of the critical and the clinical expresses a more general turn in Deleuze’s philosophy towards a pragmatic, diagrammatic or cartographic theory of language which attempts to articulate a relationship between literature and the socio-political critique of power. Pragmatics does not replace but rather subsumes what Deleuze calls the ‘generative’, which we have discussed in terms of the psychosexual genesis of material bodies and immaterial signs, and the ‘transformational’, which we have discussed<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt3fgt0f">Psychoanalysis is an Antiphilosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: In the preceding chapters, I tried to show how psychoanalysis emerged as an antiphilosophy and, in this emergence, came to establish certain routines as its own: the diagnosis of slavery as the consequence of the encounter between the body and language, a concomitant intrication of sexual protest, the ambivalence of love as at once mediating, obscuring and transforming this relation between slavery and sex, and, finally, the development of an ethics of poetic invention. This chapter, by contrast, turns its attentions to a different kind of thinker: one who begins as a self-nominated ‘philosopher’, but who, in covertly drawing from<br>

  7.  Man is a Swarm Animal from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt3fgt0f">Psychoanalysis is an Antiphilosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: The previous chapter ended with a dilemma: if the human is that ‘living being’ which can actually be separated from what once was held to be its essence, that is, ‘language’, what possible effectivity – whether of diagnosis or treatment – is left to psychoanalysis? The ongoing psychiatric, pharmaceutical and philosophical assault against psychoanalysis is one thing; the loss of its very basis for being is quite another. The first, as I have shown throughout this book, is hardly the threat to psychoanalysis that it is often supposed to be; but the second would be fatal. The second, in fact,<br>

  Chapter 6  Conclusion from:

  Abstract: Rukeyser begins
                  The Life of Poetrywith a call to arms and an affirmation: ‘In time of crisis, we summon up our strength.’¹ This ‘strength’, she asserts, may be derived from ‘every forgotten image … every memory that can make us know our power’.² For Rukeyser, in a manner similar to that discovered by Francis Galton when conducting his experiments into language and mental imagery, the singular image of a boat generates and communicates a vast network of imaginative associations.³ Summoning the memory of her evacuation from Spain, Rukeyser writes simply, ‘I think now of a boat on which I<br>

  Abstract: The opening paragraph of section 9 of
                  The Birth of Tragedyin a modified version of Walter Kaufmann’s translation reads: “Everything that comes to the surface in the Apollinian part of Greek tragedy, in the dialogue, looks simple, transparent, and beautiful. In this sense, the dialogue is an image of the Hellene whose nature is revealed in the dance because in the dance the greatest strength is only potential but betrays itself in the suppleness and wealth of movement. Thus the language of Sophocles’ heroes surprises us by its Apollinian precision and lucidity, so that we immediately have the feeling<br>

  Abstract: Ever since its publication in 1857,
                  Madame Bovaryhas been one of the most discussed books in the history of world literature. Despite the distinction and importance of his other novels, Flaubert had to reconcile himself to the fact that he became known, once and forever, as the author ofMadame Bovary. The popularity of the novel has increased rather than diminished with time. Numberless translations exist in various languages; the word “bovarysme” has become part of the French language; the myth surrounding the figure of Emma Bovary is so powerful that, as in the case of Don Quixote, or<br>

  Abstract: Speech sets man apart among animals, language distinguishes between nations: one knows where a man comes from only after he has spoken. Usage and need make that everyone learns the language of his country; but what is it that makes this language the language of his country and not of another? In order to tell, one must go back to an explanation that belongs specifically to the place and that predates even the local customs: speech, the first institution of society, owes its shape only to natural causes.<br>

  Author(s) de Man Paul<br>
  Abstract: The Seminar deals with a central problem in contemporary literary theory from a pedagogical, rather than from a purely theoretical perspective. It investigates how an awareness of the rhetorical properties of language influences the modalities and expectations of our reading and, consequently, of the way in which the reading of literary works is taught to undergraduates. This pragmatic approach is based on the experience of an experimental course for Yale undergraduates taught for the last four years. The assigned readings consist, for the most part, of literary and philosophical primary texts rather than of contemporary works of literary theory. The<br>

  Abstract: The selection combines the theoretical side of Rousseau’s thought, which is primarily of interest to students of political science and of intellectual history, with the more purely literary components of the works. It also provides the means to make connections between these two aspects of the work, by including such texts as the “Essay on the Origins of Language,” in which the link between Rousseau’s reflections on language and his political theory becomes manifest.

  Abstract: The juxtaposition of Rousseau and Nietzsche has not been studied, partly because Nietzsche has nothing good so say about Rousseau, partly because their main common interest has for a long time been neglected in works dealing with these two authors. Of late however the theory of language and of rhetoric that both develop in their early writings has received more and more attention (on Rousseau in the work of J. Derrida, R. Althusser, implicitly in Judith Shklar, etc.; on Nietzsche in recent books and articles by Ph. Lacoue Labarthe, Gilles Deleuze, B. Pautrat, etc.). The combined presence, in both authors,<br>

  Abstract: In

Despite North’s subtle intertwinings, the literary articulation of dialect forms is not only a question of race, but also a<br>

  Abstract: In the 1980s, just as the textual revolution was entering its secondary phase and sweeping the discipline, a few anthropologists began to question the disembodied nature of much of contemporary ethnography and its conceptual reliance on language-based models of analysis. Their work prepared the ground for a sensual turn in anthropological understanding—that is, a move away from linguistic and textual paradigms toward an understanding that treats cultures as ways of sensing the world. This chapter documents this countertradition within the anthropology of the 1980s and 1990s, which culminated in the emergence of the anthropology of the senses.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3998/mpub.4765277">The Immaterial Book</a><br>
  Abstract: Early modern romance is a Janus-faced genre. It looks nostalgically backward, to the medieval past and the tales that accrete around English and Continental chivalric heroes: Arthur, Amadis, Guy, Bevis, Roland. At the same time, it pushes the leading edge in generic experimentation, engendering radically new forms, hybrid species such as tragicomic drama, and developing the mode that would ultimately dominate fiction making, the long prose narrative, which became the novel. Evidence that early seventeenth-century English readers themselves regarded romance as participating in such a duality of past and present, traditionalism and modernity, is present in the language of early<br>

  Abstract: An examination of mediation in archives of art is an acknowledgment of the issue of language—its definitions, its cultural and academic parameters, its multiplicities, its unexpected relationships. The French
                  imparfait, while understood conventionally as a particular verb tense of the past, is an appealing example and point of departure. It is a wonderful suggestion of language “in motion,” without end, of the past but moving forward in time, subject to barriers in understanding, and open to new directions and revelations. By borrowing from the French, by adding multiple meanings, we render l’imparfait no more “perfect,” or “complete,” but instead<br>

                  swans, Thames, prince, murderanddaggerandpoison. Archival English came to me in the 1980s thanks to committee work for the International Council on Archives (ICA).

  Author(s) Burguera Mónica<br>
  Abstract: During the past twenty years, the approaches and perspectives associated with both poststructuralism and feminism have prompted historians to question the centrality of some of social history’s most basic assumptions, opening the door to what Patrick Joyce has called a “self-reflexive and historicized understanding” of social history and its epistemological legacy.¹ In particular, many scholars now agree that race, gender, class, and national identities do not, as was previously thought, derive exclusively from a network of social referents external to language but rather arise from a system of representations in which language and its referents undergo a continual process of<br>

  Abstract: Working quietly in private during 1934–35, as the Soviet people were toiling to meet the targets of the Second Five Year Plan, celebrating Stalin the Great Leader, and condemning “enemies of the people,” Mikhail Bakhtin was developing the concept of heteroglossia (
                  raznorechieorraznogolositsa). The Russian philosopher of language understood heteroglossia as a polyphony of social and discursive forces, a diversity of social speech types that occur in everyday life. According to him, the genre of the novel is best suited for delivering the realities of heteroglossia because it allows for a network of dialogic, interactive relations among multiple<br>

  Abstract: As George Burroughs entered the courtroom on May 9, 1692, Mary Walcott, Mercy Lewis, Abigail Williams, Ann Putnam, Elizabeth Hubbard, and Susanna Sheldon fell into “grevious” fits. This preliminary hearing found Burroughs guilty of performing “wicked Arts” upon three of the afflicted girls (Mary, Mercy, and Ann). The court used the language of James I’s witchcraft statute from 1604 (1 Jac.

In each indictment, the other afflicted girls doubled as accusers, bearing witness to the torture, torment,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5149/9781469641676_rogers">The Poetics of Inconstancy</a><br>
  Abstract: Given its date of publication, the love poem cycle of Durand’s
                  Méditationsbelongs inevitably to the Petrarchist tradition. Beginning with Scève,¹ all French love poets of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries draw heavily on the common fund of themes, images, and vaguely Platonic theories inherited from Italy.² Any global definition of Petrarchism would have to include the style and motifs used by Petrarch himself, the classicism of the Bembists, the freer variations of Tansillo and others, and the imitations of all these Italian sources in other languages – with the latter inspiring further imitations in their turn.³ But since the<br>

  Book Title: “The Useless Mouths” and Other Literary Writings-  Publisher: University of Illinois Press<br>
  Author(s): Le Bon de Beauvoir Sylvie<br>
  Abstract: "The Useless Mouths" and Other Literary Writings brings to English-language readers literary writings--several previously unknown--by Simone de Beauvoir. Culled from sources including various American university collections, the works span decades of Beauvoir's career. Ranging from dramatic works and literary theory to radio broadcasts, they collectively reveal fresh insights into Beauvoir's writing process, personal life, and the honing of her philosophy. The volume begins with a new translation of the 1945 play The Useless Mouths, written in Paris during the Nazi occupation. Other pieces were discovered after Beauvoir's death in 1986, such as the 1965 short novel "Misunderstanding in Moscow," involving an elderly French couple who confront their fears of aging. Two additional previously unknown texts include the fragmentary "Notes for a Novel," which contains the seed of what she later would call "the problem of the Other," and a lecture on postwar French theater titled Existentialist Theater. The collection notably includes the eagerly awaited translation of Beauvoir's contribution to a 1965 debate among Jean-Paul Sartre and other French writers and intellectuals, "What Can Literature Do?" Prefaces to well-known works such as Bluebeard and Other Fairy Tales, La Bâtarde, and James Joyce in Paris: His Final Years are also available in English for the first time, alongside essays and other short articles. A landmark contribution to Beauvoir studies and French literary studies, the volume includes informative and engaging introductory essays by prominent and rising scholars. Contributors are Meryl Altman, Elizabeth Fallaize, Alison S. Fell, Sarah Gendron, Dennis A. Gilbert, Laura Hengehold, Eleanore Holveck, Terry Keefe, J. Debbie Mann, Frederick M. Morrison, Catherine Naji, Justine Sarrot, Liz Stanley, Ursula Tidd, and Veronique Zaytzeff<br>

Inside, the smooth wood surfaces and the steeply sloping sides of the traditionally styled Sakha dwelling generate a strong echo from the voice of the storyteller. Pyotr Egorovich Reshetnikov, master performer of

  Abstract: The historical chapters of this work provide a narrative frame that informs this chapter’s discussion of continuity and change in olonkho performance. Measuring change for intangible cultural heritage remains a complicated process, but sociolinguists have found ways to address issues of language shift that may contribute helpful models for assessing music shift as well. Without drawing overly strict, problematic parallels between language and music (Tilley 2014, 487), sociolinguistic and other communication-based models can be modified effectively for measuring change in forms of artistic expression. In addition, these approaches highlight key factors related to resilience, thereby providing strategic insights into encouraging<br>

  Abstract: A wise Russian aphorism declares, “You don’t have to be a prophet to predict the demise of a people deprived of their mother tongue.”¹ Many Sakha people feel this way, not only about their language, but also about their arts. In the most potent way possible, these unique artistic expressions energize the self-expression and well-being of the Sakha, pushing back against decades, even centuries, of marginalization. Their arts create a space for breathing, for creating, and for celebrating the unique voices of Sakha people.² And although change is inevitable, many Sakha people desire to see olonkho continue in some form<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/j.ctt1xcmdx">New German Dance Studies</a><br>
  Author(s) THURNER CHRISTINA<br>
  Abstract: “The most secret movements of the soul,” writes Friedrich Schiller in 1780, “are revealed on the exterior of the body”; each emotion has its own specific means of expression or, more precisely, “its peculiar dialect, by which one knows it.”¹ Accordingly, the “language” of the emotions is—in the opinion of Schiller and his contemporaries—a physical one. It follows that the dancer, whose means of expression is the body, has a virtually unparalleled command of this language. The philosopher Johann Georg Sulzer likewise observes in 1774 in his

  Author(s) HUSCHKA SABINE<br>
  Abstract: Throughout the history of dance performance, the body has been seen as a site of experiences that are being transposed into movement. The
                  Ausdruckstanzof the Weimar Republic, for example, appealed under the influence of Mary Wigman to an experiential space of physical movement and the aim of this “language of dance”¹ was to draw the audience into a communicative structure of experience. “Experience” (what Wigman termedErlebnis) became the central aesthetic concept of her dance: from a position of profound skepticism with regard to language, the intention was to show the human being in his or her truest incarnation.<br>

  Book Title: Doing Emotions History-  Publisher: University of Illinois Press<br>
  Author(s): STEARNS PETER N.<br>
  Abstract: How do emotions change over time? When is hate honorable? What happens when love is translated into different languages? Such questions are now being addressed by historians who trace how emotions have been expressed and understood in different cultures throughout history. Doing Emotions History explores the history of feelings such as love, joy, grief, nostalgia as well as a wide range of others, bringing together the latest and most innovative scholarship on the history of the emotions. Spanning the globe from Asia and Europe to North America, the book provides a crucial overview of this emerging discipline. An international group of scholars reviews the field's current status and variations, addresses many of its central debates, provides models and methods, and proposes an array of possibilities for future research. Emphasizing the field's intersections with anthropology, psychology, sociology, neuroscience, data-mining, and popular culture, this groundbreaking volume demonstrates the affecting potential of doing emotions history.<br>

  Author(s) CORRIGAN JOHN<br>
  Abstract: The practice of emotions history in the field of religious studies has developed apace with the flowering of scholarly interest in everyday practice, embodiment, locality, and the constructed self over the past several decades. Most previous religious history from the earlier twentieth century,¹ whether focused on western monotheisms or on Asian or indigenous religions, was inclined to illustrate its narratives about feeling with ideas collected from theological discourses, or, at the very least, with language sampled from Christian glossaries of belief and worship.² For much religious history, confessional perspectives supplied the basis for interpretation—including the preoccupation with meaning itself<br>

  Abstract: One of the easiest, and most common, ways to begin an academic essay on videogames is to start with an experiential point of view into a gameworld that the reading audience presumably knows little about beforehand. The language is often overwrought, it addresses the reader as if he or she were an interactor, and it exaggerates or omits many details about the game in question.

  Abstract: If fashion is a language, albeit one marked by a low semantic level, then accessories can be taken as special indicators of the meaning of clothing. Idiosyncratically arranged, they are able to create both stable structures and variations on a theme. As a starting point I would like to use Mikhail Bakhtin’s concept of “multiaccentuality” and its appropriation by Stuart Hall, who adopts it as a benchmark for his encoding/decoding model.¹ His analysis of these modes of arrangement reveals decisive turning points in the social history of the tie.² Hidden within this accessory, in fact, is a symbolic potential that<br>

According to Wendell Berry in “Conservation Is Good Work,” “The idea that we live in something called ‘the environment’ … is utterly preposterous.” The prime position accorded to this noun in “the language we are using to talk about our connection to the world” signals, for Berry, both the anthropocentrism and the “inadequacy” of twentieth-century ecodiscourse.

Monuments and memorials are powerful mnemonic devices through which the custodians of collective memory seek to encode particular histories and geographies into landscapes of power and resistance. They provide rallying points for shared memories and common identities. They are material signifiers of ideas, transmitters of sentiments, and repositories of ideologies that their permanent affixture to public space intends to immortalize.

  Abstract: To explain the phenomenon of encounter, Carter performs it in differing scales, spaces, languages, tropes, and forms of knowledge, staging in the very language of the book what he calls "passages." In widely varying contexts, these passages posit the disjunction of Greco-Roman and Indigenous languages, codes, theatrics of power, social systems, and visions of community. In an era of new forms of technosocialization, Carter offers novel ways of presenting the philosophical dimensions of waiting, meeting, and non-meeting.<br>

Nationalism as a mass movement, Hobsbawm indicates, is a final stage, coming after the formation of a state. To generate identification with this “imagined community,”² nationalist movements often call upon already existing constructs of community, what we can term “protonationalist” identities generated by discourses of religion, ethnicity, language, kinship, culture, and earlier “historical<br>

With few exceptions, the name of the translator appears in small type on the credits page; it rarely appears on the title page, and almost never on the cover. It is as if the act of reading a text in a language different from the original were a most shameful activity. “Good manners” are that institutionalized behavior that allows this shameful activity to be kept secret; everyone pretends not to see what everyone else knows (even the translator knows that<br>

  Author(s) Giefer Laura<br>
  Abstract: In a previous work, dedicated to a
                  theoría¹ of reading, I investigated the paradoxical movement that characterizes the relationship between the language of literary theory and that of literature. One of the core chapters of that work noted the characteristics of identity and difference that mediate between text and metatext. In dealing specifically with the question of difference, the problem of defining language or the literary text was brought to the foreground, a classical problem that was not addressed at the time because the investigation wandered along other paths. Nevertheless, the way was prepared for understanding that the question about<br>

  Abstract: Consider the words of Grace Paley in her introduction to

  Author(s) Bal Mieke<br>
  Abstract: The image of a royal robe with ample folds cannot today but evoke that historical aesthetic and its contemporary counterpart that we associate with Gilles Deleuze (1993), with the idea of the fold. The image is thoroughly baroque. Walter Benjamin, whose work on German baroque drama has inspired extensive philosophical commentary on the baroqueness of his thought as exemplary of modernity in general, is here speaking not about art but about language.¹ Comparing the task of the translator with that of the poet, Benjamin creates a powerful image of the translator’s product as both rich (royal) and encompassing (ample), expansive<br>

  Abstract: Like Henry Thoreau, Martin Luther King Jr. assumes the office of prophecy and uses the genre as a language in and for politics. As we have seen, Thoreau developed two registers of prophetic voice, one abolitionist and the other romantic, in tandem as well as in tension with each other and with politics. We told a story that revealed unexpected affinities between these registers of prophecy and his political engagement with white supremacy, but it also suggested that while his use of wilderness as a trope was politically fruitful, his turn toward nature could not sustain this engagement. Indeed, the<br>

  Abstract: Like King, Baldwin is shaped profoundly by his experience in the black church, and he forges a language of love, suffering, and redemption that is both personal and political.¹ Like King, he exemplifies a “double-consciousness” toward both whites and blacks, whose entwined fates he can address partly because he refuses to be wholly defined by either. Like King, he works through a complex attachment to an “American” identity he links both to white supremacy and to a “promise” of overcoming ascription by “race, caste, and class.” Like King, he invests in African Americans a special responsibility for voicing and redeeming<br>

  Abstract: I initially conceived a book about “prophetic narrative” because I was so profoundly affected by Toni Morrison’s novel
                  Beloved. More effectively than any other text in my experience, it dramatizes the redemptive language and longing that has driven American culture and that has twinned white and black. As its themes led me to reread Sacvan Bercovitch’sAmerican Jeremiad, which depicted the hegemony of redemptive rhetoric in American liberal nationalism, I conceived this book, which here returns to its origin.

  Abstract: I have sought in this book to bring together political theory and a version of American studies by placing central concerns of the European canon into conversation with a politics organized by racial domination and biblical language. This has meant displacing philosophical modes of apprehending politics by rhetorical practices and literary genres. Bringing political theory into conversation with an American modernity shaped by race, religion, and genre, and not only by capital, normalization, and disenchantment, also expands the vocabulary of references and theories for analyzing politics. I then could trace how prophecy is reworked by critics of white supremacy to<br>

  Abstract: Chapter 4 of

According to Husserl, even when I talk to myself there is no genuine communication and thus no indication: I merely imagine or represent myself as speaking and communicating. This is Derrida’s opportunity to investigate the role of representation in language. “Representation” has a variety of senses, and Derrida argues that through all the registers of its meaning, the “fundamental distinction between reality and representation” cannot be drawn, since in language it is impossible to distinguish them.<br>

                  cannothave much to say to these arts, not for accidental reasons of language and geography, but because this philosophy tends to be struck mute before anything as corporeal as the martial arts.

  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROTEM ORNAN<br>
  Abstract: Biderman uses concrete examples from religion and literature to illustrate the formal aspects of the philosophical problems of transcendence, language, selfhood, and the external world and then demonstrates their plausibility in actual situations. Though his method of analysis is comparative, Biderman does not adopt the disinterested stance of an "ideal" spectator. Rather, Biderman approaches ancient Indian thought and culture from a Western philosophical standpoint to uncover cultural presuppositions that can be difficult to expose from within the culture in question.<br>

Stanley Fish, however, has argued that “literary criticism is 
                  only, today, an academic discipline [whose] specialized language … is the mark of its distinctiveness” (Professional 43). Responding to Robbins, to Fish, and to David Simpson, Timothy Peltason asks that contemporary critics learn from Victorian thinkers how to make “complex characterizations of the experiences …<br>

  Book Title: Neopoetics-The Evolution of the Literate Imagination<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Collins Christopher<br>
  Abstract: The quest to understand the evolution of the literary mind has become a fertile field of inquiry and speculation for scholars across literary studies and cognitive science. In
      Paleopoetics, Christopher Collins's acclaimed earlier title, he described how language emerged both as a communicative tool and as a means of fashioning other communicative tools-stories, songs, and rituals. InNeopoetics, Collins turns his attention to the cognitive evolution of the writing-ready brain. Further integrating neuroscience into the popular field of cognitive poetics, he adds empirical depth to our study of literary texts and verbal imagination and offers a whole new way to look at reading, writing, and creative expression. Collins beginsNeopoeticswith the early use of visual signs, first as reminders of narrative episodes and then as conventional symbols representing actual speech sounds. Next he examines the implications of written texts for the play of the auditory and visual imagination. To exemplify this long transition from oral to literate artistry, Collins examines a wide array of classical texts-from Homer and Hesiod to Plato and Aristotle and from the lyric innovations of Augustan Rome to the inner dialogues of St. Augustine. In this work of "big history," Collins demonstrates how biological and cultural evolution collaborated to shape both literature and the brain we use to read it.<br>

  Two  Narrative Memory from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/coll17686">Neopoetics</a><br>
  Abstract: The ability to transmit symbolic signs through gestures and, later, vocal sounds eventually evolved into fully grammatical language. But as the language-ready brain was millions of years in the making, so it took perhaps as long as 200,000 years for oral cultures in separate locations, e.g., Mesopotamia, the Nile and Indus valleys, northern China, and Mesoamerica, to have the institutions in place to support the production and storage of written records. It then took millennia more before writing expanded from administrative recordkeeping to historiography, philosophy, natural science, and what we now generally mean by “literature.” All the while, writing remained<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/fult13368">History in the Comic Mode</a><br>
  Author(s) Gragnolati Manuele<br>
  Abstract: One of the reasons Dante’s magnum opus is called a “comedy” is its use of a comic register as the leading one. This choice forms the basis of the poem’s capability to encompass reality in all its spectra and to combine, for instance, myth with fragments of everyday life and chronicle, theoretical speculation with personal issues and political tirades, sublime love poetry with debased language, mystical ardor with spiteful irony. Like life or history, Dante’s 
                  Comedy assembles many disparate and diverse parts; as centuries of scholarship have shown, it is often by attempting to find new combinations of these many<br>

  Book Title: Eastwood's Iwo Jima-Critical Engagements with<br>
  Publisher: Wallflower Press<br>
  Author(s): GJELSVIK ANNE<br>
  Abstract: With
      Flags of Our Fathers(2006) andLetters from Iwo Jima(2006), Clint Eastwood made a unique contribution to film history, being the first director to make two films about the same event. Eastwood's films examine the battle over Iwo Jima from two nations' perspectives, in two languages, and embody a passionate view on conflict, enemies, and heroes. Together these works tell the story behind one of history's most famous photographs, Leo Rosenthal's "Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima." In this volume, international scholars in political science and film, literary, and cultural studies undertake multifaceted investigations into how Eastwood's diptych reflects war today. Fifteen essays explore the intersection among war films, American history, and Japanese patriotism. They present global attitudes toward war memories, icons, and heroism while offering new perspectives on cinema, photography, journalism, ethics, propaganda, war strategy, leadership, and the war on terror.<br>

  Abstract: Claude Lefort’s essay “Permanence of the Theologico-Political?” in answering the question as to why political philosophers in the modern era make recourse to theological language, suggests that democracy makes possible the identifiable sphere of the political as such through the very appearance of an empty place of sovereignty. As Lefort puts it, “The formula ‘power belongs to no one’ can also be translated into the formula ‘power belongs to none of us.’”¹ This itself generates the need for a symbolic register, a vacuum into which the religious enters, not necessarily as the guarantor of power itself but as a marker<br>

  Abstract: Despite the constitutional separation of church and state—which Jefferson considered his proudest achievement—religion has always played a role in American political life. And it has not always been the organized religious congregations that have been leaders in crossing the line that the Constitution tries to establish. Religion touches deeper; it affects the language through which people express themselves as well as their vision of the nation to which they belong. What is new in the last two decades is the rise of a religious right that has become an active voting bloc bringing into politics social and cultural<br>

  Abstract: As I observed in the introduction, more than any other development over the last two decades the rise of human rights as a universal language of political justification has been taken to herald the imminence, if not the arrival, of a world of cosmopolitan politics. Whether we date the advent of human rights to the revolutionary declarations of the Age of Reason, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, or the Helsinki Accords and their embrace by the Western democracies and a burgeoning third sector in the 1970s, it was only when the collapse of “really existing socialism” left<br>

  Abstract: For many years I was convinced that a clear line should be drawn between documentation and invention, particularly in ethnographic writing, where one’s first obligation is to do justice to the experience of those who welcomed or tolerated one’s presence in their communities. It is all very well borrowing narrative conventions, figurative language, and montage from fiction, poetry, and cinema in order to give life to a text and counteract the deadening effects of academic jargon and abstraction—something I had done in several ethnographic books written for a general rather than specifically academic readership.¹ But such experimentation, I believed,<br>

                  Begriffsgeschichte) as the most appropriate method for the subject of conceptual innovation. Gadamer’s development of hermeneutics as an interpretive method of theories and traditions proved fruitful for many areas of social knowledge.¹ The major contribution of hermeneutics is its ability to articulate the relationship between language and history as traditions. After the linguistic turn, the English school of the history of political theory, exemplified by Quentin Skinner,² developed its own versions of<br>

  Abstract: In the history of cultural development, massive changes in language have often occurred, especially in times of ideological transition and cultural upheaval. These changes can for instance be seen in the Renaissance and the Japanese Meiji period. Similar occurrences have also been noted in China. The vernacular (

This later triggered confrontation and debate among proponents of the new and old literary schools. Due to then-prevailing educational policies adopted by the Chinese<br>

  Book Title: The Last Cannibals-A South American Oral History<br>
  Publisher: University of Texas Press<br>
  Author(s): BASSO ELLEN B.<br>
  Abstract: An especially comprehensive study of Brazilian Amazonian Indian history, The Last Cannibals is the first attempt to understand, through indigenous discourse, the emergence of Upper Xingú society. Drawing on oral documents recorded directly from the native language, Ellen Basso transcribes and analyzes nine traditional Kalapalo stories to offer important insights into Kalapalo historical knowledge and the performance of historical narratives within their nonliterate society. This engaging book challenges the familiar view of biography as a strictly Western literary form. Of special interest are biographies of powerful warriors whose actions led to the emergence of a more recent social order based on restrained behaviors from an earlier time when people were said to be fierce and violent. From these stories, Basso explores how the Kalapalo remember and understand their past and what specific linguistic, psychological, and ideological materials they employ to construct their historical consciousness. Her book will be important reading in anthropology, folklore, linguistics, and South American studies.<br>

  CHAPTER 2  The Language in Storytelling from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7560/708181">The Last Cannibals</a><br>
  Abstract: Kalapalo told me stories from the very first week in Aifa, their settlement. As a novice, my first research goal was to try to learn how to speak to the residents in their own language, and for this purpose I began my work by asking for lists of words for things, using as a translator the single Portuguese-speaking man present in the settlement at that time and the only person who used a Portuguese name. In 1952, Antonio had been taken as a teenager to live in Rio de Janeiro along with his sister Dyaqui, who was being married to<br>

  TWO  REVISITING DERRIDA, LACAN, AND FOUCAULT from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7560/717985">Why the Humanities Matter</a><br>
  Abstract: In the last chapter, I discussed briefly how, one way or another, a Cartesian and/or Kantian approach to the self and world leads to idealist and/or relativist epistemological dead-ends. In this chapter, I explore more generally how speculative and idealist formulations of language, knowledge, and the self inform much of the theory circulating in humanities departments today that seeks to identify positions of resistance and reclamation within the straightjacket of a so-called late capitalism. To do so, I discuss Sigmund Freud’s metapyschological formulations—

  NINE  CAN MUSIC RESIST? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7560/717985">Why the Humanities Matter</a><br>
  Abstract: There’s much interest in the cultural study of Other music: from East LA Chicano rap, U.S./Mexico border Norteño-techno, to Turkish-German hip-hop. Such interest can lead to interesting musical encounters that give rise to new rhythmic expressions; it can tell us something, too, of distributional paths governed by global capitalism. However, just like the dominant trend in approaches to the study of the self, society, language, translation, and cultural phenomena thus far discussed, so here too we see an enduring presence of a philosophical idealism. Whether identified as an alternative literacy program, as a politics of resistance to global capitalism, or<br>

  TWELVE  Patrimonial Khipu in a Modern Peruvian Village: from:

  Author(s) Salomon Frank<br>
  Abstract: This chapter concerns a central Peruvian community that owns and ceremonially uses inherited cord records in perpetuating kinship corporations directly continuous with those of Inka and perhaps pre-Inka times. We know of these corporations because the village in question, San Andrés de Tupicocha in Huarochirí Province, Peru, is self-described in the only known early-colonial source that explains an Andean religious system in an Andean language, namely, the Quechua Huarochirí Manuscript (ca. 1608; translations include Salomon and Urioste 1991 and Taylor 1987). The cord records, though not themselves of pre-Hispanic antiquity, form a material link in a chain of institutional continuity<br>

  Abstract: The nature of Dutch society and the characteristics of the European state system made the appearance of such newspapers as Jean Luzac’s
                  Gazette de Leydepossible, but they did not guarantee the success of his particular publication. To assure its survival and prosperity, Jean Luzac had to find a special place for his journal in the highly competitive international commercial market for political news. In 1772, the prospectus for a new French-language newspaper promised readers that the editors would digest information from more than 200 other European periodicals.¹ Clearly, late-eighteenth-century readers had a wide choice of newspapers and journals; they<br>

  Book Title: The Deed of Reading-Literature * Writing * Language * Philosophy<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): STEWART GARRETT<br>
  Abstract: To take the measure of literary writing,
         The Deed of Readingconvenes diverse philosophic commentary on the linguistics of literature, with stress on the complementary work of Stanley Cavell and Giorgio Agamben. Sympathetic to recent ventures in form-attentive analysis but resisting an emphasis on so-called surface reading, Stewart explores not some new formalism but the internal pressures of language in formation, registering the verbal infrastructure of literary prose as well as verse. In this mode of "contextual" reading, the context is language itself. Literary phrasing, tapping the speech act's own generative pulse, emerges as a latent philosophy of language in its own right, whereby human subjects, finding no secure place to situate themselves within language, settle for its taking place in, through, and between them.<br>

  Abstract: Language in all its modes—oral, written, print, electronic—claims the central role in Walter J. Ong’s speculations on human culture. His provocative work was honored by his scholarly peers, by the American and French governments, and by readers who came to know his writings not only in English but also through translations into many languages, including Polish and Japanese. He spent his career in St. Louis, and traveled throughout the world to lecture, to conduct research, and to meet with other leading intellectuals (Farrell,

Call it an act of violence, an act of communicative violence, if you will. But is not all language, that is, “impure” language, all language after the Fall, as Benjamin would say, violent? And does he himself not battle and ultimately fail in the face of language: fail either by instrumentalizing it as a tool for communication, or fail in failing to communicate, fail as a communicator, so to speak?<br>

  Book Title: The Light of Knowledge-Literacy Activism and the Politics of Writing in South India<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Cody Francis<br>
  Abstract: The Light of Knowledgeis set primarily in the rural district of Pudukkottai in Tamil Nadu, and it is about activism among laboring women from marginalized castes who have been particularly active as learners and volunteers in the movement. In their endeavors to remake the Tamil countryside through literacy activism, workers in the movement found that their own understanding of the politics of writing and Enlightenment was often transformed as they encountered vastly different notions of language and imaginations of social order. Indeed, while activists of the movement successfully mobilized large numbers of rural women, they did so through logics that often pushed against the very Enlightenment rationality they hoped to foster. Offering a rare behind-the-scenes look at an increasingly important area of social and political activism,The Light of Knowledgebrings tools of linguistic anthropology to engage with critical social theories of the postcolonial state.<br>

  Book Title: Outlaw Rhetoric-Figuring Vernacular Eloquence in Shakespeare's England<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mann Jenny C.<br>
  Abstract: A central feature of English Renaissance humanism was its reverence for classical Latin as the one true form of eloquent expression. Yet sixteenth-century writers increasingly came to believe that England needed an equally distinguished vernacular language to serve its burgeoning national community. Thus, one of the main cultural projects of Renaissance rhetoricians was that of producing a "common" vernacular eloquence, mindful of its classical origins yet self-consciously English in character. The process of vernacularization began during Henry VIII's reign and continued, with fits and starts, late into the seventeenth century. However, as Jenny C. Mann shows in
         Outlaw Rhetoric, this project was beset with problems and conflicts from the start.<br>

  Book Title: Paradigms for a Metaphorology-  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Savage Robert<br>
  Abstract: In
         Paradigms for a Metaphorology, originally published in 1960 and here made available for the first time in English translation, Hans Blumenberg (1920-1996) approaches these questions by examining the relationship between metaphors and concepts. Blumenberg argues for the existence of "absolute metaphors" that cannot be translated back into conceptual language. These metaphors answer the supposedly naïve, theoretically unanswerable questions whose relevance lies quite simply in the fact that they cannot be brushed aside, since we do not pose them ourselves but find them already posed in the ground of our existence. They leap into a void that concepts are unable to fill.<br>

  Abstract: In common parlance the terms “historical interpretation” and “historical representation” are often used interchangeably. The historical text can alternatively be described as an “interpretation” or as a “representation of the past.” Nevertheless, the two terms do not have quite the same meaning. This is clear from the fact that language, either spoken or written, is the prototypical object of interpretation, whereas the object of representation is reality. Texts are interpreted, and landscapes or still lives are represented in paintings made of them. It makes no sense to speak of the “interpretation” of the landscape we see through the windows of<br>

Such a language would be useless for most of human communication. It would leave us with nothing but the unpalatable choice between silence and Babylonian confusion. So let us rejoice in language’s capacity to refer to the world and hail it as one of the main guarantees of successful human communication!<br>

  Author(s) Johnson Valerie B.<br>
  Abstract: This essay applies ecocriticism to the study of neomedieval texts, an approach that I term “ecomedievalism.” Ecomedievalism interlaces study of neomedievalisms through the bifurcated lens of ecocriticism and ecomaterialism.¹ Neomedieval texts continually deploy environmental descriptions and language to develop a sense of an authentic medieval setting, part of the worldbuilding process, yet little critical attention is devoted to analyzing these methods from an ecological perspective. Ecocriticism’s rapid theorization has allowed the field to move beyond the political activism that characterized its origins, and now offers an opportunity to begin academic study of the fictional environments in neomedievalisms.² Consequently, this essay<br>

  Book Title: Edinburgh German Yearbook 9-Archive and Memory in German Literature and Visual Culture<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Osborne Dora<br>
  Abstract: In recent years, the discourse of memory - and of German memory culture in particular - has become increasingly concerned with questions of the archive. An archive can refer to a physical place, the material found there, or the system that orders this material; in its broadest sense, it might refer to something public (records housed in a municipal building), or something private (photographs in a family album). The material and documentary qualities of the archive confer on it an authenticating function attributed only cautiously to memory, but theories of the archive have questioned the status of material, documentary vestiges of the past. Memory and the archive are inextricably linked, but how does this affect the mediation of the past? This volume explores the changing relationship between memory and the archive in German-language literature and culture since 1945. Contributions approach this topic from a range of perspectives (film, visual culture, urban culture, digital technology, as well as literature) and offer illuminating studies of Harun Farocki, Anselm Kiefer, Thomas Demand, Bernd and Hilla Becher, Jürgen Fuchs, Stefan Wolter, and Sasa Stanisic.

It isthe general system of the formation and transformation of statements.”¹ Because statements emerge as meaningful discourse at a given time, their appearance is accompanied by the possibility that they might not appear. They thereby point to the ways in which language is an event, the possibility of something being said or not said, a matter of whether enunciations even take place<br>

  Book Title: Verse and Voice in Byrd's Song Collections of 1588 and 1589-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Smith Jeremy L.<br>
  Abstract: As he grappled with the challenges of composing for various instrumental and vocal ensembles, William Byrd (c. 1540-1623), England's premier Renaissance composer, devoted considerable attention to the poetry and prose of his native language, producing such treasured masterpieces as the hauntingly beautiful "Lulla lullaby"; the infectiously comedic "Though Amarillis dance in green"; and two extraordinarily dramatic Easter anthems. This book, the first full-length study specifically devoted to Byrd's English-texted music, provides a close reading of all of the works he published in the late 1580s, constituting nearly half of his total song output. It delves into the musical, political, literary, and, specifically, the sequential qualities of Byrd's 1588 and 1589 published collections as a whole, revealing, explaining, and interpreting an overall grand narrative, while remaining fully attentive to the particularities of each individual piece. Often deemed "unliterary" and generally considered political only in his approach to Latin texts, which were often of special interest to his fellow Catholics, Byrd was not only an inspired composer who had mastered the challenges of his nation's burgeoning verse, but also one who used his voice in song to foster a more inclusive polity in a time of religious strife.

  Abstract: Although Kafka distrusts his own gift for metaphor, he resorts to metaphorical language both in his fiction and in his autobiographical writings. Metaphors occur to him in what W. B. Yeats called the “foul rag and bone shop of the heart,”¹ and his fiction often germinates from intensely personal images. We can watch him experimenting in his diaries with a tangle of often tormented images, which he, metaphorically of course, likens to the Gordian knot.<br>

  Abstract: When Thomas Jefferson Brown finally decided to make his home in Indian Territory in 1870, he had been there many times before. For months he had been going in on day trips from Arkansas, his grandson mused more than a century later, learning the Indian languages and becoming familiar with the land, people, and opportunities for economic gain. In spite of national boundaries, promises of federal “protection,” and claims to Indian sovereignty, the borders between the nineteenth-century United States and Indian Territory grew increasingly porous, especially following the Civil War. American settlers in and around the territory were scrambling for<br>

  Book Title: Cultural Capital, Language and National Identity in Imperial Spain-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): BINOTTI LUCIA<br>
  Abstract: This innovative study examines the cultural mechanisms in early modern Spain that led to the translation, imitation and selective adoption of the values embodied by the Italian Renaissance. These mechanisms served to delineate a national tradition that addressed the needs of a changing society and gave a "Spanish" physiognomy to the Italian experience, which ultimately led to the Golden Age. By examining such important texts as the sentimental fictions of Diego de San Pedro and Juan de Flores, the Spanish translation of Orlando Furioso, Don Quixote, and the Polifemo, Binotti first describes the conditions imposed on book production by both the expectations of an elite audience and the limitations of the printing market while outlining the process of the creation of an expressive poetic language and the quest for literary models. She then looks at Ambrosio de Morales' chronicles and Bernardo de Aldrete's Del Origen, showing how a cultural discourse founded on foreign scholarship paved the way for the establishment of innovative-and autochtonous-methods of historical and scientific analysis in the early seventeenth-century. LUCIA BINOTTI is an associate professor in the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.<br>

Here I shall be looking at some ways of being careful that have commended themselves to two of the few Portuguese poets who have yet succeeded in breaking through the glass ceiling of their still rather unfashionable language and been admitted to the Western canon: Francisco Sá de Miranda (1481?–1558) and Luís de Camões (

  Abstract: Desire was a defining element in early Enlightenment medievalisms, I have argued, because these medievalisms often expressed their longing for the past in an erotic or sexualized language. Embodied, performative forms of knowledge represented one response to the desire to physically touch the past. The 
                  roman genre provided another response to this erotization of the past due to its association with illicit desire and its supposedly seductive, corrupting power.

While this revival, which forms part of a wider intensification of interest in language, rhetoric and the study of the biblical text, is visible all over Western Europe, scholars and texts of English origin are particularly well-represented in the extant source material.¹ This chapter focuses on the learning process involved in this type of cross-religious language acquisition.

  Author(s) Zadoff Ethan<br>
  Abstract: The study of medieval law occupies a unique niche within traditional academic discourse. A concentration on philological precision, challenges pertaining to manuscript study, and the ʹinternal languageʹ of jurisprudence have at times over-shadowed the consideration of the wider societal implications of medieval law and curtailed its use in the investigation of broad themes of social and cultural history. This is particularly true of the thirteenth-century Anglo-Jewish legal corpus, the study of which has been relegated to a select few articles and studies.¹<br>

  Book Title: Rethinking Hanslick-Music, Formalism, and Expression<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Marx Wolfgang<br>
  Abstract: Rethinking Hanslick: Music, Formalism, and Expression' is the first extensive English-language study devoted to Eduard Hanslick--a seminal figure in nineteenth-century musical life. Bringing together eminent scholars from several disciplines, this volume examines Hanslick's contribution to the aesthetics and philosophy of music and looks anew at his literary interests. The essays embrace ways of thinking about Hanslick's writings that go beyond the polarities that have long marked discussion of his work such as form/expression, absolute/program music, objectivity/subjectivity, and formalist/hermeneutic criticism. This approach takes into consideration both Hanslick's important 'On the Musically Beautiful' and his critical and autobiographical writings, demonstrating Hanslick's rich insights into the context in which a musical work is composed, performed, and received. 'Rethinking Hanslick' serves as an invaluable companion to Hanslick's prodigious scholarship and criticism, deepening our understanding of the major themes and ideas of one of the most influential music critics of the nineteenth century.

  Book Title: Love Poetry in the Spanish Golden Age-Eros, Eris and Empire<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): TORRES ISABEL<br>
  Abstract: This work engages with a broader evaluation of early modern poetics that foregrounds the processes rather than the products of thinking. The locus of the study is the Imperial 'home' space, where love poetry meets early modern empire at the inception of a very conflicted national consciousness, and where the vernacular language, Castilian, emerges in the encounter as a strategic site of national and imperial identity. The political is, therefore, a pervasive presence, teased out where relevant in recognition of the poet's sensitivity to the ideologies within which writing comes into being. But the primary commitment of the book is to lyric poetry, and to poets, individually and in their dynamic interconnectedness. Moving beyond a re-evaluation of critical responses to four major poets of the period (Garcilaso de la Vega, Herrera, Góngora and Quevedo), this study disengages respectfully with the substantial body of biographical research that continues to impact upon our understanding of the genre, and renegotiates the Foucauldian concept of the 'epistemic break', often associated with the anti-mimetic impulses of the Baroque. This more flexible model accommodates the multiperspectivism that interrogated Imperial ideology even in the earliest sixteenth-century poetry, and allows for the exploration of new horizons in interpretation.

  Book Title: Narratives of Identity in Alban Berg's "Lulu"-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): dos Santos Silvio J.<br>
  Abstract: Exploring the crossroads between autobiographical narrative and musical composition, this book examines Berg's transformation of Frank Wedekind's Erdgeist (1895) and Die Büchse der Pandora/ (1904) -- the plays used in the formation of the libretto for Lulu -- according to notions of gender identity, social customs, and the aesthetics of modernity in Vienna of the 1920s and 1930s. While Berg modernized several aspects of the plays by Wedekind and incorporated serial techniques of composition from Arnold Schoenberg, he never let go of the idealistic Wagnerian perspectives of his youth. In fact, he went as far as reconfiguring aspects of Richard Wagner's life as an ideal identity to be played out in the compositional process. In the process of composing the opera, Berg also reflected on the most important cultural figures in fin-de-siècle Vienna that affected his worldview, including Karl Kraus, Emil Lucka, Otto Weininger, and others. Adopting an approach that combines a systematic analysis of Berg's numerous sketches for Lulu, correspondence, and the finished work with interpretive models drawn from cultural studies and philosophy, this book elucidates the ways in which Berg grappled with his self-image as an "incorrigible romantic" (unverbesserliche Romantiker) at the end of his life, explaining aspects of his musical language that have been considered strange or anomalous in the scholarship.

  Book Title: Modern German Thought from Kant to Habermas-An Annotated German-Language Reader<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Large Duncan<br>
  Abstract: German-language thinkers such as Kant, Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud are central to modernity. Yet their reception in the English-speaking world has largely depended on translations, a situation that has often hampered full engagement with the rhetorical and philosophical complexity of the German history of ideas. The present volume, the first of its kind, is a response to this situation. After an introduction charting the remarkable flowering of German-language thought since the eighteenth century, it offers extracts -- in the original German -- from sixteen major philosophical texts, with extensive introductions and annotations in English. All extracts are carefully chosen to introduce the individual thinkers while allowing the reader to pursue broader themes such as the fate of reason or the history of modern selfhood. The book offers students and scholars of German a complement to linguistic, historical, and literary study by giving them access to the wealth of German-language philosophy. It represents a new way into the work of a succession of thinkers who have defined modern philosophy and thus remain of crucial relevance today. The philosophers: Immanuel Kant, G. W. F. Hegel, Ludwig Feuerbach, Karl Marx, Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, Martin Heidegger, Walter Benjamin, Georg Lukács, Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno, Jürgen Habermas. Henk de Berg is Professor of German at the University of Sheffield. Duncan Large is Professor of German at Swansea University.<br>

  Abstract: Heidegger polarizes opinion. To some, he is the most important philosopher of the twentieth century; to others, he is little more than a mystifying word-spinner. The perplexingly difficult nature of his work derives to a significant extent from his exploitation of the resources of the German language, so — even more than with most other philosophers — there is a clear advantage in reading him in the original rather than in translation. In the immediate postwar period, the vogue for Existentialism favored Jean-Paul Sartre (whose early philosophy was largely based, as Hubert L.

  Book Title: El niño en el cine argentino de la postdictadura (1983-2008)-alegoría y nostalgia<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): DUFAYS SOPHIE<br>
  Abstract: Este libro constituye la primera monografía dedicada al papel del niño en el cine latinoamericano. El análisis detallado de una decena de películas argentinas de la post-dictadura dirigidas entre 1983 y 2008, incluyendo tanto clásicas (La historia oficial, Un lugar en el mundo) como olvidadas (Amigomio, El rigor del destino), revela cómo la mirada y el lenguaje del niño son puestos al servicio de una alegoría nostálgica, estructurada en torno a la memoria o al lenguaje verbal y vinculada a la figura del padre ausente. Dufays combina los análisis fílmicos con una amplia reflexión teórica sobre las cuatro nociones clave de alegoría, melancolía, nostalgia y duelo y los articula con una genealogía de la figura alegórica del niño en las tradiciones narrativas latinoamericanas. Este recorrido permite al lector explorar las significaciones simbólicas y discursivas que el personaje infantil, la infancia y la familia han adquirido en el cine y en el contexto postdictatorial argentino. Sophie Dufays es investigadora postdoctoral del Fondo Nacional de Investigación Científica de Bélgica, en la Universidad de Louvain-la-Neuve. This book is the first monograph devoted to the role of the child in Latin American cinema. Through close analysis of about ten Argentine fiction films of the post-dictatorship period directed between 1983 and 2008, including both classic such as The Official Story and A Place in the World) and forgotten works such as Amigomío and El rigor del destino. Dufays shows how the child's gaze and language are a means of focusing a nostalgic form of allegory, structured around either memory or verbal language, and related to the figure of the absent father. In combining these analyses with a wide theoretical articulation of four key notions (allegory, melancholy, mourning and nostalgia) and with a genealogy of the allegorical child character in Latin American narrative traditions, Relatos de infancia allows the reader to explore the meanings that childhood and family have come to acquire in cinema, particularly in the Argentine post-dictatorial context.

  Book Title: Arno Schmidt's 'Zettel's Traum'-An Analysis<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Langbehn Volker Max<br>
  Abstract: Arno Schmidt (1914-1979) is considered one of the most daring and influential writers of postwar Germany; the Germanist Jeremy Adler has called him a "giant of postwar German literature." Schmidt was awarded the Fontane Prize in 1964 and the Goethe Prize in 1973, and his early fiction has been translated into English to high critical acclaim, but he is not a well-known figure in the English-speaking world, where his complex work remains at the margins of critical inquiry. Volker Langbehn's book introduces Schmidt to the English-speaking audience, with primary emphasis on his most famous novel, 'Zettel's Traum'. One reviewer called the book an "elephantine monster" because of its unconventional size (folio format), length (1334 pages and over 10 million characters), and unique presentation of text in the form of notes, typewritten pages, parallel columns, and collages. The novel narrates the life of the main characters, Daniel Pagenstecher, Paul Jacobi and his wife Wilma, and their teenage daughter Franziska. In discussing the life and works of Edgar Allan Poe, the four engage in the problems connected with a translation of Poe. Langbehn's study investigates how literary language can mediate or account for the world of experiences and for concepts. Schmidt's use of unconventional presentation formats challenges us to analyze how we think about reading and writing literary texts. Instead of viewing such texts as a representation of reality, Schmidt's novel destabilizes this unquestioned mode of representation, posing a radical challenge to what contemporary literary criticism defines as literature. No comprehensive study of 'Zettel's Traum' exists in English. Volker Langbehn is associate professor of German at San Francisco State University.<br>

Goethe’s (and Mephisto’s) power over language is anything but “schwach.” Linguistic dexterity may seem to presuppose no ideology or epistemology. Fun is fun. Still irony, paradox, and virtuosity are all dyadic (not triadic, for instance), and suggest a reliance on binary choices, even if God transcends all opposition between contraries. Irony and<br>

  Abstract: As in the preceding decades, the development of the French-Canadian novel after 1918 was closely connected to the nationalism of Quebec’s Catholic intelligentsia: In 1866 Abbé Henri-Raymond Casgrain demanded that the novel should advocate the French language and Catholicism, as well as concentrate on regional themes, country life, and the memory of Nouvelle-France. Camille Roy’s speech “La nationalisation de la littérature canadienne,” held in 1904 in the Société du parler français, built upon Casgrain’s theses and led the way for virtually all novels produced until 1930. In order to adequately perform its function as a Canadian “épopée chevaleresque” and as<br>

  Author(s) Mathis-Moser Ursula<br>
  Abstract: Oralités-Polyphonix 16, a festival and symposium that took place in Quebec in June 1991, explored fundamental aspects of orality, its forms and functions as well as its specific Québécois character. Orality can operate both in a printed text and in the act of performing, whose most popular manifestation — next to theater and dance — is the chanson. One of the many facets of orality is the euphonic experiment with linguistic material, which has already been touched upon in connection with surrealist and postsurrealist sound effects and language practices (see ch. 17, Mathis-Moser), and which is especially prominent in the works of,<br>

  Author(s) Dupuis Gilles<br>
  Abstract: The concept of 
                  écritures migrantes, or migrant literature, first appeared in Quebec during the 1980s. The expression was and continues to be used today to refer to the literary production of writers who, after immigrating to Canada, decided to settle in Quebec — the only Canadian province with a francophone majority — and to write or at least publish within the framework of the province’s literary institutions. The criteria for classifying a work as migrant literature vary from one source to another. For Daniel Chartier, author of the Dictionnaire des écrivains émigrés au Québec 1800–1999 (2003), language is not a determining<br>

  Abstract: What the foregoing account of the work of some of the major figures in Spanish American poetry around and immediately after the mid-twentieth century seems to illustrate is that two different attitudes towards the production of poetry faced each other. One emerges directly from Paz and has been admirably studied by Thorpe Running in
                  The Critical Poem(1996). The other connects with Neruda’sOdas elementales, the view of poetic language espoused by Parra, and the practice of Cardenal, explored by Alemany Bay inPoesía coloquial hispanoamericana(1997). To see the difference in a nutshell, all that is necessary is to<br>

  Book Title: Goethe Yearbook 19-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): MacLeod Catriona<br>
  Abstract: The ‘Goethe Yearbook’ is a publication of the Goethe Society of North America, encouraging North American Goethe scholarship by publishing original English-language contributions to the understanding of Goethe and other authors of the ‘Goethezeit’ while also welcoming contributions from scholars around the world. Volume 19 of the ‘Goethe Yearbook’ continues to investigate the connection between Goethe's scientific theories and his aesthetics, with essays on his optics and his plant morphology. A special section examines the central role that Goethe philology has had in establishing practices that shaped the history of ‘Germanistik’ as a whole. The yearbook also includes essays on legal history and the novella, Goethe ‘Lieder’, esoteric mysticism in ‘Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre’, and Werther's sexual pathology. The volume also includes three essays re-examining Goethe's aesthetics in the context of the history of deconstruction, as well as the customary book review section.

  Book Title: Charles d'Orléans in England, 1415-1440-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Arn Mary-Jo<br>
  Abstract: Charles, duc d'Orléans, prince and poet, was a captive in England for twenty-five years following the battle of Agincourt. The studies in this volume, by European and American scholars, focus on his life and actions during that time, and show him as a serious and learned reader, a cunning political figure (accomplished in the skills that would impress the English nobility around him), and a masterful poet, innovative, witty, and intensely self-aware. Discussion of his manuscripts, his social and political relationships, his extensive library, and his poetry in two languages reveal him as a shrewd observer of life, which in his poetry he describes in ways not seen again until the Renaissance.

  Author(s) Stone Katherine<br>
  Abstract: Writing women’s lives has always been central to the feminist project. In the 1970s confessional and autobiographical writing by women contributed to and popularized a feminist politics of self-discovery, autonomy, and solidarity.¹ Questioning the relationship between language and the subject, the body and culture, female authors asserted the social and historical import of their experiences. Notably, women’s writing provided insight into women’s experiences of war and the Third Reich at a stage when feminist history of the period was still in its infancy.² And now, in the twenty-first century, women writers are continuing to revisit the National Socialist past and<br>

  Author(s) Marshall Sheridan<br>
  Abstract: In this article I examine the place of religious beliefs, and the interrelation between religion and gender, in a selection of twenty-first-century German-language prose fiction written by women. In line with the widespread recognition of a “ religious turn”¹ or “(re)sacralization”² that is transforming political and cultural discourse in the “post-secular society”³ in which we live, the role of religion in contemporary German-language literature is subject to increasing scrutiny. In German literary studies the depiction of Islam in Germanic culture and the history of German-Jewish identity currently receive much more explicit attention than the place of Christian faith.⁴ Julian Preece<br>

  Abstract: Women’s memoirs that share common themes of forced marriage, honor killing, or “crimes of honor” and detail the cruelty and violence to which the protagonist is subjected during her quest to pursue a “Western” lifestyle have been a part of the German-language literary landscape for decades. As they are increasingly tied to Islam, however, these memoirs have become especially visible in the twenty-first century.¹ The similarity of these works is reinforced by marketing conventions, including sensational titles like

The Drina does not flow through Srebrenica, but it does flow through Višegrad, one of the first sites of the brutal expulsion of Muslims from northeastern Bosnia. As Zeh struggled to clear her mind of images of bloody corpses floating in the Drina near Višegrad, she turned her thoughts to another German-language<br>

  Book Title: A Companion to Javier Marías-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): HERZBERGER DAVID K.<br>
  Abstract: This book provides the most comprehensive study to date of the full range of Marías' writing, including discussion and analysis of his literary and intellectual formation, his development as a novelist and short story writer, and his unique perspective offered in nearly twenty-five years of newspaper columns on topics ranging from religion to football. Above all, Marías is examined as a writer of fictions. As a translator of several canonical works from English to Spanish, Marías came to appreciate the preciseness of words as well as their ambiguity, their capacity to represent as well as their propensity to distort. The author examines Marías's constant awareness of how language can be used to construct stories as the foundation for engaging the world as well as for imagining it. The nature of Marías's storytelling, and the way in which he imagines, form the principal focus of this Companion. David K.

Little is known about his early years, but he entered the University of Tennessee at the age of 17 and graduated in 1884. He remained at the university for the next four years as an instructor in modern and classical languages, thereby acquiring a linguistic facility that was to prove invaluable in his later work.

  Abstract: The past three decades have witnessed a great deal of scholarly activity under the label of “sociolinguistics.”¹ Yet the barrier between sociology and linguistics remains as firm as ever. In their studies of speech communities, linguists have as often as not tried to create their own sociology, with curious results; and a vanishingly small number of sociologists have made use of the tools of linguistic analysis.² On the sociological side, this is not too severe a limitation.

  Book Title: Hybrid Renaissance-Culture, Language, Architecture<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burke Peter<br>
  Abstract: Hybrid Renaissance presents the Renaissance in Italy, elsewhere in Europe and in the world beyond Europe as an example of cultural hybridization. It is impossible to give a clear definition of either of the two key concepts used in this book, “hybridization" and “Renaissance". Roughly speaking, hybridity refers to something new that emerges from the combination of diverse older elements. The term “hybridization" is preferable to “hybridity" because it refers to a process rather than to a state, and also because it encourages the writer and the readers alike to think in terms of more or less rather than of presence versus absence. The book begins with a discussion of the concept of cultural hybridity and a cluster of other concepts related to it. Then comes a geography of hybridity, focusing on three locales: courts, major cities (whether ports or capitals) and frontiers. There follow six chapters about the hybrid Renaissance in different fields: architecture, painting and sculpture, languages, literatures, music, philosophy and law and finally religion. The essay concludes with a brief account of attempts to resist hybridization or to purify cultures or domains from what was already hybridized<br>

Journal Title: Ethics<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: et.2002.112.issue-2<br>
Date: 01 2002<br>
Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: The necessity of both solidarity and proceduralism thus holds for both distributive and criminal justice. In the end, Ricoeur remains committed to notions that ground the just polity in community and mutual sharing without thinking that these notions require us to dispense with the formalism of procedures of justice. While the latter are not sufficient on their own to create or sustain a just society, while, indeed, formal procedures always presuppose some conception of the good, procedural conceptions allow us to recognize each other as subjects of rights. Although it is not always clear that Ricoeur succeeds in reconciling Rawls and Walzer or Habermas and Gadamer, he does provide a fresh perspective on current debates within his own interesting account of the structure of moral action.<br>

Abstract: Ahearn, always a perceptive writer, brings out a fear that many linguistic anthropologists have but rarely expressthe fear of being assimilated to sociocultural anthropology and thus losing their identity through the forfeiting of their specificity. This is the flip side of William Labovs original wish that sociolinguistics might disappear once linguistics agreed to see language as a social phenomenon (that this has not happened is both an indictment of linguistics narrowmindedness and a validation of Labovs and other sociolinguists efforts to develop sociolinguistics into a vibrant independent field). The question then arises why we should worry about being assimilated. Shouldnt we, on the contrary, welcome such a possibility, to be seen as a validation of our work or as the mainstreaming of our concerns? The problem is not in the future, which cannot be predicted, but in the past. Everything we know from our earlier experiences warns us that an anthropology without a distinct group of language specialists is likely to be an anthropology with a nave understanding of communication. We have seen it happen already. When anthropology departments decide not to have a linguistic subfield, thinking that they dont need one, their students tend to take language for granted, identifying it with a vague notion of discourse. It is for this reason that we need to sharpen our historical, theoretical, and methodological understanding of what it means to study language as culture. We owe it first to our students.<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur gets the relation of critique and reason right, in Bourgeois’s eyes, as a philosopher who sees imagination tied to thinking at the boundary (not limit) of reason. In a chapter examining Derrida’s views on “sign, time, and trace” (chap. 7), Bourgeois elaborates Derrida’s view that Edmund Husserl’s distinction between meaningful expression and sign depends on a stable borderline between primary and secondary memory (or retention and recollection) in his theory of “the living present” (or duration), which, Derrida asserts, is phenomenologically unavailable. In light of this analysis, Bourgeois draws an interesting contrast between Derrida’s insistence on a discrete closure of meaning and Ricoeur’s theory of language and imagination based in a view of the living present of meaning and experience that refuses such discrete closure. Once more, however, Bourgeois overreaches when he attempts to identify these accurately drawn contrasts with the limit/boundary distinction. In Bourgeois’s reading of Ricoeur, imagination does not produce reason from below (as in Heidegger); rather, “reason itself limits knowledge to experience from above, putting the imagination in a central position both in knowledge and thinking” (p. 131). A productive imagination of living metaphor takes place at the boundary of reason, allowing the living present in meaning and action to escape deconstruction’s critique while still incorporating a positive relation to alterity. Nevertheless, Bourgeois may be drawing the wrong conclusion about these contrasts, for it seems possible to read both Ricoeur and Derrida as seeking to work at the boundary (not limit) of reason and to think somehow the presentation of the Idea in the Kantian sense. Whereas Ricoeur’s theory of metaphor and narrative allows him to present the semantic content of the Ideas of Reason positively, these remain for Derrida (as for Kant) unrepresentable, or “the impossible.” This problem has been Derrida’s enduring concern since his 1962
   Introduction to Husserl’s “The Origin of Geometry.”The real difference between the thought of Ricoeur and Derrida is the distinctive way each thinker supplements phenomenology to take into account the creativity of meaning at the boundary of reason. For Derrida, it is thedifféranceof deconstruction; for Ricoeur, the graft of hermeneutics.<br>

Abstract: For the notion of strategic essentialism, see Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, “Subaltern Studies: Deconstructing Historiography,” in her
            The Spivak Reader, 214–21. Serene Jones has drawn attention to the fact that the poststructuralist theoretical assumptions about the always oppressive nature of binarisms do not necessarily hold up under the pressures of concrete political struggles and that, in order to strengthen the bond of solidarity for a coalition of diverse social and cultural identities, what is called for is some kind of grand narrative that clearly defines the powers to be resisted and dismantled. I think this applies to a coalition of different religious identities as well.

Abstract: Nevertheless, empiricism does not have the last word—it perhaps never has the last word, not even in what might be called “positivist empiricism,” and certainly not in practical theology, as this discipline is characterized by the interaction between empiricism and normativeness. We both share this conviction—the fifth characteristic. Therefore human rights—no matter how contested they are, which is neither surprising nor extraordinary—offer an important perspective, as the normative criteria they embody always require critical and constructive reflection. In the last part of the article I have even presented them as regulative principles of truth and justice, as a result of which they offer a kind of worldview‐related and morality‐related infrastructure for the social institutions that determine human actions in societal and personal life—the sixth characteristic. After all, for both Browning and me the ultimate issue is—the seventh characteristic—the vitality of the Christian tradition in terms of relevance and identity in the context of a multicivilization society.<br>

Abstract: Whatever normative conclusions may be drawn in the end, theological ethicists ignore the unique situation of children and childhood at their own peril. Neglecting such marginalized groups as women and minorities weakened the voice of theological ethics in the past, both by silently playing into larger social wrongs and by failing to learn and grow from those silenced. Childhood in the United States and the world presents theological ethics today with a new and different but just as acute social challenge. Methodologically, since children cannot speak up as fully as can adults for themselves, theological ethicists should engage as deeply as possible with children’s actual social experiences, including through the sophisticated observational work of the human sciences, in order more creatively to understand and respond. Substantively, childhood demands at the very least renewed attention to the asymmetrical tensions of human moral responsibility, the senses in which others demand of those around them creative self‐transformation. This childist gesture of responsiveness and self‐critique has already begun to animate the human sciences. How much more, then, should it be welcomed and deepened further by Christian ethicists, who in one way or another trace a transformed world to the possibilities incarnated in an infant’s birth.<br>

Author(s): Kern Stephen <br>
Abstract: Kern’s analysis is lucid and his thesis is ultimately persuasive. He argues that “the novel is emphatically historical in capturing a new sense of the complexity and uncertainty of causal understanding” as he traces the “sensitivity” of contemporary authors like Don DeLillo to “the significance of the new technologies of transportation, communication and investigation that transformed causal understanding in modern society” (p. 369). This is an observation with which many literary critics would agree. There are resemblances here to the methodology deployed by Ronald Thomas in his seminal and startlingly successful work
   Detective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science(Cambridge, 1999): narrative registers in its very construction the pressures of scientific and epistemological change. Yet a comparison with Thomas’s work reveals perhaps one of the few flaws of Kern’s study. IfA Cultural History of Causalityis directed toward the historian of science, one must question whether novels are ever really adequate source material for the construction of a hypothesis regarding nonfictional understandings of causality and probability. Paul Ricoeur reminds us inTime and Narrative(Chicago, 1984–1988) that literature has been seen since ancient times as “an ethical laboratory where the artist pursues through the mode of fiction experimentation with values” (Vol. 1, p. 59): fiction is thus both tethered to, yet at the same time distinct from, the world of the actual and the real. Kern acknowledges this to be so, yet his theory of mimesis, of realistic representation, seems to exclude any genuine engagement with tropes of playfulness, indeterminacy, symbolism, and ambiguity that mark literature just as deeply as any desire to replicate the real. Kern notes that he relies “primarily on novels by male authors about male murderers, because [his] method is comparative and requires controlling variables to focus on historical change” (p. 21). This seems to evade a broader question about the extent to which novels can be understood as “evidence” in any sense at all, or whether Kern should be focusing on trial reports rather than their fictionalized representations. This difficulty would be obviated if the focus of the work were an understanding of the impact of developments in scientific theory on narrative form, yet Kern seems reluctant to move fully in this direction. And indeed, if the ideal reader ofA Cultural History of Causalityis in fact a literary critic, he or she may be inclined to probe a number of Kern’s other assumptions as well—he is perhaps a little too inclined to assert that the Victorian novel is artistically “tidy,” that its patterns of closure are always neat and carefully wrought, as an expression of what Thomas Vargish has called “the providential aesthetic” in his study of the same name (Virginia, 1985). Scholars of nineteenth‐century fiction may perhaps feel that Kern’s descriptions of such neat closures sit uncomfortably with their readings ofBleak House(which is as much about the loss and destruction of evidence as it is about its recovery and careful explication) orOur Mutual FriendorDaniel DerondaorThe Brothers Karamazov(each of which problematizes our sense of a character’s relentless movement toward transgression, judgment, and punishment or acquittal). One is left with a sense that Kern occasionally deploys the term “Victorian” in a rather unsophisticated fashion: as Thomas has shown inDetective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science,even the most carefully crafted detective story of the nineteenth century can raise for readers and critics crucial questions about individual and national identity and the power of public surveillance. Yet these criticisms should not undermine a reader’s sense of Kern’s achievement in this book: it is a vast, ambitious attempt to effect a synthesis of scientific thought and literary experimentation, and on the whole it succeeds well.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: In a first reading of the book, I was critical of this emphasis on moral motivations, since it seemed to be overburdened by a psychological approach. But, on a second reading, I had to refrain from my critique. Ricoeur makes the point that he has no intention to “take the place of a resolution for the perplexities raised by the very concept of a struggle, still less of a resolution of the conflicts” (218). In other words, Ricoeur is proposing a well‐needed complement to the institutional design trend that has invaded contemporary political philosophy. Contrary to many, he stands before the most perplexing issue of recognition with eyes wide open: indeed, demands of recognition may never end and take the form of an “unhappy consciousness” (218). One can try to resolve this potential inflation of claims by sorting out political and substantive issues. But a solution that takes only this path could create vast areas of frustration that canny elites have learned to fuel, or come to neglect recognition claims on the grounds that they hide a Pandora's box waiting to be opened. I suspect that this neglect mechanism is one of the reasons why so many legitimate recognition claims still languish in limbo as we speak. The course taken by Ricoeur may be difficult to square with the mainstream approach in contemporary political philosophy—political liberalism, to name it—but it nonetheless deserves careful attention.<br>

Abstract: Three general features of this method can be noted in advance. First, this method must be immanent or internal to its subject matter. Dialectical theorists reject outright the idea that the thinker can occupy some privileged Archimedean point outside the subject of investigation. … A second feature of dialectical method is its dialogical character. Theorizing is an activity taking place not simply within the mind but between minds. Thinking is dialogical because it always takes the form of an exchange or a conversation between ourselves, our contemporaries, and our predecessors. … Third, the dialogical element is related to the historical dimension of theory.

Abstract: My encounter with this student suggests another way of thinking about the political value of rewriting. Countering all the more blasé signals my students were giving me that it was most naive to think the retelling of stories from another point of view could have any political impact, it is evidence that women’s rewritings of classic texts can still affect young women, still make them think and make them want to contribute to the discussions, the debates that shape the public sphere. Although we need, of course, to factor in serendipity—the student was on holiday and thought she had discovered a little‐known book when in fact it was a
      New York Timesbest seller—there is definitely a sense in which her discovery marked a moment in her life and signals the development of a feminist consciousness (broadly defined as a certain awareness of gender identity combined with a critical position in respect to misogyny and patriarchy and a conviction that things can be changed). There is no denying that increasing individualization at all levels of society has caused the loss of a sense of collective action and political projects. This is equally true for ideas of improvement, emancipation, and modernization, the responsibility of which has largely been shifted to the individual, whose “human rights,” as Bauman argues, are redefined as “the right of individuals to stay different and to pick and choose at will their own models of happiness and fitting life‐style” (2000;2005, 29). In this deregulated and privatized sociopolitical context that knows no common cause, re‐vision can only fail to formulate enabling fictions for a better future for all. Yet in its capacity to speak to individuals, it can still draw them into visions of community and collectivity. Re‐vision may thus not be the lifeline that is to haul us out of patriarchy any more, but as a structure of address that engages readers into contemplating differences, it remains one of the ways in which we keep sane and critical and thinking, moved by the stories of long‐forgotten lives into participating in an open public sphere.<br>

Abstract: In this article, we have argued that the application of library practice requires a suspension of truth. We support this by introducing a new theory of truth that is rooted in historicism. One of the overarching missions of library practice is to acquire, manage, preserve, and make accessible human knowledge. While there are pragmatic and sociopolitical considerations that often constrict fulfillment of this mission, the public purpose of librarianship in a free and open society nonetheless dictates that materials be made accessible regardless of what the society at the current time or the majority of people within a culturally defined place consider as true.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] I wish to thank the editors of the AHR, first, for inviting me to consider the issues in this essay, second, for the helpful comments of Acting Editor Jeffrey Wasserstrom, and, third, for the quite stimulating commentary of several anonymous reviewers. 1 See Eric Foner, ed., The New American History (Philadelphia, 1990); Foner, ed., The New American History, rev. and expanded edn.

Beard.4 But during the 1970s, the claims being made for a national mind or culture were challenged by social historians. Intellectual history was chastened and transformed by the confrontation with social history. Eschewing their former embrace of synthesis, intellectual historians pulled back to study more precisely defined themes and thinkers.5 Not only intellectual history but other subfields accommodated social history's provocation to rethink conventional gen- eralizations. In addition, a professional, even "social-scientific," concern for precision and specificity of reference collaborated-sometimes with forethought, often not-with a sharpened awareness of difference and conflict that came from social movements outside the academy to undermine older composite narratives. Neither the frame supplied by Charles and Mary Beard in The Rise of American Civilization (1927), with its dramatic narrative of conflict between the "people" and the "interests," nor the consensual pluralism that succeeded that interpretation in the 1950s survived.6 If the consensus historians underplayed conflict, the Beards' approach, for all of its sympathy for the dispossessed, was found to be inadequate as well. Their narrative revealed little feel for the diversity of Americans, and it paid scant attention to non-whites. Most important of all, while their narrative voice was sympathetic, one did not discover the quotidian life or hear the voices of those groups that have found voice in more recent historiography. Judged by newer historiographical expectations, The Rise of American Civilization seemed "thin," compared with the increasingly popular "thick" description that was built, in part, on the enormously influential anthropological work of Clifford Geertz.7 In the past quarter century, there has been a proliferation of exciting new research, much of it bringing previously overlooked or explicitly excluded groups and events into the light of history. The number and variety of American stories multiplied. Suddenly, there were histories where there had been none or where the available histories had not been attended to by professional historians: histories of African Americans in the era of slavery and beyond; of Native Americans; of workers at home in their communities, at work, and at play; of women at home and outside of the home and of gender relations more generally; of consumption as well as production; of ethnic minorities and "borderlands"; of popular culture and other "marginal" forms of cultural production; of objects and material culture; of whites and whiteness as historical subjects; of non-state international and intercultural relations; and much more. [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 4Frederick Jackson Turner never completed a major synthesis, but one can see how he might have done that work in his posthumously published The United States, 1830-1850 (New York, 1935); Charles A. Beard and Mary R. Beard, The Rise of American Civilization (1927; 2 volumes in 1, New York, 1930).. In fact, the Beards participated in this shift with the publication of The American Spirit: A Study of the Idea of Civilization in the United States (New York, 1942). 5 For an early anticipation of this development-from the point of view of intellectual history-see Lawrence Veysey, "Intellectual History and the New Social History," in Paul K. Conkin and John Higham, eds., New Directions in American Intellectual History (Baltimore, Md., 1979), 3-26. See also, in the same volume, David A.

These developments were occurring at a moment when the number of American historians was expanding to an unprecedented degree. Disciplinary expansion both allowed and prompted increased specialization. And that worried some, who began to speak of hyperspecialization and fragmentation. The structure of specialization derived in large part from the impact of a social history that often fused the group-based particularity of focus with ideological commitments to class and identity-based social movements. This pattern of work discouraged the integration of particular histories into some kind of synthesis.8 Traditionalists, perhaps not surprisingly, were unnerved by these develop- ments.9 But even some proponents of the newer history worried. Early on, Herbert G. Gutman, one of the leading figures in the movement to write a history that included all Americans and that recognized differences-class, ethnic, racial, gender-was concerned that instead of enriching and enlarging the usable history of the United States, the new scholarship was failing to do that, perhaps making it in fact less usable. The "new social history," he wrote in the introduction to his collection of pioneering essays in the field, "suffers from a very limiting overspe- cialization." Take an Irish-born Catholic female textile worker and union organizer in Fall River involved in a disorderly strike in 1875. She might be the subject of nearly a dozen sub-specializations, which would, he feared, "wash out the wholeness that is essential to understanding human behavior."10 Later, in the wake of a national meeting of writers at which historians and history seemed to be largely ignored in discussions of the political and cultural situation in the aftermath of Richard Nixon, Gutman mused aloud in the pages of The Nation over whether the failure of historians to incorporate social history's findings into a new synthesis had seriously diminished, even evacuated, history's possible contribution to public debate."1 In the mid-1980s, in what turned out to be a controversial pair of articles, I raised a related question: how might one construct the (to my mind) needed synthesis of recent historiography on the United States.12 There was considerable negative reaction to those articles, coming from two different positions.

These arguments were equated with a carelessness about scholarly rigor.13 The other, and more widespread position, focused on the risks of a national narrative itself. It was evidently feared that such a narrative would, by definition, re-exclude those groups and themes that had so recently been brought under the umbrella of history and would re-inscribe a "master narrative" dominated by white, elite males.14 By the end of the 1980s, however, the question of synthesis had become less controversial. The issue became more practical, more professional in some sense: how to do it and how to do it within the parameters of inclusion that had been central to the discussion from the beginning. It was on this note that Alice Kessler-Harris, the author of the chapter on social history in The New American History (1990 edition), addressed the question. In the last section of her essay, with the section title of "The Problem of Synthesis," she acknowledged the problem and explored various possible ways to overcome "fragmentation" and move toward synthesis.15 A different issue emerged in the 1990s. Poststructuralist literary and cultural theory, sometimes broadly and even more vaguely characterized as postmodernism, was and is suspicious of any aspiration toward a comprehensive narrative. It is to this body of theory that we owe the commonplace use and misuse of the epithet "master narrative."16 These theories have been rather slow to penetrate workaday historical practice among American historians. Levels and types of awareness of them vary: from shocked indignation at the whole idea, to vague awareness and thoughtless dismissal, to intellectual fascination largely in isolation from the making of one's own histories. In his recent book, Beyond the Great Story: History as Text and Discourse (1995), Robert Berkhofer seeks to force more attention to these issues. Insistently, but not always consistently, he urges historians to recognize the dimensions of the postmodern crisis that surrounds them. He seems more interested in sounding the alarm about the quicksand before us than in guiding us [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 13 Eric H.

But either way, he intends to challenge the very possibility of narrative synthesis.17 While these worries, proposals, and polemics were being fashioned, the daily work of historians proceeded. Among the products of that work have been a good number of explicitly synthetic volumes. There is, of course, no clear or settled notion of what defines a work of synthesis. I have used a rather generous definition. Some of the books I am calling synthetic might alternatively be designated as monographs-archivally based but exceptionally ambitious books that tackle big questions and seek to frame a large field or to provide an interpretation for an audience well beyond specialists. Others are more obviously synthetic, relying heavily on secondary literature to establish the state of the art in a broad field for a wide audience, including, often, students and the general public. With this diversity of form, purpose, and audience in mind-as well as a concern for a reasonable distribution of fields and periods-I have, with the help of the editors of the American Historical Review, selected a few recent synthetic works for examina- tion.18 The very existence of these books mutes the question of whether we need synthetic works or whether, under the constraints of present historiographical practice, synthesis is possible. In fact, the seeming proliferation of syntheses at present-and their variousness-suggests that the field of American history is at a formative (or reformative) moment that invites synthesis: the quest for new understandings that has undermined established narratives has now, perhaps, prompted new efforts at crystallizing a very unstable body of historical writing into new syntheses. A different question, however, provides the focus of this essay. What strategies for narrative synthesis are available to historians today? How might we think about the relation between a particular structure of narrative synthesis and the author's purpose or interpretation? How do these different strategies relate to current historiography? What particular work do they do, within the profession and beyond it? And finally I want to ask some questions about the firmness of the boundaries (mostly geographical) that define what is and is not captured in synthetic narratives of U.S. history. These works do not, of course, cover the whole field of synthetic works. More and other books could have been chosen, but these eleven books (and several others mentioned along the way) at least represent different kinds of history, different [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 17 Robert F.

Hine and John Mack Faragher (TheAmerican West). In fact, I have recommended each to non-historians asking for a literate one-volume history of the United States.

Together, the eleven total nearly 6,000 pages of outstanding historical writing. If nothing else, I can conclude that synthetic narrative invites long books. Because I cannot claim special knowledge in any of the fields being synthesized in these books, I do not propose to do the kind of analysis one would find in specialized reviews. Such criticisms that I have will be framed from the position of my interest in synthetic narrative. I say that in part to be honest about my own limitations in appraising these books but also for another, more positive reason. I want to insist that narrative synthesis is a form of knowledge, indeed, a particularly powerful form of creating, not simply summarizing, knowledge. I hope to get past or under the story enough to probe the implications of different modes of structuring a narrative synthesis. The way different narrative strategies construct that knowledge is important. While inclusion is one of the tests our generation will rightly ask of synthesis, there are other important historiographical issues that are embedded in the question of narrative synthesis.19 The more seriously we consider possible narratives of American history, the more we may be prepared to ask questions that press beyond inclusion. We may even be both bold enough and hopeful enough to worry a little about the language of inclusion, if not the principle. Is there perhaps more than a hint of dominant culture noblesse oblige in the language of inclusion? Might not a more sophisticated notion of the temporal and geographical boundaries of American history, including an awareness of the diasporic stories within American history, complicate and enrich the notion of inclusion?20 Can the historical and historiographical terrain be opened a bit more in a way that enables a deeper, denser, and more complex historiographical exploration of justice and difference at the center of American history? Might democracy be the word, the concept, the commitment that will move us in that direction? As I examine the stack of books before me, I propose to keep these issues in mind and to return to them at the end of this essay. JON BUTLER'S Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776 (2000) covers the whole mainland British colonial space and history, and it addresses a wide range of themes. In fact, themes, not time or chronology, organize his story. His brief, often one-word, chapter titles reveal a very distinctive type of synthesis, one immediately accessible to the reader, whether professional or lay: Peoples, Economy, Politics, Things Material, Things Spiritual. It is a reasonable progression, and in each case he brings together a good deal of material. Although his theme is transformation, Butler also claims (following recent historiography) a more inclusive geography, making more of the middle colonies than would have been the case a generation ago. In some ways, his manner of organizing the material topically bears a relation to [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 19 I do not propose to go into theories of narrative or even my own notions, but I will here indicate that my understanding has been greatly influenced by the work of Paul Ricoeur, Time and Narrative, Kathleen McLaughlin and David Pellauer, trans., 3 vols. (Chicago, 1984-88). 20 Such thinking is not restricted to specialists in the profession exploring the theme of diaspora. The novelist Russell Banks has recently argued that the focus for a synthesis of American history ought to be the African diaspora. See "The Star-Spangled Novel," Los Angeles Times, July 2, 2000. AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History 135 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] Richard Hofstadter's posthumously published America at 1750: A Social Portrait (1971).21 But what might have worked for Hofstadter, who was setting the scene for a three-volume narrative history of the United States, works less well for the purposes Butler has in his book. If Hofstadter's book was intended to provide a snapshot that would serve as a starting point, Butler's title ("Becoming America") and his stated intentions announce change as his theme. He means to persuade the reader of a broad pattern of transformation that produced a distinctive and modern society in advance of 1776 and that in turn spawned the first modern revolution. Such an argument demands more complex and careful attention to process and cause than his framing of the book seems to allow. While he has surely gathered together a considerable body of material (his notes run to fifty pages), he has not produced a synthetic narrative of change over time, one that sketches a develop- mental sequence that integrates disparate elements in the interest of a causal interpretation. By bounding each unit of synthesis, Butler is stuck with a structural isolation of topics that undercuts narrative explanation. Given that Butler's theme is transformation, this narrative structure is crippling. For reasons related to structure and style of argument, Butler's claims for American modernity are quite vulnerable. While there are doubtless some specific ways in which the British North American colonies became "modern" before independence, they were not uniformly modern-over space or in all aspects of life. Many historians would readily grant numerous anticipations of modernity by the middle of the eighteenth century, but few would insist, with Butler, that so much modernity had been achieved so soon, implying that only a few pre-modern anomalies remained on the eve of revolution.22 Most give a significant role to the revolution.23 But the most serious problem is not with the phenomena he notices or does not notice, even if there is some real unevenness on this point. Rather, it is Butler's teleology of the modern, combined with his exceedingly loose, elusive, and, as is so often said today, undertheorized definition of modernity. Add to this an unneces- sary but apparently irresistible tendency to claim American uniqueness and "firsts" for nearly everything he identifies as modern in America. He names a number of phenomena that he considers evidences of the modern-polyglot, slaves, cities, market economy, refined crafts and trades, religious pluralism, and "sophisticated politics." Without further historical specification and theoretical precision, one can indulge in reductio ad absurdum. With the exception of religious pluralism, all of these qualities probably described Athens in the age of Aristotle at least as well as the British colonies. In fact, I suspect that Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker, relying on their recent book The Many-Headed Hydra: Sailors, Slaves, Commoners, and the Hidden History of the Revolutionary Atlantic (2000), would argue that the [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 21 Richard Hofstadter, America at 1750: A Social Portrait (New York, 1971). 22 Jon Butler, Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776 (Cambridge, Mass., 2000), 1. 23 See, for example, Gordon S. Wood, The Radicalism of the American Revolution (New York, 1992). Long before, Bernard Bailyn suggested certain developments that Butler would consider modern had developed in the eighteenth century, but he emphasized the unevenness and even paradoxical character of this proto-modernity.

In the end, however, it is diversity, which he tends to equate with multiculturalism, that for Butler makes Americans modern. But if we look around, we cannot but wonder about his claims for a uniquely polyglot society. This assertion may be quite vulnerable from any sight line approaching a global perspective. Can he fairly claim that New York City harbored a level of diversity "never before gathered together"?25 Might not this be as plausibly said of Constantinople during the period covered by Butler's book? And did not the Ottoman Empire-of which Constantinople was the capital-far exceed the religious and ethnic diversity of the British colonies? My point here is partly one of fact, of care in making comparative statements without comparison. More important, however, are the criteria of the modern. Few, if any, major political bodies in the past half millennium more successfully accommodated diversity than the Ottomans, yet that achievement has never brought them recognition for a precocious modernity. One needs greater defini- tional and descriptive specificity to make the argument he claims. Because of the breadth and generality of synthetic narratives, it is especially important to be clear about key concepts. Similarly, he tends to claim the realization of "Americanness"-here equated with some vague notion of modernity-for events that, however interesting in themselves, hardly sustain his assertion that they designated "the American future."26 For example, writing of the French Huguenots, a group he knows well, he notes their assimilation, and he calls this "American."27 Well, of course it is, but so are the endogenous marriages that continue for various groups well into the twentieth century-sometimes because of racial difference and even legislation (as in the case of African Americans) or out of choice, as in the case of Scandinavians in the upper Midwest. Or to take a more ominous subject, it seems a bit fatalistic to say that colonial encroachment on Indian land "predicted" nineteenth-century relations with the Indians.28 Oddly, such a claim, while taking the moral high ground, nonetheless erases the postcolonial history of the United States by denying contingency and thus diminishing both the capacity and moral responsibility of all later actors or potential actors. The twin and linked teleologies of "modern" and "American" produce a distorting and de-historicizing synthesis. If there is a problem with the sort of synthesis Butler has written, what precisely is it? He makes historical claims about patterns and meanings of development on the basis of a narrative structure that effectively isolates and de-historicizes his themes. By not constructing a developmental narrative that integrates the various themes now separated in distinct chapters, the process and complexity of develop- ment is obscured. While his chapters are full of relevant and interesting details of [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 24 Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker, The Many-Headed Hydra: Sailors, Slaves, Commoners, and the Hidden History of the Revolutionary Atlantic (Boston, 2000). 25 Butler, Becoming America, 9. 26 Butler, Becoming America, 36. 27 Butler, Becoming America, 22.

In the absence of a narrative of change to explain and interpret, he resorts for a theme to repeated assertions of "modernity." The issue is not so much the claim for an eighteenth-century American modernity-although I am myself drawn to much more complex, nuanced, and contradictory discussions of that theme-as it is the incapacity of the particular model of synthesis he deploys to advance that theme or argument. Philip D. Morgan's Slave Counterpoint: Black Culture in the Eighteenth-Century Chesapeake and Lowcountry (1998) is at once similar to Butler's and quite different. Both focus tightly in each chapter on a particular topic or theme; there is little play among the different themes in both cases. While Butler's themes propose a reorganization of material, thus giving an impression of freshness, Morgan's quite important questions are phrased in well-established ways. While Butler's structure works against his theme of transformation, Morgan's similar structure better fits his goals for the book, partly because transformation plays a smaller role in his analysis than one might expect. Slave Counterpoint addresses nearly all the issues raised by a half century of vigorous scholarship on the beginnings of slavery, the practices of racial slavery as a labor and social system, and the nature of African-American culture in early America. It is a book of enviable learning: with a seeming total command of the historiography and an impressive knowledge of a substantial archival base, Morgan proceeds to pose (or re-pose) difficult historiographical issues. Again and again, he offers compelling answers. Want to know what scholarship has disclosed about slavery and African-American culture in the eighteenth-century Chesapeake and Lowcountry? Look to Morgan's synthesis of a generation of scholarship. To have done that is to have done a great deal, and he has done it magnificently. Yet one gets the sense of a summary volume, a volume driven by the past, by past questions. Synthesis can either cap a phase of scholarship or initiate another. I think Morgan's book falls into the former category, while Ira Berlin's new book, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (1998), which also relies on a generation of scholarship and addresses many of the same issues, has the potential to become a new starting point. Berlin has captured the shift to an Atlantic perspective that has increasingly characterized scholarship by early modern Europeanists, Africanists, Latin Americanists, and historians of British North America. In this sense, his work, at least the early parts that sketch out and populate the Atlantic littoral, points forward.29 In a dramatic opening section, Berlin, relying more on secondary literatures than does Morgan, locates his story in very broad understandings of time (periodization) and space (the Atlantic world), the dimensions of which are shadowy, almost invisible, in Morgan's account. He locates Africans in an Atlantic history connecting four continents and in a rich and growing historiography reaching out from Europe, Africa, Latin America, and North America.30 One [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 29 Ira Berlin, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (Cambridge, Mass., 1998). 30 Berlin's powerful evocation of the Atlantic builds on many predecessors. At minimum, mention should be made of Philip D. Curtin's The Atlantic Slave Trade: A Census (Madison, Wis., 1969); and The AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 138 Thomas Bender [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] wishes Berlin had sustained this perspective in the later sections. But even if he narrows the story to the territory that later became the United States and loses the multiple histories implied by his portrait of the Atlantic world, the beginnings of stories, whether novels or histories, are heavy with intention and implication that can, I hope, be built upon.31 In fact, the four Atlantic continents remain an always changing aspect of American and African histories. Attending to, or at least recognizing, that larger and continuing extended terrain of American history would enrich the story of the making of African Americans and America, a historiography that is at present too much captured by an implicit and too simple assimilation or "Americanization" model. Nonetheless, Berlin has provided a powerful image of the creation of the Atlantic world and of the origin of modern slavery within it. Morgan has a quite different strategy. His domain is not the Atlantic but the South, or two regions of the South, which he is anxious to reveal as differentiated. Thus his is a comparative history, comparing two regions within the South. Suggesting a certain scientific aspiration, he refers to his delimited space as a kind of laboratory, a site for an "indirect experiment."32 This approach offers him much. He is able to focus tightly on his questions and generally achieves sharply phrased answers. Yet, like any good scientific laboratory, his field of inquiry is almost hermetically sealed. A two-hundred-page part of the book titled "The Black World" begins with a fifteen-page section on "Africans." Yet it is in only one paragraph at the beginning and a few other scattered references that one reads anything about Africa. His story rarely strays east (or south or north or west) of the Maryland/ Virginia and South Carolina boundaries. His comparative method has impressive rigor. Yet one senses that not only does his approach trap him within a particular place, he is also caught within a very confining net woven from the existing historiography. As Walter Johnson pointed out in a review of the book in this journal, his questions are smaller than the stories he has unearthed.33 Much like another important book on African-American history, Herbert G. Gutman's The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom (1976), this book, for all its synthetic aspirations, cannot capture some of its best material within the tightly bounded historiographical questions and issues that frame it.34 As in the case of Berlin's book, Morgan's is quite explicit about time and space. There is a well-thought-out chronology of change, and one of his major arguments is that the South, and thus the black as well as white experience, was not uniform over space. He shows real and important distinctions between the experience of [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] Rise and Fall of the Plantation Complex (New York, 1990; 2d edn., 1998); and John K.

Yet by treating both the temporal and spatial aspects of the story as sites (and very limited ones) rather than as processes of historical making, he weakens the capacity of his local analyses to explain change over time and, to a lesser extent, space. His major explanatory claims appear in the introduction. They are not only brief but also separate from the rich stories he tells and the analyses he makes of historiographical questions.35 The expansiveness of Many Thousands Gone, by contrast, evokes a strong sense of change, of process. It achieves a narrative synthesis of the movement of Africans onto the Atlantic and into the Western hemisphere. The difference between this approach and the tightly controlled analysis crafted by Morgan is striking. Like Morgan's, Michael Schudson's book, The Good Citizen: A History of American Civic Life (1998), is organized around fairly established questions- especially one big question. Has American civic life deteriorated over the course of the past three centuries? Naturally, the question is of a different order than those driving Morgan's analysis. It has not been generated by disciplinary scholarship. It arose out of American public life. Schudson thus draws on history and other disciplines to address directly a public question, one endlessly repeated today and, as he shows, in the past. Schudson himself, we should note, is not a historian. He was trained as a sociologist, and he teaches in a Department of Communication. While he reveals an impressive command of the relevant historiography, historians are not his primary reference group or audience.36 Although I am sure specialists will find some of his formulations to be of considerable historiographical significance and likely to encourage new lines of research, his intention, again, is different: his audience is a general one, and he seeks to bring historical knowledge to bear on a civic issue. What he is doing points toward the most important work that one kind of successful narrative synthesis can do, for the profession and for the public. By openly declaring his address to a public issue and for a public audience, Schudson participates in a very important tradition of historical writing. Some of the very best professional historians of the United States in this century have done precisely that: Frederick Jackson Turner, W. E. B. Du Bois, Charles Beard, and Richard Hofstadter all focused on issues, worries, or preoccupations of fairly general interest to write synthetic works that importantly rephrased fundamental themes in American history. This mutual enrichment of public and professional discourse is perhaps the ideal cultural work of narrative synthesis. Let us hope that historians can do this more often and more effectively. Yet as I make this point, I realize that all of the historians just named, including Schudson himself, were either trained as social scientists or did not recognize a significant boundary between history and the [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 35Morgan, Slave Counterpoint, xv-xxiv. I should note that my concerns about boundary setting in Morgan's book do not apply nearly so much to Philip D. Morgan, "The Black Experience in the British Empire, 1680-1810," in The Oxford History of the British Empire, Vol. 2: The Eighteenth Century, P. J. Marshall, ed. (Oxford, 1998), 465-86. 36 This command is at once impressive and sometimes puzzling. In discussing the Founding and the Constitution, he does not mention Gordon Wood's The Creation of the American Republic, 1776-1787 (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1969). Nor, in writing about the first decades of the nineteenth century, does he mention either of two key books by Robert H. Wiebe, The Opening of American Society: From the Adoption of the Constitution to the Eve of Disunion (New York, 1984); and Self-Rule: A Cultural History of American Democracy (Chicago, 1995).

Is this a mere coincidence, or is it an issue to be addressed by the profession? While I would not place Schudson's book in the same class as the scholarship produced by the short list of great historians, he has written a fine book. It is a book about change over time, and he establishes three eras of citizenship and participa- tion, each clearly defined. He does not devote much attention to how each configuration changes into the next, but he effectively characterizes their differ- ences, even in some very brief summaries, as in the following paragraph from early in the book: Another way to characterize the past three hundred years of political change is to say that the type of authority by which society is governed shifted from personal authority (gentlemen) to interpersonal authority (parties, coalitions, and majorities), to impersonal authority (science, expertise, legal rights, and information) ... The geographical center of politics has shifted from the countryside to the cities to the suburbs and perhaps, today, to "technoburbs," "postsuburbs," or "edge cities," or whatever we name our newer habitations. Correspondingly, the kind of knowledge a good citizen requires has changed: in an age of gentlemen, the citizen's relatively rare entrances into public discussion or controversy could be guided by his knowledge of social position; in the era of rule by majorities, the citizen's voting could be led by the enthusiasm and rhetoric of parties and their most active partisans; in the era of expertise and bureaucracies, the citizens had increasingly to learn to trust their own canvass of newspapers, interest groups, parties, and other sources of knowledge, only occasionally supported by the immediacy of human contact; and in the emerging age of rights, citizens learn to catalog what entitlements they may have and what forms of victimization they may knowingly or unknowingly have experienced.37 This paragraph reveals the argument and the narrative strategy that Schudson uses to undercut the widespread notion of civic decline: rather than a story of decline, it is one of restructuring, one that recalibrates citizenship and civic practice in relation to changing values and social experiences. What some, including me, see as the erosion of our public life and the thinning of American political culture, he presents as a complex rearticulation of expectations and institutions. Whether one fully agrees with Schudson or not, the book and the point of view it ingeniously argues constitutes an important contribution of contemporary civic life. And a narrative strategy of restructuring (as opposed to the usual rise or fall scenarios) deserves a place in the historian's menu of narrative types. "Presentist" purposes may, however, carry the danger of anachronistic readings. Schudson is vulnerable on this score, especially in his consideration of the colonial period. He too easily asks how democratic any phase of political life was. A commitment to explore the fate of democracy in our past-something I endorse- surely includes recognizing when democracy is not an available concept. He might better have asked how the legitimation and exercise of power worked. Indeed, such a deeper historicism would complement his anti-anti-Whig approach. Similarly, while a then-and-now binary invites sometimes interesting questions and offers some illumination of past and present, it also invites problems. Again, one sees this risk in Schudson's work. False categories of judgment are explicitly or implicitly brought to bear.

Voters then were expected to have "local knowledge-not of laws or principles, but of men."38 The binary obscures the role of principles in the past and knowledge of men in the present. Most important of all, it diverts our attention from the principles that it was thought would aid voters in judging character.39 Sometimes, by focusing so much on the party system that we worry about today, he overlooks those important issues that eluded the parties or that parties avoided. Substantive issues-the reason citizenship and civic life are important-are marginalized in his account of the different concepts and patterns of public life. The result, whether intended or not, is a form of consensus history.40 "Progress or decline is not the real question," Schudson concludes.41 He converts that question into one of restructuring that points to his core argument: there must be a fit between forms of citizenship and forms of everyday life, between values and institutions, between aspirations and commitments. It is that historically informed understanding that allows him in his conclusion to speculate in quite promising ways about an evolving pattern of citizenship that may yet serve our collective hopes and needs. Still, his conclusion leaves me uneasy. Like the journalistic coverage of politics today, the substance of political conflict is subordinated to discussion of the "health" of the system, of the institutions and practices. By contrast, the tensions, conflicts, and substantive issues that made politics so important in the development of the United States and in the lives of individuals are at the center of Eric Foner's The Story of American Freedom (1998). Foner's book has an uncanny resemblance to one that at first glance might seem utterly unrelated: Richard Hofstadter's The American Political Tradition and the Men Who Made It.42 Of course, Foner inverts the point Hofstadter sought to make. If Hofstadter famously played down conflict and (less remarked upon) paid little attention to the social making of political ideologies, Foner emphasizes conflict and the changing historical construction and reconstruction of the idea and ideology of freedom. Foner's work is much more explicitly sensitive to social history, even if it parallels Hofstadter's in its interest in ideology and the limits and possibilities of American political culture. While Hofstadter was alternately comic and ironic, bitterly so at times, in The American Political Tradition, Foner's Story of American Freedom is strikingly fair and straightforward. Yet the underlying hope is similar. As James Oakes has perceptively noted, Foner's narrative is undergirded by an unstated but firm liberal ideal of freedom- one that at once shares in an Enlightenment universalism and [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 38 Schudson, Good Citizen, 81. 39 See Joyce Appleby, Inheriting the Revolution: The First Generation of Americans (Cambridge, Mass., 2000). 40 See, for example, his summary judgment of the party system at Schudson, Good Citizen, 132.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 142 Thomas Bender [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] accommodates current concerns for inclusion and regard for difference.43 I would even argue that Hofstadter's own liberal position was closer to Foner's than one might at first suspect. Both appraised American political culture and its prospects from the position of a richer, more textured liberalism than we usually recognize in current debates.44 In thinking about the core issue in Foner's narrative, therefore, it seems fair to consider it to be the quest for a democratic liberalism, insisting on the relevance and indispensability of the modifier inserted before liberalism. One might thus characterize Foner's as a democratic synthesis, which, as I suggested above, offers a stronger and more egalitarian standard of judgment than commonplace invoca- tions of inclusion. It offers as well the implication of voice and empowerment. To Foner, as he indicates in his introduction, "abstract definitions" of freedom are not the focus. His concern is "with the debates and struggles through which freedom acquires concrete meanings, and how understandings of freedom are shaped by, and in turn help to shape, social movements and political and economic events."45 The result is a narrative that is at once focused yet always open to an examination of larger issues, structures, and events that intersect with and often drive his story. It is a dynamic story, filled with actors, with agents making freedom and using freedom. He selects key events or controversies of different eras, events that are widely contested (slavery, labor and property, the role of the state, social movements). Of course, coverage is selective; the gain is the richness deriving from a series of concentrated focal points. In each case, he examines the conflict, the parties contending, and the stakes. He does not hesitate to declare justices and injustices, to name winners and losers, and he does so from a consistently democratic perspective. Foner thus achieves inclusion without the dilution conse- quent with the faux openness characteristic of talk radio and without the postmod- ern hesitations that undermine moral judgment.46 The American West: A New Interpretive History (2000) by Robert V. Hine and John Mack Faragher spans the whole of American history, from "the European invasion" until the present.47 The book is written in the spirit of Frederick Jackson Turner. Instead of lamenting the ambiguity of Turner's conception of the frontier, which after Turner got reduced by rigorous historians to a place, the West, Hine and Faragher embrace its fullness.

Interestingly, this work also comes from a Columbia scholar, however much it is openly acknowledged to have derived largely from his experience at the New School for Social Research.

That openness allows them to tell the history of the United States as a story of successive frontiers, including a fascinating rethinking of American regionalism as urban-centered at the end of the twentieth century.48 In fact, the chapter on the postwar era is a tour de force-imaginative, original, and quite compelling. In Turnerian fashion, they argue that "westering defined America's unique heritage."49 To a very impressive degree, they give substance to this claim, but recent historiography makes that claim, even for western history, problematic. As Hine and Faragher show, in the nineteenth century as well as today, the West (and the United States) was formed by migrations from west to east and south to north, and even in a limited way north to south, as well as east to west. The notion of westering is so strong in American and European history and culture, it is difficult to construct an alternative narrative structure, though no less important for the difficulty.50 This worry does not, however, undercut another summary point they make: the "frontier is our common past."51 The book is grounded in social history. Of all the books under consideration here, The American West is probably the most sensitive to the categories of experience and groups previously excluded from mainstream narratives of Ameri- can history. Their work goes well beyond mere representation of such groups and categories; previously invisible groups, whether Native Americans, migrating women, African-American settlers, working people, or the people of the border- lands, are actors who contributed to the shaping of history. But there are limits to this achievement. While there are multiple positions and voices represented in their narrative, only rarely does their narrative bring the reader inside group life. There is not much inquiry into the interior experience and subjective meanings shared by the various groups identified and recognized.52 While the story could have been situated in a wider context, one that revealed the global reach of the empires or, later, the importance of global markets, in its particular geographical focus the book consistently avoids privileging the English line of settlement. Other settler efforts are considered and sometimes compared. As is often the case with synthetic histories, however, there is a tendency to do the work of inclusion at a particular moment, and then lose the group at issue.

At times, the transnational themes they develop are extremely illuminating. They refer to what would later be characterized by theorists of the global cities as a "dual economy" in describing the role of foreign migrants, especially Chinese, in the nineteenth-century California agricultural economy.53 Likewise the interplay of national and international in their discussion of the Zimmerman telegram inviting Mexico to ally with Germany in World War I and in their discussion of San Francisco's "commercial hinterland."54 But, as in the case of Butler's book, there is a bit of parochialism in making claims of distinction. Perhaps such assertions can be demonstrated, but more rigorous definitions and empirical research than we have here are required to establish, for example, that the United States is today the world's most multicultural society.55 How would it compare with Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, whose citizens speak more than 100 languages and live on almost numberless islands? The social-history approach, whatever its success in representing difference, has in this instance under-represented national political institutions and policies. The development of the West, as Richard White and other historians of the West have pointed out, was profoundly indebted to what western Republicans now call "big government," for water, transportation, Indian removal, and, more recently, direct investment, as in defense contracts and installations and aerospace industries.56 The political economy and the role of markets, as has already been suggested, do not get the attention they deserve. We often overlook how much industry was in the West, and how much western industries-from milling and meatpacking to mining-were integral to the industrial system of the United States. And we forget how much the astonishing productivity of western agriculture enabled the formation of a large urban industrial labor supply. More of these dimensions of western history might have been included if only in the interest in enabling the story better to tell the national experience. If Hine and Faragher encompass both the full geographical and temporal dimensions of western history, Linda Gordon's microhistory builds out from a very delimited western space, the Sonoran highlands of Arizona, to develop a highly innovative narrative synthesis that locates itself at the various and causally interrelated scales of town, region, nation, and the transnational. Her work reminds us that there is a difference between a mere local study and a microhistory. The local histories of villages, towns, and cities, so common in the 1970s, tended to use global concepts but within artificially bounded fields of inquiry. One of the most famous of them all, Kenneth Lockridge's study of Dedham, Massachusetts, offered an isolated inwardness as a principal finding, although it was a finding that derived [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 53Hine and Faragher, American West, 358-60. 54 Hine and Faragher, American West, 395-97, 414.

Mostly, her account is the story of the arrival and fate of Catholic orphans from New York who were to be placed in Catholic homes. The homes were Mexican as well as Catholic, and that was the problem and the focus of conflict. The conflict played out along class, ethnic, religious, and gender lines, and it eventually reached the Supreme Court. It is a compelling and very human narrative, but one that also addresses a whole range of analytical and interpretive issues of broader interest to historians. Bringing the issues of gender, class, and race into relation with each other allows for an appraisal of their relative importance in this particular historical explanation. I think that her story reveals class to be more important than her conclusion argues, but the real point to be made is that only a narrative synthesis that brings diverse threads together will enable the historian and the reader to make this kind of judgment. These complex ends are achieved in part by her adoption of an imaginative literary strategy. Gordon's book is constructed of two types of chapters. One is quite often a broad frame for local events. In these chapters, her perspective as narrator is exterior to the action. The issues addressed are frequently structural and, as often as not, extend beyond the community. Here, one gets an analytical explanation of the relation of local experience to larger national and international cultural, political, and economic developments. Between these chapters, she has crafted others that get inside the culture of the community, providing wonderfully rich, thick descriptions of daily life and the development of the conflict. With oral histories as well as fragmentary documentary evidence, she brings the reader very close to the experience and voices of the community. The play between these accounts and the more conventional chapters produces an unusual but powerful synthesis. Whether a microhistory qualifies as a synthesis, even by my generous definition, may be debated. But the singular relevance of this book for the discussion of synthesis concerns not scale but its literary ambition, the literary experiment that gives structure to the book. Those who would write other syntheses-at various scales-will, I hope, be encouraged, even inspired, to experiment with novel narrative strategies in the interest of more powerful representations of the past. Quintard Taylor presents a third version of western history, In Search of the Racial Frontier: African Americans in the American West, 1528-1990 (1998). He offers a broad synthetic account that characterizes the experiences of African Americans over a very long period of time.

Drawing on a substantial body of scholarship, most of it published in the past quarter century, he aims to "reconstruct the history of African American women and men" in the West over five centuries, although mostly his focus is the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Taylor's central themes are the quest for community by blacks and the relative degrees of freedom and opportunity they find in different times and places. The conjuncture of the map of African-American presence and the conventional history of the West that his story brings out compels rethinking of both African-American and western history. He makes the point, for example, that the issue of Texas independence in 1836 was not simply, as myth, even the more recent multicultural version, would have it: Anglos and Tejanos in Texas confronting a despotic government in Mexico. It was also an Anglo effort to preserve slavery.60 More broadly, the map literally reveals that African Americans in the West were overwhelmingly city and town dwellers, and it is that fact that unifies their experience. The kind of synthetic narrative that he has constructed provides an invaluable service at a particular moment, crystallizing a generation of scholarship, making generalization possible. His work not only informs the public of the dimensions of previously unrecognized histories, it also provides a base for the next generation of scholarship. In a similar way, another recent synthesis, one that focuses on a more narrowly defined but also more developed area of scholarship, reveals the harvest of recent scholarship on work and workers. American Work: Four Centuries of Black and Vhite Labor (1998) by Jacqueline Jones at once brings this rich scholarship to a wider audience and proffers a fresh way of framing the field.61 If The American West, In Search of the Racial Frontier, and American Work cover very long chronological spans, books by David M. Kennedy and Fred Anderson address short periods. Their focus is also quite different, since both concentrate on political and military history. Kennedy's Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945 (1999) addresses what might well be called "high politics," while Anderson's The Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754-1766 (2000) brings social history and high politics into fruitful play, finding in that interaction the terms of his central argument about the nature of power in the British Empire. At the outset, both books locate their stories in a broad international context. Kennedy's book begins at the close of World War I, and the first character introduced is Lance Corporal Adolf Hitler, who was in a military hospital recovering from a poison gas attack when he heard the news of Germany's surrender. The international context thus suggested is obviously central to the half [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 59He explicitly recognizes the issue of intergroup relations, but he equally explicitly indicates that such is not his aim here.

The geography of Washington, D.C., even that of the White House, and the biographies of three men-Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Hitler-are more important to Kennedy's story than the world beyond the borders of the United States or, for that matter, than the American people of his subtitle. One of Kennedy's aims is evidently to urge upon Americans a greater attention to and sense of responsibility in the larger world, yet with the exception of the excellent discussion of the differing explanations of the economic crisis offered by Herbert Hoover and Roosevelt, there is surprisingly little incorporation of inter- national elements into the dynamic of the story. For all the importance of the larger world, for Kennedy, as for many Americans, whether professional historians or not, the international is a sort of "other," something "over there," if I may reverse the title of one of Kennedy's earlier books.62 Kennedy- also pays little attention to social history, not even to social histories that have sought to better explain the politics of the interwar years.63 Nor does the book address intellectual history, the history of science and technology (except briefly in connection with war production), the states, education, urban history, and much more. In fact, the book would have been more accurately described by the title of William E. Leuchtenburg's classic, F.D.R. and the New Deal, 1932-1940, which is here superseded and extended into the war years.64 So titled, adding the war to the New Deal, one could have no objection to this extraordinarily well-written, deeply researched, and compellingly argued book. But is it a history of "the American people"? Freedom from Fear is a masterful narrative on the terms it has assumed for itself. Yet having said that, historiographical questions remain. Kennedy apparently assumes that three voices are the important ones; not many other voices are heard, even though each of a small clutch of additional figures is presented very effectively as a full human being: Lorena Hickok, Eleanor Roosevelt, Harry Hopkins, Raymond Moley, Herbert Hoover, John L. Lewis, and A. Philip Randolph, among a few others. History for Kennedy, unlike for the other authors of these syntheses, is made by select leaders, not by ordinary people. What is remarkable, therefore, is the illusion of synthesis that is achieved. The book was published in a series that promises narrative syntheses of the defining periods of American national history. Most so far published accept traditional definitions of periods, and they are framed as political history, but none is so severely restricted as this one, which won the Pulitzer Prize in part because it was recognized as a work of grand synthesis. Dramatic changes in the historiography of the American field make it seem anachronistic. Yet its success makes the point that political history in the grand [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 62 David M. Kennedy, Over Here: The First World War and American Society (New York, 1980).

Fred Anderson's Crucible of War again engages us with the question of elites and ordinary people, and it provides -a promising approach. While Kennedy seems quite confident of the importance of a few leaders, Anderson seems to be ambivalent, and that ambivalence enriches his history. Although I think the principal contribution of Crucible of War to our understanding of the British Empire is grounded in the social history of the political and military experience of ordinary Americans, the dramatic focus, as with Francis Parkman's great nineteenth-century narrative, is on two great leaders of the French and Indian War, the marquis de Montcalm and James Wolfe.65 Yet, as Alan Taylor has insightfully insisted, Anderson has rewritten the story of their confrontation in a way that diminishes these actors, especially Wolfe.66 To be sure, Anderson's book goes beyond Parkman in its respect for Native Americans, their agency, and their role in the empire (and the role of the empire and war for them). He also modifies Parkman on a point that is central to the book's contribution to imperial history: unlike Parkman, Anderson not only notices but makes much of the division between English colonials and English metropolitans. These differences in expectation and experience make the war in his view a "theatre of intercultural interaction."67 Like Butler, Anderson seeks to diminish the role of 1776 in understanding the development of what became the United States. Historians, he argues, will better understand the creation of the United States by closely examining the Seven Years' War and, more generally, by challenging the usual tendency to "take as our point of reference the thirteen rebelling colonies, not the empire as a whole."68 Yet, even as he argues the importance of getting behind the Revolution of 1776 so that one can discover the eighteenth century as it was experienced, the revolution remains a touchstone for him. More than anything else, he wants the reader to recognize that the shots fired in the Seven Years' War were the ones with implications around the world. But he keeps de-historicizing his story to use it to diminish the shot of lesser implication (in his view) heard 'round the world in 1775. When one begins the book, there is a sense of excitement. Here is a history of the United States ready to take the globe as its context. Before the narrative even begins, the reader is presented with a portfolio of maps. Only two of eight describe the British colonies; no more than four of them consider North America at all. The portfolio begins with a world map, revealing the global distribution of the battles that marked the Seven Years' War. There are also maps of the Indian subcontinent, Central Europe, and the Caribbean. The introduction promises a book that will make the world, or at least the full extent of the British Empire, its context and subject. We are told that "if viewed from Montreal or Vincennes, St. Augustine, Havana, Paris or Madrid-or, for that matter Calcutta or Berlin-the Seven Years' War was far more significant than the War of American Independence."69 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 65 Francis Parkman, Montcalm and Wolfe, 6th edn., 2 vols.

We get very little of Asia (although Manila makes a brief but important comparative appearance), the Caribbean, Africa, and continental Europe. Of course, other European powers are part of the narrative, but they only have walk-on roles. We learn little of them at home or about the ways leaders or ordinary citizens interpret events, while we are, by contrast, led through elaborate accounts of high British politics. The preface, presumably written last, sketches an extraordinary agenda for what would be a stunning book. Unfortunately, Anderson did not write the book he there described. Still, judged in terms of what it did rather than what it proposed to do, it is an outstanding work of craft. It will no doubt be our generation's account of the Seven Years' War. As military history, it is superb, and it contributes importantly-but not so grandly as some of the opening rhetoric promises-to the non-controversial but still unclear issue of the causal relations that connect the Seven Years' War to the coming of the revolution. Anderson in fact offers a rich Anglo-centric narrative that explores and explains the different meaning of the war both as strategic event and as experience for the British of the metropole and in the colonies. It is written with verve and confidence-and a seemingly complete command of the materials, primary and secondary. One of its themes is the misperception of events by political elites; with the exception of William Pitt, surely Anderson's hero in this story, they fail to understand the different meaning of the war and empire for ordinary soldiers and colonial subjects. He thus makes cultural issues the heart of the book. Military and political elites play a dramatic role in the narrative, but causation for Anderson- and here he points to important newer developments in military and diplomatic history-is to be found in the culture of everyday life.70 In making this point, he not only offers an important interpretation of the war (building in part on his previous book on Massachusetts soldiers), he also reveals the empire to be less solid, more a matter of continuous negotiation, than historians often consider such entities, whether empires or nations or states.71 MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN ANDERSON, Ira Berlin, referring to the earliest history of Afro-European North America, and Daniel T. Rodgers, addressing the early twentieth century, incorporate the Atlantic, or at least the North Atlantic, into their narratives of American history. Berlin and Rodgers write very different kinds of history and focus on different periods. Berlin's is a social history, while Rodgers has written an intellectual history, or, perhaps, a history of political culture. Yet both Berlin and Rodgers recognize the complex webs that route movements-of people, of ideas, of money, of things-in the Atlantic world. The transnational terrains that Berlin and Rodgers evoke establish larger and truer frames for national histories than do notions of bounded and self-contained regions or nations. The first section of Berlin's Many Thousands Gone, a portrait of the Atlantic littoral, describes a world framed by cities and the sea, little divided by national [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 70 Anderson, Crucible of War, 453-54. 71 See Fred Anderson, A Peoples' Army: Massachusetts Soldiers and Society in the Seven Years' War (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1984).

Berlin's opening tableau describes the emergence of the Atlantic world as an ever- expanding historical terrain, where the African presence is pervasive on the sea and in the cities, including Lisbon, where they made up 10 percent of the population in the sixteenth century. He evokes a world defined by a network of cosmopolitan cities populated by creolized peoples. African people were not only omnipresent, they were often crucial cultural and economic brokers, helping to knit this new world together. Berlin lets go of this powerful frame and image in his later chapters, where he narrows the focus to regional difference within the bounds of British North America. Still, the book's protean beginning remains in the reader's mind, inviting others to realize its narrative logic and moral meaning.72 In Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age (1998), Daniel T. Rodgers also achieves a richer historicism by expanding the space of analysis. One small indication is in the subtitle. He refers to "social politics," not the more usual "welfare state." His approach, examining relations in space as well as over time as fields of contingency, makes the welfare state a problematic common term. When he uses the more general and more mobile term "social politics," he effectively historicizes the concept, lineage, and practice of the welfare state. The development of a social politics has other possible paths and outcomes besides evolution into the national welfare state.73 The national welfare state thus becomes a historically and place-specific invention rather than a universal or, worse, the teleological endpoint of American liberal narratives-an endpoint surely upended by the politics of the last quarter of the twentieth century. Following the pioneering work of James T. Kloppenberg, who also assumed a Euro-American context for progressivism and social democracy, Rodgers ap- proaches this age of reform as at once a transnational and national issue.74 A variety of reforms-from urban planning to social insurance to regulation of capitalism- are examined as products both of general, transnational ideas and of particular, national political cultures. The complex narratives thus developed by Rodgers and Kloppenberg-ones that recognize, especially in the case of Rodgers, the historicity of the balance between national and transnational-are a major advance in the narrative synthesis of a national history. Both Rodgers and Kloppenberg impress on the reader that ideas could cross the Atlantic in either direction. This is salutary; American intellectual history is too often thought by Europeans and Americans as well to be either insignificant or derivative, not quite up to equal participation in an international world of ideas. This common point is handled differently in each book. While Kloppenberg notes [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 72 One hopes this extension of the historiographical terrain will continue and that connections as well as comparisons will be made between the North Atlantic and the South Atlantic and between the Atlantic slave trade and the slave trade that turned to the east, to the Muslim empires of the Mediterranean and today's Middle East. Big as it is, the Atlantic does not capture the logic and dimensions of slavery in this era. 73 See, for example, the argument (somewhat dependent on Rodgers's work) in Thomas Bender, "Cities, Intellectuals, and Citizenship in the United States: The 1890s and 1990s," Citizenship Studies 3 (1999): 203-20. 74 Daniel T. Rodgers, Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age (Cambridge, Mass., 1998); James T. Kloppenberg, Uncertain Victory: Social Democracy and Progressivism in European and American Thought, 1870-1920 (New York, 1986).

Rodgers, by contrast, focuses on the specific transit of ideas and emphasizes the way intellectuals and reformers on either side of the Atlantic drew selectively on these ideas, depending on personal taste and local circumstance. The result is a fundamental and valuable reorientation of the way we might understand intellectual history. The conceptual opening they have created invites a yet more radical under- standing of the territory and movement of ideas. Let me go back to the title of Rodgers's book. I think that "Atlantic Crossings" projects too narrow an under- standing of the implications of the book. It emphasizes the movement of people and ideas back and forth across the Atlantic. To that extent, it recalls a much older Anglo-American historiography of "trans-Atlantic influences."75 Rodgers goes well beyond this historiography in showing that, in important respects, Europe was partly Americanized and the United States was partly Europeanized by the phenomena he describes. But his really important accomplishment is to get away from the "influence" model, to displace the linear A to B notion of intellectual history. But he could have gone farther yet. There is more to the circulation of ideas than this framing recognizes. It is more than an Atlantic crossing, more than a link between Western Europe and the United States. The whole Atlantic, South Atlantic as well as North Atlantic, and, indeed, increasingly, parts of the Pacific world better describe the extent of the intellectual network his book evokes. In regard to urban development and reform, an important theme in Rodgers's book, it is clear that there is a global conversation at work. Rather than the linearity of steamship crossings (the dustjacket illustration) between the port cities of Western Europe and New York, I imagine a Great Bazaar of urban ideas, technology, and aesthetics hovering over the Atlantic, with many traders and buyers. This exchange is not, of course, symmetrical, and that itself is an issue, but participation was nearly global in 1900. Progressive ideas, especially those dealing with urban reform and technologies, traveled through many circuits and with different voltage, but nearly the whole world was connected, not only Western Europe and the United States. Simply look at the cities of Eastern Europe, Latin America, parts of Africa, Central and East Asia. Surely, they were part of an international conception of urbanism-and of urban commercial culture. The remnants of the era make it clear that New York and Chicago, no less than Lyons, Cairo, Buenos Aires, or Shanghai, were local instances of a global process of city-making. THESE LAST COMMENTS SUGGEST what I take to be the next challenge of narrative synthesis. But before I conclude, let me briefly review what has been accomplished by the cohort of synthetic histories considered here. These books reveal, even verify, the capacity of narrative synthesis to achieve inclusion and to respect issues of identity. Moreover, it seems possible in synthetic narratives to combine structure [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 75 See Frank Thistlethwaite, The Anglo-American Connection in the Early Nineteenth Century (Philadelphia, 1959). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 152 Thomas Bender [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] and agency and to consider causal explanation without sacrificing the explication of subjective meaning-and vice versa. The volumes here examined reveal many narrative strategies and quite different relations to a wider reading public. There is no single model, and no one volume (yet) does all the things we might fairly expect in a realized synthesis. In addition, these books, both in what they do and do not do, suggest to me the value of embracing a narrative core that is a more explicit and deeper exploration of democracy and difference, freedom and empowerment, contest and justice. Such a focus promises a sharper analytical history, one more historical and less susceptible to teleology, whether of modernity or anything else. It seems plausible to propose that a wider canvas, a supranational context, may in fact enhance the examination of these issues. The work of Hine and Faragher, Berlin, Gordon, and Rodgers in particular enables one to imagine an even more radical synthesis of national history, one that operates on multiple geographical scales, from narratives smaller than the nation to supra-national ones-thus identifying the nation as a product of history as well as an object of historical inquiry. Such a framing of national history will increase awareness of the complexity of the multiple axes of historical interaction, causation, and identity formation. While I mean these concluding comments to suggest an ambitious new agenda for the discipline, we must not overlook an already existing and compelling example. Decades ago, David Brion Davis embarked on a multivolume history that considered all these issues. He brought them together in his majestic synthesis that explores slavery and freedom in the Atlantic world, a history of nearly global reach that is also-and I emphasize this fact-a history of the United States.76 My point, then, is that such histories can be written, have been written, and I trust that more will yet be written. The present moment seems especially propitious for such histories. The relation of the nation to both subnational and transnational solidarities is very much in question. It is a public concern as well as an object of interdisciplinary scholarly inquiry. Historians surely have an open invitation to rethink the boundaries of national histories.77 Colonial historians have been moving in this direction for some time, redefining their field as the Atlantic world long before the globalization talk. Likewise, Rodgers and Ian Tyrrell, both of whom work on the modern period, moved in this direction fairly early and for a different reason: their concern about the claims of American exceptionalism.78 With these various concerns at work, we may fairly expect a movement of American historians and other historians as well toward a wider sense of their fields. National histories will not be so firmly bounded, and the assumption of their national autarky will be softened by the recognition that national histories are [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 76 David Brion Davis, The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture (Ithaca, N.Y., 1966); The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Revolution, 1770-1823 (Ithaca, 1975), with the final installment yet to come. 77 See Bender, Rethinking American History in a Global Age; and Thomas Bender, The La Pietra Report (Bloomington, Ind., 2000), also available on the World Wide Web at www.oah.org/activities/ lapietra/index.html. 78 Ian Tyrrell, "American Exceptionalism in an Age of International History," AHR 96 (October 1991): 1031-55; Daniel T.

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important proponents, is thus linked by the Comaroffs forward to colonialism and to contemporary globalization, and backward in time to Part of this article was presented in a much earlier version at the Twentieth Anniversary Conference of the Journal of Southern African Studies, York, 1994; I would like to thank the participants as well as those who subsequently commented helpfully, including David Maxwell, Norman Etherington, Ed Wilmsen, and Paul Landau.

Missionaries were, in effect, agents of a first wave of globalization. The missionary movement was an early exemplar of a transnational global movement, while the intellectual claims of missionaries to universality paralleled the modernist claims of a globalizing colonialism. The struggles over the texture and composition of everyday life that took place on the frontiers of colonial society in nineteenth-century southern Africa therefore tell us something not only about the nature of colonialism but also about modernity and its considerable discontents, as well as about the resistance of the colonized to the European colonial project. In this sense, a quest for origins informs the narrative structure of both books.2 Indeed, one of the reasons that this seminal text engages us so closely is its concern with the narrative of dispossession and resistance, with a beginning and therefore, implicitly, some hope for an end-an only ambivalently postmodern narrative, in fact, despite some alarm in southern Africanist circles over Of Revelation and Revolution as a postmodern nail in the coffin of materialist history.3 This focus lends moral urgency to the Comaroffs' consideration of the distant initial encounters between white missionaries and the southern Tswana in the early nineteenth century. Volume 2, for example, opens with a striking vignette: Tswana soldiers refuse to defend the white regime in 1994, as Afrikaner patriots launch a last-ditch raid on Bophuthatswana. As homeland structures crumble around them as they write, the Comaroffs acknowledge that endings and beginnings are never entirely neat. "And yet in many respects, the narrative of Tswana colonization had completed itself, finally running its course from Revelation to Revolution."4 Doubtless the authors would now adopt a less utopian position, but their enthusiasm for revolution and for endings is important, and typical of South African historical writing from the decades before the end of apartheid.5 2 Catherine Desbarats, "Essais sur quelques elements de l'6criture de l'histoire am6rindienne," Revue d'histoire de l'Ameriquefranqaise 53, no. 4 (Spring 2000): 491-520, provides an interesting model, inspired among others by Paul Ricoeur, Hayden White, and Kerwin Lee Klein, for the reading of various historical approaches to the colonial encounter as forms of narrative romance, given the inescapable narrativity of the historical text. Susan Newton-King, also drawing on Ricoeur, similarly reflects on the inescapable imposition of an artificial order on colonial encounters by the historian of colonialism.

This chapter sets out to explore "the initial meeting of two worlds, one imperial and expansive, the other local and defensive."6 In marvelously evocative detail, the authors describe the initial entry of envoys of the London Missionary Society (LMS) in 1816 into the Tswana capital, Dithakong (seen by the missionaries themselves as a sacred journey into the land of Satan), a subsequent meeting, and the complex negotiations that took place throughout over the terms of the mission. A key metaphor is furnished by the mirror that the LMS envoy John Campbell presented as a gift to the Tswana chief, Mothibi, symbolizing the Western effort to reconfigure Tswana consciousness and the Tswana notion of the self. These initial encounters prefigured the colonial encounter to come: "the square enclosure and all that 'took place' at the center of the most public of Tswana spaces was ominous, foreshadowing a methodical reconstruction of their symbolic map."7 The Christian missionary project, this chapter further suggests, was from the start central to the creation of the dialectical oppositions of colonialism, ironic in view of its claim to erase difference. For the Comaroffs, the colonization of the Tswana thus began (although it certainly did not end) with the word, in the sense both of Bible and of cultural text, with the advent of white Protestant missionaries and their claims to possess the revealed divine word-albeit a word made flesh, clothed in material power. The roots of colonization were in a series of knowledge claims and a set of hegemonic cultural discourses, which would bolster the later seizure of land and of labor. Many scholars have explored the linkage between knowledge claims and colonial power, an issue that has long lain at the heart of postcolonial scholarship and that occupies an increasingly central place in the study of imperialism from a diversity of perspectives.8 Nonetheless, Of Revelation and Revolution furnishes a particularly influential and important statement of the position, in part because it provides a great deal of flesh on the bones of a theoretical model of cultural colonialism. The work moves from the field of discourse alone to examine in great detail concrete material struggles over the remaking of everyday life, including Tswana efforts to resist cultural colonialism. More controversially, perhaps, Of Revelation and Revolution also attempts to make explicit the links in southern Africa between a postcolonial setting.

The need to make linkages and the Comaroffs' explicit commitment to the exploration of large-scale processes lead the authors to oversimplify in places. Not only that, but the imperatives of a dialectical method push the Comaroffs at times (despite their parallel stress on indeterminacy and their very explicit engagement with the costs and benefits of a dialectical analysis, especially in Volume 2) into tighter methodological corners than they might themselves like. The links between early nineteenth-century cultural colonialism and late nineteenth-century political colonialism are not as direct or as ontologically indissoluble as the Comaroffs assume they are, while the relationship of "modernity" to colonialism furnishes matter for debate, with considerable contemporary implications. The very boldness of the Comaroffs' arguments has indeed contributed to a mixed reception among scholars of southern African history and of religion in Africa, with some enthusiastically welcoming the methodological innovation of the Comaroffs and others casting doubt in a number of ways. In the second volume of the series, the Comaroffs seem to me to have backed down somewhat from some of their bolder claims, despite their spirited engagement with the critics. This in itself provides an interesting case study of the evolution of ideas during a turbulent decade in South African history. In what follows, I would like to engage with this important work in several ways. First, I want to lay out my understanding of the theoretical guidelines in the opening volume, with particular attention to the issue of hegemony and power. Second, I want to provide an alternate reading of the opening encounters between Tswana and missionary, focusing on other intermediaries and on the fact that, even before the advent of European missionaries, the region was already affected by colonialism. I shall use this example to ask whether a dialectic model does not in some ways oversimplify complicated situations and make it hard to account for fudging across the fault lines. I shall further ask whether the result is not a rather muted account of individual agency and an attenuated depiction of the multiple uses of mission Christianity, both as language and as practice. This is not, however, to deny the latent authoritarian potential of much missionary activity, particularly in a colonial context. Third, I also want to gesture, albeit sketchily, toward some issues associated with narrative and chronology, suggesting that the schematic narrative about "modernity," industrialization, and globalization that undergirds both volumes, though provocative and important, also offers a number of hostages to fortune. These include an undue stress on the capacity of missionaries to induct converts into the global economy by changing their consciousness; rather, I see converts struggling to adapt to an overpowering global economy, among other things by trying to use Christianity in a variety of ways, with greater or lesser degrees of success. Having said all that, does this fact-mongering matter?-What are the Comaroffs doing that might go beyond reading the content of particular 9 Colonialism was simultaneously a "process in political economy and culture," and these dimensions were "indissoluble aspects of the same reality, whose fragmentation into discrete spheres hides their ontological unity."

Throughout, I want to take up some concerns of African historians and anthropologists with questions of narrative, voice, and agency in Of Revelation and Revolution. THE INITIAL CHAPTER OF THE FIRST VOLUME is a careful theoretical exposition. Although the authors rather cheerfully direct those with little stomach for theoretical discussions to skip theirs and, en bon bricoleur, to pick up the narrative at a later point, the opening discussion of anthropological concepts is in fact crucial for an understanding of what both this book and its later companion seek to accomplish. I would accordingly like to pause upon it. The stated goal of the work is to present an anthropology of the "colonial encounter," in this case between British Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana, with the larger implication that the missionaries acted as the cultural arm of colonialism, while the dilemmas of the Tswana in their confrontations with colonialism mirrored, if they obviously did not precisely reproduce, the experience of other colonized African groups in South Africa. The Comaroffs state that they hope that their discussion of this particular mission will accomplish three other things: to anticipate later modes of consciousness and struggle in South Africa; to look at an example of historical processes that were happening across Africa and indeed much of the non-Western world; and to examine analytic issues to do with the "nature of power and resistance." With reference to this latter objective: How, precisely, were structures of inequality fashioned during the colonial encounter, often in the absence of more conventional, more coercive tools of domination? How was consciousness made and remade in this process? ... How were new hegemonies established and the "ground prepared," in [Antonio] Gramsci's phrase, for formal European political control? ... Even more fundamentally, how are we to understand the dialectics of culture and power, ideology and consciousness that shape such historical processes?'1 From the vantage point of 1991, the Comaroffs placed their project into a historiographical framework that has since changed considerably, in no small part due to their own work."1 At the time, the Comaroffs castigated anthropologists for 10 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 6. 11 Among many possibilities, some works of particular importance to southern Africa include Paul Stuart Landau, The Realm of the Word: Language, Gender and Christianity in a Southern African Kingdom (London, 1995); Henry Bredekamp and Robert Ross, eds., Missions and Christianity in South African History (Johannesburg, 1995); Pier M.

The sheer diversity of recent approaches to the history of mission Christianity, a growth field, is impossible to capture in a footnote but is suggested by works such as David Maxwell and Ingrid Lawrie, eds., Christianity and the African Imagination: Essays in Honour of Adrian Hastings (Leiden, 2001); Nicholas Thomas, "Colonial Conversions: Difference, Hierarchy and History in Early Twentieth-Century Evangelical Propaganda," in Hall, Cultures of Empire; Susan Thorne, Congregational Missions and the Making of an Imperial Culture in Nineteenth- Century England (Stanford, Calif., 1999); Peter van der Veer, ed., Conversion to Moderities: The Globalization of Christianity (London, 1996); Robert W.

Historians paid more attention to missions but in the 1960s and 1970s often focused on the theoretically crude question of "whose side were the missionaries really on?" By the 1980s, mission history had been more fruitfully incorporated into work on such long-term processes as colonial conquest, capitalist expansion, state formation, and proletarianization. The methodological innovation of the Comaroffs in the early 1990s was, however, to underscore how much this new approach was itself limited by its "preoccupation with political economy at the expense of culture, symbolism, and ideology."12 They echoed the 1986 claim of Terence Ranger that most of the historiography of early missions to that point had overestimated the political and economic factors in its expansion-in a manner, according to the Comaroffs, stemming ultimately from oppositions between mind and matter at the ontological roots of our social thought.13 In rejecting a narrowly political-economic approach, the authors believed they could better answer the questions of why it was that missionaries succeeded in effecting broad social, political, and economic changes without substantial material resources (a question that, of course, assumes that this was accomplished by missionaries). What was needed, the Comaroffs claimed, was a study of consciousness: of why people articulated belief in certain things, why they took others for granted, how colonialism and consciousness were inextricably intertwined. It is in this sense that missionaries were most clearly colonial agents: they sought to remake the lifeworld of the Tswana, indeed, to colonize their consciousness. They did not necessarily seek directly and simplistically to incorpo- rate the Tswana into an unequal colonial world: they had dreamed instead of a "global democracy of material well-being and moral merit," in the Comaroffs' phrase.14 Nonetheless, their actions contributed to building an empire of inequality. This claim rests on the additional argument that the missionaries were the products of post-Enlightenment modernity, creations and agents of rationalization in the Weberian sense. Similarly, Tswana interlocutors made a variety of unexpected uses of the evangelical message, and of evangelical attempts to remake their world, again with unpredictable results. In sum, the encounter between colonial evangelism and the southern Tswana can best be described as a "long conversation," a continuing process in the course of which "signifiers were set afloat, fought over, and recaptured on both sides of the colonial encounter."15 Over the course of this conversation, the Tswana came to conceive of themselves as constituting a separate, Translating the Message: The Missionary Impact on Culture (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1989); and V. Y. Mudimbe, The Invention of Africa: Gnosis, Philosophy, and the Order of Knowledge (Bloomington, Ind., 1988). The Currents in World Christianity Project, at the University of Cambridge, has also since 1996 lent considerable impetus to the scholarly study of missions. A longstanding African literature reconsiders missions and the truth claims of missionaries, often from a theological perspective: for example, J. N. K. Mugambi, From Liberation to Reconstruction: African Christian Theology after the Cold War (Nairobi, 1996). Many works by African scholars are less well distributed in the West than they might be, given material constraints. From a wide variety of directions, missionary activity has become a newly invigorated area of research since the 1990s, although some of the more difficult underlying issues are perhaps not adequately discussed in all the literature. 12 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 8. 13 Terence Ranger, "Religious Movements and Politics in Sub-Saharan Africa," African Studies Review 29 (1986): 1-69. 14 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 12. 15 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17-18.

At the same time, the "forms" of the "European worldview" became inscribed on the "African land- scape": "not only did colonialism produce reified cultural orders, it gave rise to a new hegemony amidst-and despite-cultural contestation."16 Throughout this discussion, the Comaroffs reject the poststructuralist claim that all meanings are equally tenuous and open to contestation, regretting the episte- mological hypochondria and consequent intellectual immobility to which postmod- ern critiques have given rise in academia-even as the authors uphold some of the central insights of such critiques, notably their insistence that the indeterminacies of meaning and action be addressed by scholars.17 What poststructuralists cannot address is the basic question of how some meanings get widely accepted over significant periods of time by those against whose interest it is to believe them. This is the problem of hegemony, raised by Gramsci (however sketchy his discussion in the Prison Notebooks) and developed by many social theorists.18 The Comaroffs offer a solution, though over-schematic in the literal sense of the word. They see human consciousness as existing on a spectrum from "hegemony" to "ideology." At the hegemony end of the spectrum, one finds the taken-for-granted inscribed in everyday life-those beliefs that are not questioned because they are not even noticed as beliefs. At the other end, one finds articulated ideology, which is available for debate and which often tries to bring into consciousness the hegemonic beliefs of earlier stages. Culture in general is the "space of signifying practice, the semantic ground on which human beings seek to construct and represent themselves and others-and hence, society and history."l9 Somewhat oddly, hegemonic concepts are described as "constructs and conventions that have come to be shared and naturalized through a political community," while ideology is "the expression and ultimately the possession of a particular social group, although it may be widely peddled beyond."20 This psychological structure seems artificial and unwieldy; it is unclear why the province of the hegemonic idea should be the political community (a tricky concept to define in any case), while ideology is described not only as the product of communities (rather than at least sometimes of individuals) but as the province of the social rather than, say, political or even self-consciously intellectual groupings. The definition of the political is murky here, as it is throughout the book, despite (even sometimes because of) the painstaking effort of the authors to demonstrate the deeply political nature of the everyday stuff of life; what is lacking here and elsewhere is a willingness to limit and define the nature of the political in such a manner as to make it meaningful to call something political in the first place. Be that as it may, this construction of group political psychology permits the Comaroffs to draw conclusions that are critically important for their overall project. Indeed, the reconstruction of struggles over the stuff of everyday life that takes pride of place in the second volume depends ultimately on this theoretical 16 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 18. 17 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17. 18 Antonio Gramsci, Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci, Quentin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith, trans.

Given the place of hegemony and ideology on an ever-changing spectrum, the two are constantly fluid; meanings are always being made and remade, as ideology challenges hegemony to reveal itself, and it is in the inchoate, fluid space between hegemony and ideology that human consciousness is at its most creative. Given that hegemony is constructed largely through the "assertion of control over various modes of symbolic production: over such things as educational and ritual processes, patterns of socialization, political and legal procedures, canons of style and self-representation, public communication, health and bodily discipline and so on," the realm of "symbolic production" is (presumably) political because it is a site for power struggles. This means both that the "symbolic production" is political and that resistance to modes of symbolic production that generate hegemony is political. Modes of resistance run across as wide a spectrum as modes of control, with at one end organized protest and other movements readily recognized as political by the West; at the other end are "gestures of tacit refusal and iconoclasms, gestures that sullenly and silently contest the forms of an existing hegemony."21 It is thus in this light that missions must be seen. They sought to extend hegemonic control over indigenous peoples by changing their worldviews to a point that new ways of behaving and seeing the world were completely internalized. Resistance to the specific forms of Christianity was also resistance to the message behind the signs. In the purest sense, resistance to Christian forms was resistance to the content of capitalism and to the global capitalist system; this is indeed a critical plank of Jean Comaroff's fascinating (if not uncontroversial) reading of African independent churches as quintessentially subversive because they appropriated and yet subverted Christian forms, in her important 1985 study Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance.22 Christian missions must also be re-read. Their gestures and ritual must be analyzed in order to see how missionaries were attempting to change far more than religious allegiance, acting as emissaries of modernity and economic transfor- mation. Finally, conversion was inextricably political, and as such a suitable site for political competition between colonizers and the colonized. The extremely rich remainder of this book and its successor volume work out the implications of these theoretical positions through a quite brilliant analysis of the nineteenth-century "colonial exchange" between the southern Tswana and the Nonconformist missions to them run first by the London Missionary Society (pioneers in the field) and then by their later-arriving brethren, the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society. An additional important project of the authors throughout this study is to demonstrate the importance of an imagined Africa to the British sense of themselves and more broadly to the construction of modernity. As the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2, as part of a series of seven propositions about colonialism, "colonialism was as much involved in making the metropole, and the identities and ideologies of colonizers, as it was in (re)making peripheries and colonial sub- 21 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 31. 22 Jean Comaroff, Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance: The Culture and History of a South African People (Chicago, 1985).

A final critical point is that the authors see the interaction between missionary and Tswana as a form of dialectic between two key groups of interlocutors, dependent on the notion of difference. In the second volume, the Comaroffs acknowledge with more force than in Volume 1 the existence of overlap on the ground, and they reemphasize that the idea of difference was created by the dialectical process, despite some merging of lifeways on the ground and the mutual influence of Tswana and British. Note their comment that "neither 'the colonizer' nor 'the colonized' represented an undifferentiated sociological or political reality, save in exceptional circumstances."25 Since the end product of the colonial encounter was so clearly the production of difference and a series of deeply embedded dialectical oppositions, the Comaroffs nonetheless argue that this is the most productive optic through which to view the early nineteenth-century encounter between European mission- aries and Africans. This model is furthermore essential to their theoretical account of the formation of hegemony. ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE FOUND MOST PERPLEXING about the work of the Comaroffs is, nevertheless, the question of the extent to which it is appropriate to describe the Tswana encounter with Christianity as a form of dialectic. This question implies the ancillary question of who the agents of the dialectic were at given moments. On the face of it, these are tendentious concerns, since colonialism was so clearly in many ways a dialectic between colonized and colonizer, just as colonialism clearly generated reified views of colonizer and colonized alike. Missionaries themselves usually understood their activities in dialectical terms. Yet I think one can ask whether a dialectical approach to the history of Christianity in colonial contexts 23 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 22. 24 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 86. Those influenced by the Comaroffs in this respect include David Chidester, Savage Systems: Colonialism and Comparative Religion in Southern Africa (Charlottesville, Va., 1996); Leon de Kock, Civilising Barbarians: Missionary Narrative and African Textual Response in Nineteenth-Century South Africa (Johannesburg, 1996); Doug Stuart, "'Of Savages and Heroes': Discourses of Race, Nation and Gender in the Evangelical Missions to Southern Africa in the Early Nineteenth Century" (PhD dissertation, Institute of Commonwealth Studies, University of London, 1994).

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 443 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne does not fail to capture some aspects of social and political reality. This is above all because of the rapidity with which Christianity was out of the hands of the missionaries and settlers who brought it, the corresponding importance of non- Europeans in the spread of Christianity, the multiplicity of uses to which diverse interest groups of all ethnicities put Christianity as both a language and a practice, and the political and cultural complications of regions with multiple power players. These issues are brought out by a re-reading of the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana that occupy so key a role in the first volume of Of Revelation and Revolution. I should add that I made similar comments about the opening phases of the mission in an unpublished conference paper after the publication of Volume 1. The Comaroffs respond generously to this paper in Volume 2, as they do to a number of other critics, using the occasion to clarify and amplify their understanding of a dialectical approach. I do not want to beat a dead horse. Nonetheless, I think there are some useful differences of interpretation at stake, and so will abuse the Comaroffs' patience by briefly recapitulating a potential alternate reading of these opening gambits, before returning to the wider issue of different approaches to mission history.26 Let me first make a comment about regional issues. The lands of the southern Tswana were disrupted by colonialism, drought, hunger, and regional conflict well before the formal advent of missions. Furthermore, as Johannes du Bruyn has underscored, the lands inhabited by the southern Tswana were so profoundly affected by the Cape Colony to the south that it is problematic to frame a discussion of cultural colonialism primarily in terms of Europe and the Transvaal. In particular, the colonial firearms frontier moved with great speed, was highly destructive, and was arguably more important earlier than the Comaroffs suggest. Many different armed bands, some of them ethnically mixed, decimated peaceful groups in conflict situations exacerbated by hunger.27 Arguments about the regional context for evangelical missions to the Tswana are also implicit in a much wider body of literature about the so-called mfecane (or difaqane)-terms that have been much disputed by historians. Traditionally, the mfecane was a term given to the widespread wars, famines, and refugee movements that shook (and temporarily depopulated) much of the interior of southern Africa in the early nineteenth century, the impact of which on the Tswana the Comaroffs date from 1822. There is no space here to explore that debate, although it will be helpful to know that a 26 My re-reading of the opening encounter is based on my own work on LMS archives, which I consulted primarily with the aim of writing about contestation over the uses of Christianity within the Cape Colony and with a focus on Khoesan not Tswana uses of Christianity. It seems to me fruitful, however, to unite diverse perspectives on a very complex subject. Elizabeth Elbourne, Blood Ground: Colonialism, Missions and the Contest for Christianity in the Cape Colony and Britain, 1799-1853 (Montreal, 2002). There were four LMS delegations to the Tswana to establish a mission, not two as the Comaroffs have it. 27 Johannes du Bruyn, "Of Muffled Tswana and Overwhelming Missionaries: The Comaroffs and the Colonial Encounter," South African Historical Journal, no. 31 (1994): 294-309; Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 275-76. On Tswana views of the firearms frontier, see Robert Moffat to Richard Miles, Lattakoo [Kuruman], December 5, 1827, in Isaac Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman: Being the Journals and Letters of Robert and Mary Moffat, 1820-1828 (London, 1951), 274. Other letters in this collection describe frequent deadly raids throughout the 1820s, in which a wide variety of often ethnically mixed groups preyed on one another. On Cape influence, see also Johannes du Bruyn, "James Read en die Thlaping, 1816-1820," Historia 35 (1990). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 444 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh critical issue is whether or not covert slave trading from the Cape Colony and Portuguese territories was at the root of disruptions that have more traditionally been ascribed to the many conquests of the Zulu kingdom in the region of what is now Natal. The point I want to emphasize here is not only the great disruption in the region but also the plausibility of historian Neil Parsons's argument that Tswana territory had already been subject since the seventeenth century to political unrest and the large-scale movement of populations. Parsons in fact suggests that the roots of disruption and state formation in the area may well lie in destabilization that considerably antedated the 1820s and may in turn be linked in at least some way to eighteenth-century slave trading to the north and the rise of the predatory Cape Colony to the south.28 Scholars also tend to see later Afrikaner settler colonialism in the region as part of the same broad processes. All this calls into question the determinative impact of mission Christianity in an already destabilized region. Maybe political colonialism did precede cultural colonialism after all? How might we need to reconceptualize the Christian/Tswana encounter if we think of it as taking place in some sense in a frontier zone, or even a borderland, with multiple players, already characterized by cultural admixture, politically influenced uses of Christianity, and political turbulence? The Comaroffs are of course sensitive to these hugely important issues. I think nonetheless that they could emphasize regional complexity more and the power of missionary Christianity somewhat less in their discussion of the roots of material change (at both ends of the nineteenth century), as well as pay more attention to the implications for their overall theoretical argument of the fact that Africans tried to experiment in response to very difficult local conditions. It is also important that the missionaries entered as potential power brokers in a turbulent environment but were initially weak, able to manipulate power if and only if they could make the right alliances. With these types of broad issues in mind, the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana, so well described by the Comaroffs, might be re-read as conversations between a number of actors. Four LMS delegations traveled between 1813 and 1817 to the southern Tswana settlement known to the missionaries as Lattakoo (later Dithakong) to try to persuade the Tswana to accept missionaries. It is perhaps symbolically appropriate that none of these delegations was exclusively white. In addition to the delegations' African members, even the missionaries themselves included a black West Indian man and a Welsh speaker. Neither, come to that, was the Tswana polity entirely "Tswana." The Thlaping polity was relatively multi-ethnic; the chief Mothibi, for example, was half !Kora (a Khoekhoe-speaking group) and (like others of the chiefly lineage) married a !Kora woman. More significantly, the Europeans were not the only, or even the most important, players promoting an evangelical mission. Key from a Tswana perspective were regional actors, the Griqua (as they 28 Julian Cobbing, "The Mfecane as Alibi: Thoughts on Dithakong and Mbolompo," Journal of African History 29, no. 3 (1988): 487-519; Caroline Hamilton, ed., Mfecane Aftermath (Johannesburg, 1996), including Neil Parsons, "Prelude to Difaqane in the Interior of Southern Africa c. 1600-1822," 323-49; Neil Parsons, "Kicking the Hornets' Nest: A Third View of the Cobbing Controversy on the Mfecane/Difaqane," address to the University of Botswana History Society, Gabarone, Botswana, March 16, 1999 (available online through the University of Botswana History Department web page, at http://ubh.tripod.com/ub/np.htm).

The Griqua were clusters of settlers in the region of Khoekhoe descent, some of whom had white fathers and Khoesan mothers, and many of whom had migrated from the Cape Colony, epitomizing the remaking of identity in the wake of colonialism. Groups spearheaded by Griqua had established regional hegemony through their access to arms and horses. They provided important trade links with the Cape Colony and were sources of trade goods for the Tswana. The Griqua were already using Christianity in a variety of complicated ways, as a token of equality with white settlers, as justification for what Robert Ross has termed "sub-imperialism" with regard to the unconverted Tswana, and indeed as a basis for their reconstituted polities. Alliances with missionaries gave these emergent polities potential access to diplomacy and markets, including the arms trade, in addition to spiritual concerns. Indeed, on the way to Mothibi's settlement, British LMS inspector Campbell had helped compose a formal written constitution for a Griqua group, reflecting the symbolic uses of the language of law. The language of Christianity was already on the loose in the interior, in other words, and subject to interpretation in Griqualand as much as in the seminaries of Europe.29 The (Khoekhoe) !Kora had also been exposed to Christianity and were also competing by the 1820s to obtain guns and horses from the Cape Colony. The decision of Mothibi and his counselors about whether to accept an LMS mission was thus complicated by the fact that the LMS came under the protection of the powerful Griqua Kok clan. During a second LMS delegation to the Tswana (overlooked by the Comaroffs), for example, Adam Kok presented newly arrived missionaries to Mothibi and acted as their translator. Mothibi was anxious not to offend the powerful Kok family, but worried because his own people had since turned against the mission. In fact, he eventually sent these missionaries away altogether. When two missionaries told Mothibi that one of them "wrought in wood, and one that was to come wrought in Iron, that we would do all the work for him in that way that he wanted," Mothibi was pleased and told Kok "he could not think of rejecting those that came with or through the medium of him." When the missionaries pursued the issue of teaching, however, Mothibi worriedly told Kok that "he would not be instructed, and if A. Kok should endeavour to press it sharply upon him, and his refusal cause a variance between them, he said that he would rather take the flight from Lattakoo, with people." Kok had to reassure Mothibi that the Griqua leader would not force the Tswana chief to relocate if the Thlaping 29 This discussion both here and below draws on Robert Ross, Adam Kok's Griquas: A Study in the Development of Stratification in South Africa (Cambridge, 1976); Elizabeth Elbourne and Robert Ross, "Combating Spiritual and Social Bondage: Early Missions in the Cape Colony," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa; Alan Barnard, Hunters and Herders of Southern Africa: A Comparative Ethnography of the Khoisan Peoples (Cambridge, 1992), 156-75, 193-94; Martin Legassick, "The Northern Frontier to c. 1840: The Rise and Decline of the Griqua People," in Richard Elphick and Hermann Giliomee, eds., The Shaping of South African Society, 1652-1840 (Middletown, Conn., 1988), 358-420; Nigel Penn, "The Orange River Frontier Zone, c. 1700-1805," in Andrew B.

If missionaries were initially dependent on Griqua intermediaries, they were also materially dependent for travel and translation on Khoesan hired in the colony. The Khoekhoe and San had long borne the brunt of brutal colonial subjugation and were in many cases more receptive to conversion than groups beyond the Cape Colony. The Comaroffs indeed have a wonderful discussion of the occlusion of such intermediary figures from missionary accounts of putatively solitary heroic jour- neys.31 I would go further than the Comaroffs, however, and suggest that at least some of these companions saw themselves as fellow missionaries. On the first delegation, Campbell was accompanied by a number of Khoesan Christians from the Cape. Their prayers and preaching had made a pilgrimage route of their journey through a country of which they saw themselves as taking spiritual possession. They were active in trying to persuade Tswana individuals to accept missionaries.32 In 1814, a synod of the southern African LMS missionaries had "set aside" in a religious ceremony several men of Khoesan descent to act as LMS agents in the interior, several of whom, including Griqua leader Andries Waterboer, subse- quently played important roles in the politics of Transorangia. Cupido Kakkerlak, a product of Eastern Cape mission schools whose letters reveal a passionate spirituality, also itinerated in the region, attempting, albeit with little success, to evangelize among the !Kora. These men were employed by the LMS. As the Comaroffs point out, the society would devote much energy to reining in and controlling "native agents" after the earliest years of the mission. Nonetheless, evidence from the Cape suggests that there was also considerable evangelical activity by converts who were not formally paid by missionary societies, including elephant hunters such as Hendrik Boesak or long-range wagon drivers. In addition, as mission stations became more like churches and congregations fought for independence from missionary control around the mid-century mark, congregations had more authority, not less. My point is that evidence from elsewhere in southern Africa suggests that Christianity was spread by people with long-range contacts other than missionaries, presumably not necessarily in orthodox form. The central- ity of Khoesan people (and later other Africans) to European-led missions to the Tswana suggests a wider oral evangelical culture that the written records would not completely reflect.33 Be that as it may, the importance of Khoesan agents to the Tswana mission is most clearly exemplified by the fourth delegation to Lattakoo, led by a former 30 Robert Hamilton to LMS Directors, Griquatown, April 28, 1816, London Missionary Society Papers, South Africa Correspondence-Incoming, 6/3/C, Council for World Mission Archives, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (hereafter, LMS-SA).

Read brought with him an unusually large group of people of varied ethnic origins, mostly Khoesan, including, more problematically, his own Khoekhoe wife, Elizabeth Valentyn, and his pregnant former mistress, a San woman, Sabina Pretorius, whom he claimed to have met by accident on the road. At least ten Khoesan men and six Khoesan women accompanied Read, all of whom were church members and some of whom were "zealous persons."34 It is indeed possible that the Khoesan of the Cape Colony saw this as a Khoesan mission to the Tswana, brokered by their kin among the Griqua. In any case, once Robert Moffat took over the Lattakoo station in 1821 from Read (disgraced for his adultery), he would fight successfully to diminish the influence of the Khoesan group from the Cape Colony, whom he then firmly wrote out of the history of the station. He dismissed several for immorality, despite the resistance, in which women played prominent roles, of members of the group. Moffat also found himself opposed by Griqua factions, many of whom resented his power-mongering presence.35 Before the late 1810s, the earliest LMS agents in southern Africa were not particularly good or even very enthusiastic apostles of capitalist cultural practices, mostly because they were so poor themselves and so looked-down-upon by many respectable members of colonial society. More than a few also tended to believe in dreams, to hear the personal voice of God, or to look for the imminent end of the world. Those missionaries who were closest in time to the Enlightenment, in sum, acted least like the bourgeois agents of respectability described by the Comaroffs as quintessential exemplars of the rationalizing project of modernity. The colonial unrespectability of early missionaries was compounded by the fact that perhaps a third of them married African women before 1817, while several were involved in sexual scandals. Others took high-profile political positions that were unpopular among settlers. The Comaroffs pick up the story as Moffat, in common with many of his fellows, was urgently trying to reclaim the moral high ground and to reinvent the mission as visibly respectable and as focused on "civilization." A lot of this is more about the internal history of the LMS than about African Christianity; we certainly in general need more of the latter and perhaps less of the former. Nonetheless, it argues for the importance of local detail, and for the centrality of fractures within as well as between groups. It also points forward to ways in which converts would later need to perform "civilization" and "respectability" in order to maneuver on the colonial stage, not solely because their consciousnesses had been colonized. From the start, tensions among evangelicals themselves were fueled by anxiety over the rapid removal of Christianity from the control of white missionaries. This tension was arguably innate to a type of evangelical Christianity based on textual interpretation and the notion of divine inspiration, as well as being the product of Tswana reconstruction of Christian forms. Certainly, missionaries soon lost control even of "orthodox" Christianity. Among the northern Tswana, Paul Landau has brilliantly documented the use of Christianity by junior royals to challenge existing authority in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in ways that escaped 34 LMS-SA, 6/4/A: James Read to Joseph Hardcastle, Bethelsdorp, August 7, 1816. 35 See Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman.

Among the southern Tswana, Thlaping elites also exploited divisions among missionaries to their own political ends. In 1842, for example, Tswana elite men successfully appealed to LMS superintendent John Philip to fire missionary Holloway Helmore for excessive interference in congregational affairs, including deposing Mothibi's son as a deacon.36 Missionaries to the Tswana experienced other humiliations. The coherent Tswana group targeted by the mission decamped, to be replaced by a more motley group of refugees. The mission was battered by raids from various groups, could not protect its members, and was not successful at all until it started picking up displaced persons in the 1830s. A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS arise from this type of re-reading. At a macro level, the region was already turbulent and populations were mobile, so Christianity scarcely arrived as the harbinger of globalization in anything other than an ideological sense. This raises in turn the thorny and ultimately unanswerable question of whether Christianity would have had the capacity to colonize minds without the prior disruption of material conditions. We are back at the difficult issue of how determinative "culture" is by itself. Perhaps in the end, this rejigging of chronology strengthens the Comaroffs' fundamental argument about the inextricability of "culture" and material struggle. It does nonetheless pose all the more sharply the question of how Christianity-and religious innovation, more broadly defined- functioned in a frontier zone in a manner that was independent of the machinations of white missionaries.37 Also at the "macro" level, the Tswana were not entirely "local," nor were they unused to cultural difference. In a multi-lingual, multi-religious environment, were missionaries really needed to contextualize "Tswana custom"? Missionary papers record Mothibi making distinctions between !Kora, Tswana, and colonial Khoekhoe customs, for example. I would not want to deny the importance of local identity, or to exaggerate the degree of long-range contacts of the southern Tswana, in contrast to the remarkable global reach and global identity claims of the early missionary movement. There are issues of tremendous importance raised by that contrast. But it also seems important that there were other regional interlocutors who were of greater material importance initially to the Tswana than the Europeans, and with whom they already had the kind of cultural interchanges that might have permitted the type of self-consciousness about "Tswana" identity that the Comaroffs see as the fruit of the "long conversation." This is also a way of asking about what the southern African interior looked like before formal European colonialism and whether the communities of the region were really as settled as they appeared. There are echoes here of an older debate about whether the encounter with the "macrocosmic" claims of the "world religions" Christianity and Islam shattered the 36 Landau, Realm of the Word; Elbourne, Blood Ground. On Helmore's dismissal, see LMS-SA, 19/2/A: James Read to LMS Directors, Philipton, June 3, 1843. The LMS Directors overturned the dismissal and censured Philip. 37 An interesting point of contrast is provided by Janet Hodgson, "A Battle for Sacred Power: Christian Beginnings among the Xhosa," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa.

As Terence Ranger has argued, whatever the intellectual issues at stake, African societies, at least in the southern African interior, have to be recognized as also "macrocosmic" in the sense that they had long-range contacts, exchanged ideas over large swathes of territory (as the rapid spread of prophetic movements suggests), and rubbed up against a wide variety of different groups.38 The relative mobility of different communities was also a factor in breaking down localism. This type of approach, to my mind, decenters the European missionary-at least until the missionary came backed up by a colonial economy and a colonial army. The power exerted by the conditions of the "frontier zone" of the region is represented by the fact that even missionaries were compelled by material circumstances to take on features of African polities. The Comaroffs highlight the vision of Kuruman mission head and former gardener Robert Moffat, and his wife Mary, like that of many early nineteenth-century Nonconformist missionaries, as one of an unrealistic rural idyll, in which they sought to remake Africa in the image of a vanishing and imagined rural utopian Britain. One could, however, go further in considering the contradictions of Kuruman. Robert Moffat acted in many ways like an African leader as well as like a nostalgic Scot, and he needed to do so because of the material conditions of the frontier. In the 1820s, he proved unable to retain the allegiance of existing chiefs, for whom he was too clearly a competitor. As the refugee crisis accelerated, however, Moffat was able to gather together dispossessed people. The price of their admission was allegiance to the religion of the leader, since religion was used to rebuild communities. The currency of power was people. In similar ways, the control of women and their reproduction was important to the maintenance of the power of the patriarch, whether African chief or mission station head-Moffat even went so far, for example, as to attempt to discipline publicly Ann Hamilton, the wife of his colleague Robert Hamilton, for refusing to sleep with her husband.39 Moffat was more a part of the African frontier world than he might have liked to admit. A further critical point raised by this case study is that Africans transmitted Christianity more effectively than missionaries did. The centrality of Africans to the spread of Christianity means that much of the early history of the mission is unrecoverable. It is often unclear what kinds of Christianity were spread orally, for example. In other parts of southern Africa, prophetic figures emerged from time to time to use aspects of the Christian message in a context that suggests how quickly its language became unhinged from missionary guardianship. For example, Xhosa prophet and war hero Makanda Nxele (Makana), who led a Xhosa attack on the colony in 1819, had an earlier flirtation with the LMS; he was refused the right to work as a native agent when he insisted that there was a god for the white man and a god for the black man, and that he himself was related to Jesus Christ. The examples could be multiplied, as the Comaroffs would certainly agree.

In contrast to the Comaroffs, who emphasize the orthodoxy of the Nonconformists (whom they see in rather stereotypical, indeed Victorianist, terms), I would contend that this anxiety was familiar from debates within the European churches as well; after all, Methodism had once been perceived from within the citadels of Anglican orthodoxy in ways similar to Nonconformist views of African ecstatic innovation.40 If in the early days of missionary activity, Christianity was never fully in the control of the white missionaries who had brought it and only became popular once it was spread mostly by Africans and then transformed in the process, what does this imply about how we might conceptualize the study of colonial missions? I have suggested in the past that the messy scenario I outline above, with its complications and its fudging across the fault lines, calls into question the utility at the micro level of a strict dialectical approach to the history of colonial Christianity. The ghost of French structuralist understandings of G. W. Hegel's master-slave dialectic seems to me to hover over and to constrain the first volume. In response, however, the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2 that I have too conventional an understanding of their view of dialectical processes. A dialectic is not a "formal, abstract, or strictly teleological movement through time and space," in a Hegelian sense. Rather, it is a "process of reciprocal determination; a process of material, social and cultural articulation-involving sentient human beings rather than abstract forces or structures."41 Colonialism is dialectical because it creates binary understandings of difference and depends on the idea of opposites; it is also presumably dialectical because colonial interaction shapes both the colonized and the colonizer in new ways. Returning to the issue at the end of Volume 2, the Comaroffs reiterate (although this seems to me a somewhat different take) that by "dialectics" they mean "the mutually transforming play of social forces whose outcome is neither linear nor simply overdetermined." Defined thus, they add, "it is hard to imagine how colonial history could be regarded as anything else."42 In a weak sense, this is undeniable. Furthermore, on this model, it may not matter that the early encounter between missionaries and Tswana was so much messier than a "dialectical" account would suggest. The Comaroffs' point is precisely that out of difference and mess colonialism created binary opposites. At the same time, the exact nature of this process is often hard to capture. It is interesting to hear John Comaroff raise, in a recently published transcribed conversation with Homi Bhabha, what he terms the question of theory related to "the old Manichean opposition between colonizer and colonized, those 'iteratively marked,' positionally conflated points of reference around which the human geography of empire is so widely imagined. How, other than purely by descriptive insistence, does one displace the crushing logic of binarism in terms of which 40 Among many possibilities, see Deborah Valenze, Prophetic Sons and Daughters: Female Preaching and Popular Religion in Industrial England (Princeton, N.J., 1985). 41 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 29. 42 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 410.

Perhaps my own discomfort arises from the difficulty of defining who the agents of dialectic are. In the end, the Comaroffs are interested in doing a historical anthropology of colonialism, more than of religion in colonial contexts. In this optic, the fault line of interest is that between colonized and colonizer. Religious belief did not, however, adhere to that fault line, even though both colonized and colonizers mobilized religion to the ends of power struggle. Nor of course was Christianity itself static. At the same time, the very notion of ethnic difference was still in the process of being worked out more broadly well past the early era of industrialization; therefore it was incorporated differently into the views of colonial evangelists at different times. From the point of view of the Comaroffs' overall narrative structure, this leads us away from the Enlightenment and onto the terrain of more immediately nineteenth-century colonial concerns. On this model, colonial conquest and the need to maintain and justify white rule shaped the mid- nineteenth-century culture of white Christianity. The end was not contained in the beginning but formed by colonial processes. Be that as it may, it is instructive that the Khoesan themselves were not able indefinitely to maintain the interstitial status to which Christianity gave them some access. By the early 1850s, many living in the Cape Colony were forced to choose between the colonial binaries of "black" and "white," in the 1850-1853 frontier war in which many people of Khoesan descent rebelled to fight against the "white" colony, as "race" became the determinant of colonial identity.44 The example also underscores the importance of "black" and "white" as colonial binaries arguably of more importance than "English" and "Tswana." All this should not, however, lead us to read the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in terms of the mid-nineteenth. There is a basic problem here that dogs the Comaroffs throughout the books. Christianity is both text and practice, and therefore difficult to pin down. Not only that, it also permits and contains a wide variety both of practices and of different interpretations of its central themes. As text, Christianity became a free-floating signifier. As a practice, it was fought over bitterly by those who wanted to benefit from it. It is therefore difficult to identify Christianity clearly with one side of a dialectical or even dialogic model. This is all the more problematic because it is hard to define Christianity clearly, other than by appeals to authority. There was considerable scope for Africans to reinvent Christianity even from the beginning of the mission described by the Comaroffs. In some ways, this is precisely the Comaroffs' point: the signs of Christianity were fought over by competing ethnic groups. The Comaroffs nonetheless cannot bring themselves to see acceptance of Christianity in its unadulterated mission form as anything other than a defeat for 43 Bhabha and Comaroff, "Speaking of Postcoloniality," 22. 44 Elbourne, Blood Ground, 345-76; Robert Ross, "The Kat River Rebellion and Khoikhoi Nationalism: The Fate of an Ethnic Identification," Kronos: Journal of Cape History/Tydskrif vir Kaaplandse Geskiedenis 24 (November 1997): 91-105.

This position ultimately obscures complexity. EVENTUALLY, ONE MUST CONFRONT the type of question raised by Leon de Kock, about disciplinary conventions and the fetishization of the archive.45 De Kock argues that historians have spent too much time in their reaction to this wonderful book looking for factual flaws. To put the question in its boldest form, are the details really that essential to the overall project? Perhaps less tendentiously, what are the Comaroffs doing that goes beyond the reading of the words of colonists? The Comaroffs are important precisely because they move beyond words to decipher the gestures of people in the past. They put an anthropologist's emphasis on ritual and performance. They add thereby a crucial dimension to our reading of culture-bound historical archives. The Comaroffs' understanding of performance goes well beyond the staged performances of religious rites (although they acknowledge at the same time that people used the framework of religious ritual as a springboard for their own acting out of emotions and ideas). The missionaries are described as performing civilization, in the hope of educating the Tswana to adopt Western cultural practices through the power of display. In response, the Tswana performed noncompliance or acted out cultural bricolage. The tangible display of the body interests the Comaroffs, just as the material suffering of the colonized body that we readers know is to come provides a moral template for our reading of the early nineteenth century. The authors are particularly interested in space and the disposition of the body in space: their analyses frequently return, like the apartheid state itself, to issues of the control of the movement of African bodies.46 The Comaroffs are in some ways mistrustful of the self-interested and one-sided colonial text and find more solidity in the unspoken exchanges of bodily perfor- mance. It is this approach that both furnishes the greatest richness of the books and yet at the same time has excited unease in some interlocutors. If the evidence that remains of Tswana actions is mostly accounts of their physical activity, does that not place the reporter (the anthropologist, the historian, or even the reader) in the privileged position of interpreting Tswana actions, leaving the Tswana themselves rarely free to speak directly in their own voice? Is this even an accurate assessment of the nature of the historical record, or are there more extensive Tswana records? J. D. Y. Peel and Terence Ranger have both queried the absence of Tswana 45 De Kock, "For and Against the Comaroffs." 46 For example, Volume 2 tellingly argues that integral to the late nineteenth-century struggle over African labor was a further struggle over the "distribution of people in space and, concomitantly, their passage across the social landscape." This is a typical discussion of space that appropriately reflects the struggle of the apartheid state to control the physical body, just as slavery had earlier lent mastery of the body to the slaveowner.

The Comaroffs have responded that community historical narrative was not a genre espoused by the Tswana. They argue, furthermore, that the quest for "narrative" is elitist: it is "a short step from the stress on narrative to the history of elites, thence to elitist history."48 The issue remains uneasily unresolved. For Paul Landau, the Comaroffs themselves have a culturally constrained view of what constitutes "genuine narrative." They pay "little attention to genealogy, song, Tswana conversation, letters, political speech, tales, myth or church charters- because they are not 'genuine' narratives. Consequently Tswana people's ideas of fulfillment and transcendence do not show themselves in either volume."49 Even the Tswana intellectual and politician Sol Plaatje's great novel Mhudi, which draws on Tswana traditions about the difaqane, has been brought into the fray: for the Comaroffs, the fact that Plaatje himself claims that he could only gather material in fragments suggests that the southern Tswana indeed did not have a tradition of sustained historical narrative as late as the early twentieth century, even though Mhudi is more conventionally seen as a reflection at least to some extent of more sustained Tswana oral tradition.50 There is another critical debate at work in these discussions of agency and voice. The Comaroffs are very clear that missionary activity was part of the victimization of Africans. Much recent scholarship on southern African Christianity emphasizes instead the agency of Africans in using and reshaping Christianity to their own ends, as the focus has shifted away from missionaries and onto African Christians. In some ways, the Comaroffs want to restore a sense of moral indignation at the ways in which colonial missions did change the consciousness of Africans in a damaging fashion. Ironically, this may involve seeing people as victims who did not necessarily see themselves that way at the time-another issue of authorial voice. The Comaroffs' anger represents nonetheless an important strand of longstanding protest across the colonized world at the "colonization of the mind."51 It is impossible to deny that many Christian missionaries had a profoundly negative 47 J.

Furthermore, as Peggy Brock has persuasively argued, missionary institutional structures affected the degree of control missionaries could exert over congregations, and these structures were affected by indigenous social arrangements as well as by state power.53 I would further contend, in ways there is not space to elaborate on fully here, that shame was a key element of colonial control. Mission education could and did reinforce this. At the same time, Christianity could also provide a language through which to reclaim dignity and deny the shaming process. I think it is important in sum to see Christianity as a language with many possible uses. Conversion, for example, fulfilled a wider and more flexible range of functions than is suggested by the Comaroffs' reduction of it to a symbolic field of struggle over capitalism. A reading that focuses too exclusively on Christianity as a language of cultural domination rather than a language with a multiplicity of possible meanings pays too much attention to the Western roots of Christianity and not enough to the multiple uses to which Africans very quickly put it. I make this comment in awareness of the extent to which the Comaroffs emphasize the need to explore African perspectives through every possible means, and the extent to which they clearly do this. However, conversion was even more of an empty signifier than the Comaroffs suggest, and some of these significations did not have a lot to do with rational capitalism. On the other hand, conversion was also an act, with attached rituals and beliefs, and this is important for understanding what the act meant in the immediate rather than long-term sense. Even if I am not completely at ease with a victimization model, I would want to add that these were and are enormously complicated processes. They had deep and often painful implications for many. This demands humility from any historian. Undergirding much of the above has been a historian's concern with chronology, which, while justified, cannot do full justice to the rich ferment of ideas in these remarkable books. The Comaroffs in fact comment on what they see as different disciplinary conventions and their inherent costs and benefits. They see real and longstanding differences, as they remark at the end of Volume 2, between the ideal type of a more conventional historian and the archetypal historical anthropologist: "differences between the ideographic and the nomothetic, between the effort to arrive at the fullest possible description of events in their infinite particularity and the desire to pick out general principles across time and space." The latter approach, they underscore, "demands a certain boldness of abstraction" and is "inherently risky."54 Although one would hope that historians are not as painstak- ingly antiquarian and abstraction-averse as this implies, there is some justice to the 52 A wonderfully instructive example of the ambiguities of Christian liberal control of the education system in South Africa, just before apartheid, is furnished by Shula Marks, ed., Not Either an Experimental Doll: The Separate Worlds of Three South African Women (London, 1985). 53 Peggy Brock, "Mission Encounters in the Colonial World: British Columbia and South-West Australia," Journal of Religious History 24, no. 2 (June 2000): 159-79. 54 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 411. AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 455 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elboume comment, at least as it pertains to the Comaroffs' own work. The very manner in which they offer up a multitude of bold ideas, fizzing with possibility, also ensures that they offer a number of hostages to fortune. The Comaroffs are, for example, probably the most influential of recent scholars to argue for tight linkage between missionary activity, "modernity," "Enlighten- ment," and globalization. As Brian Stanley points out, this is also a question that has been much debated in the past few years by Christian theologians and mission theorists, with theologians paying particular attention to the damage done by the universalist truth claims of mission Christianity.55 More broadly, the Comaroffs are participating in a vast debate about modernity and postmodernity among social, political, and cultural theorists that it would be foolhardy to venture upon here. Their contribution is both important and vexed: important because they show the culturally constrained nature of claims to "modernity," vexed because despite everything they reify the truth claims of modernity and have too neat a view of the "Enlightenment," despite substantial historical debate on the utility of the concept. In so doing, they exaggerate the long-term influence of mission Christianity on the material subjugation of the Tswana, particularly by minimizing the impact of illiberal forces and overemphasizing cultural change. This could be true, however, and the significance of the Comaroffs' analysis of practice still be undimmed. The Comaroffs see "modernity" as "always historically constructed." It is in their view "an ideological formation in terms of which societies valorize their own practices by contrast to the specter of barbarism and other marks of negation."56 The Comaroffs link modernity to a view of the self as a rights-bearing atomistic individual, ultimately the "fully fledged bourgeois subject." They further associate modernity with a wide-ranging series of cultural and economic practices, including but not limited to dependence on a worldwide market, industrialization, the use of money, the use of "advanced" agricultural practices, the promotion of individuated space, and a sense of the body as private.57 It is part of the great richness of the Comaroffs' approach that they so fruitfully link cultural and economic practices, refusing to prioritize one over the other. At the same time, this view of modernity is slippery-and this is both its richness and an occasional source of frustration. The Comaroffs move between presenting the truth claims of modernity-its "text," if one likes-and the concrete material practices that advocates saw as characterizing the modern. The authors' desire not to take the truth claims of missionaries at face value make it difficult for them to spell out what, if any, were the irreducible material practices that defined modernity. If there weren't any, however, what was the material force behind the cultural claims and practices of missionaries? Yet it is arguable that at least some of what the Comaroffs identify as the 55 Brian Stanley, "Christian Missions and the Enlightenment: A Reevaluation," in Stanley, ed., Christian Missions and the Enlightenment (Grand Rapids, Mich., 2001), 1-2. Stanley points to David Bosch's Transforming Mission: Paradigm Shifts in Theology of Mission (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1991) as a seminal text for Christian theologians of mission in a postmodern context. 56 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 32. 57 A particularly influential figure for the Comaroffs' reading of the creation of the modern self in Volume 2 is Charles Taylor, whose Sources of the Self is a seminal text for their work. Taylor is of course a Christian Hegelian, whose view of the emergence of the modern self is certainly influenced by Hegelian dialectics, in however inexplicit a fashion.

There are echoes here of the great debates between radical and liberal historians in 1970s and 1980s South Africa, split over the origins of apartheid.58 For the "radical" school, liberalism, in both its ideological and economic sense, contributed to the economic domination that was at the root of apartheid. Radical historians argued that late nineteenth-century British capitalism precipitated and anticipated many features of South African society under apartheid, just as the Comaroffs here blame nine- teenth-century British liberal ideas about such things as money, markets, the individuated self, and the primacy of certain gender roles for the mental prepara- tion of the Tswana for labor oppression. Indeed, in their 2000 article "Millennial Capitalism: First Thoughts on a Second Coming," the Comaroffs explicitly link what they term the "Age of Revolution" (1789-1848) to the current "Age of Millennial Capitalism" with their similar anxieties and ontological challenges.59 This article makes explicit the magical, mystical elements of neoliberalism, and its culturally constrained forms, in contrast to neoliberals' claims to rationality and access to universal truth, just as Of Revelation and Revolution describes culturally constructed views of "modernity" and a "modern" economy. This is very helpful. Nonetheless, I think it would also be useful in Of Revelation and Revolution to be more explicit about actual intellectual debates among and between people: to have more ideology in places and less hegemony. The argument made by many, that early twentieth-century white liberals in practice came to support racist segregationist policies, while in ideological terms liberalism's support of the free market economy and nonviolent political action left it with little space to mobilize opposition to apartheid, all adds up to a trenchant and at least partially justified critique. By leaving out of the picture the intellectual shifts in liberalism (and among the opponents of liberalism) on the ground in the nineteenth century (and implicitly in the twentieth), however, the Comaroffs, like other authors, conflate several ills into one. Disciplinary specialists might want to throw further darts at the Comaroffs' narrative superstructure. Must industrialization and by implication modernity really begin in 1789? This is very French. What might be the impact of the questioning by economists of the linearity and suddenness of industrialization in Britain, which now looks more like an extended messy process than a "revolution" within neat chronological parameters? What difference does it make that the evangelical movement had many roots in seventeenth and eighteenth-century continental pietism? If Protestantism is the necessary condition of capitalism, where does this leave Catholic countries (not least France)? The point I want to close on is, however, that of tragedy. If there is, as I have suggested, an implicit narrative of origins that runs throughout Of Revelation and Revolution and lends the work its moral passion, this is not, for all that, a straightforward linear narrative of beginnings and ends. Rather, it is marked by 58 Christopher Saunders, The Making of the South African Past: Major Historians on Race and Class (Cape Town, 1988), describes the liberal/radical split. 59 Jean Comaroff and John L.

The Nonconformist missionaries who labored so intensely to change the daily lives of Africans in order to induct them into the "modern" economy did not foresee the devastating consequences of that economy for the Tswana peasantry (as might be said of some of the missionaries' modern counterparts, development workers). At the same time, the Comaroffs write as though missionaries inducted the Tswana into the global market and colonized their consciousness in a way that made their engagement more likely. It seems to me just as possible that the global market and related economic coercion came crashing into the lives and consciousness of the Tswana in a way about which they could do little, particularly as their contact was frequently mediated by coercive legislation on the part of the colonial state.60 Missionaries reflected the efforts of other Westerners to moralize the market: to see it as a force for moral good. In this, they shared the ambiguities (and guilty conscience?) of nineteenth-century liberalism. It does not take a great leap of the imagination to find contemporary parallels in the neoliberal discourse, and of course the Comaroffs are right that this putatively universalist creed contains deeply embedded culturally specific assumptions, as did nineteenth-century Anglo- American liberalism itself.61 If nonetheless market expansion is relatively inevita- ble, then is it not appropriate to ask on what terms this expansion might be the most moral? Or is the most appropriate response full-fledged resistance? Must the global marketplace necessarily be bad, on average, for Africa? From a somewhat different point on the ideological spectrum, one might also ask whether in fact Africa is incorporated into the global market on the equal terms supposedly demanded by neoliberal economics. These are clearly issues beyond the scope of this article, but not without historical parallels. In late nineteenth and early twentieth-century terms, the Tswana, it could be argued, were crowded out of an agricultural market in which many were making profits and farming more effectively than whites, in fact, in order to favor white farmers artificially and in order to bolster labor for the mines, again through "artificial" restraints on movement, through the theft of land, through racially targeted taxation, and through coercive legislation. This antici- pated many of the later strategies of apartheid.62 It is not as clear to me as it is to the Comaroffs that the questions some missionaries and Africans were asking about the possibility of a just economy were not the right ones, even if the culturally constrained answers they gave were so obviously, hopelessly wrong. I do not have answers to these questions either-merely some sympathy with the misguided quest for certainty in a rapidly changing, brutal, and deeply uncertain economic universe. 60 This is a point also made by Landau, "Hegemony and History." 61 Uday Mehta, Liberalism and Empire: A Study in Nineteenth-Century British Liberal Thought (Chicago, 1999); Mehta, "Liberal Strategies of Exclusion," in Stoler and Cooper, Tensions of Empire, 59-86. 62 Ted Matsetela, "The Life Story of Mma-Pooe: Aspects of Sharecropping and Proletarianization in the Northern Orange Free State 1890-1930," in Shula Marks and Richard Rathbone, eds., Industrialization and Social Change in South Africa (New York, 1982), 212-37; Charles Van Onselen, The Seed Is Mine: The Life of Kas Maine, a South African Sharecropper, 1894-1985 (Cape Town, 1996). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh I HAVE SUGGESTED THROUGHOUT THIS ESSAY that the Comaroffs present nineteenth- century missionaries as fairly powerful figures, able to effect changes in the consciousness of Tswana interlocutors, despite the resistance of many. In contrast, I see Christianity as important but, with some important exceptions, not necessarily white missionaries themselves. I also suggest that the linkages between political and cultural colonialism are often unclear in Of Revelation and Revolution, and that the role of "cultural colonialism" is overdetermined. If it is possible to guess about such counterfactuals, I suspect that at least some of the missionaries whose work has been scrutinized by the Comaroffs would ironically have preferred the Comaroffs' account of their activities to mine, however doubtless upset they would have been at the implication that their preaching laid the groundwork for the Tswana's entrapment within enslaving capitalist systems. But the Comaroffs do give the missionaries credit for a coherent, rationalizing, globalizing system that taught one universal truth. They also recognize the missionaries' own belief that they might instill into their converts the necessary principles of "civilization" to transform totally their supposedly primitive economies and to move them rapidly up the scale of human development toward settled commercial societies. My own interpretation, while recognizing the tremendous importance of the universalizing project as a mode of domination, calls into question the capacity of Christianity to convey as effectively as it would have liked a message of unifying orthodoxy, or indeed the overall ability of missionaries to accomplish their objectives. From the very beginning of the activity of Christians in Africa, as elsewhere in the world, Christianity was out of control, unorthodox, and an available subject for reinter- pretation in light of the needs of its interlocutors. Ironically, in sum, it is not always wise to take missionaries at their word.

Abstract: I conclude, then, that the task of theological ethics and, more broadly, the humanities and, if I can be bold, more broadly still the university itself is to examine carefully and critically and from multiple perspectives—including the religions—what it means to be and to live as responsible human beings within the vulnerabilities and complexities of forms of life. When we within our several disciplines respond to this task with all the vitality and resources at our disposal, then, I believe, knowledge will indeed grow from more to more, and life will be increased without the illusions of power or servitude to the tyranny of idols.<br>

Abstract: Excavating Victoriansbrings out very clearly the discomfort the newly discovered vast expanse of geological time gave the Victorians and examines some of the writings that helped shape responses to it. Though the book may not be of particular relevance to the historian focusing closely on Victorian geology or archaeology, for the historian of science who examines wider cultural or literary phenomena it is an important guide to the stimulus that the writings of geologists and archaeologists gave other mid-Victorian writers. Nevertheless, the specialist or narrowly focused historian of science will probably find it frustrating rather than helpful, since the overviews of Victorian geology and archaeology are brief and there are distracting errors, such as the attribution of theNinth Bridgewater Treatiseto William Buckland rather than to Charles Babbage (p. 18). The chapters on Tennyson and Dickens are both interesting and illuminating, although a reader accustomed to historical argument and with limited knowledge of the techniques of literary criticism may find them faintly bewildering in places. Nonetheless, it is in this part of the analysis that the work provides valuable guidance to the historian of science.<br>

Author(s): Franke,  William<br>
Abstract: Franke’s book has considerable merit, but I have a theoretical and a practical concern with his appropriation of negative theology. First, negative theology is never entirely negative, and while Franke recognizes that poetic language is both deconstructive and open, he nevertheless insists that our various theologies—literary or religious—finally have no positive content. Perhaps this is the postmodernism in his negative theology because this is not entirely consistent with the theological tradition. A good counterexample is Pseudo‐Dionysius, whose mystical theology seeks finally to overcome the limitations of both positive and negative speaking. Dionysius insists that God is love in a way that is both negative and positive. On this, Franke should consider the work of Jean‐Luc Marion and especially his response to Jacques Derrida on the subject of negative theology, and this omission is a considerable oversight. Second, many people of various faiths will never accept that their understanding of the transcendent has no positive content, and if this is a precondition for dialogue, then it is unlikely to occur. On this, the practical dimension of Franke’s study needs more development, as well as more traditional examples of poetic and theological openness from contemporary religious life.<br>

Abstract: In sum, this is one of the most important books on selves or the practical side of personhood in the last decade. It is also well written; the particular arguments are virtually always clear, and it is not too hard to keep track of their role within in the larger argument of the book. Some portions rise to an almost literary style and provide a rich survey of key ideas in twentieth-century French philosophy, while others engage quite originally with scholarship in moral psychology and theories of self-knowledge that will be more familiar to analytic readers. This work also complements the more detailed ethical theory on Larmore’s other books. Despite its relative inattention to volitional aspects of practical identity, and some questionable moves in the critique of authenticity, then, this work is still highly recommended.<br>

Abstract: The cultural and social sciences are welcome to examine and critique theology and Christian practice, and theology can profitably learn from these studies, but the studies themselves are not theology. To be theology, even in an interdisciplinary sense, the work must become constructive and speak to the
   religiousthought and practice of specific communities or faith traditions. In any given community, theology can become a displaced language in need of renewal, but theology can also uncover the displaced or implicit religion within the seemingly secular. To do this well, theology must remain in critical tension with the cultural sciences, including literature. The result may well be deconstructive, but such radical critique is necessary for any living tradition.<br>

Abstract: Pablo Wright observes that while I leave behind Geertz’s concept of a cultural system with respect to morality, I retain the Geertzian concern with symbols and meaning. I would not dispute Wright’s statement that meaning is the master concept on a methodological level prior to the substantive issue of evil but would stress that in addition to idiom, code, practice, and symbol, experience must figure into a comprehensive account. Wright’s evocative references to “moral installation in the world” (one might consider terms like investment, suffusion, and tonality, as well as installation) and morality as a “practiced ontology in the micropolitics of social life” deserve further elaboration. Wright endorses a pluralized notion of moralities, but I reiterate that even more important is an adjectival sense of moral rather than the nominal morality. Like Parkin, Wright poses the question of how to reintroduce the ethnographically salient notions of cosmological and radical evil once evil is first construed as a human and intersubjective phenomenon. The answer is to ask how these dimensions come into play in the experiential immediacy of social life, for example, how a cosmological battle between angels and devils is experienced concretely on the human scale. Finally, he suggests that concepts of power from Otto and the shadow from Jung may be alternatives to the notion of evil, though I rejoin that they are just as much in need of critique with respect to Christian overtones. They may be valuable for the study of morality but are not suitable replacements for evil in the sense for which I have argued.<br>

Abstract: Despite these caveats,
   Contemplative Nationis highly recommended for scholars of Jewish studies, religious studies, philosophy, and theology. The book is an excellent example of how to apply hermeneutical theories to the study of Judaism, how to bridge the gap between continental philosophy and analytic philosophy, and how to expand the scope of Jewish studies by appreciating the nature of theological discourse. While Judaica scholars could use the book in university-level courses, and rabbis could apply its approach to synagogue life, the claim that “Israel” is a “contemplative nation” will hardly resonate with most Jews today. It is very doubtful that the book could “guide the way for [the] future” of the Jewish people’s survival (226), precisely because Jews today are overwhelmingly secular, and the culture in which Jews live, both in Israel and in the Diaspora, is anti-intellectual and antitheological. Furthermore, if Fisher is so keen on Philo, he should have also reminded his readers of the fate of Philo’s enterprise: it was no coincidence that Philo became one of the Church Fathers and that his exegetical/hermeneutical project was not adopted by the tradition that became normative Judaism. When “Israel” denotes a nation of divine contemplators, “carnal Israel” (namely “Israel” as a historical, cultural, and ethnic entity) is marginalized, denigrated, and persecuted. It is true that Jewish religious life is theological, but being Jewish cannot be reduced to contemplating God.<br>

Abstract: Ultimately it is at times unclear what is gained in making these comparisons or if such analysis “enhances our understanding of the relationship between religious narratives and politics” (p. 92). What precisely is revealed in grouping these movements together, other than that political crisis invites prophetic criticism? Gutterman carefully unpacks the readings of shared Biblical texts, and he skillfully details contextual and interpretative differences. But one wishes he had gone beyond these descriptive endeavors to construct a more nuanced account of the relationship between religion and politics and, more importantly, of the specifically religious grounds of the activism he examines. While Gutterman can be theoretically deft—in exploring the relation between narrative and politics (p. 21) or garden/wilderness metaphors (p. 47)—he is not fully engaged with the literature on political religion, often citing unrepresentative figures like William Connolly or Stephen Carter. He is a sharp writer with an eye for interesting problems and material. I applaud his engagement with important issues and also the ambition of his thinking. But his central categories require further explication, and this book speaks to the need for more conversations across disciplines.<br>

Abstract: Benjamin also notes: “Every present day is determined by the images that are synchronic with it: each ‘now’ is the now of a particular recognizability. In it, truth is charged to the bursting point with time. (This point of explosion, and nothing else, is the death of the
            intentio, which thus coincides with the birth of authentic historical time, the time of truth.) It is not that what is past casts its light on what is present, or what is present its light on what is past; rather, image is that wherein what has been comes together in a flash with the now to form a constellation” (2002, N3,1). The two great related demands made by T. S. Eliot in “Tradition and the Individual Talent” will also be recalled here: his call for the exercise of the “historical sense” as a juxtaposition of significant events from discontinuous times, which in turn produces an “impersonal” (nonintentional) effect. These demands define the representation of history in works such asThe Waste Landand Pound’s early cantos.<br>

Abstract: Culture has been regarded as an anathema to psychology as an empiricist research tradition. Despite the explosive growth of research on culture and psychology over the last decade of the 20
         thcentury and its importance in Asian social psychology, the ontological and epistemological tension between psychology as a science and psychology as a cultural/historical discipline introduced in the writings of the thinkers of the Enlightenment and counter-Enlightenment still lingers on in the contemporary discourse of psychology. Clifford Geertz once ominously suggested that cultural psychology may have chewed more than it can. In this paper, the interpretive turn in social science as exemplified by writings of Charles Taylor and Paul Ricoeur is reviewed and discussed how it may impinge on the practice of Asian social psychology as an empirical science in methodological, epistemological, and ontological respects. It is argued here that the current practice of Asian social psychology is largely, though not entirely, free of the challenges mounted by these theorists, and that Asian social psychology has an advantage of not encumbered by this traditional tension due to a monist ontology that is prevalent in Asia.<br>

Abstract: Conventional views of text/music relationships in early Italian opera focus on the imitation of affections. But by dealing exclusively with the referential meanings of texts (e.g., emotions, images, and concepts) these views overlook an important aspect of music's interaction with language. In opera, music also imitates language's contextual and communicative functions—i.e., discourse, as studied today by the subfield of linguistics called pragmatics. In his operas Monteverdi fully realized Peri's ideal of “imitating in song a person speaking” (“imitar col canto chi parla”) by musically emphasizing those context-dependent meanings that emerge especially in ordinary language and that are prominent in dramatic texts, as opposed to poetry and prose. Such meanings are manifest whenever words such as “I,” “here,” and “now” appear— words called “deictics”—with the function of situating the speaker/singer's utterances in a specific time and place. Monteverdi highlights deictics through melodic and rhythmic emphases, repetition, shifts of meter, style, and harmony, as part of a strategy to create a musical language suited to opera as a genre and to singers as actors. In
         Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patriaandL'incoronazione di Poppea, this strategy serves large-scale dramaturgical aims with respect to the relationships among space, time, and character identity, highlighting issues also discussed within the contemporary intellectual context.<br>

Abstract: In his 1986 essay on the intersections between music theory, phenomenology, and perception, David Lewin develops a heuristic model through which to come to terms with the constitution of multiple and heterogeneous perceptions of musical events. One of his principal vehicles for demonstrating this phenomenological turn is the well-known analysis of Schubert's “Morgengruß.” The present article considers the ramifications of Lewin's methodology, particularly with respect to the experience of time that emerges from Lewin's mobilization of the heuristic perception model, by approaching it from the perspective of Husserl's
         Phenomenology of Internal Time Consciousness. This perspective reveals a superposition of temporalities as well as a superposition of languages as the underlying factors through which Lewin's analysis is produced.<br>

Abstract: This article examines the conflicts of 1990s Algeria and Assia Djebar's critique of these events using the flexibility and experimentation of the novel form. The entrenched government of the Front de Libération Nationale has been engaged in an ongoing conflict with a group of radical, underground Islamist terrorists, and the result has been that both parties attempt to quash any political or cultural dissent. The government clings to its policy of strict Arabization, while the Islamists fight for the invention of a thoroughly new spiritual, Islamic community, necessarily in harmony with itself. Djebar's
         Le Blanc de l'Algérie (Algerian White)challenges both the Islamists and the government by exposing the limits of their stultifying rhetoric, and by describing the author's own experiences of bereavement using an alternative language resistant to generic norms. Djebar upholds unique, creative forms of commemoration that refuse to conform to the demands of Islamist ideology or sanctioned political rhetoric, and that can mimic her deceased friends' own singular art forms. At the same time, Djebar's commemorative text seeks a language free from convention-bound formulae and able to transcend the linear progress of a narrative necessarily evolving through time. In this sense,Le Blanc de l'Algérieuses both content and form to deconstruct the layers and masks of commemorative discourse, and the political misuse of those masks. The novel engages with the difficulties of creating an appropriate discourse of mourning while stretching and opening out existing rhetorical forms.<br>

Abstract: This essay argues that Emily Dickinson’s poetry intervenes in the broad cultural assessment of epistemology provoked by the evolutionary debates of the 1860s. While scholars have begun to explore the thematic correspondences between Dickinson’s poetry and some aspects of this cultural conversation, this essay examines the ways in which her intervention occurs at the level of poetic form and is in fact profoundly dependent upon form. Specifically, it analyzes a set of her poems from the early 1860s through the early 1870s in which she uses the dual structure of metaphor to elicit a way of thinking about truth that is aligned with the empirical methods of research that were widely embraced in the mid nineteenth century; however, in the face of an increasingly contingent notion of truth, Dickinson’s way of thinking significantly revises cultural assumptions about what those methods might yield. The metaphors examined here amplify the distinctions between two material entities—lightning and fork, or sunset and lilac, for example—rather than merging them or leaping beyond them to stable, transcendent meaning. What Dickinson plays with is the possibility of a revised version of revelation or truth, one that is not only derived from the observation of material difference through the two parts of a metaphor, but that is more radically contingent on the perpetuity of such dual perception. Altogether, Dickinson’s metaphors are both critical and recuperative, as they contribute to the dismantling of fixed truth while embracing the limited revelations made possible by—
         onlymade possible by—sustained process.<br>

Abstract: The
         Left Behindnovels by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins have become a major publishing phenomenon in recent years. The novels have succeeded in part because they address the anxieties of their readers, using apocalyptic language to depict a future world in which evildoers are punished, and the faithful reverse the tables on their cultural marginality. The novels, however, also speak to the "here and now," articulating in narrative form the beliefs and actions that place one among either the saved or the damned. The novels accomplish this through the issuance of marks. Both believers and the followers of Antichrist have distinctive marks, which prove less than reliable. At stake, ultimately, is an evangelicalism open to the ambiguity and uncertainty of contemporary life, and a reactive fundamentalism that insists, metaphorically, on the rigidity of marks—a quest for certainty ill-advised in a world characterized by relentless change.*<br>

Abstract: Abstract:The concem with progress and utility is shared by nineteenth-century scientists, philosophers, and rhetoricians, leading to significant correspondences among their discourses. This concern is manifest, for example, in the way in which several rhetorical treatises of the nineteenth century regard the distinction between a figure and a trope, which had been a common part of rhetorical theory since the time of Quintilian, as useless and anachronistic. By examining three nineteenth-century articulations of the justifications for erasing the trope/figure distinction from the cultural repertoire, this essay reveals structural and semantic parallels between these rhetorical treatises and the discourses of evolution and utilitarianism. Thus, the essay locates the source of the synonymity which the terms "trope" and "figure" have acquired in contemporary critical metalanguage in Victorian ideologies of progress and of the unprofitability and consequent discardability of the ancient.<br>

Abstract: Abstract: Vico's theory of metaphor is best understood as a monster in the tradition of classical rhetorical invention. It is the mutant offspring of metaphor characterized as "necessary" (an "ear" of com, for example) and metaphor characterized in terms of analogy. From the perspective of his method. Vico marries these apparently incompatible forms inherited from Aristotle and thereby identifies a third type of linguistic metaphor. I argue that the metaphor identifies a stipulatory definition taken out of context. In order to situate this claim, I outline Vico's genetic analysis and elaborate in general terms what metaphor and definition share. Most importantly. Vico insists that beings, actions, and events are linguistically identifiedin some particular diseursive context. Indeed, in many cases that context alone determines whether the expression can be called a definition or a metaphor. Like Cicero's ideal jurist, Vico's hero employs motivated words and realizes possibilities available to common sense. Henee Vico's theory of metaphor is both "constructivist"—language has the power to makes things—and "humartist"—it must do so in a form appropriate to history and culture. Vico's theory is consequently important to us because it challenges the proper/figurative distinction championed in the philosophy of language and adds a pragmatic dimension to contemporary views of metaphor at work in literary theory.<br>

Abstract: Abstract:This essay argues that in 1 Thessalonians, Paul uses eschatological discourse—language about the end of hme—in order to evoke a symbolic world-view in which his readers become God's elect, living at the end of time and awaiting the sudden, imminent retum of Christ from heaven. This self-identification explains their present misfortunes, while at the sam.e time demanding that they fulfill the ethical and moral demands of the Christian faith. More broadly, this essay points to the role that eschatological discourse played within early Christianity in general, suggesting that it formed a central, paradigmatic drama which helped to define ontological and teleological reality for the movement's adherents.<br>

Abstract: In the
         Rhetoric, Aristotle identifies "bringing-before-the-eyes" as a capacity that is crucial to metaphors because it allows rhetors to actualize actions immediately before audiences, leading those audiences to insight. Because this description suggests that metaphors activate cognitive mechanisms on the part of their listeners, "bringing-before-the-eyes" has been considered a key element within Aristotle's theory and the nexus of that approach to metaphor and contemporary conceptual ones. Yet, no study has probed these claims to any degree. Accordingly, this paper examines Aristotle's references to "bringing-before-the-eyes" as well as to two associated concerns,energeia/actualization and sense perception. This examination demonstrates that "bringing-before-the-eyes" is not explicitly cognitive but instead a perceptive capacity. In this, Aristotle's theory anticipates recent approaches to language because it allows the audience to participate in the persuasive process at a level that extends its role beyond the traditional Aristotelian understanding that it is the target of emotional appeals.<br>

Abstract: AbstractBeginning with Roland Barthes' “The Old Rhetoric: an aide-mémoire” (1964–65), semioticians have shown a remarkable interest in the history of rhetoric. Writers like Barthes, Tzevtan Todorov, Gérard Genette, and Paul Ricoeur have offered accounts of rhetoric's past that invariably concluded with rhetoric's demise and its replacement with semiotics. These writers typically portray rhetoric's history as one of a brief rise followed by a very long decline, a pattern, says Todorov, of “splendor and misery.” This essay examines the semioticians' predictions of rhetoric's demise as well as semiotics' attempt to claim elements of rhetoric as its own. The essay concludes by considering the present state of semiotics' aspiration to supersede rhetoric as a theory of language and human affairs.<br>

Abstract: Although research on teacher cognition is no longer in its infancy, it has largely failed to affect the ways in which programs and teachers are evaluated. In accordance with what Raths and Katz (1985) call the Goldilocks Principle, the notion of teacher cognition may simply be "too big" (too general and vague) for mundane application. This review was designed to compare alternative approaches to the evaluation of teacher cognition and to consider ways in which the literature of this subfield may be discouraging its application. Teacher cognition is defined as pre- or inservice teachers' self-reflections; beliefs and knowledge about teaching, students, and content; and awareness of problem-solving strategies endemic to classroom teaching. This paper describes and critiques five different approaches to the evaluation of teacher cognition: (a) direct and noninferential ways of assessing teacher belief, (b) methods that rely on contextual analyses of teachers' descriptive language, (c) taxonomies for assessing self-reflection and metacognition, (d) multimethod evaluations of pedagogical content knowledge and beliefs, and (e) concept mapping. In the final section, ambiguities and paradoxes inherent in this literature are discussed, particularly the continued use of rhetoric associated with process--product research. Questions regarding the ecological validity of measurement tools and tasks are raised. A suggestion is made that it may be politically exigent to begin relating measures of teacher cognition to valued student outcomes.<br>

Abstract: An assumed link between language and experience prompted the narrative collection and mutual interpretation of data between me and an immigrant from Iran whom I taught ESL. An underlying theme of the study was the quest for a helpful image of language. Realizing that dictionary meanings were inadequate in the meaning-making process, we concentrated on illustrative examples for the meaning of words. We exploited mininarratives implicit in such examples-incipient stories based on the speaker's past, present, and imaginatively projected experiences. As we expanded these "experiential narratives," the student's personal practical knowledge emerged and helped clarify troublesome words and sentences. Viewing language as experiential narrative demonstrated the importance of the context of acquisition. It increased opportunities for the negotiation of meaning and highlighted the notion of agency in the constitution of meanings.<br>

Abstract: Psychodynamically, Augustine's conversion responds to and reconstitutes tensions and relational ambivalences generated by his experiences with the "betraying embrace," principally as he has encountered its symbolic representation in his mother Monica's retentive and rejective tears, in one of her controlling dreams, and in his association with and loss of an unnamed friend. Those experiences crucially affect his own betrayals of secular covenants in his passage to conversion -- covenants with language and rhetoric, with order, and with "lower instincts," among others -- and are themselves transformatively replicated in divine and divinely sanctioned alliances scrupulously structured by his emotional requirements to prevent betrayal: in particular, Augustine's "Romantic" relationship with deific embrace perpetuates in an altered mode the discontent that brought him to seek it.<br>

Abstract: This paper proposes a theoretical foundation for extending our understanding of study drawings by bringing forward concepts from a number of disciplines that are concerned with the structure of knowledge. Study drawings are defined as the informal, private drawings that architectural designers use as a medium for graphic thinking in the exploratory stages of their work. Drawings from the work of Paxton through Picasso are analyzed to confirm the familiar characteristics of study drawings and to identify the properties which account for their role in the working process of design, including their use as a means of inquiry. This epistemological function is compared with certain features of written language in order to propose an internal structure for study drawings. The paper concludes that much of the origin and nature of knowledge in design can be explained in terms of the properties and processes of study drawings and that these terms should be used to evaluate proposals for new media in design.<br>

Abstract: The Parable of the Sower has fallen under an ancient and modern hermeneutical eclipse. Critical examination of the Markan text of the Markan text of the parable (4:3-9) indicates that the first hermeneutical eclipse of the parable's message occurred when the community which produced the interpretation of the Parable of the Sower (Mark 4:14-20) reworked the parable to conform to the community's theological needs. Removal of this community's reworked features from the text lays bare the original form of the Sower and gives us access to Jesus' original parabolic message. But apprehension of the full depth and scope of that message has not been possible with current hermeneutical methodologies. The limitations of these hermeneutics leave the message still under partial eclipse. By expanding the interpretative horizon with the help of Whiteheadian insights on ontology, epistemology, and the phenomenology of language, one is able to appreciate more fully the meaning of Jesus' proclamation in the Parable of the Sower.<br>

Abstract: This study of organised political violence in north-central Nicaragua from 1926 to 1934 focuses on the infamous Conservative gang leader Anastacio Hernandez and on Sandino's rebels. The contexts of a weak central state and local-regional caudillismo are outlined. It is shown that after the 1926-27 civil war. Hernandez and others produced ritualised spectacular violence in the service of their Chamorrista caudillo patrons. The language, practices, and characteristics of organised violence are examined. It is argued that Sandino's rebels appropriated these tools of political struggle, and that changes and continuities in the organisation of violence in Nicaraguan history merit greater attention.<br>

Abstract: Academia's mathematical metaphysics are briefly explored en route to an elaboration of the qualitatively rigorous requirements underpinning the calibration and unambiguous interpretation of quantitative instrumentation in any science. Of particular interest are Gadamer's emphases on number as the paradigm of the noetic, on the role of play in interpretation, and on Hegel's sense of method as the activity of the thing itself that thought experiences. These point toward and overlap with (1) Latour's study of the metrological social networks through which technological phenomena are brought into language as modes of being that can be understood, and (2) the way that Rasch's models for measurement comprise a potential beginning for metaphysically astute, qualitatively and quantitatively integrated, mathematical methods in the social sciences. The paper closes with observations on the general problem that is philosophy, the need to remain open to multiplicities of meaning even as clear understandings are sought and obtained.<br>

Abstract: The concept of political culture embraces some of the most basic, perennially fascinating concerns in behavioral political science; because of certain ambiguities in its theoretical formulation, however, there has been a tendency for the term to grow fuzzy with continued use. Its connection with related concepts, such as political psychology, political structure, and political language, has remained unclear, with the result that political culture has been difficult to isolate as an independent variable. Thus it has come to occupy a position on the periphery of politics, and is usually presumed to reinforce the status quo. This paper re-examines previous formulations of the concept and proposes a theoretical synthesis. The analytical framework is derived from semiological theory, a branch of science specifically designed for the analysis of meanings. The central variable is the political symbol. By analyzing the interactions of political symbols within a comprehensive semiological framework, the traditional concerns of political culture can be accommodated in a more precise and systematic way.<br>

Abstract: Working-class people perform class identities. These performances are marked with ironies in which working class symbolizes power and powerlessness. Such performances elide linear meaning-making in favor of poetic paradox and help us understand the contradictions of working-class life. "The New Deal," a chapbook by my great-grandfather, represents an occasion for understanding how one working-class person used language to consider his life's contradictions. The chapbook articulates a unique "working-class poetics" and suggests why rhetoricians ought to locate representations of the paradoxes of working-class life.<br>

Abstract: This article offers an anti-naturalist philosophical critique of the naturalist tendencies within qualitative concept formation as developed most prominently by Giovanni Sartori and David Collier. We begin by articulating the philosophical distinction between naturalism and anti-naturalism. Whereas naturalism assumes that the study of human life is not essentially different from the study of natural phenomena, anti-naturalism highlights the meaningful and contingent nature of social life, the situatedness of the scholar, and so the dialogical nature of social science. These two contrasting philosophical approaches inspire, in turn, different strategies of concept formation. Naturalism encourages concept formation that involves reification, essentialism, and an instrumentalist view of language. Anti-naturalism, conversely, challenges reified concepts for eliding the place of meanings, essentialist concepts for eliding the place of contingency, and linguistic instrumentalism for eliding the situatedness of the scholar and the dialogical nature of social science. Based on this philosophical framework, we subject qualitative concept formation to a philosophical critique. We show how the conceptual strategies developed by Sartori and Collier embody a reification, essentialism, and instrumentalist view of language associated with naturalism. Although Collier's work on concept formation is much more flexible and nuanced than Sartori's, it too remains attached to a discredited naturalism.<br>

Abstract: Drawing attention to the complex reciprocal relationship between commercialized leisure and commercial literature in the so-called "Age of Wit," this essay reconceives of the witty and witless in two important ways. Taking for granted, first of all, that wit is usually analyzed in terms of the efficacy of verbal language, the essay examines how and why debates concerning true and false wit were played out in physical terms—in this case, through the motions, gestures, and attitudes of the dancing body. Second of all, the essay attempts to account for the enduring, if unwitting, attractions of "false wit" by likening it to the tricks and transformations of contemporary English pantomime. Satirists of the 1720s, 1730s, and 1740s frequently invoke the unmeaning motion of Harlequin as a visual way of proscribing the verbal excesses of extravagant language. At the same time, apologists for pantomime associate Harlequin's "dumb Wit" with truth, reason, and the pattern of nature, claiming that the genre's corporeality allowed it to transcend the limitations and equivocations of words. The essay concludes that the popularity of pantomime contextualizes the Augustan reaction against false wit, in that it identifies a source of aesthetic pleasure in the public's eagerness to be duped by apparent sameness in difference. Early eighteenth-century readers enjoy luxuriant, illogical, and mixed metaphors, forced similes, and trifling jibes and quibbles for the same reason that early eighteenth-century spectators delight in the unexpected turns of pantomimic entertainment: in a world under the sway of Harlequin's magical slapstick, audiences derive satisfaction from being deceived.<br>

Abstract: This article draws on ethnographic examples to examine how rural Maya-speakers in the Mexican state of Yucatán ground the experience of identity politics in quotidian engagements with pre-Hispanic objects and utterances in the Maya language. My argument is intended as a revision of models of critical scholarship that have been influenced by poststructuralism and that place an overwhelming emphasis on discourse as a modality through which politically viable identities are created and performed. Specific examples show how vernacular multiculturalism is shaped by the agency of forms of language use and physical objects that have been a part of local life-worlds long before the popularization of Mayan identity politics. This offers some potentials for collaborative work that have not been fully explored in poststructural critiques of representation. L'auteur s'appuie sur des exemples ethnographiques pour étudier la manière dont les locuteurs du maya vivant dans les zones rurales de l'état mexicain du Yucatán fondent leur expérience de la politique identitaire sur une interaction quotidienne avec les objets et énoncés préhispaniques de la langue maya. Son argumentation se veut une remise en cause des modèles universitaires critiques influencés par le poststructuralisme, qui mettent lourdement l'accent sur le discours en tant que modalité permettant de créer et de réaliser des identités politiquement viables. Des exemples concrets montrent comme un multiculturalisme vernaculaire se constitue par l'action des formes d'usage du langage et des objets matériels qui faisaient partie de la vie locale longtemps avant que la politique identitaire maya se popularise. Cette approche offre un potentiel de travail en collaboration qui n'a pas été complètement exploré par les critiques poststructuralistes de la représentation.<br>

Abstract: This article proposes using the theoretical discussions of Deleuze and Guattari as a means of comprehending the various ways in which individuals speak about their ethnic identity. This is done through a case study of a state-run educational boarding school offered to subjects identified as 'ethnic' in Israel. The findings expose two ways of talking about ethnic identity: 'minor language' and 'major language'. What I term the 'major language of ethnicity' makes substantial use of state language and offers two hierarchical categories that serve as an archetype for classifying groups. The 'minor language of ethnicity', on the other hand, offers multiple local identifications and potential identity alternatives. The article suggests using dynamics at the foundation of these concepts to consider the position of the researcher and to expose existential 'lines of flight' and life inventions of subjects in everyday life.<br>

Abstract: This essay represents an attempt to critically assess the intellectual orientation often termed 'structuralism.' In particular, the essay is concerned with European, and even more specifically French, structuralism as displayed in the writings of Louis Althusser, Roland Barthes, Michel Foucault, and C. Levi-Strauss. The analysis indicates that despite a novel language, an often rigorous character, and some interesting, indeed exciting, intellectual constructions, structuralism is very much a child of positivism. The positivism/structuralism relationship is most clearly revealed when structuralism is contrasted with Marxian social inquiry. For comparative and illustrative purposes, then, the essay contrasts structuralism and Marxism.<br>

Abstract: This essay suggests Friedrich Nietzsche has a contribution to make to the theoretical enterprise of social science. Contemporary theorizing, reflecting an increased attention to language, has been focusing on the dialogical mode of production and, of course, on hermeneutics. This has led to a renewal of interest in Friedrich Nietzsche. In this essay, two alternative models of the hermeneutic circle are examined: one arising out of the work of the school of Konstanz; the other associated primarily with the work of Juergen Habermas. The former presents a circular image of the "conversational" situation; the latter portrays a time schedule of the process based on the psychoanalytic process of therapy. Nietzsche's contributions are suggested to be significant, in the first model, in regard to the mode of production and, in the second, the stage of the quasi-naturalistic turn. Nietzsche's way to truth is through constant and relentless criticizing. In contrast to the rationalistic practices of Western philosophy, Nietzsche exercised an art of interpreting based on the use of metaphor and aphorism. This practice seems to reflect Nietzsche's concern to communicate truth in a world he saw as inherently ambiguous and dynamic, thus, rendering propositional truth impossible. Nietzsche radically challenges the rational foundations on which we stand. Thus he presents us with a mode of knowledge production that reclaims traditions lost to science. In addition, Nietzsche shows, by word and example, that his existential approach offers a way to see life as a text and source for quasi-naturalistic forays toward understanding. In this way Nietzsche shows that the traditional concept of knowledge is a pseudo-concept by revealing the intimate and inseparable connection between life and knowledge. Knowledge is rooted in life; it is a manifestation of concrete psychological and political realities. Consequently, it makes sense not to ignore life as a source for explanation when examining resources for re-establishing communication when the hermeneutic circle breaks down in a moment of misunderstanding.<br>

Abstract: This paper presents an historical outlook on the macro-micro distinction in modern sociology. It links the genesis of social interactionism and microsociology to the rise of Romantic philosophy and attempts to elaborate methodological principles dividing macro- and microscopic perspectives in sociology. Six ideal-typical distinctions are considered: natural vs. social universality, emergent properties vs. emergent processes, morphological structuralism vs. genetical interactionism, choice among socially structured alternatives vs. structuring appearance into reality, structural vs. emergent directionality, operational vs. hermeneutical analysis. The complementarity of the languages of macro- and microsociological theories is advocated as a foundation for the further elaboration of conceptual links between the two levels of analysis.<br>

Abstract: Jaspers' thesis (while rejecting the claim of philosophers of the Western tradition to universal validity and Truth, yet conceding that their metaphysical systems express an awareness of Being) is as follows: "Reality is neither the object nor the subject, but that which encompasses both, the Encompassing which is illuminated in the division between subject and object"; He — the One God — is Encompassing and the greatest closeness which has its place within the inwardness of man". The whole inquiry leads Jaspers to claim that the existential self is rooted in Transcendence and the ground of all things lies in the real ization of the existential self in freedom in which eternity and time coalesce. In this freedom time — far from being the "moving image of eternity" — becomes the actual scene of the existential self's moral striving with the forces of this world, and by seizing the cipher (= the language of Transcendence) as the symbol of Transcendence, the existential self achieves authentic existence, thus endowing the historical process of time with unique and ultimate meaning. 1) Reason: It is because of reason with which God has endowed man that any content of a pretended revelation possesses any self-evidencing power: "In diesem Menschwerden durch Vernunft wird das Eine der Transzendenz fühlbar dem Einen der jeweils geschichtlichen Existenz". Yet by abandoning belief in universal Truth we become open for Truth, realised and determined in its concrete historic form for each individual by means of communication. Communication therefore becomes "the universal condition of man's being". It follows that Truth cannot be separated from communicability. It only appears in time as a realitythrough-communication so much so "that I can not even become myself alone without emerging out of my being with others". Now the element in which existential communication lives and moves and has its spiritual being is — reason ("reason is what penetrates everything"). 2) Unity of Mankind: The discovery of the unreality of man's existence apart from God, is the discovery at the same time of the fact that God is the ultimate ground of the unity of mankind. According to Jaspers the fact of life are to conform to the principle of that wider order of reality disclosed to us in the experience of communication in which the reality of each person's likeness to the image of God finds its practical application. The development of communication depends on the principle of correlation of Existenz and Transcendenz which is the property of no finite existential self, but manifests itself alike in all. Though we may be confronted with the question "Is it God or the devil who governs the world?", it remains equally true that even "failure is no argument against the truth that is rooted in transcendence". 3) Ultimate Dignity of Man: Jaspers' unequivocal emphasis on freedom, stating that "Freedom and God are inseparable" serves to assure this ideal its place in human society. Thus man's exercise of freedom knits him up into the transcendental design. The claim that certain facts and experiences yield a basis for the recognition of the ultimate dignity of man is justified precisely by this evidence that through God, as inseparable from freedom, we discern the ultimate significance of both man and humanity.<br>

Abstract: This article considers the function of the mashal (parable) in Rabbinic literature and the connection between the use to which the mashal is put in that literature and the literary form it takes. Following a consideration of the contexts, narrative and exegetical, in which the mashal appears in midrashic and talmudic literature, three disctinct models for the form are proposed: (1) As a didactic tool, whose form is exoteric and relies largely on figurative language that illustrates the ideas the parable teaches. (2) As an instrument of sectarian doctrine, often esoteric in its form, and one which closely resembles allegory and seeks to disguise its message if not to hide it. (3) As a homiletical device with the form of an allusive tale told for an ulterior purpose, in order to persuade its audience of a certain inexplicit message. The article suggests that the mashal in Rabbinic literature generally falls into the third category, and that the messages it seeks to persuade are mainly on the order of praise or blame (or a subtype of praise or blame, like apologetics, polemics, eulogy, or complaint). Examples of meshalim for several of these categories are briefly discussed. The article concludes with a detailed analysis of the meshal found in Lamentations Rabba 3, 21. This is a praise-mashal whose narrative also suggests a certain kind of blame and, in effect, allows the mashal to be read in two ways. On the basis of this analysis, it is suggested that the rhetorical richness of the mashal derives in part from the tension between the mashal's function and its narrative complexity, and that the popularity of the form was a result of the fact that the use of narrative in the mashal allowed the Rabbis to express certain feelings and attitudes that other, more prosaic, midrashic literary forms could not convey.<br>

Abstract: This article breaks the poetic code in Agnon's A Guest for a Night by deciphering its system of lexical and semantic signs, which link this novel with the Talmud in numerous ways. The article reaches two conclusions: (1) Agnon did more than integrate traditional motifs and stories in this novel — he used agadic and halachic material to relink Modern Hebrew literature with the Talmud. (2) This novel is nothing less than an old-new key to the Talmud which Agnon wrought by blending its language and that of Modern Hebrew literature into a new style.<br>

Abstract: The method adopted in this study of Meir Shalev's poetics involves the simultaneous application of two complementary theories: the theory of literary mythopoesis (based on Aleksei Losev's personalistic theory of myth) and the theory of the origins of signs, language and culture developed by Eric Gans. It is shown that images of incorporated memory in the novel function as synergetic mechanisms both of turning signs into personalities and of turning personalities into signs. The unity of the body and memory representations appears to be the prominent feature of Shalev's postmodern fiction, which serves as the significant step in the development of magical realism in Israeli literature.<br>

Abstract: מסה זו עוסקת בסוציולוגיה של התרגום בתנאים של יחסי כוח תיאולוגיים וקולוניאליים בין שפות. בעקבות ולטר בנימין, פול ריקר, ז'אק דרידה והספרות הפוסט-קולוניאלית, אדגים כיצד תחומים בלתי ניתנים לתרגום הופכים את התרגום לאשליה משיחית. דרך דוגמאות מתוך ספרות הנכבה שנכתבה בערבית אני מבקש להראות כיצד התחומים הבלתי ניתנים לתרגום מוצפים במסמנים לא יציבים ובמצבים אפורתיים של מבוי סתום. למשל, השימוש במילה נכבה אינו עקבי אלא תלוי בהקשר של זמן הכתיבה וזמן התרגום. בערבית אפשר למצוא לבד מנכבה גם את המושגים כארת'ה, הזימה, נכסה ומאסאה. בעברית אפשר למצוא שימוש באסון, בתבוסה, בטרגדיה או בנכבה. גם המסמנים ההיסטוריוגרפיים ומסמני הזמן והמרחב בספרות הנכבה אינם יציבים אלא משתנים תמידית. תובנות אלה מציעות אסטרטגיות תרגום שמתבססות על הטיות זמן מתאימות (למשל זמן הווה מתמשך במקום זמן עבר), על היעזרות בהערות חיצוניות לטקסט ועל שערוב מסוים של העברית. What is translation under asymmetrical conditions of power? How do colonial and theological practices shape the relationships between languages? Drawing on Walter Benjamin, Paul Ricoeur, Jacque Derrida, and postcolonial literature in general, I show how untranslatable texts stemming from such asymmetry result in insurmountable gaps which render the messianic "perfect translation" impossible. Using examples from literature on the Palestinian Naqba, I examine how untranslatable texts (from Arabic to Hebrew) are inflated with unstable signifiers, which themselves are contingent on the time/space aspect of the translation. Using these examples, I demonstrate the extent to which translation from Arabic to Hebrew necessitates peculiar political and aesthetic strategies which are sensitive to colonial and theological conditions.<br>

Abstract: In this article I suggest ways in which rhetorical analysis can complement sociological analysis of early Christianity. On the basis of a universally acknowledged saying of Jesus ("blessed are you poor"), I suggest that those who use social scientific perspectives need to clarify more accurately the levels of data from which they are working (i.e., when they are working with probably early material, possibly the words of Jesus himself, and when they are working with the later elaboration of the traditional material) and to identify the rhetorical value of each level. I then show how, contrary to sociological analysis that depicts Jesus as merely proclaiming reversal, the historical Jesus proclaimed a reversal that had already happened but one that was away from God's intended order: what the historical Jesus was calling for was a future restoration to a state that existed before the reversal. Attention to the rhetorical nature of his follower's use of this proclamation, however, shows that when the author of the Gospel of Luke and the Lukan Acts of the Apostles uses the language of reversal and restoration, he now does so to describe what was happening not primarily vis-à-vis "the world" but in their own, now Christian communities Jesus' message of reversal of the fate of the poor becomes in this way the Lukan message of the apostolic governance of that reversal, that is, the broker's (the apostolic leadership's, after the model of Jesus) dispensation of the patron's (God's) resources.<br>

Abstract: IN THIS ESSAY I CONSIDER POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTIONS OF FEMINIST THEOLogy to theological aesthetics and ethics by comparing the work of Hans Urs von Balthasar (1905—88), the predominant figure in theological aesthetics, with that of Elizabeth Johnson and Sallie McFague. Balthasar's emphasis on contemplation and obedience in response to the unexpected revelation of God's glory contrasts with the practicality, mutuality, and creativity of feminist theological ethics. On the other hand, feminist theology's emphasis on appropriate language and images for God suggests an implicit aesthetics. The artistic work of contemporary African women in crisis situations sheds further light on both Balthasar and feminist theology and brings into relief the relationship of beauty and justice. Although Balthasar's emphasis on the transcendent glory of God may leave him with an undeveloped ethics, feminist theology's agent-oriented approach could benefit from greater attention to contemplation and a transformed understanding of obedience. These conclusions urge greater appreciation and development of the aesthetic and imaginative dimensions of feminist theological ethics.<br>

Abstract: History is not neutral. It is rendered ideological by the very act of being conveyed in a narrative form, for language is both the purveyor of meaning and the principle locus of ideology. This paper explores the idea of history as discourse, and its deployment in the cultural-symbolic construction of the Singapore nation. To this end, I have chosen to analyse a key moment for Singapore history, the years 1963-65, when Singapore was first merged with the nation of Malaysia, and then separated from it. The way that these events are described in official histories is used by the government of Singapore to justify its policy of multiracialism, which also serves as a legitimating device confirming the state in its political and ideological hegemony. I have examined the events through analysis of local newspapers, The Straits Times and Berita Harían, to see in what ways their reporting may have helped to mould popular understandings of what was happening.<br>

Abstract: This paper examines the role of narrative as a basic linguistic form in communication. It is suggested that what clients say, and the case histories that emerge, can be understood in terms of 'fictional' genres. Reference is made to their role in the construction of social work accounts. The author indicates the complex nature of description, the need for increased sensitivity to different kinds of descriptive account and to the part of language and imagination in the making of accounts.<br>

Abstract: This paper, a reply to Professor R. S. Downie's criticisms of our paper 'A Political Critique of Kantian Ethics in Social Work', both appearing in BJSW 19, 6, tries to answer the main charge against us of illegitimately bridging the logical gap between statements of value and statements of fact. In addition to this, we explicate further our original arguments that language and power are indissolubly bound to each other, and that a Kantian approach to social work theory and practice fails in trying to dissolve that relationship by finding a neutral, universal ground from which to derive ethical principles and judgements.<br>

Abstract: Disciplina acuñada en el XIX, la filología surge como historicidad fundamental, identificando la significación de una obra con sus condiciones de producción originarias, un discurso de la ciencia (historia) sobre la lengua y la literatura. La hermenéutica contemporánea supone una ruptura de la razón histórico-filológica y una afirmación de los nuevos significados que a un texto se le añaden al pasar de un contexto cultural u otro nuevo. Para la filología, el criterio pedagógico único de explicación de los textos es la restitución de la intención deliberada y originaria del autor. Hermenéutica y teoría de la literatura afirman que no hay adecuación lógica necesaria entre sentido de la obra e intención de autor. Tras la “muerte del autor” del formalismo semiótico, la posmodernidad niega el texto mismo y afirma que éste tiene tantos sentido como lectores. A discipline minted in the 19th century, philology, emerges as a fundamental historicist approach, identifying the significance of a work with its original conditions of production, a discourse from science (history) about language and literature. Contemporary hermeneutics assumes a break with historical-philological reason, as well as an affirmation of the new meanings added to a text by passing from one cultural context to another new one. For philology, the only pedagogical criterion in explaining texts is the restitution of deliberate and original authorial intent. Hermeneutics and literary theory assert that there is no logical association necessary between the meaning of the work, and authorial intent. Since the “death of the author” of semiotic formalism, postmodernity has denied the text itself, instead asserting that it has as many meanings as it has readers.<br>

Abstract: This article attempts to pose the principles for the use of certain tools, forged in linguistics, for sociological analysis, particularly for the analysis of interviews. Far from being a simple collection of information, the interviews with migrants analyzed here are an arena for intense language activity. With the use of concepts such as annunciation, pragmatism and natural logic, various language functions are identified that sociologists should take into consideration: the construction of representations, negotiation of one's position in an interaction. Contrary to the spontaneous sociology of certain linguistics, language practices are not those of an actor free of all social determinants. On the contrary, by taking into consideration the complexity of language, sociology can construct a plural, heterogeneous and even divided actor. Cet article essaie de poser les principes d'utilisation de quelques outils forgés en linguistique pour l'analyse sociologique, plus particulièrement pour l'analyse des entretiens. Loin d'être une simple collection d'informations, les entretiens analysés ici, qui sont des entretiens de migrants, sont le lieu d'une intense activité langagière. En recourant aux concepts de l'énonciation, de la pragmatique et de la logique naturelle, sont repérés divers fonctionnements langagiers que le sociologue a tout intérêt à considérer: construction des représentations, négociation des places dans l'interaction. Cependant, contrairement à la sociologie spontanée de certaines linguistiques, les pratiques langagières ne sont pas celles d'un acteur libre de toutes déterminations. Au contraire, en prenant en compte toute la complexité du langage, le sociologue peut construire un acteur pluriel, hétérogène, voire divisé.<br>

Abstract: Language and judicial activities are both signs of the existence of a society. There is, therefore, good reason for a dialogue between the science of language and the science of law. This article applies a linguistic theory of the Paris School (semiotics) to the examination of a legal text, namely a contract. The author points to some elements shared by legal and other texts, and demonstrates how a semiotic interpretation can provide interesting and unexpected insights into the deeper levels of a legal text. He concludes that a similar approach could fruitfully be used with other types of legal text.<br>

Abstract: This essay argues that a religious perspective on South African writing (the term is defined as including any cultural artefact, spoken or written, which uses language(s) as its main means of communication) is both fruitful and long overdue. The essay traces, or outlines, the general situation and lists some areas in which religious concerns, such as transformation, suffering and hope, poverty and marginality, can contribute to debates on South African writing. Some of these are further discussed.<br>

Abstract: This paper sets out to question contemporary notions of language which employ metaphors of imprisonment or confinement to describe the alleged failure of the word to connect with the world. Valentine Cunningham's recent book. In the Reading Gaol, is confronted with Helen Keller's experience of being excluded from language (as described in her autobiography), in order to argue that the issue of hermeneutic freedom needs to be rethought. This involves raising certain doubts about freedom—doubts identified by means of a consideration of the cases of New Testament prisoners: Peter, John, Paul and Silas. I conclude that freedom, confronted by doubt (evident in ascetical gestures) is produced by a hermeneutics of hope. Hope, constituted by its own rivenness, both allows and limits the effects of hermeneutical suspicion. The imprisoning effect ascribed to language can then be seen as a failure with regard to hope.<br>

Abstract: The story of the Fall inscribes the myth of a fallen language as the absolute other of the original sacred. Hence the dualistic scheme between a fallen materiality and a metaphysical God. This article explores how the death of this God is not merely a secular turn, but the opening of a different, anti-theological, or fallen religiosity that allows us to trace the sacred in unexpected places—also within fallen language. Translation and literature will be explored as instances where language performs its own fallenness— its materiality, arbitrariness and difference—and thereby releases a sacred expression. The essay considers 17th-century theologian Martin de Barcos' letters regarding translation, Derrida's essay 'Des Tours de Babel' and notions of literariness based on Blanchot and Mallarmé.<br>

Abstract: Religious echoes are resonant with race and gender in Beloved, raising questions best posed in a psychoanalytic register. Freud's sceptical questioning of religion is important for a consideration of the gendered, raced, and specifically religious subjectivities explored in the novel, as is Lacan's paradigm of entry into the symbolic order. Reading the religious in Beloved in light of both Freud and Lacan, and reading the poetically evocative Word in all three, I locate within the novel a profound ambivalence, an awareness of the limitations of language under the Name of the Father and the necessity—even potential good—of imagining within its system.<br>

Abstract: Having defined how 'secular' is to be understood in this context, this essay explores two sets of observations. The first concerns the relationship between religion and literature as cultural products of a specific cultural imaginary. Both are fundamentally associated with narrative, which, as even contemporary neuroscience demonstrates, continually attempts to make sense of the world. Both are narratives in which there is a reflection upon, and a performance of, creativity. Since the cultural imaginary has been shaped historically by the religious, then all reflections upon creating are coloured by the sacred. The second set of observations issues from the first and concerns the relationship between authorial standpoint and literary creation. The essay examines authorial intention, the nature of language and the operation of the imagination as each relates to the cultural imaginary and the act of 'making believe'. The two sets of observations and their examination demonstrate the ways in which literature continually resists secularity.<br>

Abstract: The article of M. Lilla marks the political position of Derrida in the context of French philosophy since Sartre. Presenting him as an engaged opponent of existentialism and structuralism Lilla shows that Derrida's vehement philosophical fight is directed fundamentally against what he calls the logocentrism of all western philosophy. Derrida's only remedy against this disease: deconstruction of the language. In applying this recipe himself, Derrida ends at a somewhat mysterious one and only notion, the concept of justice, which according to him is not destructible and should not be destructed. The provocative explanation Lilla gives for the surprising fact, that Derrida's most fervent adherents live in the United States is the unlimited self-confidence and good nature of the Americans.<br>

Author(s): Bell Allan<br>
Abstract: This article questions the aptness of 'discourse analysis' as a label for our field, and prefers the less reductionist concept of 'Discourse Interpretation'. It does this through drawing on ideas from the field of philosophical hermeneutics – the theory and practice of interpreting texts. It operationalizes and adapts the construct of the Interpretive Arc from the philosophy of Paul Ricoeur in order to address issues that are central to discourse work, including that of how we warrant the validity of our textual interpretations. The Interpretive Arc consists of six interlinked phases, which the article presents and exemplifies through discussion of a single text – the story of Babel. Phase I of the arc defines readers as being in a state of Estrangement before the text because of the distancing created by its written or technological form. Phase 2 is that of Pre-view, the state of opinion or knowledge that readers bring to a text. At phase 3, a first reading forms readers' Proto-understanding, their initial 'guess' at what the text means. Then processes of Analysis (phase 4) test and evidence the validity of alternative readings, limiting the interpretations which can plausibly be taken from a text. Three byways of interpretive analysis are challenged and discarded: the dominance of author intention, structuralist analysis and limitless polysemy. Analysis then leads into 5, the phase of informed Understanding of the matter or injunction of the text, of what is disclosed or unfolded before the text. The Interpretive Arc is completed in phase 6, Ownership. Here, through processes of critique of their own and the text's ideologies and of fresh listening, readers are led to a new self formed by the matter of the text. There is a dialectic amongst Analysis, Understanding and Ownership, with each informing and modifying the other. The approach emphasizes interpretation as the heart of discourse work. The 3000-year-old narrative of Babel is a subject as well as an object here. It contributes to the matter of the article and its interpretation is interwoven with the theoretical substance. The story is shown to be an integrated narrative abounding in sophisticated linguistic techniques which show a delight in language. The traditional Christian and Western interpretation of Babel – as an affront to God which results in the curse of multilingualism – is challenged. A re-constructed interpretation informed by intertextual evidence reads the fault of Babel to be the people's refusal to spread through the earth. Babel can be interpreted as a manifesto against the monolingual and monocultural impetus of empires ancient and contemporary. The multilingual outcome is a positive affirmation of sociocultural and linguistic diversity.<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur placed a great deal of importance upon text and the interpretation of text. Bell accepts this by virtue of his extended analysis of the story of Babel, and I hope to offer ways of extending and developing Bell's arguments to incorporate the ethical demands that Ricoeur placed upon text, upon our interpretation of text and upon action as a form of readable text. This will not include a commentary on discourse analysis, which I am not qualified to give. Ricoeur differed from the structuralist tradition in that he saw the relationship between language and life as taking a dialectical form: debate that presumes the possibility of altering one's position by grappling with different views, and often taking inspiration from Hegelian dialectics, with their contrasting polarized views and the eventual attempt at affirmative common ground. The term λογοσ (logos) was first used in a philosophical way by Heraclitus to give us the principle of order and knowledge, and yet for Heraclitus the world was dominated by conflict and change. Ricoeur studied this tension within logos between order and disorder, partly by his writing about language and his work on signs and symbols, partly through metaphor and narrative and also through his insights on translation. For him, all these are facets of the need for both Explaining and Understanding as forms of interpretation of language, ethics and action. Ricoeur's work on logos provides us with an approach that asks whether ethics controls language or vice versa or both and how this fits in with structuralism and later movements. For Ricoeur, signs (words, texts) are not the centres of our perceptual experience. At the heart of our perception are our motivations and our actions, for which we must take responsibility in a sort of provisional affirmation that we will keep trying. In so doing we must doubt (be suspicious of) our own motives just as much as those of others, and see action as a form of readable text.<br>

Abstract: The notion of text acquires a fundamental epistemological role in the disciplines of language in the second half of the XXth century. The analysis of some linguistic objects we have called semiological tools could highlight some epistemological issues in the use of the term text. From the Sixties we can observe that text has progressively acquired the general status of an object of analysis. Nevertheless, if linguistic text proves to be a common object of analysis for semiotics and hermeneutics, then it is necessary to reconsider their epistemological relations, to understand something new about what text is. Considering the interpretative problem in the hjelmslevian epistemology, a new perspective emerges between these complementary approaches to text. Comparing semiotics and hermeneutics we can also question the epistemological role that the notion of text embodies among contemporary disciplines of language.<br>

Abstract: Daß die Verstiegenheiten und Mißbräuche, welche die Scholiasten der Spätantike seit
der Kaiserzeit mit der Etymologie getrieben haben, aller ernsten Grundlagen entbehrten
und reine Fabrikation ebenso mittelmäßiger wie phantasievoller Wichtigtuer darstellten,
die sich „Philologen" und „Grammatiker" nannten und noch bis in die byzantinische Epoche
hinein fortwirkten, ist allgemein bekannt (s. zum Beispiel die vielfachen Entlarvungen dieses
durch die Jahrhunderte mitgeschleppten Ballastes von Pseudogelehrsamkeit bei W. G. Ruther-
ford, A Chapter in the History of Annotation, Being Scholia Aristophanica, Bd. III, London
1905, S. 392 etc). Daß die ebenso irrationalen und vielleicht noch geschmackloseren ety-
mologischen Spekulationen, die man im 20. Jahrhundert auf die Wortgruppe έρμηνεία, έρμη-
νεύειν, ερμηνευτικός anwendete und immer noch anwendet, im gängigen akademischen Lehr-
betrieb heute ernst genommen werden und sich professoraler Autorität erfreuen, ist nicht
nur ein bildungsgeschichtliches curiosum, sondern ein Zeugnis irrationaler Aushöhlung der
„geisteswissenschaftlichen" Fakultäten. Als Beispiel seien nur erwähnt Karl Kerényi, Her-
meneia und Hermeneutike, Ursprung und Sinn der Hermeneutik in ders., Griechische Grundbegriffe,
Fragen und Antworten aus der heutigen Situation, Zürich 1964, 42-52, und F. K. Mayr, Der
Gott Hermes und die Hermeneutik in Tijdschrift voor Filosofie, 30, 1968, 525-635. Wie der Autor
des zuletzt genannten Artikels selbst, auf Heideggers Formulierung zurückgreifend, sagt,
ist das „Spiel des Denkens verbindlicher als die Strenge der Wissenschaft"... Wohin eine
im Banne Heideggers stehende „Begriffsgeschichte" führt, kann man bei der Lektüre dieses
Schwalls besser „verstehen"... Wie wenig Tragweite die immer wieder angeführte (Techné)
hermeneutike in der Epinomis 975 c hat, sagt der Text selbst: bei der Kunst Orakel zu inter-
pretieren, die weder Seelengröße noch Weisheit hervorbringt, weiß der „Interpret" nur,
was er sagt, ob es jedoch wahr ist, hat er nicht gelernt (τό λεγόμενον γάρ οίδεν μόνον, εΐ
δ' αληθές, ούχ έμαθεν). Übrigens kommt das Wort έρμηνευτική in den pseudo-platonischen
Definitiones in seiner sonst gebräuchlichen Bedeutung vor, 414 d 4: "Ονομα διάλεκτος άσιλιθετος
έρμηνεντική τοϋ τε κατά τής ουσίας κατηγορουμένου και παντός του μή καθ' έαντοϋ λεγομένου.
(Nomen, zuzusammengesetzte Ausdrucksweise für etwas seinem Wesen entsprechend
Bezeichnetes, sowie auch für alles von diesem Ausgesagtes). — Pierre Chantraine, Dictionnaire
Etymologique de la Langue Grecque, Histoire des Mots, Paris, 1970, S. 373, sagt ausdrücklich,
„Terme technique sans étymologid'. Vgl. auch F. Solmsen, Ein dorisches Komödienstück in Rheinisches

Abstract: This forum gathers together a set of essays composed in response to the 2011 special issue of Religion & Literature 42.1–2, titled "Something Fearful": Medievalist Scholars on the "Religious Turn" in Literary Criticism, edited by Kathryn Kerby-Fulton and Jonathan Juilfs. The forum's ten authors reflect both on essays within the original volume and on the broader questions engaged by it and through its very publication; responsive remarks from Kathryn Kerby-Fulton and two contributors to that initiating volume conclude the conversation. Through conversation, response, and critical engagement, the forum's contributors weigh questions of the language of belief in scholarly discourse, of the continuities of religious practice across history, of the assumptions and beliefs undergirding critical work on religion and literature and culture, and of the acknowledgement of the religious convictions of medievalists' scholarly subjects, scholars, and the communities of both.<br>

Abstract: Environmentally we seem to be both the victims and the perpetrators of a type of bait and switch: lured into the discussion by one set of intuitions, our interests become redescribed in terms that are intellectually more respectable. Our deepest concerns with the environment are converted into foreign discourses, as we strain to make the languages of science, economics, and interest group politics express our intuitions. The circumscription of environmental philosophy within environmental ethics is one manifestation of this process of bait and switch. 'Corrosive Effects' critiques this process through a case study of acid mine drainage-water pollution resulting from mining activities. An analysis of acid mine drainage reveals the metaphysical and theological roots of many of our environmental problems.<br>

Abstract: This article examines Gadamer's claim that language is fundamentally metaphorical from the perspective of Ricoeur's complementary analysis of metaphor. I argue that Gadamer's claim can only be understood in relation to a broader understanding of metaphor in which metaphor is not regarded as secondary to literal meaning. From this context one is better able to understand the connection Gadamer makes between language and ontology, which is found in his statement "Being that can be understood is language."<br>

Abstract: Ernst Troeltsch distinguished between naive, apologetic and evolutionistic absoluteness.
From the original spontaneity of 'naive absoluteness' and its artificial (partly super-
naturalistic, partly rationalistic) defence as 'apologetic absoluteness' (in the Middle Ages and
in the Enlightenment, respectively) there came forth in Hegel the idea of 'evolutionistic
absoluteness' — an ingenious but untenable attempt to reconcile the solid apologetic
conception of absoluteness of that day with the dynamics of history by presenting it as the
outcome and terminus of historical progression. See Troeltsch, Die Absolutheit des Christen-
tums, 87ff. Cf. J. Klapwijk, Tussen historisme en relativisme, 222-29. At present the belief in
progress and thus also the mix of it with the idea of absoluteness is no longer a subject of
discussion.<br>

Abstract: Interestingly enough it appears that the structural features of reconciliation show a re-

quires that I am able to say what I have done wrong (the reverse of silence and the
tinspeakable), that I recognize my guilt (which is incompatible with splitting) and that I ask for
forgiveness (which is very shameful, but may résolve shame when penitence is accepted and
forgiveness is given); see Glas (in press); Muφhyand Hampton (1988); Volf (1996).<br>

Abstract: In From Beast to the Blonde, Marina Warner studies the status of fairy tales as historical documents which
give an account of women's daily experiences, as they illustrate their particular rites of passage and the relevance
of maternal figures in their lives. The resonance of Mother Goose is taken by Warner "either as a historical source,
or a fantasy of origin" which she can trace into ancient traditions, like the Islamic or the Christian, and which
adds credibility to the stories (1994, xxiii).<br>

Abstract: Afrikaans writers have often found themselves in a marginal position. During the time of apartheid, they vehemently criticised racial discrimination, thus dissociating themselves from the centre of power. After the demise of apartheid, Afrikaans writers were marginalised in a different way, when the Afrikaans language lost its previous dominant position and truly became a minority language. They were then forced to reexamine their past and reinterpret their present. In this article, recent Afrikaans writers' radical reinvention of the ideological significance of the Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902) is discussed. One novel about the War, Ingrid Winterbach's Niggie ("Cousin") is analysed in detail as an example of the search for meaning from a marginal position. The novel has a special relevance for Afrikaners in their painful adaptation to a new South Africa, but it is also linked to general themes like trauma, despair and hope.<br>

Abstract: By inquiring into the translatability of Judaism and philosophy, we reawaken an ancient problem that asks after philosophy’s relation with religion:
         What has Athens to do with Jerusalem?Translation is a rejuvenated means of wrestling with this irksome question, which seeks to understand how multiple approaches to meaning and being can exist concurrently or whether any interaction forfeits multiplicity for the primacy of one form over all others. The specific issue that linguistic versions of the problem address is whether or not the languages that Judaism and philosophy speak are separate and distinct and if those distinctions are established on deeper, non-linguistic ground. For this reason, translation not only raises the problem of articulacy and context in interlingual translations, it also alludes to an ontological or metaphysical separation that speaks of different, non-shared worlds. Whether or not a translation theory addresses, repairs or upholds the opposition between religion and philosophy is in question, and translation becomes a vehicle for discussing what Jerusalem has to offer Athens and what Athens has for Jerusalem. In this essay, I examine the translation problem as an attempt to repair or re-gloss the relation between Judaism and philosophy by way of Michael Fagenblat’s recovery of Emmanuel Levinas’ thought in his work,A Covenant of Creatures: Levinas’s Philosophy of Judaism(2010).<br>

Abstract: The paper explores the meaning of conversion for African Christians in South Africa by looking at some of the indigenous terms that have populated the Christian vocabulary. The paper focuses on terms like
         ukuguquka, ukukholwa, ibandla, ikholwa, igqobhoka, inkonzo,andinkolo. These terms are found among people who speak Nguni languages. It shows how they were used in pre-Christian context and traces their evolution in Christian contexts. Research conducted in the Reformed Presbyterian Church, St John’s Apostolic Faith Mission, and Methodist Churches in Cape Town between 1997 and 2001 has indicated that conversion was not a simple religious process but involved diverse political, economic and social aspects. Conversion involved a transformation of an African Christian identity from the margins to the centre. It also involved extensive negotiation of what it means to be Christian through the translation of Christian content into an African idiom. The paper goes through various terms and how their original meanings were discarded for new ones.<br>

Abstract: This article considers the legacies of Jacques Derrida in and for Anglo-American sociocultural anthropology. It begins with a survey of Derrida's own engagement with themes that have historically been foundational to the field: (a) the critique of sign theory and, with it, the questions of language and law in Lévi-Straussian structuralism; (b) the question of the unconscious; (c) the critique of the performative and its consequences for the idea of ritual; (d) the rereading of Marcel Mauss's concept of the gift, and of economy more generally; and (e) the analysis of the metaphysical basis of law, in both religious and ostensibly secular formations. It then considers the state of the field at the time when it was being infused with different forms of poststructuralism and explores the competing claims made by these discourses in relation to deconstruction. Finally, after tracing the convergences and divergences between Derridean deconstruction and theory in sociocultural anthropology, it treats two main examples of works produced against and under the influence of Derrida's thought, respectively.<br>

Abstract: We respond in language to catastrophic, or traumatic, shocks to symbolic systems, for which the fall of the Tower of Babel can be seen as a mythic model. One response is an exploration of new uncertainties; another is a fearful rigidity that seeks to return to an imagined Adamic wholeness of language; another is an effort to transcend language altogether. This essay examines two contemporary responses to a perceived "fall" of language-several case studies of Oliver Sacks's and two novels by Don DeLillo-and places them in the context of the twentieth-century "linguistic turn" in the humanities and social sciences and what I call a "counterlinguistic turn" that is contemporaneous with the linguistic turn and represents developments of some of its key assumptions.<br>

Abstract: Recent attempts by geographers to explore the human experience of space have focused on overt behavior and its cognitive foundations. The language and style of our descriptions, however, often fail to speak in categories appropriate for the elucidation of lived experience, and we need to evaluate our modes of knowing in the light of modes of being in the everyday world. Phenomenologists provide some guidelines for this task. They point to the preconsciously given aspects of behavior and perception residing in the "lifeworld"-the culturally defined spatiotemporal setting or horizon of everyday life. Scientific procedures which separate "subjects" and "objects," thought and action, people and environments are inadequate to investigate this lifeworld. The phenomenological approach ideally should allow lifeworld to reveal itself in its own terms. In practice, however, phenomenological descriptions remain opaque to the functional dynamism of spatial systems, just as geographical descriptions of space have neglected many facets of human experience. There are certain avenues for dialogue between these two disciplines in three major research areas: the sense of place, social space, and time-space rhythms. Such a dialogue could contribute to a more humanistic foundation for human geography.<br>

Abstract: How places are made is at the core of human geography. Overwhelmingly the discipline has emphasized the economic and material forces at work. Neglected is the explicit recognition of the crucial role of language, even though without speech humans cannot even begin to formulate ideas, discuss them, and translate them into action that culminates in a built place. Moreover, words alone, used in an appropriate situation, can have the power to render objects, formerly invisible because unattended, visible, and impart to them a certain character: thus a mere rise on a flat surface becomes something far more-a place that promises to open up to other places-when it is named "Mount Prospect." The different ways by which language contributes toward the making of place may be shown by exploring a wide range of situations and cultural contexts. Included in this paper are the contexts of hunter-gatherers, explorers and pioneers, intimate friendship, literary London, Europe in relation to Asia, and Chinese gardening and landscape art. There is a moral dimension to speech as there is to physical action. Thus warm conversation between friends can make the place itself seem warm; by contrast, malicious speech has the power to destroy a place's reputation and thereby its visibility. In the narrative-descriptive approach, the question of how and why language is effective is implied or informally woven into the presentation, but not explicitly formulated or developed. Ways of making place in different situations-from the naming of objects by pioneers, to informal conversation in any home, to the impact of written texts-are highlighted and constitute the paper's principal purpose, rather than causal explanations, which must vary with each type of linguistic behavior and each situation.<br>

Abstract: In this paper we argue that the concept and practice of responsibility is being transformed within science and engineering. It tells the story of attempts by nanotechnologists to make responsibility 'do-able' and calculable in a setting where the established language and tools of risk and risk analysis are seen as inadequate. The research is based on ethnographic participant-observation at the National Science Foundation-funded Center for Biological and Environmental Nanotechnology (CBEN) at Rice University in Texas, during the period 2003 to 2007, including the controversies and public discussions it was engaged in and the creation of the International Council on Nanotechnology (ICON). CBEN began as a project to study 'applications' of nanotechnology to environmental and biological systems, but turned immediately to the study of 'implications' to biology and environment. We argue here that the notion of 'implications' and the language of risk employed early on addressed two separate but entangled ideas: the risks that nanomaterials pose to biology and environment, and the risks that research on this area poses to the health of nanotechnology itself. Practitioners at CBEN sought ways to accept responsibility both as scientists with a duty to protect science (from the public, from de-funding, from 'backlash') and as citizens with a responsibility to protect the environment and biology through scientific research. Ultimately, the language of risk has failed, and in its place ideas about responsibility, prudence, and accountability for the future have emerged, along with new questions about the proper venues and 'modes of veridiction' by which claims about safety or responsibility might be scientifically adjudicated.<br>

Abstract: The aim of the present article is to investigate how the passages of the Holy Text regarding natural sciences or the cosmological order of the universe can be read from a hermeneutical viewpoint, in a philosophical rather than a historical, grammatical or stylistic sense; the debated problems of literary and artistic character, and the relationship between Qur'an and science per se, are not involved here. If we assume as a working hypothesis the Gadamerian perspective that 'being, as far as we can understand it, is language', we can accept that the being of God and of the universe are disclosed in Qur'anic language and that the Qur'an becomes the framework of the aletheia (in the Heideggerian sense) of science. This paper utilises the above-mentioned epistemological and hermeneutical key in order to make a first attempt to explore the possibility of a philosophical analysis of the question of science in the Qur'an, and concludes that, although it can sound highly paradoxical, the attitudes of total agreement, partial agreement or no agreement between Qur'an and science are not mutually exclusive, but rather work in parallel at different linguistic levels. ‮الهدف من هذه الدراسة هو بحث کيف يمکن فهم الآيات القرآنية المتعلقة بالعلوم الطبيعية أو النظام الکوني من وجهة نظر منهج تفسيري من ناحية فلسفية لا تاريخية أو نحوية أو بلاغية. لن يتم هنا مناقشة قضايا أدبية أو فنية أو العلاقة بين القرآن والعلم في هذا البحث. إذا افترضنا أن وجهة نظر جادامير (remadaG)، ‮ وهي أن " الوجود، کما نفهمه، هو اللغة "، تعتبر نظرية قابلة للتطبيق، يمکن أن نقبل أن وجود الله والکون يبين من خلال اللغة القرآنية وأن القرآن يصبح إطار الوصول للحقيقة، طبقاً لفهم هيدجر (reggedieH). ‮إن هذا البحث يستخدم علم الحد والمنهج التفسيري من أجل القيام بأول محاولة لاستکشاف إمکانية تحليل فلسفي لقضية العلم في القرآن. وقد انتهى هذا البحث إلى أن التوافق بين القرآن والعلم تاما أو جزئيا أوعدم التوافق لا يعتبر أمرا قاطعا من الجهتين لکنه يعمل على درجات لغوية مختلفة متوازنة.‬<br>

Abstract: The interdependence of language and culture highlights the need to find methods for second language students to acquire cultural information and practices. This article reviews definitions of culture posited by anthropologists and language educators and discusses problems related to the recent paradigm shift from "small 'c' and big 'C'" as classifications for culture to the three 'P's of products, practices, and perspectives proposed by the Standards for Foreign Language Learning in the 21st Century (National Standards 2006). Drawing from Kramsch's (1993) postulate of real culture (C1) versus perceived culture (C1'), the current study solicited responses to a questionnaire regarding the practices of Spaniards from two age groups (young and mature) and American students involved in a study abroad program in Spain. Data analyses reveal that perceptions of American Students most closely align with those of Young Spaniards. Implications point to the need for intervention and instruction to provide students with a broader perspective of Spain's cultural practices.<br>

Abstract: Knowledge-intensive firms are composed of multiple communities with specialized expertise, and are often characterized by lateral rather than hierarchical organizational forms. We argue that producing knowledge to create innovative products and processes in such firms requires the ability to make strong perspectives within a community, as well as the ability to take the perspective of another into account. We present models of language, communication and cognition that can assist in the design of electronic communication systems for perspective making and perspective taking. By appreciating how communication is both like a language game played in a local community and also like a transmission of messages through a conduit, and by appreciating how cognition includes a capacity to narrativize our experience as well as a capacity to process information, we identify some guidelines for designing electronic communication systems to support knowledge work. The communication systems we propose emphasize that narratives can help construct strong perspectives within a community of knowing, and that reflecting upon and representing that perspective can create boundary objects which allow for perspective taking between communities. We conclude by describing our vision of an idealized knowledge intensive firm with a strong culture of perspective making and perspective taking, and by identifying some elements of the electronic communication systems we would expect to see in such a firm.<br>

Abstract: The conflict between President John F. Kennedy and the management of the steel industry in April, 1962 has been interpreted in an unsatisfactory manner. Many of Kennedy's reactions appear to be inexplicable and do not conform with the impression of him either as an "idealist without illusions" or the calculating cynic of recent revisionist writing. This paper is an attempt to provide another understanding of Kennedy's behaviour. We argue that Kennedy was neither hero nor villain, but a practising politician aware of the obligations and function of his profession in a liberal democratic polity. We suggest that Kennedy was aware of the sensibilities of his constituency and that he possessed a finely attuned ear to the language and discourse of American politics in the early 1960s. Consequently Kennedy realised the peril, in the steel crisis, to his political standing and thus felt compelled to embark on a dramatic and potentially dangerous course of action. We attempt to sustain this argument by closely examining the political language of the participants, relying heavily for our analysis on the writings of the Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, the Italian semiologist, Umberto Eco and the Russian linguist V.N. Volosinov.<br>

Abstract: In his theory of communication Schutz exhibits a significant tension between two fundamental perspectives, phenomenology and pragmatism, and in the long run he fails to reconcile the contradictory implications these perspectives have with regard to his model of interaction. The main problem seems to be the notion of sense-constitution. Schutz develops two distinguishable accounts of constitution: an egological one and a model based on the phenomenon of direct interaction of empirical subjects. Two key concepts are related to these different modes of constitution: the model of appresentation with regard to language, symbols and signs, and the model of synchronisation as triangulation of streams of consciousness and outward action sequences. They are analyzed as significant for two different methods and two different theories of communication. I propose some reasons for Schutz's insistence on a phenomenological account of the ego and the constitution of sense, and offer a brief sketch of an alternative strategy that is implicit in Schutz's theory.<br>

Abstract: With the portrayal of local resentment towards the massive influx of Silesian refugees after WWII in the GDR in his novel Landnahme, Christoph Hein expands the literary representation of history he began earlier in Horns Ende, again using the fictional small town of Guldenberg as paradigmatic for the GDR, extended here over time to include unified Germany. Bernhard Haber's epic, but unscrupulous struggle to overcome the will of his neighbors for him to fail provides the backdrop for Hein's depiction of how the past unavoidably writes the future and how the collective process of socialization shapes meanings and values. Using five narrators, Hein applies his earlier concept of social autobiography to trace historical developments in the acquired collective attitudes of Germans towards Gypsies, Poles, the handicapped, and African and Vietnamese workers left behind after unification, all of whom were subjected to the same abusive language and discrimination directed at the refugees.<br>

Abstract: La stèle du Bronzo est gravée d'un oiseau "levé", en plein vol, la tête tournée vers l'extérieurs, superposé à un filon de quartz blanc; une crosse, également traitée en champlevé, lui barre le passage. En première lecture, une identification plausible du genre volatile semblait prévaloir et le colombidé emportait notre adhésion. Mais une analyse plus posée et un effort de déconstruction graphique du motif permettront cette fois de reprendre et d'affiner la reconnaissance, en décrivant les différents filtres autorisant tel ou tel rejet de catégorie ou d'espèce, pour ne conserver en dernier ressort que les meilleurs prétendants à la seule confrontation possible, celle qui oppose les corvidés aux colombidés. La représentation du Bronzo est en définitive équivalente en substance et en structure aux scènes figurées sur les stèles voisines dans lesquelles un phallus s'oppose qu tranchant d'une lame de hache (Mané Rutual), tandis qu'un cachalot affronte la coalition des animaux et des outils de l'homme (Table des Marchand). A "flushed" bird is engraved on the Bronzo stela, in full flight, its head turned to the exterior, superposed over a white quartz vein; a crook, equally treated in cut-away engraving, bars its passage. At a first reading, a plausible identification of the bird seemed to prevail and the Columbidae met with our approval. However, more deliberate analysis and an effort at the graphic deconstruction of the motif allows the identification to be reconsidered and improved, by describing the various filters authorising the rejection of such or such a category, finally preserving the best claimants to the only possible confrontation, opposing Corvidae to Columbidae. The Bronzo representation is equivalent in substance and in structure to the scenes on the neighbouring stelae where a phallus is opposed to the sharp edge of an axe blade (Mané Rutual), while a sperm-whale confronts the coalition of animals and human tools (Table des Marchand). However Bronzo is a deformed toponym, untranslatable as such; why not search in a more or less recent past, through some unavoidable semantic or linguistic evolution, for traces of a probable or possible mutation of the word? At the end of a brief investigation, we suggest that the expression Men Bran Sao, "The Stone of the Standing Raven", known from the early 19th century, is the name of this monolith. Nevertheless, the last time that a bird was directly observed on this stela was during the 5th millennium; the two closely conected fragments, on the model of the neighbouring Grand Menhir, prove that the stone has not been displaced since that distant period. We consequently propose this explanatory hypothesis to explain in Bronzo such a radical change of name: a zoomorphic mythical entity that we recognize as a pigeon, attached since time immemorial to the stela in question, passed under the influence of the Brittonic language and the new culture to the designation of another ornithological entity, the raven. If a bird as clearly identified as the Bronzo has played a determining role in the mythical Neolithic Armorican bestiary, like the sperm-whale, a scientific step is now necessary to find some hidden occurrences in other poorly understood signs, since such an important representation in our interpretive schema, unique in Brittany, cannot remain isolated. We correspondingly claim, in this coherent and logical research prolonging the Bronzo discovery, that the only possible appropriate solution for the famous "horn" signs is a bird shown full on, in flight, with spread wings.<br>

Abstract: Ruskin's complex attitude toward women has long been important to feminist and Victorian studies; over a quarter-century ago Kate Millett published Sexual Politics and its famous attack on Ruskin's essay "Of Queens' Gardens." She charged Ruskin with promoting a sugar-coated but perfidious system of separate spheres for men and women. Yet shortly after Ruskin produced that idealized vision of housewife-queens in 1865, he created a new ideal queen in his mythological study The Queen of the Air (1869), this time elaborated from Athena. Through his mythopoesis, Ruskin disrupts both conventional gender categories and his own implication in them. Ruskin presents a series of binary oppositions that he immediately conflates: Athena and Medusa, air and earth, bird and snake, formation and destruction, science and myth, male and female. Ruskin documents the instability of his oppositions through a bizarre "natural language" where real-life creatures such as birds and snakes serve as eternal hieroglyphs, signifying universally recognizable abstractions. That seemingly fixed signs in Athena's hieroglyphic code inevitably change is clear from Ruskin's acknowledgment of Darwin's evolutionary theory. But evolution slips into a wild image of degenerative metamorphosis, where all the divisions that Ruskin has so laboriously noted dissolve. Since Ruskin identifies Athena with each seemingly opposed animal signifier in his language of living hieroglyphs, he subverts all linguistic difference and ultimately feminizes signification itself. Through myth Ruskin creates a mutable language, one where genders as well as signs become mobile rather than fixed.<br>

Abstract: This paper discusses semantic aspects of noun incorporation in Akwesasne Mohawk, one of six Northern Iroquoian languages spoken today. Meanings of verb stems with incorporated nouns are shown to range from literal referents of transitive action to abstract, nontangible metaphors. NI is examined as the structural means through which novel semantic units are formed. These new units expand the interpretative range of basic meanings as part of creative linguistic and conceptual processes. Metaphors are created to fulfill lexical and poetic functions. Data are presented and analyzed from body part and other semantic domains.<br>

Abstract: The article resituates Ricur's theory of métaphore vive in the contemporary context of the so-called "cognitive revolution." The latter denomination is highly misleading. There is nothing revolutionary about the cognitivist study of metaphor as a general pattern of thought; just like the discipline of rhetoric that was already on the decline in l8th century Europe, it is conservative in its validation of everyday, ideologically charged language as the model for all language, including that of poetry and art. Riceur’s conception of "live metaphor," on the other hand, does justice to the "revolutionary" character of poetic language, its function of breaking the order of "commonplaces we live by"—and are ruled by. A "poem in miniature," metaphor constitutes the model for any "poietic," creative imagination. Resulting from a clash, disturbing the common everyday language, live metaphor (and poetry in general) projects a world in such a way as to render strange and thus question the world we live in.<br>

Abstract: Hie vor dô wir kinder wâren by Der Wilde Alexander (fl. 1250) proceeds from the words of St. Paul: "Even so we, when we were children [nepioi], were in bondage under the elements of the world" (Galatians 4:3). Accordingly, the "Kindheitslied" is no nostalgic song of retrospection in the form of sacred, didactic allegory (a gloss is absent), but rather is an extended scriptural analogy addressing the change from the Old Law to the New. The words dô and nu (1,1 and 1,7) reflect New Testament rhetoric. The biblical echo in the opening line permits immediate identification; thus Alexander relies neither on progressive unveiling of his message nor on a language or ciphers. The "Kindheitslied" can be profitably discussed in conjunction with the body of literature on the encounter of Church and Synagogue.<br>

Abstract: Describing how my way of being in the world hindered or advanced my research, I suggest that a researcher's quality of life and mode of narrative inquiry may be closely related. The outcome seems to hinge on the inquirer's relationship to time and place in life and research. As all human beings, researchers use narrative to structure temporal complexity, only to find that this use contributes a complexity of its own. Efforts to overcome either pervade our lives as well as our forms of inquiry. I specify how such efforts endanger narrative inquiry, both in research and teacher education, and I struggle to find a language that accommodates a contextualized, narrative self as it reaches out to culturally shared conditions.<br>

Author(s): Blades David<br>
Abstract: Against the backdrop of Blades's analysis in Foucauldian terms of the failure of a particular science-technology-society reform, this review addresses four questions: (1) the problem of postmodern writing as a language of rupture; (2) the justification of science-technology-society approaches to science teaching; (3) the fruitfulness of Foucault's explanatory framework for understanding educational change; (4) the fruitfulness of Foucault's framework for education theory in general. It is argued that Foucault's notion of authors who are "founders of discursivity" can form the basis of both a productive theory of educational change and also of an educational vision in which a school strives to become a community of such founders of discursivity.<br>

Abstract: Critical social theory is a multidisciplinary knowledge base with the implicit goal of advancing the emancipatory function of knowledge. It approaches this goal by promoting the role of criticism in the search for quality education. Through critical social theory in education, quality is proportional to the depth of analysis that students have at their disposal. As a critical form of classroom discourse, critical social theory cultivates students' ability to critique institutional as well as conceptual dilemmas, particularly those that lead to domination or oppression. It also promotes a language of transcendence that complements a language of critique in order to forge alternative and less oppressive social arrangements. A critical social theory-based movement in education highlights the relationship between social systems and people, how they produce each other, and ultimately how critical social theory can contribute to the emancipation of both.<br>

Abstract: As radical feminists seeking to overcome the linguistic oppression of women, Rich and Daly apparently shared the same agenda in the late 1970s; but they approached the problem differently, and their paths have increasingly diverged. Whereas Daly's approach to the repossession of language is code-oriented and totalizing, Rich's approach is open-ended and context-oriented. Rich has therefore addressed more successfully than Daly the problem of language in use.<br>

Abstract: Essentialist and postmodern feminisms are often regarded as incompatible. I propose that Buddhist theories of subjectivity change the nature of the tension between them as presently construed because Buddhist traditions describe a mind not wholly governed by language, and a subjective mental dimension that is entirely integrated with the body and its sensations. A corollary is the compatibility Buddhists perceive between conditioned subjective states (akin to postmodern feminisms) and the unconditioned (akin to essentialist feminisms).<br>

Abstract: Accepting MacIntyre's teleological argument that the notion of individual rights is an invention or fiction, the article argues, against MacIntyre, that such a fiction may be interpreted as a creative response to the social requirements of modernity. Such rights language discloses the essential features of modernity but also the underlying teleological and moral structure of all human association. But whether rights language is perceived as a fall from morality or as a creative differentiation of moral language depends on a reading of history and especially on the interpretation of the Enlightenment project. Jürgen Habermas is used for an alternative reading of the Enlightenment and the relation of rights to the normative teleology of language itself. But both readings of history turn out to be theodicies, dependent upon hidden theological assumptions. Whether a society centered on a notion of rights can be governed by teleology can only be answered theologically.<br>

Abstract: The field of library and information science (LIS) has built its practice and research perspective on a logico-analytic philosophy, which has generated useful, tangible technologies. Lately there is interest in nonempirical philosophies, such as hermeneutics and critical theory, to fulfill better LIS' service-oriented mission of providing "information" to user populations. One dimension of critical theory, Jürgen Habermas' theory of communicative action, can expand LIS' conception of information and supplement logico-empirical research methods and research practices. This article examines how LIS, particularly research into librarian-patron interaction and information system design, favors an empiricist view of language and, as a consequence, may be limiting its effectiveness. It proposes how the field might expand to include communicative action in fulfilling its mission and research agenda.<br>

Abstract: This essay considers the persistence of collective and corporate models of literary authority within late-Victorian literature and print culture. While modern critics often understand Victorian authorship to be individually centered and governed by a dynamic of secrecy and disclosure, the periodical debates about anonymity that intensified in the fin de siècle suggest that Victorian readers and writers embraced a more flexible, collective notion of authorship. The plot, language, and paratext of Mary Elizabeth Hawker's pseudonymously published Mademoiselle Ixe, as well as the author-publisher correspondence concerning the novel, offer a representation of the corporate and collective interpretive modes that would have been familiar to late-Victorian readers, if not to recent critics. Hawker's text and the archival material it brings to light also suggest that modern readers might productively turn to the Victorian past to expand the definitions of authorship that circulate throughout nineteenth-century scholarship today.<br>

Abstract: Vico maintained that metaphor is a fundamental process of human mental life which bridges the gap between emotion and cognition. This Vichian perspective is reflected in areas of critical theory treating metaphor and other tropes, particularly their use in narrative. In psychology too, the significance of metaphor is increasingly recognized despite the Cartesian emphasis on literal thought and language in contemporary psychology's central paradigm, cognitive science. The paper compares the Cartesian and Vichian perspectives and suggests that the former limits the integrated treatment of cognition and emotion. This is illustrated with an example of how a child's feelings about a distressing situation are both revealed and changed in storytelling. The Vichian perspective is more appropriate to understanding this therapeutic interaction of cognition and emotion through metaphoric narrative play. This perspective has significant echoes in psychoanalytic and textual studies suggesting how sensitivity to the latent content of narrative metaphors offers both speaker and hearer a unique insight into the experience of the narrator.<br>

Abstract: The view of language is greatly changed from early modern philosophy to later modern philosophy and to postmodern philosophy. The linguistic question in early modern philosophy, which is characterized by rationalism and empiricism, is discussed in this paper. Linguistic phenomena are not at the center of philosophical reflections in early modern philosophy. The subject of consciousness is at the center of the philosophy, which makes language serve purely as an instrument for representing thoughts. Locke, Leibniz and Descartes consider language from a representationalist point of view. To them, language itself is idealized and represents thought as if it were thought representing itself. Like the structural linguist Saussure, the founders of phenomenology and analytical philosophy give much attention to the logical or static structure of language, and stick up for the representationalism of early modern philosophy. However, their successors refuse to accept this attitude, meaning the final collapse of representationalism. /// 从早期现代哲学到后期现代哲学再到后现代哲学，在语言观上产生了重大的 变化。早期现代哲学以唯理论和经验论为典型形式。语言现象没有成为该时期哲学 反思的中心问题; 意识主体处于哲学的中心，这使得语言仅仅充当着表象思想的工 具。洛克、莱布尼茨和笛卡尔都从表象论的角度看待语言，在他们那里，语言本身 被观念化了，它们表象思想，就像思想在表象它自身。正像结构语言学家索绪尔一 样，现象学和分析哲学的创始人关注的都是语言的逻辑结构或静态结构，他们延续 了早期现代哲学的表象论，但他们的后继者拒绝接受这种态度，而这意味着最终突 破表象论。<br>

Abstract: This article constitutes an exploration of Mahmud Darwish's poem, "The Hoopoe," as part of a study on the relationship of myths to culture, in general, and to literature and poetry, in particular. It starts from the hoopoe as a mythical symbol pulling the text in two directions. First, a direction that relates the poem, through time, to the realms of the universe, dream, and poetry, using the language of insinuations and allusions; second, a fictional direction that makes of the the poem-through evocation of previous quest journeys, including texts by Al-Jahiz, Avicenna, Al-Suhrawardi, Al-Hallaj, Aristophanes, and Farid Al-Din Attar-a quest into the depths of the individual and the collective self. Memory, history, and language, culminate in the discovery of the mother-land. Thus, Darwish's poem may be classified as poetry, prose, drama, and epic. It is, in fact, a mixture of all these genres, as well as a literary myth narrating the story of the search for a sacred time-the time of beginnings, and of childhood. /تمثل المقالة حفراﹰ استبطانياﹰ في قصيدة "الهدهد" لمحمود درويش - ضمن بحث في علاقة الأساطير بالثقافة عامة وبالأدب والشعر خاصة - انطلاقاﹰ من الهدهد كرمز أسطوري يتجاذب النص في اتجاهين اثنين: أ- اتجاه جدولي، يصل القصيدة - عبر الزمن - بعالم الكون وعالم المنام وعالم الشعر في لغة اللمح والإشارة٠ ب- اتجاه أفقي قصصي، يجعل من القصيدة - عبر رحلات نموذجية سابقة ومن خلال نصوص حاضرة غائبة للجاحظ، وابن سينا، والسهروردي، والحلاج، وأرسطوفان، وفريد الدين العطار، وغيرهم - رحلة في أعماق الذات الفردية، وفي أعماق الذات الجماعية ذاكرة وتاريخاﹰ٠ تجمع قصيدة درويش بين "الشعر" و"النثر" والمسرحية والملحمة، كما أنها أسطورة أدبية تقص علينا قصة بحث عن زمن مقدس هو زمن البدايات والطفولة٠‬<br>

Abstract: The attempt to write extreme violence, or to reco[r]d[e] traumatic cultural memory - the representation of horror - tests both the representational capacity of language and the rationality of subjecthood. Much narrative endeavour is spent trying to narrativise or 'structure' horror into story. However, because traumatic memories resist the narrative framework of the novel, questions are posed not only about the reliability of the narrator's memory and his/her ability to narrate a credible story, but also about the suitability of the fictional form of the novel to represent historical events such as extreme violence. How does language in narrative, with its insistence on order and sequence, 'capture' the destructuring nature of violence? Where is the subject or the idea of rational subjectivity in these de-structuring acts of violence? I will attempt to address these issues through a critical 'reading' of Moses Isegawa's novels Abyssinian Chronicles (2000) and Snakepit (2004). In these novels, Isegawa recasts and reenacts a period of recent Ugandan history marked by violence and chaos, emanating from the dictatorship of Idi Amin. However, both novels stretch the limits of 'factual' or historical credulity, reminding the reader that they are in fact works of historical fabrication. I am of the view that the narrative endeavour in these two novels is not only to record the chaotic events experienced during the years before and after the fall of Idi Amin, but to recode, through the tropes of language (symbol, imagery, and metaphor), the devastating effects of those years on the literary landscape of Uganda.<br>

Abstract: This article examines the expression of the immigrant experience in Le Figuier enchanté (1992), focusing on the notions of hybridity and intercultural exchange. The text is shown to constitute a form of intercultural dialogue, while also demonstrating some barriers to such dialogue, such as old-stock Québécois "obsession" with protecting French, or an overattachment to ethnicity on the part of immigrants. Micone's "surconscience linguistique" (Gauvin), is explored both through his use of language and through his consideration of linguistic politics in Quebec. The possibility of an "enchanted" hybridity is mooted, although this is shown to remain somewhat aspirational.<br>

Abstract: L'alternance entre les trois pôles de la formation (auto-hétéro-oïko) présente dans les pratiques de formation alternée (variété des situations d'apprentissage et des acteurs) renvoie à la différenciation des trois personnes pronominales (je-tu-il) du langage courant et s'inscrit dans l'épistémologie ternaire de la sémiotique initiée par Peirce. L'intelligence pratique et rusée (la métis des Grecs), repérée chez des artisans grâce à l'expression régionale « le biais du gars », met en scène une logique ouverte où transduction et abduction s'articulent à déduction et induction. Une « raison expérientielle » , dialogique, écologique, à visée éthique, est ainsi forgée. C'est une rationalité pratique cherchant à actualiser le potentiel de la situation. Elle est empreinte de sagesse et de « prudence » en action, au sens d'Aristote (phronésis). L'éc(h)oformation qui émerge de cette raison expérientielle, de ce regard interactionnel, est indissociable de la boucle étrange entre deux autres raisons : la raison sensible et la raison formelle, entre spontanéité et habitude. The tripolar concept of training (auto-hetero-oïko), foundation of alternating courses practice (with multiple learning situations and actors), draws us back to the differenciation between the three main persons singular (I, You, He) expressed in common language as the compound epistemology of semiotics put forward by Peirce... Practical intelligence (close to the "metis" of the Greeks) can be noticed among craftsmen when they refer to the "biais du gars" bespeaking an open logic where transduction and abduction are linked to deduction and induction. A constructive reasoning, interactive ans ecological, with ethical objectives, is created. It's a practical rationality aiming at actualizing the potentiality of the situation and marked by sagaciy and prudence in action in the Aristotelian sense (phronesis). The "ec(h)otraining" emerging from the wisdom of experience, this interactive vision of things is necessarily included in the chain linking two other thoughts : the intuitive thought and the formal thought, between spontaneity and habit.<br>

Abstract: Richard Rorty uses Nietzsche to show that people need to create themselves because there is no foundationalist language which they can establish as an anchor. Although this perspective is Nietzschean, it is not Jamesian, and so Rorty misappropriates James when he conflates James and Nietzsche as like-minded progenitors of the mythologizing of a privileged vocabulary. This essay evaluates Rorty's reading of James by considering whether truth in Rorty's textualist sense can abide by the stream of thought. Although James does mythologize privileged vocabularies, he believes that words need to reflect the world more accurately (something Rorty would never say) by abiding by the flux of experience. As such, James recognizes the value that old words have as tools. Whereas Rorty shows disdain for old words, James shows us the cash value those words have in helping us to do anything from paying our bills to constructing more practical and effective theories.<br>

Abstract: This review explores the most significant dimensions and findings of phenomenological approaches in anthropology. We spell out the motives and implications inherent in such approaches, chronicle their historical dimensions and precursors, and address the ways in which they have contributed to analytic perspectives employed in anthropology. This article canvasses phenomenologically oriented research in anthropology on a number of topics, including political relations and violence; language and discourse; neurophenomenology; emotion; embodiment and bodiliness; illness and healing; pain and suffering; aging, dying, and death; sensory perception and experience; subjectivity; intersubjectivity and sociality; empathy; morality; religious experience; art, aesthetics, and creativity; narrative and storytelling; time and temporality; and senses of place. We examine, and propose salient responses to, the main critiques of phenomenological approaches in anthropology, and we also take note of some of the most pressing and generative avenues of research and thought in phenomenologically oriented anthropology.<br>

Abstract: This paper is about the analysis of the written production of argumentative discourse. Thanks to the technique of collective writing it is possible to observe the process of discourse production. Declarative, strategic and procedural abilities of two non native adults are successively analyzed and compared periodically to those of two young native speakers. This study focuses on only two levels : global and interphrasal organisation of discourse. The organisation of debates in class so as to bring students to build argumentative concepts and help them in their approach of texts (reading and writing) shows the limits of a didactic scheme which relies on oral language practice for the elaboration of written texts.<br>

Abstract: I begin by introducing the Ilongots and some of their attitudes toward speech. Whereas most modern theorists think of language as a tool designed primarily to "express" or to "refer," Ilongots think of language first in terms of action. They see commands as the exemplary act of speech, displaying less concern for the subjective meanings that an utterance conveys than for the social contexts in which utterances are heard. An ethnographic sketch thus outlines how Ilongots think of words and how their thought relates to aspects of their practice -- providing an external foil for theorists found closer to home. Speech Act Theory is discussed and questioned first on internal grounds, as an approach that recognizes but slights important situational and cultural constraints on forms of language use. A consideration of the application of Searle's taxonomy of acts of speech to Ilongot categories of language use then leads to a clarification of the individualistic and relatively asocial biases of his essentially intra-cultural account. Last, I return to Ilongot directives. A partial analysis of Ilongot acts of speech provides the basis for a statement of the ways in which indigenous categories are related to the forms that actions take, as both of these, in turn, reflect the sociocultural ordering of local worlds.<br>

Abstract: We analyse the French noun livre « book » according to an argumentative conception of language. A summary is presented of the theories of Anscombre (Theory of stereotypes) and of Carel and Ducrot (Theory of semantic blocks), which are used to reveal the argumentative dimensions of livre. Argumentation is argued to derive from a common sense system (Sarfati) leading to the ascription of doxa in language governed by a topohbased device, which corresponds to discursive object. Semiotisation is supported by phenomenological processes: the Indexicality of meaning (Lebas 1999, Cadiot and Visetti 2001) is concerned at the Linguistic level with the construction of semantic forms along three dimensions of meaning, known in the Theory of semantic forms as motifs, profiles, and themes. The contributions of the discursive levels to the constitution of a semantic form are raised in view of the phenomenon of lexical anticipation. What we call "inserted motifs" reveals the genericity of Discursive Formations. In the course of "profiling", these motifs constitute a pre-syntactic zone of stabilisation. The "doxic profiles" allows the construction of topoï by thematisation.<br>

Abstract: This study examines the functions of the bilingual discourse strategy of language alternation in the process of marking boundaries of continuous discourse. The focus is on switched discourse markers -- employed, it is argued, to metalanguage the frame of the discourse. The corpus is comprised of audio recordings of over 20 hours of Hebrew-English bilingual conversation. The strategy of language alternation at discourse markers is illustrated, and the switched discourse markers are classified according to Becker's approach to context (1988b) as a source of constraints on text. This classification is then related to the phenomenon of clustering of discourse markers at discourse unit boundaries in both bilingual and monolingual discourse. Finally, cross-linguistic differences in discourse markers are related to a theory of metalanguage.<br>

Abstract: The tremendous growth in economic development in the countries of Southeast Asia has resulted in a dramatic increase in intraregional travel. As a result, tourist developments are being built at a tremendous speed and scale. Such buildings are bringing into sharp focus the definitions of terms such as "tradition/al" and "modern/ity," as well as redefining notions of "authenticity" within various cultural settings. The paper explores tourists' quest for authenticity by examining three sensitively designed resorts which use the vernacular to perpetuate an architectural language that assumes the status of authenticity by ensuring a perceived historical continuity. The paper also argues that the concept of authenticity is one way of articulating the experience of modernity and postmodernity. It proposes that authenticity can only be addressed by opening the references of figuration to the multiple imperatives of contemporary culture.<br>

Abstract: This article explores the nature of historical forgetting in the Philippines through the lens of Pierre Bourdieu's notion of forgetting as misrecognition, which is invested with power and struggle. The notion is concretized in the context of Reynaldo Ileto's discussion of the Schurman Commission, which was tasked to gather information about the Philippines as part of the United States' pacification campaign. Because historical forgetting is rooted in the structure of society itself, policies concerning language and education are imbued with power and class dimensions. The necessity of change in consciousness is enmeshed in the broader politics of social change, which is thus the context of the debate on the critical role of English in the Philippines. The political imperative to forget is inherent in—and partly sustains—the fundamental structure of social relations in the Philippines.<br>

Abstract: The article is intended to indicate how the study of written and cultural texts may be used to approach the problem of identifying the system of thought characteristic of particular groups. Certain premises of what may be called an “interpretative paradigm” have been selected to create a theoretical starting-point, and in this context the most suggestive appear to be the concept of culture developed by symbolic anthropology, the cultural-semiotic concept of text and the multi-dimensional hermeneutic approach to textual intepretation. The author therefore seeks to bring together, in addition to the general features ofinterpetative ethnology, certain theoretical and methodological starting-points derived from the three approaches mentioned. One may approach the problem of understanding of a foreign testimony via “adequate interpretation”. Here, to understand means to adopt the cultural “language” of a message as one's own, and to interpret and so transfer the unknown into an accessible code, most often one's own code. The process of interpretation is understood as the discovery of the hidden content behind the apparent stirface, and in this activity the understanding of culturally remote testimony is axiomatically taken to bepossible and communicable. In a broader epistemological context we can see in adequate intepretation one of the means to the never-ending process of correction of our pre-judged knowledge. In a spirit of critical rationalism we could deflne such interpretation as the working hypothesis that may be falsified by further Scientific activity and then replaced by a better theory. Such conclusions on the methodological range of the interpretative approach indicate only one of the possible syntheses of various epistemological paradigms, for the theoretical use and application of which ethnology seems especially suited.<br>

Abstract: Patočka summarized his conception of style in the essay „Umění a čas" [Art and Time] (1966), in which he observes style over historie periods and its increasing departure from a priori, metaphysically ascertained and universally valid meaning. In modern art, style is established by the freedom of the Creative act; its centre of gravity shifts to the level of „signifier". Patočka's essay „O minulém rázu umìění" [Concerning the Former Nature of Art] (written 1965) helped to clarify „aesthetic attitude". In this essay, he develops an interpretational duet: a critique of Hegel's metaphysical starting point, which distances itself from the experience of modern art, and an appraisal of Hegel's interpretation of time, which remains inspirational. In accordance with it, Patočka the phenomenologist considers art the place of „destructive creation", of vivifying revelation, whose source is in man. The next part of the article calls attention to a lecture by Paul Ricoeur „Vyprávění, metafora a teorie interpretace" [Narrative, Metaphor and the Theory of Interpretation] (1987), in which Ricoeur introduced a modern hermeneutic approach to literary studies. What is most relevant here is the concept of the „double reference". The first aspect of reference relates to empirical reality; the second to the „productive reference", which designs a world created by the literary work. Semantic innovation in the narration of a story has a parallel in the semantic innovation of the metaphor. In both cases there emerges „the new, the as yet unsaid, the inexpressible - in language".<br>

Abstract: In the late twentieth century two conceptions of text in a literary work followed from the original distinction between Sinn (smysl, sense) and Bedeutung (význam, reference), which was made by Gottlob Frege in 1892 - namely, those of Wolfgang Iser and Paul Ricoeur. For us, they are interesting for their direct or indirect affinity to Czech Structuralism. The article presents a detailed comparison of the two conceptions: Iser's 'act of reading', culminating in the 'play of the text', and Ricoeur's proposal of 'productive reference', which heads towards the references (Bedeutungen) of a world that is irmagined, without actually being, and announces itself through the creative power of language. The article concludes by returning to the question of the game and reference in the work of Iser and Eugene Fink. Play and art guard the vitality of sense.<br>

Abstract: In the twentieth century the phenomenon of the subjective body was integrated into ontology in philosophy, moving from Phenomenology to Existentialism. The rediscovery of the body and affect as a way of thinking also led contemporary cognitive science to the topic of the relationship between emotion and cognition, to the necessity of expanding the model of the mind and of experiencing emotions and physical sensation. The extension of the explanatory possibilities of a scholarly metalanguage into the area of the emotions and physical sensation is also important for the analysis of the acoustic aspect of lyric verse. In the acoustic flow of verse, the sounds of language have, apart from a phonemic function, their own sensuous (emotional) effect of the articulating body. In literary studies so far the acoustic flow has been interpreted only at the segmental level as a sequence of phonemes or sounds (for example in constructs of acoustic succession, phonetic instrumentation, or phonetic composition). At the suprasegmental level the acoustic flow must be conceived of as a sequence of syllables, a sequence of articulated phonations, the semantic movement of the phonemic flow. A syllable has no semantic value, but does have an experiential form, which influences motivation, behaviour, and experience. In addition to sonic and tonal modulation at the suprasegmental level, qualitative modulation, modulation of timbre, and the sequences of tones and of noise are also employed. In modelling the semantic movement of syllables in a phonemic flow the methodological approaches of experimental psychosemantics have been used. Connotational objectivization took place in three dimensions that were polarized on the basis of domestic and alien, light and darkness, activity and passivity, and research was conducted with a sample of 2,800 respondents. The analysis of the acoustic side of lyric verse would be incomplete if in addition to accentual rhythm and melody we did not also consider qualitative modulation, the semantic movement of the phonic flow. At the segmental level of verse, phonemes are semantically completed by the lexical meanings of words. This semantic process is parallel to the semantic process of the phonemic flow, but apart from the metrical correspondence between them there is no causal connection, only similar semantic content. In addition to the semantic movement of the phonational flow and the semantic saturation of phonemes, the dynamic of the acoustic process of verse completes the phonic line of the verse, which in itself links occurrences of sonic and tonal modulation.<br>

Abstract: This article discusses the options that narrative and language have in their attempts to capture or describe traumatic experience and death. It concentrates on two prose texts by Karel Čapek, Obyčejný život and Povětroň, and the first phase of Freudian psychoanalysis, pointing at generally distinguishable limits and distortions that arise when narrative and language come in contact with trauma and death. Contrary to the current trend within „trauma studies“ , the article does not deal with autobiographical records of traumatic experience. It rather tries to point out that thinking consistently about the connection between memory, language and trauma tends to blur and question the traditional distinction between fiction (understood as a work of imagination) and autobiography (taken as a description of real events). It also tries to show that psychoanalysis arrives, explicitly and implicitly, at a similar conclusion. The last part of the article poses the question what the resulting relationship between the outside (narrated, written Story) and the „inner“ experience is like, and to what extent the structure of this dyad can also be questioned.<br>

Abstract: What distinguishes Woolf's prose is not her famous penchant for simile, but her constant use of the less ostentatious, though more radical, verb metaphor. Combining these figures in strings, in which the verbs are consistent but the implied nouns contradictory, Woolf deliberately unsettles the reader, forcing him or her to consider not only the tenuous relations between the word and the world, but the contingent nature of phenomenal reality itself. Thus the view of life as something at once "very shifting" and "very solid" (expressed in the diaries and dramatized in the novels), pervades the essays, captured in the paradoxical relation "it is and is not" that Paul Ricoeur claims lies at the heart of metaphor. A close study of a paradigmatic essay, "On Not Knowing Greek," and of manuscript drafts in New York and Sussex reveals that this tension between shifting and solid extends to the syntax, which manages to be both extravagant and firmly anchored, and to the developing structure of the essay as a whole, which traces a movement of mind (a strategy James Farrell defines as specifically "feminine"), remaining defiantly heuristic and resisting the inherent closure of the formal essay. Thus, like her novels, Woolf s reviews and essays engage us in the process of perception even while inviting us to explore critically the operations of language in that perception.<br>

Abstract: Narratology may be thought of as a complicated system of conceptual filters that enact a severe formalist reduction upon the corpus of what may be thought and said about storytelling. According to Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan, this reductiveness needs to be expanded in order to attend more to language. One way of answering to her reformist prescription is a turn to the study of linguistic surface structure organized as a meditation on the metaphor of the filter. For Seymour Chatman this metaphor designates a character through whom a narrator elects to tell a story. For Max Black, "filter" is a trope for metaphoric process. Examining these senses of the filter in Henry James's short story "The Beast in the Jungle" leads to emphasis upon negations and belief qualifiers. In James's story, both turn out to be invaded by the logic of Freudian negation, itself a type of intrapsychic filtration.<br>

Abstract: A verbal message is a work of art because of the poetic function of language which we recognize because it appears in conversation. We understand one another through a mutual verbal accommodation. The resultant redundancy is precisely the poetic function. Analogously, when we encounter a poem with its multiple parallelism, we alter its language as well as our own, creating "community" just as we do in the most meaningful talk. A brief excursus into a variety of medieval poetry illustrates a relevance to criticism. Because the proverbs which abound in social complaint encapsulate community consensus, they reinforce poetic strategy.<br>

Abstract: The difference between literal and figurative language becomes evident by comparing the Dutch novel The Journey of the Customs Officer to Bentheim (1983) by Willem Brakman with Proust's Remembrance of Things Past. Certain passages in the Dutch novel can be read either as literal or as metaphorical descriptions. The reader having a reading attitude which activates that frame of "reality" which is strictly separated from the frame of reference called "fiction and representation" will read crucial passages in this novel figuratively. The reader for whom fiction and reality are inseparable and situated on the same ontological level will read them literally. Both reading attitudes, the modernist aqd postmodernist ones, are personified in the two main characters of the novel. This twofold reading implies a critique of Hrushovski's descriptive method for the analysis of metaphor which is used throughout this paper. If the position of frames of reference is undefined in his theory, in his interpretive practice it becomes clear that for him frames of reference are situated in the text. Yet The Journey's ambiguity as to whether one or two frames is applicable undermines this position. It is up to the reader to differentiate or not hierarchically between reality and fiction.<br>

Abstract: The problem being dealt with in this paper is whether a text has only one legitimate meaning, or no meaning at all. The question becomes even more acute when the contexts of sender and receiver are different. Polysemy and ambiguity are well-known obstacles to communication on the level of the word. The necessity of a general semiotic theory is stressed, and explains the difference between denotation and connotation. The functionality of metaphor in biblical language points to the interpretive value of polyvalency. The impression of unlimited indeterminacy created by the recent emphasis on the active role of the reader, is in a sense misleading since author and reader function as a textual strategy. On the other hand, the actualization of the textual expression as the content of the text by applying the various codes and subcodes, implies a continuous interaction between intensional and extensional approaches. In this respect topics, thematics, ideological and world structures are operative. Since interpretation and application are not to be separated in a pragmatic context, as is the case with the text of the Bible, there inevitably remains the possibility of multiple interpretations due to the interpreting and applying of the text of the Bible in a concrete situation. Yet this interpretation and appropriation should always be done as comprehension of the text and in continuity with the tradition.<br>

Abstract: The linguistic structures of the letter of Jude encode and articulate important religious and social meanings, such as the author and his readers' (and their adversaries') position within their social universe, as well as their beliefs, practices, norms and values. At the same time the letter also affects the circumstances which occasioned its writing, whether to expose and label Jude's opponents as evil intruders who must be exposed of, or to actively maintain the religious purity of the community to which it is addressed. Jude's language is a language of social and religious control.<br>

Abstract: Since the Kantian revolution, metaphysical knowledge has been articulated by influential theologians in the language of analogy. In accordance with this tradition, the metaphor found in Luke-Acts, that God does live in houses, but not houses built by men, is explored by studying it as a root metaphor. A root metaphor in the theological sense can be defined as the most basic assumption we can make about man's existence and experience. In this article John H Elliott's proposal that 'temple' and 'household' in Luke-Acts articulate a contrast in social institutions is debated. I wish to argue that this 'contrast' does not really articulate a shift in social institutions, but rather a broadening of an existing social institution as the result of a changed symbolic universe. This shift in symbolic universe is studied against the backdrop of a tendency to broaden the temple as a theological symbol which had already started and which intensified during the Second temple period. It is shown that the temple, its sacrificial offerings and purifying rituals, were closely associated with the household, its meals and purifying ceremonies. Jesus also advocated the broadening of the concept temple/household. His view is reportedly conveyed by Stephen, Peter, James, and Paul.<br>

Abstract: The communication of the gospel is sometimes in an 'insider language' of transcendant realities with which the secular world is unfamiliar. How significant an impediment is this? Consider fairy tales are universally understood. They share many of the same elements and functions as testimonies which are at the heart of pentecostalism. We can use stories and testimonies in our ministries? Thus to communicate with secular people we must be willing to put the stories of our lives on trial. The trans-personal dimension must be communicated, for religious experiences can be powerful. The challenge is to find ways to use stories and metaphors to speak to a secularised world of the major doctrines as expressed in The Foursquare Gospel' without losing any of its power.<br>

Abstract: This article addresses how a perceived tension between the spontaneous personal and the shared textual elements of religious language is resolved in the context of Pentecostal services recorded at two Assemblies of God (AG) churches in California and Michigan. In an analysis of pray er and the metapragmatic commentary that surrounds it, I argue that the balance between spontaneously created prayer and invocation of fixed text plays on an opposition that goes beyond ritual or religious language; rather, it is best understood as characterizing two opposing text-building or entextualization strategies. Using evidence from AG prayer, sermons, and songs, I show that the preferred entextualization strategy highlights the situatedness of the text in a particular context and as emanating from a particular speaker. My findings have significance not only for research on religious language, but also for further understandings of entextualization and the discursive means of constructing personhood and affect.<br>

Abstract: This article argues for a definition of translation as a form of writing under constraint. Quite straightforwardly, the translator must write the original text again in a language other than the one in which it was originally composed. Both inhibiting and enabling, that restriction is also translation's resource, ensuring its distinctiveness as a writing practice and providing the key to its unique transformative possibilities. Like lipogrammatical writing, translation is inaugurated by its constraint. The article explores the affinity between translation and the lipogram with reference to Georges Perec's La Disparition, where the prohibition of the letter e initiates a peculiarly inventive kind of writing. Peculiarly inventive, because the effects generated by writing without a given letter of the alphabet, or by writing a given text again in another, altogether different, language, are essentially unprogrammable: we do not know what is going to happen.<br>

Abstract: Serge Lifar built his career during the 1930s, a decade crucial to understanding his 'années noires'-or 'black years', as the French historian Henry Rousso called the period of the German occupation of Paris (1940—1944). Lifar's powerful and respected position at the Paris Opéra, the social connections he had built and maintained and the psychological impact of exile: all these elements help clarify Lifar's accommodating attitude towards the German occupants of his adopted city. During the 1930s Lifar came to be accepted in French intellectual society as the 'heir' of Serge Diaghilev. Through his publications he made a powerful contribution to the process by which Diaghilev's Ballets Russes assumed its paramount position in the development of modern ballet, a process set in motion by the impresario himself. Lifar played this role chiefly in France. In the English-speaking world, where relatively few of his books appeared in translation, other writers served to canonise the Diaghilev endeavour, albeit for somewhat different ends. A list of Lifar's publications in Russian and other languages (French above all) displays the growing influence of his actions and authority, the power of his connections (inherited primarily from Diaghilev), and his relentless will to overcome the problems of emigration as he secured not only success as a dancer and choreograph but also a public reputation as an intellectual. The recent discovery of new evidence has led to the identification of the respected Pushkin authority Modeste Hofmann as the writer whose unacknowledged work enabled Lifar to establish himself as an historian. This evidence, provided by Hofmann's grandsons André and Vladimir Hofmann, raises serious questions about the authority of Lifar's books. An interplay of subjective relationships is woven into the texture of these narratives in which survival and ambition, a paternal attitude and filial respect, exist in constant tension. Neither the making of these books nor the myth of Russian dance which they espouse can be understood without placing their authors in the milieu they shared in Paris as Russian émigrés.<br>

Abstract: The relations between language and imagery are addressed by cross referencing Lacan and James Hillman, along with Mead, Geschwind, and Gibson. Not only is neither symbolic frame reducible to the other, but neither can be rooted in perceptual capacities that would be distinct from or more "primitive" than the other. Outside of specific theoretical agendas that would analyze one by simplifying the other, word and image are co-emergent and co-dependent expressions of the inherent openness of the human mind.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo procura abordar os papéis de sacerdote, chefe e xamã - todos presentes no ngillatun, ritual de fertilidade mapuche - da perspectiva de seus modos diferenciais de travar relações por meio da linguagem. A linguagem, conforme entendida pelos Mapuche do meio rural chileno, não emerge exclusivamente das intenções de falantes individuais, mas igualmente da força (newen) constitutiva da totalidade do ser. Sacerdotes, chefes e xamãs recorrem à fala para alinhar-se a essa força, que por meio deles se atualiza. Uma tal observação lança nova luz sobre o entendimento de Clastres quanto à relação entre chefia e linguagem. Se, acompanhando os Mapuche, enfatizamos as qualidades indexicais da linguagem, em detrimento das simbólicas, vemos que se torna um tanto problemático analisar a linguagem dos chefes em conformidade com um modelo de “troca”, como faz Clastres. This paper seeks to approach the roles of priest, chief, and shaman — all present in the Mapuche ngilUtun fertility ritual -from the perspective of their differential modes of relating through language. Language, as understood by rural Mapuche, emerges not solely from the intentions of individual speakers, but equally from the force -newen -constitutive of all being. Priests, chiefs, and shamans all seek to align themselves through speech to this force which instantiates itself through them. Such an observation casts new light on Clastres' understanding of the relationship between chiefs and language. If we follow Mapuche in emphasizing the indexical rather than symbolic qualities of language, we see that Clastres'analysis of chiefly language as susceptible to a model of "exchange" becomes somewhat problematic.<br>

Abstract: Disciplinary specialties and boundaries may impede as well as facilitate understanding. Standard scholarly orientations to the study of Navajos and other ethnic populations manifest many biases of ethnocentrism and a general tendency to stereotype. Specific observer-related tendencies to distort are noted, among them tendencies to understate social dynamics and the degree to which Navajos are functioning parts of wider social systems. The literature on Navajos is a product of changing tools in the hands of changing observers applied to changing communities in the context of ongoing change in the wider societies of both observer and observed. It is argued that "multiplying glimpses," or increasing the number and types of observers and the variety of disciplines and paradigms represented, may reduce observer and position biases that distort existing views of Navajo society. An overview of the massive literature on the Navajo leads to the identification of 21 distinct genres. These genres and other Navajo texts may profitably be viewed in the perspective of textual analysis, broadly defined. Issues of meaning and interpretation are considered, including the reality-language-text nexus, construction of texts, text-context patterns, and the interaction of text, situation, and analyst in interpretation. Appropriate use of existing texts is socially responsible "green research" and should not be professionally stigmatized. It substitutes resource-efficient recycling of discarded and underanalyzed texts for the old expensive, obtrusive colonial patterns of work.<br>

Abstract: The claim of this essay is that those who study ritual should make fuller use than has been made so far of the literature in philosophy of art. The relevance of aesthetic theory to several questions currently being addressed in ritual studies will be shown, and a model based on what we call "ritual spaces" will serve as the basis for interpreting certain types of ritual. We apply our theory to the ancient Zoroastrian high liturgy, the Yasna. Implications of this interpretive model will also be explored; they include discussions on the following issues: the role of ritual language, the relationship of the various dimensions of ritual, and the basic functions of liturgical performance. The essay begins with analysis and concludes with synthesis.<br>

Abstract: The Hebrew Bible depicts interpretation as a continual process of losing and finding, of forgetting and remembering. Texts are lost and found, and in the Joseph story (Gen. 37-50), Joseph himself is abandoned and recovered, with all memory of him repressed until it is dramatically recalled. His story demonstrates that repression is the condition of interpretation, and that interpretation-not resurrection-holds forth the promise of a future life. Nonetheless, the repeated losses that punctuate the Joseph narrative have inspired the opposite conclusion: that Joseph is a type of Jesus, that his descents and ascents prefigure the final one. Typology, a mode of biblical interpretation that prevailed during the early church, has enjoyed a recent revival in the context of literary studies; but I argue that the typological language of "fulfillment," of shadows and truth, is alien to Hebraic-and postmodern-understandings of textuality.<br>

Abstract: The conflict between formalist thinking and theories that view texts in their historical contexts serves as a starting point for the introduction of a cognitive view of literature. From this perspective language has full referential powers. The "referent" splits into two entities, however: things-in-themselves (in their material identity), which we cannot know, and things in their coded form, which are perceptually accessible. Readers' mnemonic potentials, a consequence of the bonding of perception and language, are adduced to show that texts originate in past interpretations of other texts and in personal experience and that consequently social forces and historical events are subsumed in the individual memory. In the cognitive light, memory becomes the ultimate metaphor, and the epistemological claim of realism regains its compelling force.<br>

Abstract: In his Narrative (1845), Frederick Douglass constructs a self based on conversion rhetoric and binary logic. In the greatly expanded My Bondage and My Freedom (1855), he complicates this textual self by both imitating and criticizing tropes conventionally used in the slavery debate, such as metaphors related to animals. Christianity, and manhood. Emphasizing the constructed nature of mimesis and metaphor, Douglass demonstrates his ability to escape the bondage of reductionist language even as he claims the power associated with linguistic mastery. This revision of self emerges from his experience of northern racism, manifested in his limited role in William Lloyd Garrison's organization. Douglass's renunciation of Garrisonian dogma and his entry into political action-including his striking textual reinterpretation of the United States Constitution-coincide with the stylistically "modernist" self of the second autobiography.<br>

Abstract: The Mexican state's use of revolutionary history to invoke nationalistic sentiments nurtures a lively tradition of storytelling. Ironically, Buena Vista's storytellers criticize the inauthenticity of official representations of the past even as they draw on the images and ideals of "official" history to weave their own tales. This article argues that discourses of authenticity reinscribe historic distinctions between the community and the state in a language which evokes modern notions of purity and truth. The article highlights the political role of discourses of authenticity within the hegemonic structures of modern state power in Mexico.<br>

Abstract: «At the basis of the literary act is a consciousness of language. Whether or not the writer is given to abstract reflexion, there is in literature itself a metaliterary dimension.» In his article on the Evolution of Literary Theory, Tzvetan Todorov examines the relation between the «discourse on Literature» and the object of that discourse: literature. Whereas exegesis concerns itself with the Elucidation and explanation of an historically given object, theory itself constitutes its object. Theory then is in turn seen to be historically informed. From the Poetics of Aristotle, through the medieval hermeneuts, the Renaissance concern with genres, Todorov traces the development of the theoretical discourse which proposes literature as its object. Only in the romantic period is a theory of literature, in the strict sense, elaborated. In the 20th century this theory is further influenced by other emergent disciplines :Marxism, psychoanalysis etc. The final pages of Todorov's paper consider in detail the impact of structuralism, particularly in France, on the literary theoretical discourse. He concludes with reference to the changes taking place currently. According to Todorov, it is in the «idea of genre» that the «transformation will take place.»<br>

Abstract: A properly sociological definition of the concept of discourse does not exist because the notion has never been detached from the linguistic sphere. Not only linguists and semiologists, but also sociologists, use the word primarily as a linguistic category. This article attempts to define the concept of discourse sociologically. It is argued that a sociologically defined notion should be dissociated from the linguistic realm. As a linguistic category, 'discourse' is either used as a synonym for language or text, or is closely associated with one of these notions. 'Discourse' in a sociological sense should refer to a class of texts. This definition confers upon the concept of discourse an intertextual dimension. Defined in this way, the category can not only become an operative sociological concept, but it also becomes autonomous and is no longer reducible to linguistic or paralinguistic conceptual entities, such as text or language. No longer confined to the linguistic realm, the concept can designate a particular entity which possesses its own existence. Discourse can become a thing in itself. The argument is presented in three parts. The first is a critique of the current definitions of the concept 'discourse'. The second proposes, as an alternative, a sociological definition of discourse. Finally the third part applies this new definition in a sociological analysis of journalism.<br>

Abstract: Most students of Javanese culture and society have used a few crucial native terms and concepts to analyze aspects of traditional etiquette, statecraft, and mysticism. A unitary approach to priyayi ethics, aesthetics, and power is developed here by synthesizing themes common to earlier treatments. Several points of disagreement with Geertz's (1960, 1973) descriptions are discussed in conclusion as a way of drawing out lexicographic aspects of the methodology of interpretive anthropology.

Abstract: In their interpretations of magical acts and utterances, anthropologists frequently argue that magic and technology are informed by two different kinds of logic, the former "expressive" in character, the latter "instrumental." A close analysis of magical hunting songs used by the Aguaruna of Amazonian Peru reveals that the songs are part of a general ordering process that encompasses the strategic use of thoughts, speech, objects, and acts to achieve practical ends. In Aguaruna thought the expressive imagery of magical songs is an instrumental tool that shapes events in the performer's world.

Abstract: Narrative, self, and face-to-face interaction all intersect in everyday storytelling practices in which children and caregivers make claims to personal experiences. This article examines such practices as a site for the social construction of self in early childhood. Drawing upon excerpts of narrative talk from a variety of cultural traditions in the United States, we describe the self-relevant meanings and processes entailed in three particular narrative practices.

Abstract: Sumbanese descriptions of the "traditional house" as a microcosm and emblem of local identity are neither unproblematic expressions of a cultural totality nor simply objectifications imposed by ethnography or modernity. One way the house is able to serve as a discursive object reflects, in part, specifically Sumbanese models of action and beliefs about language as refracted in changing historical circumstances. In ritual, speakers seek to engage and elicit responses from powerful others, whereas current religious and political developments reframe ritual words as means of describing a cultural world. Both sets of practices draw on the authority of "entextualized" language but interpret it in different ways. Emerging representations of cultural meaning are shaped by long-standing speech genres and by recent social and cultural transformations, mediated by shifting language ideologies.

Abstract: An ethnographic study of the words and actions common to a shelter for people considered homeless and mentally ill shows how distinct forms of reasoning and personal agency relate to a set of practical concerns and political exigencies. Whereas the shelter's staff rely on and promote a referential language and direct, active forms of agency, its residents depend on tactical, persuasive uses of language and oblique, reactive forms of agency. Yet because the staff have the upper hand politically, their orientations to language, thought, and action take a more central role in encouraging people to act in sincere and reasonable ways. The residents draw on ideas of sincerity, reason, and personal accountability, but in makeshift ways, with the result that the ideas are caught up in the rhetoric of self-presentation. The article's findings underscore the need for anthropologists to attend to the diverse means, and political, linguistic, and cultural grounds, of human reason and agency.

Abstract: Arthur C. Clarke once wrote that "any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." The language of magic is evident in much of popular discourse about computers. A content analysis of Time magazine reporting on computers and related technologies over a ten-year period revealed that 36 percent of all these stories used explicitly magical or religious language. Together with a qualitative analysis of implicitly magical themes, the patterns in Time's reporting reveal how magic language was used as one strategy to stabilize and close the technological frame of personal computers in the mid-1980s.<br>

Abstract: This article focuses on the last two novels by Adolfo Couve, La comedia del arte (1996) and Cuando pienso en mi falta de cabeza (La segunda comedia), posthumously published in 2000. The article proposes an allegorical reading of the transformation of the painter Camondo into a wax statue, the protagonist of both novels who later loses his mind. The article argues that the loss of the mind allegorizes a quotidian time, in tune with Couve's world, which spins and repeats itself, closed, without a horizon, a “beheaded” time (lacking future). This allows the possibility to build a coherent sense of a series of narrative forms (which include language, space, time, characters) and that, taken as a whole, show the particular way in which Couve's narrative is built and developed.<br>

Abstract: This study presents an interpretation of the configuration of the poetic subject in the books of poems El Primer Libro (1985) and Albricia (1988) by Soledad Fariña (1943), which understand a self in a continuous process of gestation and birth. This process serves the purpose of recomposing a disarticulated subjectivity lost in the framework of the political and cultural conditions imposed by the military dictatorship that ruled Chile in the 1970s and 1980s. By using a metaphor of a journey and searching for a new language, the subject attempts to access a primitive stage andfind its maternal self in order to confront the dominant power, by codifying and configuring herself through an otherness in a feminine body-text. However, this process of maturation and discovery is intervened and left incomplete by the impulse of modernity, thereby creating a deformed, dissociated and off-centered self, which aims at growing opposed to logos. This conflict turns the upcoming of the new self into a painful event, like giving birth, that stems from the subject's wounded and fractured body, intending to re-establish de selffrom its fragments, traces and memories.<br>

         apprentissage en profondeurbasé sur des années d'expérience en éducation dans des contextes autochtones? » Après avoir analysé les divers sens attribués à la notion d'appropriation culturelle, l'auteure présente des textes de Gee sur les discours secondaires, de Foucault sur la production du discours et de Wertsch sur les structures profondes du discours et fait le lien avec des expériences décisives sur le terrain tirées d'années de recherche et d'enseignement. Gardant au fond de l'espoir, l'auteure conclut l'article en présentant le protocole d'appropriation culturelle recommandé par des universitaires autochtones lors de l'utilisation de savoirs autochtones par des personnes nonautochtones dans des contextes pédagogiques.<br>

Abstract: Recent scholarship has given considerable attention to lyric poetry as a form of sensuous knowledge. This approach emphasizes the corporeal origins of poetry, its genesis in the body or in language viewed as material. The question of sensuous knowledge is central to the larger theoretical issue of modernity itself, in which lyric holds a central yet ambiguous status. The question of sensuous knowledge is ultimately a question of meaning. However, modern thought — thought pertaining to “modernity” — is fundamentally circular. This would seem to establish an epistemological impasse for aesthetics. But I argue that this circularity offers an important, and necessary, way to limit knowledge and thereby ground an ethical subjectivity. My essay places formalism at the heart of sensuous knowledge. In this essay I develop an account of the importance of abstraction in sensuous knowledge by way of Kant's concept of
         Darstellung, “presentation [of sensory experience].” The “presentation” is the object as it has undergone a structural process of internalization and been made available for psychic use as meaning; that requires a recognition of loss. Where this is important for literature is that twentieth-century American poetry frequently uses very personal images of family life as a way of conveying sincerity about corporeal experience. I use this discussion of circularity in modern aesthetic thought to argue that there is a risk to taking shortcuts to meaning through images of the material bodies of children. In these contemporary poems by Gary Snyder, Sharon Olds and Rita Dove, the poets reject loss in favor of a very modern “affirmation” of the material. But affirmation and the visual image as a sign of affirmation cannot alone bind meaning to us. That meaning must be internalized through theworkof poetic presentation.<br>

Abstract: For both Levinas and Derrida, the practice of philosophy, understood as commentary by the former and deconstruction by the latter, was founded on borrowing terms from other languages and finding their equivalents in French. This argument is developed through a discussion of two texts, Levinas's early Talmudic reading, “The Temptation of Temptation,” and Derrida's deconstruction of
         The Merchant of Venicein “What Is a ‘Relevant’ Translation?” This essay shows how translated terms are interwoven into these texts. It also shows that translation is essential to Levinas's and Derrida's creative conceptualization, and to the performativity of their philosophies, meaning that Levinas and Derrida open their language to other languages in order to create concepts. It finally argues that in both Derrida and Levinas the question of the limits of translation, namely, of the moment in which translation becomes conversion, is left open.<br>

Abstract: This article examines Jean Hatzfeld's
         Machete Season: The Killers in Rwanda Speak, a collection of testimonials by perpetrators of the genocide in Rwanda. While surveying popular representations of killers in Rwanda, circulating theories about the 1994 genocide and the veracity of these killers' accounts, this article also investigates the production, edition, and translation of these killers' interviews. In particular, it focuses on Jean Hatzfeld's role as editor of these killers' testimonies and Innocent Rwililiza's position as translatorinterviewer. Contextualizing elements missing from these interviews——namely, concepts from Rwandan language, history, and culture, as well as broader psychosocial dimensions both pre- and post-genocide——this article problematizes Hatzfeld's depiction of these ““ordinary killers.””<br>

Abstract: In his essay “The Style of Autobiography”, Jean Starobinski remarks, “One would hardly have sufficient motive to write an autobiography had not some radical change occurred […] conversion, entry into a new life, the operations of Grace”. From the beginning, the traumatic events of Keller's childhood — her loss of sight and hearing around age two — marked her not only as “outsider” and “other” but also as “autobiographer” even before she acquired language. “I can show so little visible proof of living”, Keller confessed. Perhaps for this reason she filled the “white darkness” she lived in with writing — first with finger spelling traced in the hand, then with Braille, and finally with type. While each medium seemed to bring her closer to the dream — her own and her century's — of transparent communication, so each text she produced threatened to turn into a “black box”, an instrument designed to collect and preserve data for analysis following a catastrophic event, but one that inevitably fails to illumine the inner world of Keller's deaf-blindness. This essay explores Keller's dreaming within the black box of writing, following her impossible desire for an “instrument which will show what takes place in the mind when we think”.<br>

Abstract: Surface reading and similar developments in literary study advocate a turn away from symptomatic reading toward the superficial and self-evident. Arguing for the productivity of these approaches despite the contradictory language in which they have sometimes been formulated, this essay develops a related form of analysis: literal or denotative reading. Denotative reading does not reject deep or figurative interpretive possibilities. Rather, it insists they must be pursued in close connection with the facticity of fictional worlds, particularly in the case of maritime and other fiction deploying a specialized, technical lexicon. The essay treats Joseph Conrad's
         Heart of Darkness(1899) as an exemplary instance of such fiction, contending that its precise articulation of tidal currents, nautical maneuvers, and ship design signals the key role of “restraint” not only in this novella but throughout Conrad's corpus.<br>

Abstract: The combinatory and ludic polyculturalism, the parodic transmutation of meanings and values, the open, multilingual hybridization [which] are the devices responsible for the constant feeding and refeeding of this “baroquizing” almagest: the carnivalized transencyclopedia of the new barbarians, where everything can coexist with everything. They are the machinery that crushes the material of tradition, like the teeth of a tropical sugarmill, transforming stalks and husks into bagasse and juicy syrup.

Abstract: The world is a large and various place. Those wishing to chart new planetary cartographies are finding many languages to study beyond the French–German–English triad that long dominated Western comparative studies, and they are developing new methods appropriate to the expanded scope of our field. The tough linguistic and political analyses that Emily Apter rightly wishes comparatists to pursue will best be carried forward by widening our cultural and linguistic horizons, and by employing the full variety of critical and theoretical approaches that can be included in our cartographic toolboxes today.<br>

Abstract: Fitzgerald's nostalgic style, though, set an example of how a nostalgic narrative could be structured, and in its aftermath it was used by such different authors as Evelyn Waugh in
      Brideshead Revisited(1945), Anthony Burgess inA Clockwork Orange(1962) and the works of Kazuo Ishiguro. The author's own later work employs it as well. The technique of using the reader's textual memory in order to evoke a phenomenological nostalgic experience is very evident in both versions ofTender Is the Night(the 1934 original, and Malcolm Cowley's 1951 restructuring). In the 1951 version, the structure of the narrative closely follows the pattern of happiness and reflection. An early description of a Swiss valley communicates an awe of life and nature: “The sun swam out into a blue sea of sky and suddenly it was a Swiss valley at its best—pleasant sounds and murmurs and a good fresh smell of health and cheer” (9). In the transitory third book, “Casualties: 1925,” the tone has changed from appreciative to melancholic, as in this description of the small town of Amiens: “In the day-time one is deflated by such towns, with their little trolley cars of twenty years ago crossing the great grey cobble-stoned squares in front of the cathedral, and the very weather seems to have a quality of the past, faded weather like that of old photographs” (138). At the end of the novel both Dick and Nicole Diver become obsessed with youth and the past as well as with time: “for Nicole the years slipped away by clock and calendar and birthday, with the added poignance of her perishable beauty” (228). Toward the end of the novel, Nicole's last sight of Dick—“her eyes followed his figure until it became a dot and mingled with the other dots in the summer crowd” (386)—forces the reader to reflect in a reversed movement. Instead of vanishing like Dick, this image suggests a backward recollection of what was a Swiss valley “at its best.”<br>

Abstract: Even in her familial tone, and perhaps because of it, Jabbeh Wesley never forgets that the healing and meaning-making function of grief and mourning, as painful as grief and mourning are, is not to be avoided. Rather, as DuBose argues, based on the painful experience of his wife's miscarriage, as “‘child’ and ‘parent’ disappeared, our bodies and our society
      dys-appeared, and our connections and hopes re-appeared” (374). Jabbeh Wesley attaches the reappearance of the hopes for the healing and reconstruction of her Liberian world to people's ability and willingness to truly experience the painful process of grief and, perhaps informed by that cathartic experience, allow compassion and empathy to guide their relationship to others.<br>

Abstract: Some time ago, Paul Ricoeur pointed out that “the symbol gives rise to thought.”
      
               These diasporic religious communities enable us to find a new beginning for thought that has the possibility of avoiding the exclusivity and elitism that has too often accompanied the objective meaning of thought as a science of the rational. Not only these diasporic religions, but also the very conundrum of the continent of Africa as a whole, to echo Skinner at the beginning of our paper, may serve in the same manner as one of the most important ways that thought might be renewed—and the relationship of thought to action and performance.38<br>

Abstract: Is SPEP the city of God? This would be going too far. Not even the theological turn in French Phenomenology would make this claim. Dick Howard already threw in a troubling question: “diversification that perhaps gives more breadth than depth?” he asked. And there are plenty more troubling questions. SPEP is now a big operation. It has committees and subcommittees, multiple simultaneous sessions, blind review. All these developments are signs, perhaps inevitable ones, of its success, but all have familiar downsides: bureaucratization, diversification for its own sake, what Habermas would call
   Unübersichtlichkeit. This is what happens when outsiders become insiders, the antis become their own sort of establishment. You can't blame some of us for feeling nostalgic for our long-lost innocence, even though we all know—you don't have to be a philosopher of history to know this—that we can't go there. History has rendered a judgment, but Dick Howard said, “Historywilljudge.” That's one problem with history: It's always rendering judgments, but they are never final. You'd have to be at the end of history for that, and despite the claim of some philosophers, we aren't there yet. The slaughter bench of history looks very different today from the early 1960s, but it's still in some ways a slaughter bench. So how will the SPEP of the early twenty-first century look to the philosopher-historians of 2061—or is it 2062?<br>

Abstract: In short, it is exposure to the experientially inspired and theoretically casual atmosphere of those early SPEP meetings—where neglected topics and unorthodox modes of thinking and speaking were encouraged in an undisciplined way—to which I owe the most. Of course, SPEP grew up. It has experienced its share of embarrassing upheavals, as the heavy presence of its own versions of the social and political prejudices in the larger culture became too obvious to ignore. But it is now a major event—the four-day anchor for a week-long convention that takes over hotels, runs multiple concurrent sessions, fosters satellite groups, and often follows established lines of discussion. Some even call it the alternative APA. Yet I am sure that as long as lifeworld experience continues to trump whatever it is currently fashionable to say about it, grown-up SPEP will retain enough of its original vitality and intellectual generosity so that another generation of aging academics will have cause to repeat our present thank-yous in another fifty years.<br>

Abstract: Our plight, then, is not simply that we are all in the same boat, let alone on the same ocean. Yet we are still bound by the responsbility of inhabiting the same planet. What would it mean, then, to share the earth with all its inhabitants, not just in terms of occupying the same planet but also in terms of caring and looking after each other in the anachronistic sense of the word
   dutyas plight? Can we risk pledging to solemnly avow our own investments in the very things we so self-rightousely protest against, not in order to stop protesting in the name of justice but, rather, in the hopes of turning the killing machine back against itself and taking another step toward “hunting down” and abolishing death penalities wherever they may be hiding, even in our own disowned fears and desires?<br>

Abstract: In 1986, however, SPEP's present mission statement could not have been conceived. Many important issues and questions remained unrecognized or simply ignored. But the opening before the organization was now a “postmodern” one, and a hallmark of what is called postmodern thought is its requirement that it transform in the force of its own lack of founded stability. I believe that 1986 began a series of developments that is turning SPEP toward ways of thought and life that cannot be labeled postmodern. I doubt that this turning constitutes a midlife crisis for SPEP in its fiftieth year. But it does highlight for me the fact that I have been giving a historical narrative that has to do with continuities in the dissolution of continuities, that I have not been—if I may put it this way—postmodern in an orthodox manner, although I have refused to give an unambiguous meaning to the term that has played a major role in organizing this essay. I do not know whether this discussion is postmodern, post-postmodern, or modern, and I do not care. I do care, however, about the openings that SPEP has provided for collegiality, conflict, unresolved differences, transformations, and sites for presentations, discussion, and critique. In my experience, in its own organizational development and travail, it has occasioned changes in the lives of many philosophers (mine among them). I expect that its indeterminate opening now—its continuing transformations in the interaction of many differences—will continue to surprise, irritate, and change those of us who participate in its opportunities. I close with a sense of beginning and an acknowledgment of the strangeness of the continuity that a series of beginnings provides: continuity without substance, continuity coming to pass.<br>

Abstract: We at SPEP have never been modern and have made a good living off the critique of modernism and of its binary oppositions. But I think that the business as usual of Continental philosophy will have to be expanded to include a critique of the opposition of the human and the nonhuman, of
            physisandtechne, and of “Continental philosophy” and “science.” For the truth is that we have been a party to the science wars. That is why I think that the work of Catherine Malabou is exactly the sort of work that SPEP and Continental philosophy generally will have to do in the future.
                  We have yet to admit how deeply inscribed the human is in the nonhuman and the technical. We have yet to appreciate that being-in-the-world is not only historicized, gendered, and incarnate but also both a neural and a galactic event, of both microscopic and macroscopic proportions. Can it be of no interest to “philosophy,” can there be nothing to “wonder” about, that our bodies are literally made of stardust? We have yet to realize how deeply interwoven is the imagination of speculative physics with the wonder of the philosophers. If the best we can do is to protect our turf by saying that science does not think, the sciences will steal our thunder, that is, our wonder, right out from under us. Science does think, and science wonders, because wonder is the piety of thought. That is a matter to which SPEP, and Continental philosophers generally, whether they have taken a theological turn or are running in the opposite direction, should give more thought.36

Abstract: For, if phenomenology renounces its search for the absolute and for foundations, then it must give up seeing itself as a single and self-contained discourse. The minimal phenomenologist renounces monolinguism and is no longer the master of only one discourse. Instead, he or she must practice a mixed discourse. To do this is to practice diglossia, to become a code-switcher. In its ordinary sense, the practice of code-switching refers to the passage from one language or dialect to another one in the course of a single conversation, for instance, when the conversation moves from an informal to a formal setting or when it moves from one topic to another. But in the phenomenological context, this would involve the ability to shift from a phenomenological discourse to its “others,” whether they might be Freudian energetics, Deleuzian aspects, Badiouan events, and so on. This practice of translation or code-switching has perhaps always been the role of the phenomenologist, if it is accepted that phenomenological reflection does not begin from itself but is nourished by a life that precedes it and gives rise to it.<br>

Abstract: In this work, I argue that creative metaphors are formed when some persistent problem, caused by an inadequacy in preexisting knowledge, descends into the collective unconscious, is reconfigured unconsciously in novel ways, and then reemerges back into consciousness where the impasse is resolved by the metaphorical expression of new knowledge. To develop this position, I (1) review and critique some well-known language-based studies of metaphor, (2) summarize psychoanalytic and depth psychological approaches to the psyche as one way to overcome the shortcomings of the language-based scholarship, (3) relate C. G. Jung's account of the psyche and his related notion of synchronicity to creative metaphors, (4) graft a quantum physics approach to material reality back onto Jung's work as a provisional structure of the collective unconscious, and finally, (5) offer some suggestions about how creative metaphors might work psychologically.<br>

Abstract: Adopting a hyperbolic perspective is also certainly a way to argue as well as a way to examine other “texts” because it is a trope and figure of thought that reveals those moments within discourse when one is attempting to transcend the bounds of reality because the extraordinary nature of a given situation or subject matter requires the use of an excessive prophetic voice or an ardent polemical exaggeration. As Mileur posits, “The work is a hyperbole, the intersection of other hyperboles, and the subject is, insofar as he can be written about at all, another hyperbole” (1990, 86). Rather than circumventing it, understanding hyperbole as the focus of thought and action can create significant moments of
      inventioas well aselocutiofor the hyperbolist and critic alike. By approaching a particular text, a critical term, and even a piece of criticism itself from a hyperbolic perspective, one might (re)consider and (re)interpret these “texts” as a stretching of discursive limits that leads one toward a re-presentation of the extraordinary—an attempt to communicate the ineffable or transgress the expressible.<br>

Abstract: Second, how do we account for the fact that the processes of public memory are both created by individual choices and nurtured in collective contexts? Many scholars have productively addressed this question by unpacking specific examples in which individuals or groups vie to control public memories. The critical framework I recommend offers a more systematic approach to this issue. To view representations of the past through the nested lenses of rhetoric, public memory, and the agential spiral is to focus on how human beings—individually and in groups—forge connections with people of other times through the medium of public agency. The agential spiral, derived from my reading of Ricoeur's “threefold mimesis,” aims to pinpoint three moments in the construction of narratives in which human action is represented and reinterpreted within a temporal structure. As a critical framework, the agential spiral helps us to view the creation of public memories at three key moments and to see the process as a coiling whole. Using this tool, we can better understand why certain memories persist in certain societies and how those memories powerfully connect people across time as well as space.<br>

Abstract: Moreover, for Shaw and Ricoeur, imaginative works of art have the power to project alternative and potentially redemptive ways of living together harmoniously, which in turn can substantially change hearts, alter beliefs, and reorient behavior in an empathetic direction that promotes vigilant concern for the other. Be they biblical narratives, plays for the stage, fictions for the page, or other forms of literary texts broadly construed, stories can portray freedom and fault reconciled in compassionate beings committed to advancing the common good. In this way, poetic making can and has instilled in us not only faith and hope but magnanimity as well. Thus, the answer to the provocative question Shaw poses at the beginning of his last major treatise,
      Everybody's Political What's What?—“Is Human Nature Incurably Depraved?”
               —is a resounding no: not just for him but for Ricoeur, too. Where there is faith, there is hope; and where there is hope, there is life. Life expectant.55<br>

Abstract: To challenge an unexamined critical alignment with Ishmael's limited epistemology in Herman Melville's
         Moby-Dickshows how the placing of confidence in Ishmael as witness to Ahab's monomania leads to a misreading ofMoby-Dick. Ahab lies at the center of a highly developed epistemology that competes with and eludes the narrator's comprehension. The various trophies that appear throughout the text are manifest examples of this other-than-interpretive system of knowing, and Melville uses the act of possessing trophies, particularly the act of eating trophies, to show graphically how such a system works. In other words, Melville has developed a complex epistemological system of ingestion around Ahab to model how language can be materially invested with meaning and how that meaning is performed.<br>

Abstract: It has been over ten years since anything significant has been published on D. H. Lawrence's critical prose, and nothing of note has ever been written on the subject of the short essays—“The Novel,” “Surgery for the novel—Or a Bomb,” “Morality and the Novel,” and “Why the novel Matters”—containing his theory of the novel. The rhetorical style Lawrence adopts is so informal, so comical, and often so bizarre that the impulse of critics, when they do refer to these essays, is to ignore the rhetoric and somehow extract a system of logocentric doctrine, a doctrine that does not bear scrutiny. To appreciate Lawrence's genre theory, one cannot ignore the style in which it is written but must instead focus on the dynamics of discourse comprising the rhetorical text. Grounding my reading in Bakhtin's
         carnival, I argue that Lawrence celebrates the novel in terms of its “joyful relativity” (Bakhtin's term), a theory that articulates itself performatively in different ways through its own deconstruction. Read deconstructively, Lawrence's genre theory offers an important contribution to modernist concepts of language, an area from which Lawrence has traditionally been entirely excluded.<br>Link: <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/style.34.1.36">http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/style.34.1.36</a>

Abstract: In this article, I attempt to bring together the post-structuralist, Levinas-oriented and the rhetorical-and-narratological branches of the contemporary ethical reflection on fiction and explore their respective understanding of the notion of an “implied author.” I argue that Booth's concept and its subsequent redefinitions remain fraught with ‘technical’ difficulties and prove indefensible. After reviewing discussions of the “implied author,” I compare two readings of Yann Martel's
         Life of Pito explore the relevance of the notion for the cases when one wishes to arbitrate between contrasting interpretations of the same text. I then argue that neither the rhetorical and narratological nor the Levinas-oriented ethical criticism has succeeded in rendering Booth's concept a precise and effective tool for literary interpretation. I conclude my analysis by considering the possibility that an alternative understanding of intentionality will enable practitioners of both lines of inquiry to pursue their research without needing to resort to the concept of an implied author.<br>

Abstract: What is left unsaid in this article about the relationship between utopia and rhetoric could certainly fill the pages of many books. The range is especially rich when we turn to contemporary rhetorical theorists who specifically address society as a value to be combined with a remembered or imagined better place, as in Nedra Reynolds's
      Geographies of Writingor bell hooks'sBelonging: A Culture of Place.
               Just as constitutive rhetoric (that is, cumulative discourse that contributes to building the structure of human society) has been important in the works of theorists often cited by utopists as crucial to their work, so the utopian impulse continues to be inherent in the way rhetoricians see their subject. To persuade verbally or visually, we must have our own idea of what is socially better, and we must also be able to imagine what our audience believes to be better. The function of utopia, then, may be less philosophical and ideological at its root than it is linguistic in a pragmatic sense. As Kenneth Burke has written of human beings, we are “the symbol-making, symbol-using, symbol-misusing animal … rotten with perfection.”38

Abstract: Milan Kundera has described this kind of comedy as echoing a joyous, life-affirming laughter—“the serious laughter of angels expressing their joy of being.”
      
               But that is not to suggest that there is anything divinely pious in this position: if Joyce is an angel, then he is one, like Stephen Dedalus, who will not blindly or uncritically serve.168
            
               In commenting upon an earlier version of this article, Patrick Parrinder spoke of “the difficult relationship between Utopia and comedy.” This relationship is problematized by the fact that Utopia rarely seems able to laugh at itself or therefore to offer the liberating possibilities of comedy. Joyce's later writing, however, appears to advance the rare chance of a pluralist, ambiguous, and dynamic vision of Utopia: a Utopia that might be sustained into futurity—a Utopia that still has room for dreamers and for democrats. But is it still possible that we can call this realm of radical openness, this flux of possibilities, this resolutely material site, Utopian? And do we really need to? This kind of Utopia is not a category or a frame but a direction, a progress, a confluence of streams of consciousness and of unconsciousness, flowing into the river of life: not just a symbolic river but a real one too, the Liffey, the great Anna Livia Plurabelle herself. Or as Joyce put it, more succinctly (and more joyously), it is simply “Lff!”169

Abstract: It is in this sense that Utopia can be understood as
      lying before us—in both senses of this confounding double phrase. Utopia resides in the past (beforein this instance means “behind us”) inasmuch as any reconsideration of Utopia in the present must inevitably begin with the past. But if the sources of Utopia in the present reside in the past, realization is in the future (beforein this instance means “ahead of us”). It is this double valence that links the articles that make up this special issue. Some deal with historical figures, literature, or places, while others take up analogous considerations that are closer to us now. However, in each case, the future is what is at issue: What shape will it take? How might the circumstances of its emergence be as propitious as possible? These key questions suffuse all of the articles that follow and are of the greatest urgency to all disciplines but in particular for architecture and urbanism, which are burdened with providing the stage upon which we play out the drama of our lives, individually and collectively.<br>

Abstract: Liudmila Ulitskaia’s 2006 novel, Daniel’ Shtain, pervodchik (Daniel Stein, Translator), explores the experience of the Russian-speaking diaspora in the aftermath of World War II through a focus on Jewish immigrants in Israel who convert to Christianity. The novel’s treatment of the divisive topic of Jewish to Christian conversion is enabled by the author’s reliance on the theoretical and allegorical values of translation. Evoking advancements in twentieth-century translation studies through its broad treatment of translation and critique of the investment in the notion of fidelity to the original, be it language or identity, the novel advocates for the acceptance of the transformations and the resulting hybridity of the Jewish diasporic self. Daniel Stein, Translator specifically highlights the influence of the Soviet nationalities policies and the Nazi occupation of eastern Europe on the identity metamorphoses of Soviet Jews. By promoting the legitimacy of the expressions of Jewish identity by immigrants from the USSR through her novel, Ulitskaia proposes an expanded and anti-essentialist view of Jewish identity that would include individuals traditionally viewed as apostates.<br>
