  Author(s) Alison James<br>
  Abstract: This leads me to some remarks on the concept of law in Islam or law relative to Islam (see Lohlker 2011). If we think about law in an Islamic context we are often conflating two concepts: law, called

  Author(s) Hariman Robert<br>
  Abstract: Fear is a feature of human nature that political realists typically factor into their pessimistic view of international affairs. The world as it actually “is,” they assume, consists of nation-states inherently conflicted over competing interests and limited resources, arbitrating their differences and seeking security through the elusive agency of power. Humankind is motivated less by morality and law than by fear and greed, motives which must be managed through the intelligent application of power—not just military power, but economic and ideological might as well. Providing for national security and fulfilling national interests are constant aspirations and tenuous achievements in<br>

  Book Title: Executing Democracy-Volume One: Capital Punishment & the Making of America, 1683-1807<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hartnett Stephen John<br>
  Abstract: Executing Democracy: Capital Punishment & the Making of America, 1683-1807is the first volume of a rhetorical history of public debates about crime, violence, and capital punishment in America. This examination begins in 1683, when William Penn first struggled to govern the rowdy indentured servants of Philadelphia, and continues up until 1807, when the Federalists sought to impose law-and-order upon the New Republic.This volume offers a lively historical overview of how crime, violence, and capital punishment influenced the settling of the New World, the American Revolution, and the frantic post-war political scrambling to establish norms that would govern the new republic.By presenting a macro-historical overview, and by filling the arguments with voices from different political camps and communicative genres, Hartnett provides readers with fresh perspectives for understanding the centrality of public debates about capital punishment to the history of American democracy.<br>

  Author(s) WAITE GEOFF<br>
  Abstract: Richard Posner lists several reasons to think that morality and law are enterprises distinct from literature: the fact that the heinous actions of German lawyers and citizens in the 1930s and 1940s coexisted with Germany’s status as one of the most cultured nations of the world; the circumstance that one of the well-known abilities of many well-read people is to remain insensitive to the suffering of others; the fact that moral atrocities fill the literary canon without affecting either the aesthetic virtues of the work or its reader’s own moral attitudes; and, finally, the distance between the concerns of law<br>

  Abstract: Woman has been associated in a stereotypical way with both good and evil. As an “angel in the house,” woman has been credited with natural goodness, an innate allegiance to “a law of kindness.” But this same description extols her as infantile, weak, and mindless—a creature in constant need of male supervision and protection. Undertones of sadism run throughout Coventry Patmore’s hymn to the angel who is in reality a prisoner in the house she graces.¹ The alleged angel was an image that all Victorian women were supposed to internalize. Virginia Woolf described her struggle with the angel in<br>

  Abstract: A century ago, one of the most important modes of research in the professional study of Greco-Roman antiquity as well as in a number of other fields was a recently developed specialty called by its admirers (back then it had no opponents) ‘

By decomposing the compilatory handbooks produced by the erudition of late antiquity into their various sources and establishing the relations of dependence among them, the adepts of this method sought to trace back reports about a variety of aspects of the ancient world – primarily philosophy and history, but also religion, law, sculpture, and other matters –<br>

  Abstract: In August of 1997, I was actively second-guessing my decision to leave Vail, Colorado, to start the Master of Divinity program at Columbia Theological Seminary. My sister-in-law, Denise, a pastor in the Presbyterian Church (USA), trying to be encouraging, predicted that because I loved literature, I would surely love the Old Testament. Perhaps I was in a particularly skeptical mood, but her analogy struck me as untenable. It made as much sense as if she had said, “You love Colorado, and so surely you will love Georgia.” I couldn’t see the connection. I loved medieval tales of Arthur, Beowulf, eighteenth-century<br>

  Book Title: Questioning the Human: Toward a Theological Anthropology for the Twenty-First Century-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Van Stichel Ellen<br>
  Abstract: Theological anthropology is being put to the test: in the face of contemporary developments in the spheres of culture, politics, and science, traditional perspectives on the human person are no longer adequate. Yet can theological anthropology move beyond its previously established categories and renew itself in relation to contemporary insights? The present collection of essays sets out to answer this question. Uniting Roman Catholic theologians from across the globe, it tackles from a theological perspective challenges related to the classical natural law tradition (part 1), to the modern conception of the subject (part 2), and to the postmodern awareness of diversity in a globalizing context (part 3). Its contributors share a fundamental methodological choice of a critical-constructive dialogue with contemporary culture, science, and philosophy. This collection integrates a wider range of approaches than one usually finds in theological volumes, bringing together experts in systematic theology and in theological ethics. Authors come from different American contexts, including Black and Latino, and from a European context that include both French and German. Moreover, the interdisciplinary insights upon which the different contributions draw stem from both the natural sciences (such as neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and ethology) and the humanities (such as cultural studies, philosophy, and hermeneutics). This volume will be essential reading for anyone seeking a state-of-the-art account of theological anthropology, of the uncertainties it is facing, and of the responses it is in the process of formulating. The shared Roman Catholic background of the authors of this collection makes this volume a helpful complement to recent publications that predominantly represent views from other theological traditions.<br>

  Abstract: In our postmodern culture, which has developed, to an extent never before attained, an awareness of the historicity of human existence, the concepts of human nature and natural law, such as they are given in Catholic doctrine, seem to have lost all means of analyzing the present condition of humanity and are able to represent only the traits of an era that has today disappeared.

  Book Title: Crediting God: Sovereignty and Religion in the Age of Global Capitalism-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Vatter Miguel<br>
  Abstract: Tocqueville suggested that the people reign in the American political world like God over the universe.This intuition anticipates the crisis in the secularization paradigm that has brought theology back as a fundamental part of sociological and political analysis. It has become more difficult to believe that humanity's progress necessarily leads to atheism, or that it is possible to translate all that is good about religion into reasonable terms acceptable in principle by all, believers as well as nonbelievers. And yet, the spread of Enlightenment values, of an independent public sphere, and of alternative projects of modernitycontinues unabated and is by no means the antithesis of the renewed vigor of religious beliefs.The essays in this book shed interdisciplinary and multicultural light on a hypothesis that helps to account for such an unexpected convergence of enlightenment and religion in our times: Religion has reentered the public sphere because it puts into question the relation between God and the concept of political sovereignty.In the first part, Religion and Polity-Building,new perspectives are brought to bear on the tension-ridden connection between theophany and state-building from the perspective of world religions. Globalized, neo-liberal capitalism has been another crucial factor in loosening the bond between God and the state, as the essays in the second part, The End of the Saeculum and Global Capitalism,show.The essays in the third part, Questioning Sovereignty: Law and Justice,are dedicated to a critique of the premises of political theology, starting from the possibility of a prior, perhaps deeper relation between democracy and theocracy. The book concludes with three innovative essays dedicated to examining Tocqueville in order to think the Religion of Democracybeyond the idea of civil religion.<br>

  Abstract: What is the relation of theology to politics? Of revelation to revolution? To approach this question, I want to turn not to the constitution of the subject (Alain Badiou’s preoccupation) or to the constitution of the community (Paul’s preoccupation), because in the end these entities are not sufficient to achieve the robust political ends imagined for them. Instead, I want to turn to the question of justice (the preoccupation of the Hebrew Bible), for the infusion of this ethical concern is vital: political life must be lived under the horizon of justice.

  Book Title: Human Rights, Inc.: The World Novel, Narrative Form, and International Law-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SLAUGHTER JOSEPH R.<br>
  Abstract: In this timely study of the historical, ideological, and formal interdependencies of the novel and human rights, Joseph Slaughter demonstrates that the twentieth-century rise of world literatureand international human rights law are related phenomena. Slaughter argues that international law shares with the modern novel a particular conception of the human individual. The Bildungsroman, the novel of coming of age, fills out this image, offering a conceptual vocabulary, a humanist social vision, and a narrative grammar for what the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and early literary theorists both call the free and full development of the human personality. Revising our received understanding of the relationship between law and literature, Slaughter suggests that this narrative form has acted as a cultural surrogate for the weak executive authority of international law, naturalizing the assumptions and conditions that make human rights appear commonsensical. As a kind of novelistic correlative to human rights law, the Bildungsroman has thus been doing some of the sociocultural work of enforcement that the law cannot do for itself. This analysis of the cultural work of law and of the social work of literature challenges traditional Eurocentric histories of both international law and the dissemination of the novel. Taking his point of departure in Goethe's Wilhelm Meister, Slaughter focuses on recent postcolonial versions of the coming-of-age story to show how the promise of human rights becomes legible in narrative and how the novel and the law are complicit in contemporary projects of globalization: in colonialism, neoimperalism, humanitarianism, and the spread of multinational consumer capitalism.Slaughter raises important practical and ethical questions that we must confront in advocating for human rights and reading world literature-imperatives that, today more than ever, are intertwined.<br>

  Book Title: Terms of the Political: Community, Immunity, Biopolitics-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Campbell Timothy<br>
  Abstract: Terms of the Political: Community, Immunity, Biopolitics presents a decade of thought about the origins and possibilities of political theory from one of contemporary Italy's most prolific and engaging political theorists, Roberto Esposito. He has coined a number of critical concepts in current debates about the past, present, and future of biopolitics-from his work on the implications of the etymological and philosophical kinship of community (communitas) and immunity (immunitas) to his theorizations of the impolitical and the impersonal. Taking on interlocutors from throughout the Western philosophical tradition, from Aristotle and Augustine to Weil, Arendt, Nancy, Foucault, and Agamben, Esposito announces the eclipse of a modern political lexicon-"freedom," "democracy," "sovereignty," and "law"-that, in its attempt to protect human life, has so often produced its opposite (violence, melancholy, and death). Terms of the Political calls for the opening of political thought toward a resignification of these and other operative terms-such as "community," "immunity," "biopolitics," and "the impersonal"-in ways that affirm rather than negate life. An invaluable introduction to the breadth and rigor of Esposito's thought, the book will also welcome readers already familiar with Esposito's characteristic skill in overturning and breaking open the language of politics.<br>

                  cumwithmunus(ormunia). Such a derivation is important insofar as it designates precisely what holds the members of a community together. These members are not bound by just any relationship, but precisely by amunus—a “task,” “duty,” or “law.” According to the other meaning of the term (which is closer to the first than it might seem), they are bound by a “gift,” but a gift that is to<br>

  Book Title: Value and Values-Economics and Justice in an Age of Global Interdependence<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Hershock Peter D.<br>
  Abstract: Especially in the aftermath of what is now being called the Great Recession, awareness has mounted of the imperative to question the modern divorce of economics from ethics. While the domains of economics and ethics were from antiquity through at least the eighteenth century understood in many cultures to be coterminous and mutually entailing, the modern assumption has been that the goal of maximizing human prosperity and the aim of justly enhancing our lives as persons and as communities were functionally and practically distinct. Working from a wide array of perspectives, the contributors to this volume offer a set of challenges to the assumed independence of the quantitative and qualitative dimensions of human and planetary well-being. Reflecting on the complex interrelationship among economics, justice, and equity, the book resists "one size fits all" approaches and struggles to revitalize the marriage of economics and ethics by activating cultural differences as the basis of mutual contribution to shared human flourishing. The publication of this important collection will stimulate or extend critical debates among scholars and students working in a number of disciplines in the social sciences and humanities, including philosophy, history, environmental studies, economics, and law.<br>

  Abstract: The West can no longer be called the West on the basis of the movement through which it saw extended to the entire world the form of what might have appeared, up until recently, as its specific profile. This form contains both techno-science and the general determinations of democracy and law, as well as a certain type of discourse and modes of argument, accompanied by a certain type of representation—understood in a broad sense of the term (e.g., that of the cinema and the entirety of post-rock and post-pop music).

  Abstract: As a child, Francis Coppola often changed schools to keep pace with his father’s musical career. Growing up in various suburbs, he experienced ethnicity not as a way of life on the streets but as a way of relating within a middle-class family. Coppola the filmmaker constantly mirrors both this close-up familial vision of the self and anger towards the symbolic absent father. Although this conflicted familial vision might seem to negate the social values of John Ford and Frank Capra, Coppola does assert similar themes of family and home, law and decency and democracy in seemingly self-contradictory narratives: In<br>

An additional assumption about the guiding orientation or behaviour of these units then needs to be introduced to arrive at ways of conceptualising stable collectivities. In the discourses mentioned above, this assumption is basically one of rationality, with specific variations.

  Book Title: Critical White Studies-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stefancic Jean<br>
  Abstract: No longer content with accepting whiteness as the norm, critical scholars have turned their attention to whiteness itself. In
      Critical White Studies: Looking Behind the Mirror, numerous thinkers, including Toni Morrison, Eric Foner, Peggy McIntosh, Andrew Hacker, Ruth Frankenberg, John Howard Griffin, David Roediger, Kathleen Heal Cleaver, Noel Ignatiev, Cherrie Moraga, and Reginald Horsman, attack such questions as:*How was whiteness invented, and why?*How has the category whiteness changed over time?*Why did some immigrant groups, such as the Irish and Jews, start out as nonwhite and later became white?*Can some individual people be both white and nonwhite at different times, and what does it mean to "pass for white"?*At what point does pride in being white cross the line into white power or white supremacy?*What can whites concerned over racial inequity or white privilege do about it?Science and pseudoscience are presented side by side to demonstrate how our views on whiteness often reflect preconception, not fact. For example, most scientists hold that race is not a valid scientific category -- genetic differences between races are insignificant compared to those within them. Yet, the "one drop" rule, whereby those with any nonwhite heritage are classified as nonwhite, persists even today. As the bell curve controversy shows, race concepts die hard, especially when power and prestige lie behind them.A sweeping portrait of the emerging field of whiteness studies,Critical White Studiespresents, for the first time, the best work from sociology, law, history, cultural studies, and literature. Delgado and Stefancic expressly offer critical white studies as the next step in critical race theory. In focusing on whiteness, not only do they ask nonwhites to investigate more closely for what it means for others to be white, but also they invite whites to examine themselves more searchingly and to "look behind the mirror."<br>

Thomas insists that our received notions of rights and duties in law are rife with racial implications. This is particularly the case given the highly charged racial context within which notions of rights and duties were developed, who they were meant to exclude, and our societal struggle to make the law “color-blind.” In this context, abstract notions of citizen, government, rights, and duties do not begin to account for the relationship between people<br>

  Book Title: Religion: Beyond a Concept-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): de VRIES HENT<br>
  Abstract: What do we talk about when we talk about religion? Is it an array of empirical facts about historical human civilizations? Or is religion what is in essence unpredictable-perhaps the very emergence of the new? In what ways are the legacies of religion-its powers, words, things, and gestures-reconfiguring themselves as the elementary forms of life in the twenty-first century?Given the Latin roots of the word religion and its historical Christian uses, what sense, if any, does it make to talk about religionin other traditions? Where might we look for common elements that would enable us to do so? Has religion as an overarching concept lost all its currency, or does it ineluctably return-sometimes in unexpected ways-the moment we attempt to do without it? This book explores the difficulties and double binds that arise when we ask What is religion? Offering a marvelously rich and diverse array of perspectives, it begins the task of rethinking religionand religious studiesin a contemporary world. Opening essays on the question What is religion?are followed by clusters exploring the relationships among religion, theology, and philosophy and the links between religion, politics, and law. Pedagogy is the focus of the following section. Religion is then examined in particular contexts, from classical times to the present Pentacostal revival, leading into an especially rich set of essays on religion, materiality, and mediatization. The final section grapples with the ever-changing forms that religionis taking, such as spirituality movements and responses to the ecological crisis.Featuring the work of leading scholars from a wide array of disciplines, traditions, and cultures, Religion: Beyond a Concept will help set the agenda for religious studies for years to come.

  Author(s) Carlson Thomas A.<br>
  Abstract: I have no interest in answering the question of my title. For most people the obvious answer would be “no.” For Stanley Fish, among others, the answer is “yes.” Dissatisfied with the terms on both sides, I wish to analyze the question itself and the conditions under which it has come to seem meaningful. The point is not to single out Fish, since his basic claim is one that has wide currency, especially in conservative legal circles and among Christian critics of secular law, from Michael McConell and Stephen Carter to Stanley Hauerwas. Nor is it to defend liberal secularism.<br>

  Abstract: It is no easy task to determine the proper place of the “political” within the writings of Paul de Man. The difficulties inherent in the question stem not so much from the absence of references to history and politics in his writing—on the contrary; it is a rare text by de Man that does not mention law, politics, economics, social unrest, war, or revolution. The problem arises instead from the way such references can become intelligible only in the context of analyses that are themselves not in the first place either historical or political.

  Abstract: The French Reformed lay theologian Jacques Ellul is probably better known for his original and insightful work in social analysis and critique rather than in theology, and yet his wrestling with issues of hell and universal salvation offer some original insights for contemporary theology.

  Author(s) Berthrong John<br>
  Abstract: Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) saw morality in light of human reason. Practical reason itself becomes the criteria for right and wrong, stimulating moral action. Practical reason enables the human being to grasp innate moral law. The moral law is deontological in the sense that moral action has little to do with the consequences. For Kant, the categorical imperative is grounded solely in the notion of duty. There is one domain of value, the domain of moral value which is immune to human fragility and vulnerability. The very notion of a moral precept, for instance “Don’t kill”, can never conflict with<br>

During the long years of their separation, he made no effort to retrieve her from Saul’s sphere but found time to meet with Jonathan more than once.

When Luther encounters a postmodern context, he can best be understood by challenging and transcending him. His doctrine of justification, theology of the cross, Trinity, law and gospel, eucharistic theology, and two kingdoms theory among others are seen at the point of the death, resurrection and reconciliation of the crucified Christ, the scope and reach of which is of inclusive, universal character allowing and tolerating other ways.

  Publisher: University Press of Kansas<br>
  Author(s): Levinson Sanford<br>
  Abstract: The first paperback edition of a classic of American constitutional theory. The book is divided into two parts. In Part I Professor Tushnet appraises the five major competing "grand theories" of constitutional law and interpretation, and, argues that none of them satisfy their own requirements for coherence and judicial constraint. In Part II the author offers a descriptive sociology of constitutional doctrine and raises critical questions as to whether a grand theory is necessary, is it possible to construct a coherent, useful grand theory, and is construction of an uncontroversial grand theory possible?Professor Tushnet's new Afterword is organized in parallel fashion to the original text. Part I offers a new survey of the contemporary terrain of constitutional interpretation. Part II provides an extended discussion of the most prominent of contemporary efforts to provide an external analysis of constitutional law, the idea of regime politics. This includes discussion of major court decisions, including

  Abstract: This cranky academic discussion has two aims.

To teach the reality of social class as both a literary trope and a socio-political category, in other words, raises issues concerning, not solely pedagogy or social hierarchy, but personal agency, identity politics, and subject formation.

  Abstract: Among recent thinkers who affirm Christianity as absolute, discussion of its relation to other religions revolves—and often not too amicably—around the polarity between an “optimistic and broad” inclusivism and a “negative and strict” exclusivism.¹ These approaches are not altogether new. They retrieve and develop three models that have emerged in the tradition of Christian reflection. Inclusivism draws on two models. The first, notable in Thomas, sees non-Christian religions as useful preparations for the Gospel (

Second, legislatures used statutes to streamline credit markets, market transactions, and the formation of corporations. For the last several decades, scholars have often invoked Morton J.

  Book Title: Hermeneutics Ancient and Modern-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRUNS GERALD L.<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging meditation on the nature and purpose of hermeneutics, Gerald L. Bruns argues that hermeneutics is not merely a contemporary theory but an extended family of questions about understanding and interpretation that have multiple and conflicting histories going back to before the beginning of writing.What does it mean to understand a riddle, an action, a concept, a law, an alien culture, or oneself? Bruns expands our sense of the horizons of hermeneutics by situating its basic questions against a background of different cultural traditions and philosophical topics. He discusses, for example, the interpretation of oracles, the silencing of the muses and the writing of history, the quarrel between philosophy and poetry, the canonization of sacred texts, the nature of allegorical exegesis, rabbinical midrash, the mystical exegesis of the Qur'an, the rise of literalism and the individual interpreter, and the nature of Romantic hermeneutics. Dealing with thinkers ranging from Socrates to Luther to Wordsworth to Ricoeur, Bruns also ponders several basic dilemmas about the nature of hermeneutical experience, the meaning of tradition, the hermeneutical function of narrative, and the conflict between truth and freedom in philosophy and literature. His eloquent book demonstrates the continuing power of hermeneutical thinking to open up questions about the world and our place in it.<br>

  Book Title: Indebted-Capitalism and Religion in the Writings of S. Y. Agnon<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Sagiv Yonatan<br>
  Abstract: This is the first book to examine the oeuvre of Shmuel Yosef Agnon, 1966 Nobel laureate in literature, through a reading that combines perspectives from economic theory, semiotics, psychoanalysis, narrative theory, and Jewish and religious studies. Sagiv outlines the vital role economy plays in the construction of religion, subjectivity, language, and thought in Agnon's work, and, accordingly, explores his literary use of images of debt, money, and economy to examine how these themes illuminate other focal points in the canonical author's work, excavating the economic infrastructure of discourses that are commonly considered to reside beyond the economic sphere.Sagiv's analysis of Agnon's work, renowned for its paradoxical articulation of the impact of modernity on traditional Jewish society, exposes an overarching distrust regarding the sustainability of any economic structure. The concrete and symbolic economies surveyed in this project are prone to cyclical crises. Under what Sagiv terms Agnon's "law of permanent debt," the stability and profitability of economies are always temporary. Agnon's literary economy, transgressing traditional closures, together with his profound irony, make it impossible to determine if these economic crises are indeed the product of the break with tradition or, alternatively, if this theodicy is but a fantasy, marking permanent debt as the inherent economic infrastructure of human existence.<br>

However, even the official doctrine of a Church does not escape the law of historical concretization, according to which all dogma particularizes what it tries to establish by restricting its validity to detennined epochs and milieus.

In what follows, we shall first examine the use of Old Testament theological motifs, metaphors, imageries, allusions, festivals, and structural frameworks in John’s Gospel. We shall then explore the use and interpretation of direct and indirect Old Testament citations as well as references to the law in the gospel. An investigation of the understanding of the words as well as commandments of Jesus in the gospel will follow.<br>

  Abstract: In 2005, the French government chose 10 May as the annual date for its national day for remembering the slave trade, slavery and their abolitions. The creation of this official day of remembrance fulfilled one of the criteria set out in the so-called Taubira law (2001), which sought to inscribe the slave trade, slavery and their abolitions into national memory. Since the 1983 decree under François Mitterrand, each of France’s overseas departments and former slave colonies has had its own official commemorative date to celebrate abolition.

  Abstract: Pluralism and human rights are epochal challenges now, and they challenge established modes of discourse and practice including our conceptions of the normative. both of these face challenges of multi-dimensional transformations in self and society. A key challenge here is to broaden our conceptions and realizations of law and rights. In his critical reflection on law and society in India, Andre Béteille writes, “individual rights do not have the same depth and firmness in india, the same anchorage in its social structure, than they do in the United States” (1997, 198).

  Abstract: In the nineteenth century Jamal al-Din al-Afghani (1838/39–1897), Muhammad ‘Abduh (1849–1905) and Rashid Rida (1865–1935), who are today considered the founders of Islamic reform, were already urging an inner reform of Islam. Underlying their efforts was a sense of subordination to the West. For all three, the backwardness of the Islamic world had been caused, and exclusively so, by a fixed, inflexible understanding of Islam and the blind imitation of its forefathers. For this reason they demanded a modern interpretation of the Qur’an and of Islamic law that would be appropriate for the altered circumstances. This effort,<br>

  Book Title: Supper at Emmaus-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): OLSEN GLENN W.<br>
  Abstract: Supper at Emmaus traces various important intellectual topics from the ancient world to the modern period. Generally, as in its treatment of the question of whether the long-standing contrast between cyclical and linear views of history is helpful, it introduces important thinkers who have considered the question. A preoccupation of the book is the appearance and reappearance across the centuries of patterns used to organize temporal and cultural experience. After an opening essay on transcendental truth and cultural relativism, the second chapter traces a distinction, common in historical writings during the past two centuries, between an alleged ancient classical "cyclic" view of time and history, used to describe the claimed repetitiveness of and similarities between historical events ("nothing is new under the sun"), and a contrasting Jewish-Christian linear view, sometimes described as providential in that it moves through a series of unique events to some end intended by God. In the latter, history is "about something," the education of the human race or the redemption of humankind. As in each of the remaining essays, the book then attempts to draw out the limitations of what the current consensus on this topic has become. It does this for such things as our current understanding of religious toleration, humanism, natural law, and teleology. Some of the essays, such as those on debate about Augustine's understanding of marriage or the concluding illustrated essay on the baroque city of Lecce, are published for the first time. Others are based on previously published contributions to the scholarly literature, though generally each of these chapters concludes with a postscript that engages with current scholarly debate on the subject.<br>

  Abstract: The prospects of natural-law thinking can seem dim indeed, in spite of some recent able defenses.¹ Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, it is incumbent upon contemporary Catholic intellectuals to make their contribution to the modest revival of the natural law tradition such defenses represent. It seems to me that, in order to be fruitful, this contribution must avoid two extremes. On the one hand, it should not simply return to the older manual tradition of construing natural law, lest it underwrite a new dualism between nature and grace.² On the other hand, granting that the newer, very striking,<br>

  Abstract: “Secularism” is a philosophy that holds that the affairs and organization of society should be arranged according to principles and rules derived from experience and human insight without reference to customs, revelations, or sacred books whose authority is derived from God or the gods or ancestors. It is distinct from the process of “secularization” whereby the state, professions such as medicine and law, and academic fields such as archeology gradually take over areas of human life once governed by religion and the church. Both words derive from the Latin word

  Book Title: The Intimate. Polity and the Catholic Church-Laws about Life, Death and the Family in So-called Catholic Countries<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): PÉREZ-AGOTE ALFONSO<br>
  Abstract: The waning influence of the Catholic church in the ethical and political debate. For centuries the Catholic Church was able to impose her ethical rules in matters related to the intimate, that is, questions concerning life (from its beginning until its end) and the family, in the so-called Catholic countries in Western Europe. When the polity started to introduce legislation that was in opposition to the Catholic ethic, the ecclesiastical authorities and part of the population reacted. The media reported massive manifestations in France against same-sex marriages and in Spain against the de-penalization of abortion. In Italy the Episcopal conference entered the political field in opposition to the relaxation of several restrictive legal rules concerning medically assisted procreation and exhorted the voters to abstain from voting so that the referendum did not obtain the necessary quorum. In Portugal, to the contrary, the Church made a “pact" with the prime minister so that the law on same-sex marriages did not include the possibility of adoption. And in Belgium the Episcopal conference limited its actions to clearly expressing with religious, legal, and anthropological arguments its opposition to such laws, which all other Episcopal conferences did also. In this book, the authors analyse the full spectrum of the issue, including the emergence of such laws; the political discussions; the standpoints defended in the media by professionals, ethicists, and politicians; the votes in the parliaments; the political interventions of the Episcopal conferences; and the attitude of professionals. As a result the reader understands what was at stake and the differences in actions of the various Episcopal conferences. The authors also analyse the pro and con evaluations among the civil population of such actions by the Church. Finally, in a comparative synthesis, they discuss the public positions taken by Pope Francis to evaluate if a change in Church policy might be possible i~<br>

  Abstract: In the ethical domain, Belgium has been one of the first Western European countries to introduce new legislation clashing head on with the prescriptions of the Catholic Church in these matters. In 1990, a law was passed de-penalizing abortion, in 2002 a law authorizing euthanasia and, in 2003, one legalizing samesex marriages. Although the law authorizing euthanasia, under different restrictive conditions, had existed for more than ten years, we nevertheless selected this theme to illustrate the topicality of the ethical problems since euthanasia came very definitely to the fore again recently as a result of two distinct events which stimulated<br>

This, of course, is particularly true in the United States, where the founding fathers transformed those ideas into an unsurpassed system of balanced government. Remarkably enough, at the center of these ideas stands the age-old concept of natural law.

  Book Title: Freedom and Time-A Theory of Constitutional Self-Government<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): RUBENFELD JED<br>
  Abstract: Should we try to "live in the present"? Such is the imperative of modernity, Jed Rubenfeld writes in this important and original work of political theory. Since Jefferson proclaimed that "the earth belongs to the living"-since Freud announced that mental health requires people to "get free of their past"-since Nietzsche declared that the happy man is the man who "leaps" into "the moment-modernity has directed its inhabitants to live in the present, as if there alone could they find happiness, authenticity, and above all freedom.But this imperative, Rubenfeld argues, rests on a profoundly inadequate, deforming picture of the relationship between freedom and time. Instead, Rubenfeld suggests, human freedom-human being itself--necessarily extends into both past and future; self-government consists of giving our lives meaning and purpose over time. From this conception of self-government, Rubenfeld derives a new theory of constitutional law's place in democracy. Democracy, he writes, is not a matter of governance by the present "will of the people"; it is a matter of a nation's laying down and living up to enduring political and legal commitments. Constitutionalism is not counter to democracy, as many believe, or a pre-condition of democracy; it is or should be democracy itself--over time. On this basis, Rubenfeld offers a new understanding of constitutional interpretation and of the fundamental right of privacy.<br>

  Abstract: In the introduction, I analyzed in what sense the invention of a concept of “crimes against humanity” in international law may be interpreted as a sign of moral progress, a sign of history (
                  Geschichtszeichen) in the Kantian sense. By virtue of this concept, the international community recognizes—at least in principle—a crime whose seriousness is such that it remains universally and eternally open to prosecution. In this chapter, I shall analyze in what senses the concept of “crimes against humanity” remains, despite this moral advance, bound to a humanist metaphysics whose limits today more than ever need to be<br>

  Abstract: It is often interesting to free-associate about the titles chosen for conferences. My free association about the title of this conference – “Architecture, Ethics and Technology: An Interdisciplinary Symposium” – led me to wonder whether ethics was perhaps the ham in the sandwich, squeezed perfectly flat by architecture, on the one side, and technology, on the other.

  Book Title: Shattered Voices-Language, Violence, and the Work of Truth Commissions<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Phelps Teresa Godwin<br>
  Abstract: Following periods of mass atrocity and oppression, states are faced with a question of critical importance in the transition to democracy: how to offer redress to victims of the old regime without perpetuating cycles of revenge. Traditionally, balance has been restored through arrests, trials, and punishment, but in the last three decades, more than twenty countries have opted to have a truth commission investigate the crimes of the prior regime and publish a report about the investigation, often incorporating accounts from victims. Although many praise the work of truth commissions for empowering and healing through words rather than violence, some condemn the practice as a poor substitute for traditional justice, achieved through trials and punishment. There has been until now little analysis of the unarticulated claim that underlies the truth commissions' very existence: that language-in this case narrative stories-can substitute for violence. Acknowledging revenge as a real and deep human need,
      Shattered Voicesexplores the benefits and problems inherent when a fragile country seeks to heal its victims without risking its own future. In developing a theory about the role of language in retribution, Teresa Godwin Phelps takes an interdisciplinary approach, delving into sources from Greek tragedy toHamlet, from Kant to contemporary theories about retribution, from the Babylonian law codes to the South African Truth and Reconciliation Report. She argues that, given the historical and psychological evidence about revenge, starting afresh by drawing a bright line between past crimes and a new government is both unrealistic and unwise. When grievous harm happens, a rebalancing is bound to occur, whether it is orderly and lawful or disorderly and unlawful.Shattered Voicescontends that language is requisite to any adequate balancing, and that a solution is viable only if it provides an atmosphere in which storytelling and subsequent dialogue can flourish.

  Book Title: The Children's Table-Childhood Studies and the Humanities<br>
  Publisher: University of Georgia Press<br>
  Author(s): DUANE ANNA MAE<br>
  Abstract: Like the occupants of the children's table at a family dinner, scholars working in childhood studies can seem sidelined from the "adult" labor of humanities scholarship. The Children's Table brings together scholars from architecture, philosophy, law, and literary and cultural criticism to provide an overview of the innovative work being done in childhood studies-a transcript of what is being said at the children's table. Together, these scholars argue for rethinking the academic seating arrangement in a way that acknowledges the centrality of childhood to the work of the humanities. The figure we now recognize as a child was created in tandem with forms of modernity that the Enlightenment generated and that the humanities are now working to rethink. Thus the growth of childhood studies allows for new approaches to some of the most important and provocative issues in humanities scholarship: the viability of the social contract, the definition of agency, the performance of identity, and the construction of gender, sexuality, and race. Because defining childhood is a means of defining and distributing power and obligation, studying childhood requires a radically altered approach to what constitutes knowledge about the human subject. The diverse essays in The Children's Table share a unifying premise: to include the child in any field of study realigns the shape of that field, changing the terms of inquiry and forcing a different set of questions. Taken as a whole, the essays argue that, at this key moment in the state of the humanities, rethinking the child is both necessary and revolutionary.

  Abstract: Under the provisions of section 14(h)(1) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) of 1971 (Public Law 92-203), the secretary of the interior was authorized to withdraw eligible lands as Native historical places and cemetery sites. Most Alaska Native regional corporations established under the act filed applications for the properties, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs created an office in 1978 to investigate these sites.¹<br>

  Abstract: This chapter focuses on the ethical responsibilities of the computing profession. Governance should be based on ethics and be imposed by authority. The ethical aspects of digital technology should, therefore, be understood before its governance can be expected to be effective. Also, to be respected, governance of the industry should be administered by a knowledgeable authority; that is, by a professional body encompassing the entirety of digital technology. This technology has been developed and exploited in a quagmire of commercialism and hyperbole in which intellectual property law and market dominance determine the direction of development much more than the nature<br>

  Abstract: On June 22, 2002, a Pakistani woman from the Punjab, Mukhtaran (or Mukhtar) Bibi, was gang-raped. The deed was the result of a conflict between her family and another family in her village, belonging to the Mastoi clan. The Mastoi accused Mukhtaran’s twelve-year-old brother of assaulting a woman of their clan (in fact, it seems he had been seen talking to the woman in a field). The boy was therefore kept under lock and key by the Mastoi. In such cases, of conflict between families, Pakistani villagers often have recourse to a local tribal law council, a Panchayat.

  Abstract: HERMENEUTIC PHILOSOPHIES and traditions have existed for centuries, flourishing especially in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in Germany and other parts of continental Europe. They were concerned originally with understanding the Bible and other sacred texts, and with the interpretation of Roman law, which ruled parts of the Continent as late as the nineteenth century. But by extension all sorts of other texts could be subjected to hermeneutic techniques: the works of Plato and Aristotle, commentaries on the Bible and the Talmud, poetry and drama, myths and legends.<br>

  Book Title: Varieties of World Making-Beyond Globalization<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): WAGNER PETER<br>
  Abstract: Globalization has been the topic of heated debate in recent years, with one side asserting that it will produce a better standard of living for people around the world, and a fierce opposition arguing that it will ultimately lead to greater poverty and the destruction of unique human cultures. Varieties of World Making tackles the issue from a different angle, proposing that the contemporary global network of business, politics and culture be viewed from the inter-disciplinary perspective of ‘world making’. Drawn from the ranks of sociology, law, international relations, political philosophy and history, the distinguished contributors cut through polarized rhetoric to examine the current global situation. Their proposed diagnoses draw upon thoughtful analyses of various political dilemmas whose ripple effects are felt around the world, such as the volatile relationship between Islam and Europe, or the legal foundations for a true international order absent in the shadows of imperialism. Varieties of World Making will be an essential resource for all those grappling with the complex consequences of globalization for the future.<br>

  Abstract: That nations dwell in eternal anarchy has been one of the defining assumptions that have shaped the socialization of several generations of students of international relations. While political struggle inside the state takes place in the shadow of the law (conceived as the sovereign’s command), this mediation was thought to be absent in the international arena. However, the demise of the Soviet Union and the increase in the volume, scope and speed of transnational interactions challenged this traditional assumption of anarchy and non-co-operation.

  Abstract: It is fair to say, after our examination, that corruption is a troubled concept in law. The traditional understandings of corruption, used in law—corruption as the breach of duty, corruption as the quid pro quo transaction, corruption as illegality or inequality, and so on—capture parts of this idea, but not all. Animating these technical and rational understandings in spirit and practice is another, quite incommensurable concept. Corruption, under this deeper (and popular) understanding, is a raw moral idea. It invokes ideas of ʺdepravityʺ and ʺevil,ʺ human frailty and temptation. It is the capture of individuals and political systems<br>

And yet mutual accommodation between Australian Aboriginal and Western institutions and practices is possible. Globalised commitments to Indigenous people’s rights and the flexibility of institutions—when they are committed to fairness—help generate mutual accommodations across difference.

  Book Title: Religion after Religion-Gershom Scholem, Mircea Eliade, and Henry Corbin at Eranos<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wasserstrom Steven M.<br>
  Abstract: By the end of World War II, religion appeared to be on the decline throughout the United States and Europe. Recent world events had cast doubt on the relevance of religious belief, and modernizing trends made religious rituals look out of place. It was in this atmosphere that the careers of Scholem, Eliade, and Corbin--the twentieth century's legendary scholars in the respective fields of Judaism, History of Religions, and Islam--converged and ultimately revolutionized how people thought about religion. Between 1949 and 1978, all three lectured to Carl Jung's famous Eranos circle in Ascona, Switzerland, where each in his own way came to identify the symbolism of mystical experience as a central element of his monotheistic tradition. In this, the first book ever to compare the paths taken by these thinkers, Steven Wasserstrom explores how they overturned traditional approaches to studying religion by de-emphasizing law, ritual, and social history and by extolling the role of myth and mysticism. The most controversial aspect of their theory of religion, Wasserstrom argues, is that it minimized the binding character of moral law associated with monotheism.<br>

  Abstract: Anyone who has sat on a jury or followed a high-profile trial on television usually comes to the realization that a trial, particularly a criminal trial, is really a performance. Verdicts seem determined as much by which lawyer can best connect with the hearts and minds of the jurors as by what the evidence might suggest. In this celebration of the American trial as a great cultural achievement, Robert Burns, a trial lawyer and a trained philosopher, explores how these legal proceedings bring about justice. The trial, he reminds us, is not confined to the impartial application of legal rules to factual findings. Burns depicts the trial as an institution employing its own language and styles of performance that elevate the understanding of decision-makers, bringing them in contact with moral sources beyond the limits of law.<br>

  Book Title: Christian Political Ethics-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Coleman John A.<br>
  Abstract: Christian Political Ethicsbrings together leading Christian scholars of diverse theological and ethical perspectives--Catholic, Lutheran, Calvinist, and Anabaptist--to address fundamental questions of state and civil society, international law and relations, the role of the nation, and issues of violence and its containment. Representing a unique fusion of faith-centered ethics and social science, the contributors bring into dialogue their own varying Christian understandings with a range of both secular ethical thought and other religious viewpoints from Judaism, Islam, and Confucianism. They explore divergent Christian views of state and society--and the limits of each. They grapple with the tensions that can arise within Christianity over questions of patriotism, civic duty, and loyalty to one's nation, and they examine Christian responses to pluralism and relativism, globalization, and war and peace. Revealing the striking pluralism inherent to Christianity itself, this pioneering volume recasts the meanings of Christian citizenship and civic responsibility, and raises compelling new questions about civil disobedience, global justice, and Christian justifications for waging war as well as spreading world peace.

  Abstract: I am in substantial agreement with the analysis in John Finnisʹs chapter. Indeed, it is as good a short statement of just war theory within the Catholic natural law tradition as I know of. Given this, I think the most useful contributions I can make are to underline certain points that seem to me to be important, to develop some of the distinctions Finnis makes, and to draw out some of the implications of his analysis. I will also say something more than Finnis does about conscientious objection and the duty of citizens to support their nationʹs war efforts.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7t8mt">Politics and the Imagination</a><br>
  Abstract: Since the very idea that there could be a “metaphysics” of “right” is by no means self-evident, what would motivate someone to think it was possible, advisable, or necessary to develop such a thing? One suggestion is the following: We notice that conceptions of “right” change dramatically from one society and era to another. Thus Roman law was based on a distinction between free persons and slaves. Slaves were considered to be “in the power” of their owners: they had no legal personality at all (
                  nullum caput habent), and could be killed by their masters with impunity. The way this<br>

  Abstract: Jane addams’s decision to become a volunteer also forced her to become an advocate of social justice. The girl from rural Illinois moved to Chicago with the hope of helping disadvantaged individuals. She quickly discovered that caring for individuals could go only so far. To improve the conditions of poor people in Chicago would take the help of city hall and eventually even the federal government. With the help of labor unions and social-reform organizations, she was able to institute juvenile-court laws, the first “mother’s pension” law, tenement-house regulations, an eight-hour workday law for women, factory-inspection laws, and workers’ compensation.<br>

  Abstract: To the extent that my book is an “introduction,” it is inconclusive. It is a series — not exhaustive — of explorations, of questions, of tryings. And, as I said in my introductory chapter, part of its tentativeness lies in its use of many idioms, or languages. Perhaps what ties it together, ultimately, is the broad theme that language is important to law, and that thinking about legal language from various perspectives might give us greater insight into that universe of discourse that is the law.<br>

  Abstract: Are the resources of premodern thought adequate to modernity? George Kateb argues that to understand the scale of modern horrors we must come to grips with the human imagination—specifically, the tremendous new capacity of the imagination of one or a few people to unleash itself on the world. Leaders construct society or law afresh in their minds with an energy that Kateb calls “hyperactive”; they go on to sway their followers to make the stuff of their imaginations real. In cases when change leads to atrocity, imagination is once again responsible—this time, the stunted imaginations of the followers,<br>

  Abstract: Institutionally, in the standard academic table of organization, the university catalogue—the knowledge tree of contemporary western culture—the humanities are the subjects regularly listed under that heading: literature, philosophy, art history, music, religion, languages, and sometimes history. This branch of knowledge is separated from the branch of the social sciences and from the branch of the biological and physical sciences. These three branches together form the arts and sciences, or the liberal arts, as they are sometimes known, which are as a group separated in turn from the professional disciplines—such as medicine, education, business, and law—which, at<br>

  Abstract: The sentence, “I am you,” had a positive content, made up of what was understood: propositions drawn from sacramental theology, metaphysics, and epistemology. These propositions converged into two broad paradigms, corresponding with flesh and spirit, that provided ways to explain how many became one, but they were by no means self-evident. The grounds of their validity went beyond logical, and even empirical, proof. They extended to yet more general doctrines that defied the law of contradictions and, indeed, that prescribed negation and the coincidence of opposites.<br>

                  Introduction to Islamic Theology and Law. Rather, the “doctor maximus” of turn-of-the-century Islamic Studies observed merely that on “examining the legal documents, we find that the Shi‛i legal position towards other faiths is much harsher and stiffer than that taken by Sunni Muslims.” The pages following that observation then enumerate the precise horrors of Shi‛ite purity laws. S. D. Goitein, Goldziher’s successor as master Orientalist in the realm of Judeo-Arabica, also neglected the possibility of Judeo-Shi‛ite symbiosis. Thus, after his memorable firsthand account of<br>

  Abstract: Constitutional democracy with its veneration of the rule of law and the condition of equality seems, as it enters the last decade of the twentieth century, to be more sharply defined than ever before as the regime which best satisfies the human quest for freedom and dignity. As the ideological conflict of this tumultuous century abates, and parousiastic regimes¹ retreat, teeter and collapse, history offers the astonishing prospect of an underlying democratic movement taking the form of a constitutional dialectic. This dialectic in its present mature stage is a conversation, conducted by legislatures, courts and citizens, about the fundamental questions<br>

Assuming Canada’s overriding mythology to be pastoral, Frye found it an easy step to emphasize that Canada, unlike the United States with its history of revolution and technological productivity, is<br>

Cassin was a law professor at the University of Paris who brought to the cause a rich experience of public service in Geneva as well as France. His arrival and the warm welcome he received from de Gaulle established the general’s indifference to the religious or ethnic background of would-be recruits and his clear willingness to override the evident anti-Semitism in his military entourage.

Since it was determined from the outset that overseas polities would not be brought into the German federation as member states, the German constitution provided no model for the incorporation of colonial territories and German citizenship law was equally useless for defining the status of Germany’s new subjects.

  Abstract: The last decades of the twentieth century witnessed a “renaissance of rhetoric” (cf.

The idea that cultures are rhetorically constituted is, of course, not new, and there have been various earlier attempts to address the subject—for example, Plato, Nietzsche, Burke, Heidegger, Gadamer, and others. But I think that there still is much to gain by rethinking this time-honored topic, and in this paper I will explore the possibility of a more<br>

  Book Title: Beyond Federal Dogmatics (pdf)-The Influence of EU Law on Belgian Constitutional Case Law Regarding Federalism<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): Feyen Stef<br>
  Abstract: The relationship between EU law and national constitutional law, including constitutional law in federalism matters, has been subject to an ongoing scholarly debate. This monograph contributes to this debate in two ways. The author argues for an approach to constitutional law that goes beyond the classic - coined dogmatic - understanding of constitutional case law regarding federalism as expounded in Belgian academia. Building on that basis, he sets out to rethink the framework within which the connection between EU law and national constitutional law can be understood. The analysis delves into the relationship (and sometimes tension) between ‘rule-of-law' values (which may serve as checks upon instrumental forms of reasoning) and the toolbox deployed in constitutional court case law to accommodate several rather pragmatic needs.<br>

  Abstract: The Belgian Constitutional Court holds an ambiguous position towards European law. Whereas, generally, it has recognized its power to review the conformity of a legislative act approving a treaty with the Constitution, it also deploys these treaties, and more broadly European law as enshrined in treaties and other instruments, to decide upon the constitutionality of other laws. Especially in reviews that rely upon the constitutional principle of non-discrimination, European law can play an important role, providing content to that principle.<br>

  Book Title: Islam & Europe-Crises are Challenges<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): SHAH Prakash<br>
  Abstract: Within the framework of the Forum A. & A Leysen, several experts from in and outside the Muslim world contributed to this book. In Islam and Europe: Crises Are Challenges they discuss how dialogues between Islam and the West, with a focus on Europe, can be achieved. The various authors (legal scholars, political theorists, social scientists, and psychologists) explore in these collected essays such interrelated questions as: How much diversity is permissible within a liberal pluralistic democratic society? How strong are the implications of citizenship? What are equitable accommodations of contested practices? They argue for an adequate understanding of how Western Muslim communities in Europe experience their minority position and what needs to be done to improve their participation in European society. The second part of this volume is a collection of papers written around the work of Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na'im, who also makes his own contribution to the book. The Catholic University of Leuven awarded An-Na'im an honorary doctorate in 2009 on the theme of multiculturalism, intercultural relations and diversity. An-Na'im is recognized the world over as a leading expert in the area of religion and law, and as a human rights activist. Islam and Europe: Crises Are Challenges reinforces our sense that a better knowledge and awareness of the growing diversity of our society, and striving for harmonious relations between Islam and the West, are among the most important challenges of our time.

  Author(s) LADD JOHN<br>
  Abstract: Natural law is one of the chief ideas that religious ethics, political philosophy, and jurisprudence share. In this chapter, I will suggest an interpretation of natural law that situates it within these three fields. In particular, I will make use of some perspectives from religious studies, with a view toward deepening our understanding of natural law as a specifically
                     naturalisttheory. For natural law, as I understand it, is a human-naturenaturalist theory of basic juridical concepts such as justice, rights, and law itself.<br>

  Abstract: Academic trends in legal scholarship do not occur in a vacuum, nor are law schools and legal scholars autonomous. To understand what has been going on in contemporary legal theory, one must look to what has been going on at the university. American university campuses have recently witnessed a form of organized dissent not seen since the turbulent 1960s and 1970s. Commentators report that “[a] n intellectual and cultural revolution is now under way at American Universities.”¹ The revolution has been stirred in part by cultural changes unfolding in American society brought about by the

The rise in numbers of divorces which others responded to with a kind of moral panic Stanton saw as wholly encouraging: a sign of the “new woman’s” higher aspirations for personal liberty and individual choice. Divorce law reform was once again a live political issue in the 1890s.

  Abstract: FEMINIST AND MULTICULTURAL texts inscribe the discussion of feminist and indigenous rights into an old and already occupied hermeneutical place. They write over the already-written script of public sphere and civil society, and by so doing feminism, at least, steps into the terrain of the prophetic. Richard Rorty’s reading of Catherine MacKinnon’s work illustrates this shift in the feminist text, which holds true for the indigenous text as well. MacKinnon states that “unless women [read also indigenous groups] fit into the logical space prepared for them by current linguistic and other practices, the law doesn’t know how to deal with<br>

The massive amount of literature that has recently appeared on the supposed waning of courtesy shows how much we have come to value democratic civility as a sign of civilized pro-social behaviour. Yet nostalgia for a supposedly more civil era distracts us from realizing that in a different time and place the outright disrespect, hatred, and exclusion of the ‘other’ was considered normal and vital for survival.

  Abstract: This chapter begins with an outline of its central arguments as well as the concluding claims of the book as a whole. As covered in Chapter 4, applications of Levinas to law typically ask us to imagine law as a responsive site for the ethical encounter – whether in its institutions, its procedures, or reflected in its substance. This rests on a typically unstated but nevertheless unavoidable premise, that law operates as the servant of human will. This largely reflects how Levinas understood law himself, as being the necessary framework in which we do the hard work of creating social<br>

The state of nature, in which sovereign states still find themselves, is reinforced by predatory doctrines of pre-emption in the area of national security and of relentless expansion in the area of economic activity, itself continuously dominated by security interests.¹ This analysis may not be disputed by legal internationalists or constitutionalists.

  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Musheno Michael<br>
  Abstract: Whether on a patrol beat, in social service offices, or in public school classrooms, street-level workers continually confront rules in relation to their own beliefs about the people they encounter. Cops, Teachers, Counselors is the first major study of street-level bureaucracy to rely on storytelling. Steven Maynard-Moody and Michael Musheno collect the stories told by these workers in order to analyze the ways that they ascribe identities to the people they encounter and use these identities to account for their own decisions and actions. The authors show us how the world of street-level work is defined by the competing tensions of law abidance and cultural abidance in a unique study that finally allows cops, teachers, and counselors to voice their own views of their work.Steven Maynard-Moody is Director of the Policy Research Institute and Professor of Public Administration at the University of Kansas.Michael Musheno is Professor of Justice and Policy Studies at Lycoming College and Professor Emeritus of Justice Studies, Arizona State University.<br>

  Abstract: Street-level decision making is complexly moral and contingent rather than narrowly rule bound and fixed. A fundamental dilemma—perhaps the defining characteristic—of street-level work is that the needs of individual citizen-clients exist in tension with the demands and limits of rules. This does not mean that rules do not permeate all aspects of street-level work (they do) or that most street-level actions are not consistent with law and policy (they are). The most common situation may be that the rules effectively fit the complexity of workers’ judgments about citizen-clients. When the rules and standard procedures fit the situation, street-level<br>

  Abstract: Arguing that the "letting die" element of biopolitics has been overemphasized, Yasmeen Arif zeros in on biopolitics' other pole: "making live." She does so by highlighting the various means and the forms of life configured in the aftermath-or after
         lives-of violent events in contexts of law, justice, community, and identity. Her analysis of the social repercussions is both global and local in scope. Arif examines the convictions made in the Special Court of Sierra Leone, the first hybrid court of its nature under international criminal law. Next, she explores the making of a justice movement in the context of Hindu-Muslim violence in 2002 in the state of Gujarat, India. From there she revisits the Sikh carnage in Delhi of 1984. Finally, she explores a span of civil violence in Lebanon, and particularly, its effects on the city of Beirut.<br>

Oblivious to debts, to logic and justice, it moves steadily toward death in search of the intervention of a father figure in front of whom it refuses to yield.

Instead peasant rebellions are described through metaphors that see them as irrational, incomprehensible, and naturalistic: forest fires, rainstorms, raging rivers, earthquakes, and the like.

  Author(s) Anderson Stanford<br>
  Abstract: Academic disciplines may be charged with irrelevance, as occupying “ivory towers.” Then again, these disciplines may project themselves into worldly affairs, courting criticism either for their inconsequence or for the corruption of their ideals. In the academy today, one encounters a mistrust of disciplinarity as laying false claims to authority. There is also often a curious absence of the notion of “profession”—perhaps because both critics and supporters emphasize academic disciplines rather than those disciplines, such as medicine and law, that are recognized to prepare professionals. Disciplines merit critical examination, but I conceive the discipline of architecture as providing an<br>

  Abstract: THIS STUDY addresses several problems of constitutional law and the general theory of right, problems connected to the redefinition of the contemporary State as a “social State,” a “planned State,” and a “State of labor.” It seeks to account for several transformations that have taken place in the juridical system of sources, the structure of the State, and the connected conceptions of juridical norm and authority. The fundamental thesis is that these institutional changes, produced by underlying political changes, do not alter the class nature of the bourgeois State, but rather perfect it, making it adequate to the new needs<br>

  Author(s): LAFONT CRISTINA<br>
  Abstract: Jürgen Habermas is one of the most influential philosophers of our time. His diagnoses of contemporary society and concepts such as the public sphere, communicative rationality, and cosmopolitanism have influenced virtually all academic disciplines, spurred political debates, and shaped intellectual life in Germany and beyond for more than fifty years. In
      The
            Habermas Handbook, leading Habermas scholars elucidate his thought, providing essential insight into his key concepts, the breadth of his work, and his influence across politics, law, the social sciences, and public life.This volume offers a comprehensive overview and an in-depth analysis of Habermas's work in its entirety. After examining his intellectual biography, it goes on to illuminate the social and intellectual context of Habermasian thought, such as the Frankfurt School, speech-act theory, and contending theories of democracy. TheHandbookprovides an extensive account of Habermas's texts, ranging from his dissertation on Schelling to his most recent writing about Europe. It illustrates the development of his thought and its frequently controversial reception while elaborating the central ideas of his work. The book also provides a glossary of key terms and concepts, making the complexity of Habermas's thought accessible to a broad readership.<br>

  Author(s): ESTRADA ISABEL M.<br>
  Abstract: Este libro evalúa la aportación del documental cinematográfico y televisivo producido en España a partir de los años 90 al debate en torno a la memoria de la represión franquista, por un lado, así como a la construcción de la identidad democrática, en términos más generales. Propongo que tanto los documentales con un enfoque histórico explícito como aquellos cuya mirada retrospectiva se realiza sin referentes tan concretos cuestionan el proyecto político teleológico concebido durante la Transición. La primera parte de mi estudio trata de la memoria histórica de la guerra civil específicamente y, la segunda, de la memoria en un sentido socioeconómico para apuntar el déficit de agencia del sujeto en la democracia neoliberal. En última instancia se reivindica la marginalidad social de la víctima a la vez que se deja al descubierto su obliteración de los procesos democráticos. Isabel M. Estrada is Visiting Assistant Professor, Franklin & Marshall College. ENGLISH VERSION This book examines how a selected group of documentaries made since 1995 for both film and television inform the debate centered on the so-called "recuperation of memory" of the Spanish Civil War and dictatorship. Estrada contends that these documentaries modify Spanish identity as it was conceived by the teleological historical project of the transition. The narrative of mass media should be examined in order to comprehend the process of the "recovery of memory" that culminated in the Law of Historical Memory (2007). She carries out a comparative analysis of the visual discourse of the documentary and the narrative discourses of history and testimony, paying special attention to the relations of power among them. Using theoretical frameworks provided by Badiou, Adorno, Renov, and Ricoeur, this study ultimately sheds light on the status of the victim in the context of Spain's neoliberal democracy. Isabel M.

  Abstract: The study of medieval law occupies a unique niche within traditional academic discourse. A concentration on philological precision, challenges pertaining to manuscript study, and the ʹinternal languageʹ of jurisprudence have at times over-shadowed the consideration of the wider societal implications of medieval law and curtailed its use in the investigation of broad themes of social and cultural history.

  Book Title: Narrative Deconstructions of Gender in Works by Audrey Thomas, Daphne Marlatt, and Louise Erdrich-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Rosenthal Caroline<br>
  Abstract: By analyzing the works of Thomas, Marlatt, and Erdrich through the lenses of subjectivity, gender studies, and narratology, Caroline Rosenthal brings to light new perspectives on their writings. Although all three authors write metafictions that challenge literary realism and dominant views of gender, the forms of their counter-narratives vary. In her novel 'Intertidal Life', Thomas traces the disintegration of an identity through narrative devices that unearth ruptures and contradictions in stories of gender. In contrast, Marlatt, in 'Ana Historic', challenges the regulatory fiction of heterosexuality. She offers her protagonist a way out into a new order that breaks with the law of the father, creating a "monstrous" text that explores the possibilities of a lesbian identity. In her tetralogy of novels made up of 'Love Medicine', 'Tracks', 'The Beet Queen', and 'The Bingo Palace', Erdrich resists definite readings of femininity altogether. By drawing on trickster narratives, she creates an open system of gendered identities that is dynamic and unfinalizable, positing the most fragmented worldview as the most enduring. By applying gender and narrative theory to nuanced analysis of the texts, Rosenthal's study elucidates the correlation between gender identity formation and narrative. Caroline Rosenthal is Professor and Chair of American Literature at the Friedrich-Schiller University in Jena, Germany. Her book 'Narrative Deconstructions of Gender' was published by Camden House in 2003.<br>

  Abstract: After Parsonsis a fresh examination of Parsons' theoretical undertaking, its significance for social scientific thought, and its implications for present-day empirical research. The book is divided into four parts: Social Institutions and Social Processes; Societal Community and Modernization; Sociology and Culture; and the Human Condition. The chapters deal with Parsons' notions of societal community, societal evolution, and modernization and modernity.After Parsonsaddresses major themes of enduring relevance, including social differentiation and cultural diversity, social solidarity, universalism and particularism, and trust and affect in social life. The contributors explore these topics in a wide range of social institutions-family and kinship, economy, polity, the law, medicine, art, and religion-and within the context of contemporary developments such as globalization, the power of the United States as an "empireless empire," the emergence of forms of fundamentalism, the upsurge of racial, tribal, and ethnic conflicts, and the increasing occurence of deterministic and positivistic thought.<br>

  Abstract: If there is anything like a great tradition in social theory, it must be the multigenerational effort to come to terms with what has been called “modernity.” For well over a century prior to World War I, members of the lineage of classical social theorists posited some inexorable direction of modernization that sooner or later would encompass the human world. Their formulas ranged from Comte’s law of ineluctable stages to Alexis de Tocqueville’s irresistible trend toward social equality to Karl Marx’s dictum of de te fabula narratur to Herbert Spencer’s law of evolution to Max Weber’s thesis of world-historical rationalization.<br>

  Abstract: Trials against former leaders of a dictatorial regime are symbolic moments in the founding of a new political order. Beyond the classic functions of criminal justice (punishing the guilty, preventing similar deeds in the future and reinforcing respect for the law), these trials can also play an epistemic role in societies in transition.¹ They constitute important processes of narrative construction, understood as “storytelling” (
                  mise en récit) about injustice. The selection of the relevant facts at the trial, their legal characterization, and the assignation of blame by sentencing may constitute public affirmations of an official and normative version of events,² which<br>

  Book Title: Hybrid Renaissance-Culture, Language, Architecture<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burke Peter<br>
  Abstract: Hybrid Renaissance presents the Renaissance in Italy, elsewhere in Europe and in the world beyond Europe as an example of cultural hybridization. It is impossible to give a clear definition of either of the two key concepts used in this book, “hybridization" and “Renaissance". Roughly speaking, hybridity refers to something new that emerges from the combination of diverse older elements. The term “hybridization" is preferable to “hybridity" because it refers to a process rather than to a state, and also because it encourages the writer and the readers alike to think in terms of more or less rather than of presence versus absence. The book begins with a discussion of the concept of cultural hybridity and a cluster of other concepts related to it. Then comes a geography of hybridity, focusing on three locales: courts, major cities (whether ports or capitals) and frontiers. There follow six chapters about the hybrid Renaissance in different fields: architecture, painting and sculpture, languages, literatures, music, philosophy and law and finally religion. The essay concludes with a brief account of attempts to resist hybridization or to purify cultures or domains from what was already hybridized<br>

  Book Title: Constitutions, Courts, and History-Historical Narratives in Constitutional Adjudication<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Uitz Renáta<br>
  Abstract: Emphasizes the role history and historical narratives play in constitutional adjudication. Uitz provocatively draws attention to the often-tense relationship between the constitution and historical precedence highlighting the interpretive and normative nature of the law. Her work seeks to understand the conditions under which references to the past, history and traditions are attractive to lawyers, even when they have the potential of perpetuating indeterminacy in constitutional reasoning. Uitz conclusively argues that this constitutional indeterminacy is obscured by 'judicial rhetorical toolkits' of continuity and reconciliation that allow the court's reliance on the past to be unaccounted for. Uitz' rigorous analysis and extensive research makes this work an asset to legal scholars and practitioners alike.<br>

  Abstract: Theories of constitutional interpretation and constitutional adjudication seek to establish a model of constitutional review which enables courts to respond even to hard cases without transgressing the limits of the legitimate exercise of the review power.¹ In the course of this exercise one of the riddles used to be the countermajoritarian difficulty, as exposed in Bickel’s landmark work 
                  The Least Dangerous Branch (1962). Theories that understand constitutional adjudication in the matrix of the continuing operation of the branches of government respond well to challenges that stem from the undemocratic nature of constitutional review.

Abstract: Sheleff’s engagements lead to the conclusion that the law, though still repressive and irrational, could be used to encourage social solidarity while respecting diversity in human norms, thus allowing the law to become a “loose framework for expressing—and enhancing—cohesion” (p. 318). This overbroad conclusion lacks content. We are left with a multidisciplinary book that intelligently analyzes the dimensions of the problem and carefully explicates the flaws of Weber, Durkheim, and Marx but breaks no new ground.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: What about the last dimension of the constitution of moral action, the dimension of practical reason? Ricoeur agrees with Hans‐Georg Gadamer that judgment and interpretation cannot be removed from the application of laws and principles to particular cases. Hence, he also accepts Ronald Dworkin’s argument against legal positivism. Because legal positivism identifies the meaning of a law with its original intent, it is left no recourse in hard cases that seem to be outside the purview of this intent except to appeal to the discretionary power of the judge. In contrast, Ricoeur emphasizes a criterion of validity that looks to the narrative coherence of a legal judgment in view of the history of the legal enterprise. Yet, Ricoeur thinks that Dworkin misses the opportunity to coordinate his “narrativist notion of fit” (p. 114) with a theory of argumentation borrowed from Habermas and the Erlangen School. Just as Rawls’s theory of justice lends formalism to the selection of principles of justice within a community of shared understandings and aspirations, Habermas’s discourse theory lends formalism to Dworkin’s interpretive judgments insofar as interpreters must argue for their interpretations under a set of discourse rules. Indeed, Ricoeur sees the ideal endpoint of a trial as a kind of ideal speech situation in which both winner and loser recognize each other as subjects of rights whose causes should have been heard, who made plausible arguments, and whose arguments were heard (p. 131).<br>

Abstract: To the difficult question about how bodies might be formed out of scattered particles, Nieuwentijt replied with an optical analogy. If the atoms of light can be subjected to certain natural laws to form a shadow, it should not be impossible for the same process to take place with the particles of dead bodies. Chemistry furnished an answer to objections from the destructibility of matter. Like Boyle, Nieuwentijt recalled that the properties of a given substance persist through mixtures and transformations and that the original substance can be retrieved thanks to chemical manipulations. In the makeup of the body, flesh, bones, and membranes are not confounded, and each is nourished by appropriate substances. Finally, distance between a corpse’s particles is not a problem because the magnet attracts iron, and the universe is governed by the Newtonian law of attraction.<br>

Abstract: Backstage, for example, was the country westerner who mourned to another member about her African‐American son‐in‐law’s fear of coming to the Buffalo Club. Backstage conversation often took this more serious form, but only in whispers, in groups of two or three, in the ladies’ room or parking lot, away from the main stage. Anthropologist Judith Irvine (
            1979) argues that part of what constitutes a group is precisely how it distinguishes between formal and informal speech; following her logic, we argue that part of what constitutes a group is how it distinguished between frontstage and backstage speech.<br>

Author(s): Luhmann Niklas <br>
Abstract: The God‐term in Luhmann’s universe is “autopoesis,” essentially the self‐direction of the systems of society, including that of art, toward greater autonomy and complexity. Although Luhmann was a student of Talcott Parsons and his work bears the evolutionary interest of the functionalist paradigm, it is what many partisans of the older version might consider to be a mutant functionalism. As Luhmann avers, he considers “system differentiation” as “the heart of Parsons’s theory” (p. 350, n. 4) yet unlike Parsons’s optimistic sense that differentiation was undergirded by functional imperatives such as adaptive upgrading, Luhmann’s own sense is that the process of societal evolution “does not presuppose central norms, no matter how generalized” (p. 2). Essentially what this means is that society is composed of a set of systems (economy, politics, law, and art, among others) that evolve and complexify but not toward any unified state, such as Parsons’s “societal community.” Rather, each system tends toward its own independence and standards, and thus much of Luhmann’s book explores what he calls “the autonomy of art,” that is, the ability of the art system to develop its own “self‐description.”<br>

Issue: ca.2004.45.issue-1<br>
Date: 02 2004<br>
Author(s): Juillerat Bernard<br>
Abstract: Several of the essays arein the theological senseapologetic. The first is a selfsituating, at times trenchant criticism of cognitive anthropology. The second is a historical account of psychoanalytic anthropology that is so parochial, so superficial that it hardly merits reading. Juillerat considers neither the critiques of psychoanalytic anthropology nor the research of ethnopsychoanalysts such as Paul Parin in Zurich, Waud Kracke in the United States, or the anthropologically oriented psychoanalysts in India, Japan, and South America. It would be a pity, however, if readers dismissed the book at this point, for the remaining essays are theoretically interesting, ethnographically rich, and at times conceptually disquieting. They include such topics as the nature of the symbol; the relationship between Freuds originary fantasies and LviStrausss basic kinship units (
      atomes de parent); the interaction between individual and collective representations; the conjunction of endopsychic projections of cosmologies and social reality; splitting and metamorphosis in the Yafar conception of death; parallels between the evolutionism in Yafar mythology and in BachofensMutterrecht; the stress on the paternal principle in Freud and the maternal in Jung; a rethinking of Maussian exchange theory that recognizes gifts that impose no obligation; an interpretation of a recent cargo cult that relates the land of plenty to the terror and longing for intrauterine return that is expressed in Yafar myth; and a reinterpretation of Naven as a psychodrama in which the uterine nephewthe eternal herois caught between agnatic law and incestuous ties with the mother. The last chapter consists of theoretical excerpts from JuilleratsLavnement du pre(1995), which, though meant to enrich the reading of Yafar ritual and myth, are difficult to evaluate out of context.<br>

Abstract: The danger to the constitution under Charles I originated not, as royalists claimed, with a malignant party inside parliament. It was the actions of the king himself that brought about the collapse of his rule: first his governing without parliament and outside of the law, and then his threats of force against parliament in 1641 and 1642. If by 1642 the parliament had gone beyond defensive resistance against royal incursions on its privileges and had begun to invade the prerogative, this was justifiable in the situation. Had they dissolved themselves or merely stood by, inactive, and meekly petitioned the king while he got possession of all the arms and artillery of the nation, of the fleet, and of major garrisoned fortresses, and while Irish and foreign troops were brought in, then, Neal says, “both they and we must in all probability have been buried in the ruins of the liberties of our Country.”
      34By this point Charles had in effect abdicated: by deserting parliament, by refusing to discharge his duties, and by setting up his standard in the north. Neal draws the parallel with 1688, when in a similar crisis of authority a parliament convened without the king’s writ had assumed the authority to rule.<br>

Abstract: Another example of objectification occurs when I am defined as an object reduced to the parameters seen by economic theory—when I become the famous “economic agent,” supposedly summed up by the calculation of my needs, by the evaluation of these needs in numbered costs and the balancing of these costs against purchasing power, and finally by the purported rational calculation of a correspondence between the costs of the objects of the needs and this purchasing power. In order to attain even an approximation of rigor, this stage‐by‐stage reduction assumes that choices are made according to the laws of exchange and thus that the economic agent proceeds strictly according to self‐interest, in short, that I only know and practice business, which is to say strict exchange according to the iron law of a selfishness that is no longer moral, but epistemological. Thus there disappears from economic analysis everything that escapes exchange and commerce, but which doubtless makes them possible and flows over them in every direction: the gift and all the forms of social gratuity that have not yet been rendered economic. For if economy economizes on the gift, then more fundamentally, gratuity economizes on economy itself.

Abstract: Bernard Bailyn, personal correspondence, October 11, 2002, continues, “Soon after [the Braudel review in 1951], I developed an active interest in Goubert and the other French demographic historians whose writings have had a significant influence on what I have worked on. I was aware too of the sociologists (my father‐in‐law Paul Lazarsfeld and his colleagues at Columbia and here [at Harvard] kept me up on some of what they were doing).” Lazarsfeld (b. 1901, Vienna) taught at the Sorbonne and the Ecole’s Sixth Section in 1962–63; he contributed an essay to the two‐volume Mélanges en l’honneur de Fernand Braudel, “Toward a History of Empirical Sociology,” in
            Méthodologie de l’histoire et des sciences humaines(Toulouse, 1972), pp. 289–301. See also Paul F. Lazarsfeld, “An Episode in the History of Social Research: A Memoir,” inThe Intellectual Migration: Europe and America 1930–1960,ed. Donald Fleming and Bernard Bailyn (Cambridge, Mass., 1969), pp. 270–337. Even Americans without Bailyn’s French language skills would have found French scholarship readily available in English before the 1970s: Marc Bloch’sStrange Defeatin 1940,The Historian’s Craftin 1955,Feudal Societyin 1961,French Rural Historyin 1966, and collected essays in 1967, and Lucien Febvre’sA Geographical Introduction to Historyin 1925 andMartin Lutherin 1929. For the younger generation of social scientists associated with Braudel at the Sixth Section of the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, English translations of Claude Lévi‐Strauss’sTristes Tropiquesappeared in 1961 andStructural Anthropologyin 1963. In fact, Clyde Kluckholm had Talcott Parsons offer Lévi‐Strauss a tenured professorship at Harvard in 1953, but Lévi‐Strauss (who had been a fellow professor with Braudel in Brazil in the mid‐1930s and later taught in New York at the New School during the war) declined, remembering later, “I had no desire to start life as an exile again,” cited in Marcel Hénaff,Claude Lévi‐Strauss and the Making~<br>

Abstract: On seeking for some clue to the law underlying these current maxims, we may see shadowed forth in many of them, the importance of economizing the reader’s or hearer’s attention. To so present ideas that they may be apprehended with the least possible mental effort, is the desideratum towards which most of the rules above quoted point. When we condemn writing that is wordy, or confused, or intricate—when we praise this style as easy, and that as fatiguing, we consciously or unconsciously assume this desideratum as our standard of judgment.

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: For Kant, a “boundary” always presupposes a positive conception of the enclosing region (e.g., the field of noumena) beyond the enclosed space (e.g., the “field of experience”), defining a shared border where the two spaces “touch” (sec. 57). In contrast, a “limit” defines a border as merely a negation of an incomplete quantitative series. Theoretical reason (mathematics and natural science) has no boundary; new cognition extends to infinity. Bourgeois’s main point is that the very enterprise of critique founders without its boundary relation to the positive content provided by the Ideas of Reason (ideas of the completion of the series of conditions)—in particular, as “postulates of pure reason” practically indispensable for obedience to the objectively binding moral law. Bourgeois cites Kant: “[The end of reason] is ‘to point out to us actually not only the bounds of the pure use of reason, but also the way to determine them’” (p. 43). What grounds critique and critical metaphysics is not reason in its conditioned use, the understanding (
      Verstand) and its categories; rather, it is reason (Vernunft) in its unconditioned use that establishes the sources of cognition, their domain, boundaries, and relations.<br>

Abstract: Some years ago there arose a rather heated debate among theologians in Europe, the United Kingdom, and the United States about the distinctiveness of Christian ethics in relation to “autonomous morality” specified on philosophical grounds. This was part of a longer standing agenda in modern philosophical Western ethics at least since the Enlightenment to isolate a unique domain of the “moral” free from the resources of historical traditions, especially religious traditions. What concerned a wide range of theologians in the later third of the twentieth century was to clarify, if possible, the precise relations between Christian faith and an autonomous morality. Does Christianity add anything to moral reason, and if so, what? In what does the distinctiveness of the Christian moral outlook consist? These questions touched deeper impulses in the Christian tradition insofar as forms of Christian ethics, say natural law ethics, always granted some autonomy to moral reason outside of other resources, revealed and otherwise. Throughout the late 1960s and the early 1980s a host of Roman Catholic and Protestant theologians weighed in on the debate.<br>

Abstract: According to Tesauro, the Son of God, the “sublime” writer of his own commentary, appears to the prophet as a scribe. His writing is first and foremost a sign of judgment and salvation (he marks the foreheads of those who do penance), but also of cleansing (he throws burning coal over the city). The linen cloth covering the body of the divine scribe will later become page and written text. Tesauro writes that, as a new Caesar, the divine scribe competes with himself, since he is at once supreme warrior and supreme historian of his own deeds. But as a written text, the divine scribe finds his literary model in Moses’s Decalogue.
      38If the two tablets contained the words that God dictated to Moses, in the two figures marked on both sides of the shroud God later revealed that the body of his Only‐Begotten Son brought his law to its fullness.<br>

Abstract: In “Theology and the Interpretation of Narrative,” in the context of a debate with Ricoeur, Frei further highlights the significance of the narrative focus of Christian reading. As he writes, the narrative of Jesus is understood “both as … the enactment of who he is, and in its emblematic function for the life of the community.”
         21Frei highlights that such Christian reading, in its focus on the story, involves an “amazing abandonment of halacha in favor of haggadah,” which he partly attributes to antinomian tendencies in Gentile communities. He also distinguishes this “Christian equivalent of haggadah” from Midrash’s emphasis on “sets of individual, cryptic, metaphoric tales.” However, while seeing the narrative as primarily haggadic, Frei’s discussion of the narrative focus of Christian reading indicates that he does think its “emblematic function” serves a role analogous to law, in terms of shaping the community. Highlighting a point already discussed, Frei says that the “parables of the kingdom of God, whatever their original intent, were used … as figurations of Jesus,” and ascribed to him.<br>

Abstract: While giggles erupted from all corners of the room, I couldn’t help wondering if the constant assertion of God’s control over events didn’t in some way diminish these students’ sense of moral obligation to act in the world. After all, if all events follow God’s plan, regardless of what one chooses to do, why then act in ways that risk one’s safety?
            16Why “follow God’s law” if you can experience God’s history, and live and die within God’s embrace, feeling less pain than those who are not saved? If you’re saved through belief, then what propels ethical action? Mrs. Barrett herself had said that the Al Qaeda attackers had “seized the power that should have been given to God and didn’t allow God to work through the situation.” Was the Holocaust a situation that God “ought to work through” or one where people ought to intervene? Only one student, Kira, eventually volunteered that she would hide Jews, that she would choose God’s laws over the Gestapo’s, regardless of the risks to herself and her family.<br>

Abstract: I trust that what I have written here clarifies, in the course of the discussion, the relevance and significance of the seven characteristics of Don Browning’s style of theologizing. Following in his footsteps I hope to have made a contribution to the public theology he espouses—the first characteristic I mentioned at the beginning of this article. I trust that I have likewise shown my interest—the second characteristic—in the institutions determining people’s concrete daily lives, as well as influencing and coloring their norms, values, and religiosity. I have referred specifically to the institution of law, especially human rights law. The third characteristic is also clear: as Browning’s study of marriage and the family is conducted in a global, more especially an interreligious perspective, I have paid due attention to interreligious interaction and dialogue, which dominate not only politics and the mass media but also the conversations in our living rooms. Both of us are convinced that any public theology must be characterized by an empirical approach—the fourth characteristic. In his family project, Browning not only collaborates with social scientists but also incorporates their empirical research into the goal and content of his project. In this article, I, too, have used insights from political and social sciences, as well as empirical‐theological research, in order to relate the assumptions and principles of interreligious interaction and dialogue directly to empirical reality.<br>

Abstract: Allow me to illustrate this theological ethical role by discussing perhaps the most important claim of the new childhood studies literature in the social sciences: namely, that children should be understood as social “agents.” Children’s agency has taken a central place in the sociology, anthropology, history, law, and other studies of childhood in Europe and now increasingly in the United States. According to a recent interpretation, children’s agency means that “children’s actions affect their worlds and especially their social worlds,” so that childhood studies “emphasizes children’s quest to make sense of their world and to construct a good fit with it.”
         36The study of children’s agency is the study of how children participate in creating their social environments, exercise their own social competencies, act diversely rather than stereotypically, construct independent ideas and meaning, and help to interpret their own cultures, communities, and identities. Agency also includes “voice,” which “puts the focus on children’s commitment to make known their own ability to act on their own behalf, whether to ensure their own interests or to modify the world that surrounds them.”37<br>

Abstract: The depths of the distinction of ethics from poetics here can be seen by its assumption even by modernity’s critics. Nietzsche’s transvaluation of values, for example, claims to move finally “beyond good and evil”—beyond ethics as rationalized ahistorical law—to a vision of human life characterized in part by pure making and invention.
         12Radical though this is, it still rests on the contrast of morality and aesthetics, however much it inverts their priority. Nietzsche’s “superman” throws off the shackles of the Kantian moral law only, in fact, to embrace a rather Kantian aesthetic freedom of taste (combined, it is true, with a Greek poetics of self‐making) as the more authentic human activity. Our most sublime actions should be motivated by the beauty and power of the inner human spirit as opposed to the mere mass thinking of morality. As a result, Nietzsche’s will to power and revenge against resentment do not overturn but in fact necessarily presuppose the ancient quarrel between the moralists and the poets—the difference being only that he chooses the latter over the former. In a way, it is Plato’s own banishment of the poets from the city that is to blame for their Nietzschean eternal return: now cloaked in the Trojan Horse of aesthetic nihilism or self‐making authenticity.<br>

Abstract: To anticipate a criticism of the use of Habermas’s discourse ethics, there should be acknowledgment of Bent Flyvbjerg’s opinion, which is shared by a number of people: “The basic weakness of Habermas’s project is its lack of agreement between ideal and reality, between intentions and their implementation” [
      36, p. 215]. In directly countering Habermas’s discourse ethics, Foucault says, “The problem, then, is not to try to dissolve [power relations] in the utopia of completely transparent communication but to acquire the rules of law, the management techniques, and also the morality, the ethos, the practice of the self, that will allow us to play these games of power with as little domination as possible” [37, p. 298]. However, Habermas does admit, “Bargaining processes are tailored for situations in which social power relations cannot be neutralized in the way rational discourses presuppose” [38, p. 166]. Their positions are not so far apart, and the common ground is the ethics of the discursive practice. Furthermore, Habermas and Foucault share some phenomenological justification for their positions. Communication may not be transparent, as the Habermasian ideal would prefer, but neither is power a totally corrupting force. There are times when the discourse in librarianship will be agonistic (competitive and possibly strained); an agreed‐upon set of rules for ethical communication is still the most effective antidote to disruption and authoritarianism and assurance of rights being recognized.<br>

Abstract: Yet, since the Christian model of responsibility rests on a deepened interiority and is the gift of a self‐less other who remains inscrutable, this new model has a definite place for secrecy, for the
      mysterium, for the mystical, unlike the Greco‐Roman version, which is superseded so radically as to break entirely with its memory. Christian responsibility has its origin in a gift, in a “gift that is not a present,” and it is from the outset tied with secrecy for essential reasons. Indeed, as Derrida points out, “a gift that could be recognized as such in the light of day, a gift destined for recognition, would immediately annul itself. The gift is the secret itself.… Secrecy is the last word of the gift which is the last word of the secret” (GD,pp. 29–30). Originating in the elusive event of such a gift, even the transition from Platonism and neo‐Platonism to Christianity remains obscure; it cannot be simply accounted for in positive terms. But since the gift of responsibility is a gift from a self‐effacing Goodness (who holds the human being in its hands from within) to the individual in all his or her creatural singularity, it is “the gift of something that remains inaccessible, unpresentable, and as a consequence secret” (GD,p. 29). The donee is exclusively responsible to the donator, and hence, as Derrida’s discussion of the Abrahamic story of the sacrifice of Isaac in the second half ofThe Gift of Deathdemonstrates, he or she is relieved of the necessity of explaining his or her deeds to others. Indeed, being the unique addressee of the gift, the responsible individual must, at the limit, relate to others in an irresponsible fashion. How he responds to the divine Law remains secret—that is, unaccounted for—and ultimately secret to him‐ or herself as well, for such responsible decision making must, in principle, be unaccountable.<br>

Abstract: In this sense, the production and reproduction of unevenness in ever new registers was a condition of capitalism’s “law” of accumulation. It is tragically ironic that in the wake of the catastrophe inflicted on New Orleans and the American Gulf Coast by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 the media immediately discovered the existence of a Third World within the midst of the United States and confronted all of the signs of unevenness once reserved for the world outside Euro‐America. In no time at all, an act of nature was able to easily rip off the veneer of the present to reveal an enduring and deep‐seated historic unevenness—the image of the Southern Question in the American South and elsewhere—instead of the homogenous time associated with both capital and the nation form.
         5It is this specter—in the figure of noncontemporaneous contemporaneity—that has come back to haunt the present in the incarnate form of explosive fundamentalisms fusing the archaic and the modern, the past and the present, recalling for us a historical déjà vu and welding together different modes of existence aimed at overcoming the unevenness of lives endlessly reproduced.<br>

Abstract: While in Mormon theology there is no existence without agency, the agency that operates in this world is conditioned by the gift of the atonement of Jesus Christ. The Book of Mormon, at 2 Nephi 2:26–27, provides: “because that they are redeemed from the fall they have become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon, save it be by the punishment of the law at the great and last day. … Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient.”<br>

Abstract: The citation as concept symbol is examined from the perspective of three separate levels of analysis. The micro level refers to individual use of a citation to identify past ideas or innovations that have been previously accepted as legitimate. The meso level is defined as a cluster of citations used to identity a group’s contemporary view of reliable knowledge. The macro level of analysis refers to the entire structure of a citation system used to explain knowledge processes. These three levels of citations as concept symbols are then examined in relation to the correspondence, coherence, and consensus theories of truth. The article lays a foundation for considering the relationship between the cited knowledge systems of science, law, and technology and the three theories of truth. In so doing, Van der Veer Martens demonstrates that citations as concept symbols and boundary objects can help illuminate new approaches to understanding specific aspects of citation analysis theory in library and information science and, in some ways, the social networks of scholarly communication within the intellectual domains of science, law, and technology.<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Abstract: Certainly the next sentence alone, even if it tried harder, couldn't set the trouble right, with its mention of that further “nurse and friend” (plural this time, unless synonymous) they also “give” to her wastrel brother Tip. Sprung from “give a mother's care,” its parallelism has grown derailing. Give a nurse? Give suck or succor? Further, too, the feminine dominates as sole antecedent in the pickup clause, where Tip is “never vexed by the great exactions he made of her” (
         LD,p. 787). Of her—and of course of her new husband and partner. But whether Arthur is tacitly slotted in as bedside friend and brother-in-law or male nurse in this loose and dubious syntax, there was, as we saw, no ambiguity at all in the pronominal grammar of the preceding sentence, where, tendering along with Amy “a mother's care,” he has inherited the same maternal role from which he in his own right never took solace. He has answered the lack by embodying it—and not as psychological diagnosis any longer but as moral uplift within the last distended cadenza.<br>

Abstract: This account of the relative, instrumental good of political life leads Augustine to view its defense by public officials as justifiable. For Augustine, the use of lethal force poses fewer dangers to the ordering of an individual’s attachments when his actions are mediated by role responsibilities and organized toward the protection of the common good. Killing is less intimate for soldiers than for private persons insofar as it is carried out as a duty of public office. For that reason, homicide can be more detached and disinterested—ordered by interests that go beyond a private person’s immediate loves to include the commonweal. Augustine writes, “A soldier who kills the enemy is acting as an agent of the law, so he can easily perform his duty without inordinate desire.”

Abstract: If anything characterizes our age it is the many endangerments to and alterations of life ranging from the genetic to the planetary. In this situation, some thinkers insist that we need a heuristics of fear about the possible end of nature and also to focus on human mortality in order to evoke a sense of responsibility.
         35Jacques Derrida puts this forcefully inThe Gift of Death. “My irreplaceability is therefore conferred, delivered, ‘given,' one can say, by death. It is the same gift, the same source, one could say the same goodness and the same law. It is from the site of death as the place of my irreplaceability, that is, of my singularity, that I feel called to responsibility. In this sense only a mortal can be responsible.”36As Socrates is reported to have claimed, philosophy is about learning to die. Yet that is not quite right, I submit. While showing wherein the consciousness of responsibility might arise—that is, in the singularity of being toward death, my own or that of the other—the focus on mortality by Socrates, Derrida, Ricoeur, and others cannot clarify the purpose of responsibility, that is, the good human power is to serve. At best, it discloses that we ought not to do harm, a demand of nonmaleficence. Ethical reflection on how we ought to live too often dodges the question of why we ought to affirm life, our own, that of others, and also the wider compass of life on this planet. Here religious resources can and must be explored. That is, too often a theological or philosophical ethicist fails to grasp what Augustine profoundly understood, namely, that the remembrance of death is itself inscribed within life, and, therefore, one can bring this vitality to articulation in terms of the good that moral responsibility can and ought to respect and enhance.37This opens and requires theological reflection into responsibility itself. How then are we to articulate the purpose of responsibility beyond the claims of a modern, humanistic orientation, ~<br>

Abstract: Prayer is, after all, enunciated when our ability to respond and reply (existentially and ethically, as well as linguistically) is most at stake and most fearfully close to failure. If prayer is the performative utterance of faith, then faith ultimately demands the enunciation of a being‐for‐God that, by definition, we are not, and hence one we struggle to articulate with the language at hand. And if the essence of the religious is “the reverence of the invisible,” then prayer is caught up in the visible order of the understanding that marks the human separation from God: “Words force us to speak metaphorically … in the language of the
         eye” (N5411, fol. 44v).52Attempts to articulate a relationship with the divine must be drawn out of human experience marked by a chasm of separation. As Coleridge comments in 1829, “I know indeed, that his ways are not our ways nor his Thoughts our Thoughts.” Yet the struggle against the limits of language must be made: “How can I love him, trust in him, call on him,but as a Man?” (N6155, emphasis mine).53Thus, while Coleridge may indeed believe that language is as potentially sacramental as the moral law or reason, we should also remember the human subject’s intrinsic distance from all three.

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 655202<br>
Date: 8 2010<br>
Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: The function of Lévinas's universalization of Talmud is two-fold. First Lévinas can only assert Judaism's importance in the contemporary world if its message speaks to everyone. Additionally Lévinas has to defend against the reading that Judaism is itself another tribalism or nationalism. The quotation above appears in the context of a Talmudic passage that discusses to whom one owes the equivalent of overtime wages. The text itself is clear. The law refers to the people Israel. Given the fact that Lévinas has defined Judaism in such a way that it is opposed to any distinction between “natives” and “strangers,” he is at great pains to protect Judaism from any interpretation that would allow it to appear tribalistic or exclusionary. He does not dispute the literal meaning of the passage, but insists that the more universal meaning is the source of the passage's truth; it is the philosophical core that must be unearthed. The problem is that Lévinas's philosophical model of reading Talmud forces him to make statements that are at odds with his own validation of the plurivocity of the scriptural text.<br>

Abstract: Whether or not the poets themselves agreed, for classical rhetoricians simile and metaphor function almost exclusively as forms of ornamentation. In the Aristotelian, Ciceronian, or Quintilian rhetorical tradition, metaphor is mere “substitution,” a way to see likeness between two distinct phenomena, a language trick, and a graceful addition to the poem.
         54According to the rhetoricians, metaphor, simile, and neologism in this tradition function primarily to increase aesthetic appeal. Despite this position, as one scholar of ancient rhetoric has highlighted, in fact, metaphor had more functions in ancient poetry. Among these we might include (a) to clarify, (b) to render sensual immediacy, and (c) to link the vehicle with unexpected associations.55Still, as Auerbach highlighted about classicalfigura, these features keep the image within a tropological function because none are associated with semantics. But a number of Dante's nonhuman creature images are different. The examples of a few that he has adapted from his Latin sources can suffice here. Dante's snake and serpent images inInferno25.69–141, derived from Lucan'sPharsaliaand Ovid'sMetamorphoses, do much more than characterize the terrain, as in Lucan.56Ovid's serpent image shares a moral valence with Dante, for the image characterizes the entanglement of passion as Hermaphroditus falls to the lure of Salmacis: “But she wrapped herself around him, as a serpent / Caught by an eagle, borne aloft, entangles / Coils around head and talons, or as ivy / Winds round great oaks, or an octopus extends / Its prey within its tentacles.”57In this instance, the melding into the other presents itself as a distortion and an aberration, as a devolution, both in Ovid and in Dante. But Dante appropriates this classical textual legacy with its moral judgment, however, to support his law ofcontrapasso, moving the imagery far beyond the two dimensions of ornamentation and moral censure. Dante's analogy between the thieves ~<br>

Abstract: Early in
         Adaptation, Laroche (Chris Cooper) takes Susan to an orchid show (figs. 2–3). Laroche bends down to admire anangraecum sesquipedale, the orchid with a nectary so long that Darwin postulated the existence in the vicinity of a moth with a twelve-inch proboscis (the daring surmise, which no one believed at the time, ultimately proved correct). And this is what he says:
               
            L
               aroche:
                  
            Angraecum sesquipedale. [A] beauty! God! Darwin wrote about this one. Charles Darwin? Evolution guy? Hello?

                  (nodding):

            L
               aroche:See that nectary all the way down there? Darwin hypothesized a moth with a nose twelve inches long to pollinate it. And everyone thought he was a loon. Then sure enough, they found this moth with a twelve-inch proboscis. Proboscis means “nose,” by the way.
            
               
            O
               rlean:I know what proboscis means.
            
               “In this sense, they show us how to live”: the moral of the story is to be yourself, to find the one thing that you are designed to do, to pursue your passion, safe in the (almost Adam Smithian) knowledge that it will make the world a better place. This sounds like a beautiful idea, made even more beautiful by being connected to the deepest secrets of the physical world—it is as though romantic love were a law of nature, on a par with gravity and the conservation of energy—and by the luscious images of bees and ophrys orchids, often in extreme close-up and shallow focus, set to soft, rising strings. Laroche is drawing on his extensive knowledge of the anthic realm to tell us something vitally important about the human condition, indeed something existentially important, in that it can and should serve as a guide to our behavior. And so we have the glimmerings of a f~<br>

Article Title: Why Devils Came When Faustus Called Them<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 660269<br>
Date: 08 2011<br>
Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: Faustus enters into the play with his antiallegorical habit of mind firmly in place. In his opening soliloquy, he not only ignores the scriptural promise of salvation but also never acknowledges that every profession he considers and abandons resounds as a figure for salvation. In his refusal to read allegorically, Faustus articulates but does not hear that the study of each art stands as a metonym for a larger spiritual quest to come to God; he makes visible but does not see the eschatological trajectory in which the ends of earthly things are themselves means to move the soul toward an invisible, deferred ending in heaven.
      26Thus Faustus begins with Aristotle, asking whether “to dispute well” is “logic's chiefest end” (1.1.8). When he concludes that it is, and that this “art” affords “no greater miracle” (1.1.9), he decides to abandon its study since he has already “attained the end” (1.1.10). This seems fair enough, since merely to dispute may well indeed seem a rather limited goal, yet in the very next line, as Faustus actually renounces the art, he bids “on kai me on, farewell” (1.1.12), and the significance of what he is abandoning changes.27Faustus is abandoning not just the form of disputation but the opportunity to study being and nonbeing, existence itself; yet Faustus seems to think he understands the mysteries of ontology since he has mastered the external form of the art that is the vehicle for its study. In the same manner, Faustus renounces the law with an almost Pauline critique, calling it a form of “external trash” (1.1.35), yet, from the perspective of faith, even the Justinian rule “if one and the same thing is bequeathed to two persons, one should have the thing itself, the other the value of the thing”—which Faustus dismisses as a case of “paltry legacies” (1.1.30)—may be seen as a vehicle with which to ruminate on the very problem of having a self split into body and soul, with one part, “the thing,” going to the earth after death and th~<br>

Abstract: However, Larmore usually uses “commitment” in a much broader sense that allegedly applies to all mental states. Beliefs are not images or ideas felt with a certain vivacity, or acts of accepting propositions, but are instead dispositions with practical implications: behavior that expresses the belief “has to be such that the belief would have provided the individual
      a reasonto act this way” (77–78). Similarly, following Scanlon, Larmore holds that “every desire represents its object as something there is a reason to pursue” (78), even if it is easily outweighed. This claim is more troublesome because we experience some appetites without thinking that there is anything that would count in favor of the desire’s object before our attraction toward it. Their psychologicaldynamiscan also persist even when we believe that the apparent reason to which such desires respond is illusory, as the case of Swann’s love shows (182). These brute preferences or inclinations give us at best disjunctive reasons to satisfy them or to eliminate them (Mark Murphy,Natural Law and Practical Rationality[Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001], 75)—and this weak reason to satisfy them can thus be rejected outright rather than merely outweighed. That is exactly what distinguishes desires and emotions that involve strong evaluations: these motives respond to reasons that appear normative independently of being desired. Even if desires are bound up with beliefs given the wholism of the mental (92, 102), it does not follow that in every desire the “person obligates himself to behave, all else being equal,” in ways that accord with “the value accorded to the object of desire” (80)—as if a person who had no other desires but this one would rationallyhaveto act according to it.<br>

Author(s): Csordas Thomas<br>
Abstract: Among the multiple dimensions of social and cultural imagination, morality occupies a blurred place across social domains, being Religion, on the one hand, and Law, on the other, the traditional loci of the moral in classical anthropology. Tom Csordas’s article helps us think beyond tradition, pointing out a little addressed topic in the emerging subfield of the anthropology of morality: the notion of
         evil, which, by the way, was and still is of central concern in shamanic and witchcraft studies, and also in certain currents of contemporary philosophy. This article interrogates us about the possibility of defining morality “as a cultural system,” in Clifford Geertz’s sense. In doing so, the author seems to discard finally the idea of morality as a “cultural system” for a less systematic, dispersed set of moral meanings that traverse social life. In this undertaking he does not leave the central Geertzian concern on symbols and meaning. Ultimately, human action is mediated by symbols that condense and produce meaning. Here, meaning seems to be the master concept related to the anthropological study of morality. Among the cultural meanings that shape moralities, Csordas finds appropriate introducing cross-cultural notions of evil to enrich any anthropological approach to morality. In the multifarious realms of morality, evil appears as a complex idiom or code through which moral notions are expressed. And among cultural practices, witchcraft and sorcery are of central concern to understand how many societies build their moral frameworks. Regarded both as a human and a cosmological (or nonhuman) phenomenon, evil in Csordas’s view as a cross-cultural analytical category, might enlighten studies about what I may call the “moral installation in the world.” The latter is related with the existential approach to morality proposed in this article. But I consider that, in conceptual terms, morality is always hierarchically included in ontology (what is the nature of ~<br>

Abstract: Antiquarian accounts of Roman institutions, specific rituals or bodies of norms (e.g., augural law) written by Romans about their own past and present competed with accounts and interpretations of Roman history and culture by Greek authors. This would clearly imply a “we” of Latin-speaking Romans against the “them” backdrop of literature by Greek authors, maybe even of Greek literature in general. The focus in all these texts is an urban one.

Abstract: As we have seen, for Badiou proceeding from the truth-event delivers no law and thus no form of mastery, be it that of the wise man or the prophet.
            
                  “If one demands signs, he who performs them in abundance becomes a master for him who demands them. If one questions philosophically, he who can reply becomes a master for the perplexed subject. But he who declares … does not enter into the logic of the master… . To declare an event is to become the son of that event.”137
               
                  When Paul leaves for Arabia in order to proclaim the gospel, he is armed solely with a personal event that, nonetheless, provides him with grounds for declaring that impersonal event that is the resurrection.138
               
                  As Badiou puts it, Paul “firmly holds to the militant discourse of weakness”139
               
                  knowing that he must leave truth to its subjective “voicelessness” for only the work of its declaration ensures its continuation. One of Badiou’s central insights is that the militant apparatus of truth can only be achieved by going against the flow of the world,140
               
                  which reminds us that—once emptied of its theological content—the structure of Paul’s proclamation has, for Badiou, contemporary political significance. In this sense, he discovers in Paul a thinker whose legacy contains revolutionary potential even today” and in whose proclamation of the event of Christ’s resurrection as “truth for all” lies the “theoretical basis for continued engagement in revolutionary thought and politics.”141

Abstract: Abstract.
         Gadamer's pursuit inTruth and Methodof an applicative literary hermeneutics modeled on legal hermeneutics earns him the status of a precursor to the emergence of what is known in North America as the “literature and law movement.” Attentive to the debates and controversies surrounding this movement, this article seeks to explore an interpretive interzone in which the judge and the literary critic, if they apply themselves to a poetics of elasticity, might be of exemplary significance to each other. The notion of “exemplarity” does not, however, imply a mechanical appropriation of the practices of the one by the other, but a mutually nuanced and complicated approximation of the strengths of each by the other. In the light of this normative poetics of proximity and distance, Dworkin's model of the “chain novel” is assessed and supplemented by (an alternative) model grounded in Foucault's genealogy of authorship as expounded in his article “What Is an Author?”<br>

Abstract: The L.D.S Church's use of commemorative rituals and narrative history to simultaneously adapt and maintain identity is not unique, but it is uniquely available to analysis because of the immediacy of the change and the Saints' devotion to record-keeping. Thus, the drama of LDS survival during the Progressive Era illuminates age-old religious strategies for adaptation to social norms, which strategies preserve the faithful's confidence in the timelessness of their god's moral and ecclesiastical order. More narrowly, these events in American church history are critical for understanding how the civilly disobedient Saints finally accepted the rule of federal law without losing their religion.<br>

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>

Author(s): van Woudenberg René<br>
Abstract: The idea that we can properly be held responsible for what we believe underlies large stretches of our social and institutional life; without that idea in place, social and institutional life would be unthinkable, and more importantly, it would stumble and fall. At the same time, philosophers have argued that this idea is strange, puzzling, beyond belief, false, meaningless or at any rate defective. The first section develops the alleged problem. The burden of this paper, however, is not to discuss the merits of this idea but rather to measure the damage in case the idea turns out to be defective indeed. This is done by substantiating the claim that this idea indeed underlies large and important stretches of our social and institutional life. Section 2 substantiates that claim by presenting the results of a web search on the use of what I call "deontological epistemic expressions", i.e. expressions in which deontological and epistemological notions (both broadly construed) are combined; examples are "obligation to believe", "not permitted to forget", "right to know". The ubiquitous use of these expressions, I argue, is linguistic evidence for the claim that the contested idea indeed pervades our social life. Linguistic evidence, however, can be frail and misleading. From the fact that we say that the shade is moving we cannot conclude that shades really exist; likewise it may not be permitted to conclude from the ubiquitous use of deontological epistemic expressions that there really are doxastic obligations (and hence doxastic responsibilities). The third section, therefore, moves beyond the linguistic evidence and discusses two social institutions, viz. education and law as we find them in modern Western societies, and argues that they cannot be made sense of unless the contested idea is in place. Educational and legal systems of course vary greatly throughout the Western world. Such differences as exist, however, are irrelevant for the claim I will be making in t~<br>

Issue: i309685<br>

Author(s): Van Gennep Susan<br>
Abstract: In Sumatra's Angkola Batak culture, rituals celebrating major kinship-related events such as marriage have many layers of social and symbolic meaning; they have political, kinship, musical, mythic, and philosophical dimensions as lengthy, oratory-filled ceremonies that unite wife-giving lineages with wife-receivers. This article examines several ways that the interpretive approach that is discussed in the introduction can help students of Indonesian ritual grasp diverse aspects of Batak marriage rituals such as their hidden symbolic organization and their practical political implications. The article deals with a short sequence of adat dance staged for anthropological research purposes. (Adat, once translated as customary law, roughly means Angkola ceremonial life, kinship norms, and political thought; adat is eminently flexible, redefined by each Batak generation.) The choreography of the dance (wife-receivers dancing with wife-givers), songs, clothing, the political biographies of the participants, and the fact that the event was staged render the ceremony open to both structural and social contextual inquiry.<br>

Abstract: In recent years, sociologists and anthropologists have conducted significant studies of modern life using concepts and perspectives derived from symbolic anthropology. This paper discusses the theoretical and methodological problems entailed, including the distinction between symbolic and nonsymbolic actions. Research on three major areas of behavior is reviewed: (a) studies of institutions, especially politics, law, and social control; (b) studies of ceremonial events, including life-cycle rituals, sports, and festivals; and (c) studies of everyday life, including consumer goods and food, and popular culture. We conclude with a discussion of the methodological issues of location and dimensionality and the different forms of symbolic analysis.<br>

Abstract: The use of Reason may take two different meanigns: the way of the rational and the way of the reasonable. The first one consists in computing from quantitative evaluations, the second one to deliberate from arguments pro and con. The first one is the way of Mathematics, as to the second, it is more traditionally the way of Politics and Law. All the societies have used the second to solve their social problems. The West only has used the first in the field of human relations. Consequently, we have a devaluation has endured the same destiny. The consequence of that alteration has been very spectacular. The West has got an incredible power. However, to-day, that tremendous efficiency faces limits of all kinds.<br>

Author(s): Dulkin Ryan S.<br>
Abstract: The exegetical stories of Genesis Rabbah 8 portray God as engaged in an ethical debate over the implications of humanity's creation. These stories narrativize the necessity of favoring mercy over justice. The Deity must mobilize the attribute of mercy to overcome the justice problem of human fallibility. These stories rehearse the conflict of values in an "organic" fashion as opposed to discursive argumentation over abstract principles, and suggest a virtue theory grounded in mercy and kindness without being inflexible or absolutist. As such, mercy and kindness should be inculcated not over and above Jewish law but prior to the law.<br>

Article Title: La pena di morte: L'attuale sviluppo magisteriale<br>
Publisher: PONTIFICIA UNIVERSITÀ GREGORIANA<br>
Issue: i23570983<br>
Date: 1 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Carlotti Paolo<br>
Abstract: Appurata l'esistenza di uno sviluppo dottrinale — e non solo circostanziale — a proposito del recente magistero ecclesiale sulla pena di morte, l'articolo si sofferma sul movimento argomentativo che guida l'Evangelium vitae rispetto alle edizioni del Catechismo della Chiesa Cattolica in particolare, e in generale rispetto all'intera vicenda storica dei pronunciamenti magisteriali in proposito. Dopo un'attenta disamina, la dignità umana con i correlati diritti dell'uomo, tra cui quello inalienabile alla vita, emerge come snodo ermeneutico per un ripensamento, in sintonia con la chiave personalista del Vaticano II, delle referenze etiche del diritto penale, che giunga a dichiarare, in modo più chiaro e definitivo e per se e non solo per accidens, l'implausibilità morale della morte inflitta come pena e a prevederne la procura solo alle strette e rigorose condizioni della legittima difesa. The article looks into the recent magisterium of the Church on the death penalty and deemes it an instance of the development of doctrine rather than a circumstantiated reaction. It then dwells on the thinking that constitutes the backbone of the Encyclical Evangelium Vitae and compares and contrasts it with the various pronouncements of the teaching office of the Church, and with the two editions of the Cathechism of the Catholic Church. When one carefully examines the issue, human dignity and its consequent human rights — among which one must mention the inalienable right to life — emerge as the hermeneutical cog of the problem. Together with the personalistic views of Vatican II, such a hermeneutic asks for a rethinking of the ethical norms in penal law which, in a clearer and more definitive way — per se, and not simply per accidens —, must then declare the moral implausibility of death whenever it is meted out as punishment. A death inflicted on someone else can only be justified within the strict and rigorous condition of legitimate self-defence.<br>

Article Title: La rivelazione tra immanenza e trascendenza: Rosenzweig e Levinas<br>
Publisher: PONTIFICIA UNIVERSITÀ GREGORIANA<br>
Issue: i23575105<br>
Date: 1 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Margaria Luca<br>
Abstract: Rosenzweig e Levinas pensano la Rivelazione di Dio nella storia richiamandosi su diversi aspetti, anche se con sottolineature specifiche. Per la tradizione ebraica il problema di Dio e della possibilità della sua rivelazione è di sapere come Egli agisca nei confronti dell'uomo. Per Rosenzweig, il riferimento alla vita vissuta apre la possibilità di un pensiero nuovo, dove il tempo diventa l'altro del soggetto. Allo stesso modo, per Levinas il soggetto e il suo potere richiamano, nell'incontro con l'altro, ad un Altro. Entrambi gli autori mettono quindi in risalto la centralità della chiamata dell'uomo all'obbedienza. Per Rosenzweig però, la Rivelazione di Dio è legata al comandamento dell'amore del prossimo, che è legato all'amore di Dio. Per Levinas invece, il rapporto con Dio si riduce al suo aver donato la legge agli uomini. Rosenzweig and Levinas reflect on the revelation of God in history drawing on different aspects of the question and offering different emphases. In both of these authors we recognize how it is central to Jewish tradition to reflect on the problem of God and on the possibility of his revelation by reflecting on the question of just how it is that he acts towards man. For Rosenzweig, a reference to life as lived opens the possibility of a new way of thinking where time becomes the 'other' that confronts the subject. Similarly, for Levinas the ability that the subject has to recall an encounter with the 'other' enables an openness to an encounter with the 'Other'. In each of these authors we witness a stress on man's call to obedience. However, for Rosenzweig, the revelation of God is linked to the commandment of love of one's neighbor, which is tied to God's love for us; for Levinas the relationship with God is reduced to his having given the law to men.<br>

Publisher: AKADÉMIAI KIADÓ<br>
Issue: i23656603<br>
Date: 1 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Simon Róbert<br>
Abstract: The different approaches to the problem of sin frequently attributed to it an ethical connotation which would have assigned its role and place even in the history of religions. These approaches supposed implicitly a closer or looser connection between religion and ethics. The present author's historico-philological investigation, after having compared some basic linguistic and historical data of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, came to the conclusion that the early forms of the sin perceptions had not yet belonged to the sphere of ethics, while those forms which developed in early modern times have not become part of ethics. Evil and sin were originally associated with religion, later on, however, the judgement of sins has been taken over by the secularised law.<br>

Publisher: PRESSES UNIVERSITAIRES DE FRANCE<br>
Issue: i23662339<br>
Date: 12 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): BOURETZ PIERRE<br>
Abstract: Centrée sur l'élaboration d'un système de la religion à partir des sources du judaïsme, la dernière pensée de Hermann Cohen repose sur le concept de fils de Noé. Avec lui, Cohen réfute la thèse de Spinoza sur la nature politique de la loi juive, montrant que non seulement elle préserve la pureté du monothéisme, mais pose les fondements du droit naturel moderne. Articulant après Maïmonide les notions d'étranger, de résident et de fils de Noé, la Religion de la raison construit un lien systématique entre les concept d'autrui et d'humanité universelle. Elle ouvre ainsi l'espace où s'inscriront de manières différentes Franz Rosenzweig, Leo Strauss ou Emmanuel Lévinas. Focused on the drawing up of a system of religion by the sources of judaism, Cohen's last philosophy is based on the concept of the Sons of Noah. With it, he disproves Spinoza's thesis about Jewish law's political nature. He shows that not only this law preserves the purity of monotheism, but also gives the foundation for modern natural right. Because Cohen, after Maimonides, builts an articulation between the notions of the stranger, the resident alien and the sons of Noah, Religion of the Reason promotes a systematic link between the concepts of the other man and the universal hunanity. It opens the way for the philosophy of Rosenzweig, Strauss, or Levinas.<br>

Publisher: Franz Steiner Verlag<br>
Issue: i23676353<br>
Date: 1 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): Sabete Wagdi<br>
Abstract: This article aims at explaining, on the one hand, the inadequacy of the formalist positivist method in answering the essential questions of constitutional Law, such as the validity of the constitutional norm, the sovereignty of the people which comes before the original constitutional act and the effects of a theory of values on the limitation of the revision power. On the other hand, it proposes an onto-axiological approach, which refers to the Philosophy of Law. A relevant methodology of constitutional science of Liberty helps the specialists to follow the progress of knowledge. It puts forward means for approaching the subject matter of science (the norm), the constitutional environment and the theoretical basis of the norm. Following this proposed method would help not only in describing the norms but also in checking their validity, their justification and their imperfection when compared with their aims. These thought processes are a never ending search, that is to say a characteristic of science itself.<br>

Publisher: Franz Steiner Verlag<br>
Issue: i23676311<br>
Date: 1 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Dédeyan Daniel<br>
Abstract: Departing from the disconcerting tact that the only passage where Kant mentions court practice is in a chapter on art, the essay undertakes a reconstruction of Kant's esthetics. As to beauty, the judgment of taste appears as a judgment on the ability to judge, and it is universally valid not because it is true, but because it is communicable. Kant's notion of art turns out to be the autonomous discourse of taste as his notion of morality stands for autonomy of man and his notion of law for autonomy of civil society. However, Kant's esthetical experience of the sublime as appearance of what neither mind nor senses grasp breaks up harmony and autonomy and unjudges judgment. At this point, the essay uncovers an intrinsically destabilizing force of Kant's ‚reason‘, traces the consequences for the judicial judgment and gives a perspective to philosophy of law within a differentiated society.<br>

Abstract: Language and judicial activities are both signs of the existence of a society. There is, therefore, good reason for a dialogue between the science of language and the science of law. This article applies a linguistic theory of the Paris School (semiotics) to the examination of a legal text, namely a contract. The author points to some elements shared by legal and other texts, and demonstrates how a semiotic interpretation can provide interesting and unexpected insights into the deeper levels of a legal text. He concludes that a similar approach could fruitfully be used with other types of legal text.<br>

Abstract: In this contribution, an endogenous conception of law is defended which can be deployed in regard of different scales of time and domains of the law. In this article, the focus is mainly on labor law. In the first part, a history of the French employment contract law is presented by proposing a grid of its foundations and evolution from the distinction of different principles of justice generating conventions. The change of conventions and its impact on law is precisely treated. In a second part, the recent evolution of this law will be exposed by showing the key role played by legal intermediaries in the contractualization of the working relationship, based on a database of employment contracts. It is shown how lawyers can generate an increasing strategic use of law, disconnected from territorialized conventions, if they do not play their role of mediator between different logics. In the conclusion, the emergence of a transnational law and the transformation of the lawyer profession are questioned.<br>

Abstract: In Reformational philosophy the term 'structure' can be used in two different senses: It could
refer to the factual or subject-side of reality and is then used in the sense of the structure of
reality. It could also refer to the law-side of reality, i.e. the structural laws governing and
conditioning the regularities perceived in phenomena. Then it is understood in the sense of the
structure for reality. When the term 'structure mapping' is used in this article it refers primarily
to the latter sense of the term, although it is conceded that analysis of the structures for reality
are inextricably bound to the analysis of the structures of reality.<br>

Abstract: Dooyeweerd recognizes the problem, to be sure, when he asks, 'Is sinful reality still mean-
ing?' And then he acknowledges: 'Here we indeed touch the deepest problem of Christian
philosophy'. But the answer follows, without restriction and without hesitation, on the same
page: 'Sinful reality remains apostate meaning under the law and under the curse of God's
wrath' (A New Critique, vol. 2, p. 33). The 'Why?' of the Crucified One and so many cross
bearers finds no echo here.<br>

Publisher: Brill<br>
Issue: i24708591<br>
Date: 1 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): Seerveld Calvin<br>
Abstract: Scripture crédits its writing as well as the spoken word of Christ with life-bringing truth
requiring obedience; e.g., John 2:22. Romans 15:4, I Corinthians 10:11, Révélation 1:3).
The old Marcion heresy of pitting Spirit against Letter, appealing to II Corinthians 3:6,
mistakes the antithesis Paul wants to drive home in the episües. Because Christ is the
fulfillment of the Mosaic law rather than its abolishment (Matthew 5:17-20), our life is to be
a letter from Christ inscribed (επιστολή... εγγεγραμμένη) by the very spirit of the living
God (II Corinthians 3). The correct opposition Paul draws is that between an obedience
marked by Itteral circumcision or by circumclsion of the heart, a Spirit-humbled, holy
writings-directed life (cf. Romans 2:25-29, 10:5-13, II Timothy 3:14-17). Gottlob Schrenk's
exegesis is not wholly sound, I think, but the exposition is fine and complete on γράφω, in
Tbeologtscbes Wörterbuch zum Neuen Testament, ed. G. Kittel (Stuttgart: Verlag von W.
Kohlhammer, 1933), 1:743-73, especially pp. 764-69.<br>

Date: 1 1, 1993<br>
Author(s): Blosser Philip<br>
Abstract: Indeed, Dooyeweerd in some contexts seems to suggest this, which would conflict
fundamentally with the implications of his belief in the resurrection of the body. Reporting
on a conversation with Dooyeweerd in Amsterdam in June, 1964, Steen says that he asked
Dooyeweerd "whether he thought that the fact that Paul speaks of faith abiding in I Cor. 13
after the judgment day, had any bearing on whether the function of faith would abide after
judgment. Dooyeweerd gave an interesting reply. First he said, 'faith turns into sight and
therefore faith passes away.' When I mentioned the fact that Paul emphasizes that faith
abides, he stressed the fact that we really know nothing about the future after the judgment.
When I then asked how it would be possible to conceive of a resurrected man without all the
functions and the law spheres holding, he seemed to reconsider his previous statement and
agree that I was laying my finger on an important point." (Steen, Structure, p. 85)<br>

Author(s): Glas Gerrit<br>
Abstract: 'Emergence' is meant in the sense that in the course of evolution structures sponta-
neously developed that, compared to existing structures, are conceptually or ontically of a
qualitatively different order. Within the continuity of the evolution process, then, something
new emerges. Stafleu is no evolutionist in the sense that evolution theory is his worldview; he
does adhere to the theory of evolution. As he sees it, systematic reformational philosophy has
concerned itself far too little with the issue of evolution. Stafleu holds that evolution is often
mistakenly taken to mean that the emergence of new structures, biotic structures for example,
can be explained via the laws for existing structures, in other words, by physical-chemical laws.
Approached in this way, the irreducibility of the modal aspects is at issue (the classical
objection from the side of reformational philosophy). The problem however dissolves entirely
as long as law and that which is subjected to it are not mixed. The laws for new structures are
not themselves a product of evolution; they become operational once the situation is ready for
them.<br>

Article Title: Can Histories be True? Narrativism, Positivism, and the "Metaphorical Turn"<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i342994<br>
Date: 10 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): Nelson Chris<br>
Abstract: Narrativism, as represented by Hayden White and Frank Ankersmit, can fruitfully be analyzed as an inversion of two brands of positivism. First, narrativist epistemology can be regarded as an inversion of empiricism. Its thesis that narratives function as metaphors which do not possess a cognitive content is built on an empiricist, "picture view" of knowledge. Moreover, all the non-cognitive aspects attributed to narrative as such are dependent on this picture theory of knowledge and a picture theory of representation. Most of the epistemological characteristics that White and Ankersmit attribute to historical narratives therefore share the problems of this picture theory. The article's second thesis is that the theories of narrative explanation can also fruitfully be analyzed as inversions of positivist covering-law theory. Ankersmit's brand of narrativism is the most radical in this respect because it posits an opposition between narrative and causal modes of comprehension while simultaneously eliminating causality from narrativist historical understanding. White's brand of narrativism is more of a hybrid than is Ankersmit's as far as its theory of explanation is concerned; nevertheless, it can also be fruitfully interpreted as an inversion of covering-law theory, replacing it by an indefinite multitude of explanatory strategies. Most of the striking characteristics of both White's and Ankersmit's narrativism presuppose positivism in these two senses, especially their claim that historical narratives have a metaphorical structure and therefore no truth-value. These claims are hard to reconcile with the factual characteristics of debates by historians; this problem can be tracked down to the absence in "metaphorical" narrativism of a conceptual connection between historical narratives and historical research.<br>

Author(s): Morris Rosalind C.<br>
Abstract: This article considers the legacies of Jacques Derrida in and for Anglo-American sociocultural anthropology. It begins with a survey of Derrida's own engagement with themes that have historically been foundational to the field: (a) the critique of sign theory and, with it, the questions of language and law in Lévi-Straussian structuralism; (b) the question of the unconscious; (c) the critique of the performative and its consequences for the idea of ritual; (d) the rereading of Marcel Mauss's concept of the gift, and of economy more generally; and (e) the analysis of the metaphysical basis of law, in both religious and ostensibly secular formations. It then considers the state of the field at the time when it was being infused with different forms of poststructuralism and explores the competing claims made by these discourses in relation to deconstruction. Finally, after tracing the convergences and divergences between Derridean deconstruction and theory in sociocultural anthropology, it treats two main examples of works produced against and under the influence of Derrida's thought, respectively.<br>

Abstract: There are, of course, discussions of this sort in a variety of modern moral and political
theories. For example Onora O'Neill has given accounts of this issue from a strongly
Kantian perspective, and the notion of reasonableness and what it leads to plays a central
role in John Finnis's influential rearticulation of Natural Law theory. See Onora O'Neill,
'Vindicating Reason', in The Cambridge Companion to Kant, ed. Paul Guyer (Cambridge,
1992); and John Finnis, Natural Law and Natural Rights (Oxford, 1980). The beginnings
of my own approach to this question can be found in Political Theory, Modernity and
Postmodernity, Chs. 3 and 4.<br>

Abstract: Many Natural Law theorists thought that God could not rightly violate or alter
principles of justice, but argued instead that there must be independent moral grounds to
which even God would have to appeal for justification. Hugo Grotius expressed an early
form of the idea in 1625, in the Prolegomena to his De lure Belli ac Pads. Other Natural
Law theorists of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, who expounded variations of
the doctrine, include Samuel von Pufendorf (De lure Nature et Gentium Librii Octo,
1672), Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui (Principes du droit naturel, 1747), and Emerich de
Vattel (Le Droit des Gens, 1758). See A.P. d'Entrèves, Natural Law (London, 1951),
ch. 3; cf. Voltaire, 'Remerciement sincère à un homme charitable', in Vol. V of
Montesquieu's De l'Esprit des lois (Paris, 1816 [1750]), pp. 257-62. See also John
Haldane, 'Religious Toleration', Synthesis Philosophica, 17 (1994), pp. 21-6, pp. 24-5;

Article Title: CONFLITTO DI ORDINAMENTI E CONFLITTO DI PARADIGMI IN ANTONIO PIGLIARU<br>
Publisher: Leo S. Olschki<br>
Issue: e26233631<br>
Date: 4 1, 2013<br>
Author(s): Riccardo Gaetano<br>
Abstract: This paper aims to stress the anthropological relevance of
         La vendetta barbaricina come ordinamento giuridico(1959), the most famous Antonio Pigliaru’s book, by showing some methodological affinities with Mauss’sEssai sur le don. The author maintains that, exactly as it was affirmed by Alain Caillé in this latter case, it is possible to single out a sort of “third paradigm” operating in Pigliaru’s analysis ofvendettain traditional Sardinia. To emphasize this feature of Pigliaru’s book also allows us to throw a fresh look at the lasting but often unprofitable debate concerning the most appropriate label – Law or Anthropology – for defining the subject of his most important work.<br>

Article Title: Between Decision and Deliberation: Political Paradox in Democratic Theory<br>
Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i27644419<br>
Date: 2 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Honig Bonnie<br>
Abstract: Deliberative democratic theorists (in this essay, Seyla Benhabib and Jurgen Habermas) seek to resolve, manage, or transcend paradoxes of democratic legitimation or constitutional democracy. Other democratic theorists, such as Chantal Mouffe, embrace such paradoxes and affirm their irreducibility. Deliberativists call that position "decisionism." This essay examines the promise and limits of these various efforts by way of a third paradox: Rousseau's paradox of politics, whose many workings are traced through Book II, Chapter 7 of the Social Contract. This last paradox cannot be resolved, transcended, managed, or even affirmed as an irreducible binary conflict. The paradox of politics names not a clash between two logics or norms but a vicious circle of chicken-and-egg (which comes first—good people or good law?). It has the happy effect of reorienting democratic theory: toward the material conditions of political practice, the unavoidable will of the people who are also always a multitude, and the not only regulative but also productive powers of law.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i27646172<br>
Date: 12 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Wyschogrod Edith<br>
Abstract: Mass death resulting from war, starvation, and disease as well as the vicissitudes of extreme poverty and enforced sexual servitude are recognizably pandemic ills of the contemporary world. In light of their magnitude, are repentance, regret for the harms inflicted upon others or oneself, and forgiveness, proferring the erasure of the guilt of those who have inflicted these harms, rendered nugatory? Jacques Derrida claims that forgiveness is intrinsically rather than circumstantially or historically impossible. Forgiveness, trapped in a paradox, is possible only if there is such a thing as the unforgivable. "Thus, forgiveness, if there is such a thing," can only exist as exempt from the law of the possible. Does this claim not open the way for hopelessness and despair? More troubling for Derrida is his concession that forgiveness may be necessary in the realm of the political and juridical. If so, is not the purity of the impossibility of forgiveness so crucial for him, contaminated? In pointing to some of the difficulties in Derrida's position, I shall appeal to Vladimir Jankelevitch's distinction between the unforgivable and the inexcusable. I shall also consider the significance of repentance in the theological ethics of Emmanuel Levinas and Max Scheler. Forgiveness, I conclude, is vacuous without expiation, a position that can be helpfully understood in the context of Judaism's analysis of purification and acquittal in the Day of Atonement liturgy. I argue that what disappears is Derrida's assurance of the impossibility of forgiveness, a disappearance that allows for hope.<br>

Publisher: University of Wisconsin Press<br>
Issue: i30157392<br>
Date: 7 1, 1984<br>
Author(s): McDonald William C.<br>
Abstract: Hie vor dô wir kinder wâren by Der Wilde Alexander (fl. 1250) proceeds from the words of St. Paul: "Even so we, when we were children [nepioi], were in bondage under the elements of the world" (Galatians 4:3). Accordingly, the "Kindheitslied" is no nostalgic song of retrospection in the form of sacred, didactic allegory (a gloss is absent), but rather is an extended scriptural analogy addressing the change from the Old Law to the New. The words dô and nu (1,1 and 1,7) reflect New Testament rhetoric. The biblical echo in the opening line permits immediate identification; thus Alexander relies neither on progressive unveiling of his message nor on a language or ciphers. The "Kindheitslied" can be profitably discussed in conjunction with the body of literature on the encounter of Church and Synagogue.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur argues that it is in fact obe-
dience to the law that is evil, and not transgression of the law:
Evil in moral consciousness is essentially transgression, that is, subversion of a law; it
is in this way that the majority of pious men continue to consider sin. And yet, situ-
ated before God, evil is qualitatively changed; it consists less in a transgression of a
law than in a pretension of man to be master of his life. The will to live according to
the law is, therefore, also an expression of evil - and even the most deadly, because
the most dissimulated: worse than injustice is one's own justice. Ethical conscious-
ness does not know this, but religious consciousness does. (438)<br>

Publisher: Presses de la Fondation nationale des sciences politiques<br>
Issue: i290822<br>
Date: 6 1, 1972<br>
Author(s): Deleuze Philippe<br>
Abstract: En janvier 1972, dans la France de Georges Pompidou, aux derniers feux de la "nouvelle société" promise depuis Matignon par Jacques Chaban-Delmas, "casseurs" et "gauchistes" sont déjà hors-jeu. Mais le "front des luttes" post-68 se déplace. Les prisonniers entrent en scène, à Toul en décembre 1971 puis à Nancy, ouvrant une mise en accusation de la justice dont le témoignage du docteur Vasseur en 2000 a bien montré que l'instruction n'était pas achevée. Les historiens entreprennent aujourd'hui, sur archives et témoignages, l'exploration de ce lancinant procès. Voici un des premiers exemples de leur travail, au ras des faits et des interprétations d'époque. Dans le sillage des luttes de l'après-68, des prisonniers de droit commun se mobilisèrent à partir de 1971. La mutinerie de Nancy en janvier 1972 fut réprimée mais suscita une mobilisation à l'intérieur et à l'extérieur des prisons françaises. L'auteur l'analyse notamment à partir des archives du Groupe d'information sur les prisons (GIP), mais aussi de la presse et de diverses enquêtes. Le GIP, où militaient aussi des intellectuels de renom, prit ainsi une part importante dans la mise à jour de la réalité carcérale, à l'occasion de ce qui fut le premier grand procès de la prison. /// In the wake of the post-1968 struggles, common law prisoners started mobilizing as of 1971. The Nancy mutiny in January 1972 was repressed, but it brought about mobilization inside and outside French prisons. The author analyzes this from the records of the Prison Information Group (GIP) but also from those of the press and various investigations. The GIP, in which famous intellectuals actively participated, had a big role in showing prison reality clearly in what was the first big prison trial.<br>

Author(s): Warren Judith<br>
Abstract: Looking at the metaphorical similarities between abortion statutes and copyright law reveals reproductive laws' stake in property ideologies. "Fair use" provisions in copyright law are analogous to abortion rights, delimiting the extent to which a non-owner (one who copies, a mother) can exert control over material "belonging" to another. The similarity suggests that the way to understand abortion fury is as a manifestation of property rights.<br>

Article Title:  The Subversive Nature of Virtue in the Mahābhārata: A Tale about Women, Smelly Ascetics, and God <br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion, Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i40000336<br>
Date: 3 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Dhand Arti<br>
Abstract: This article focuses on one key episode of the great Hindu epic, the Mahābhārata: the scene in the first book in which the Bhārata widows Ambikā and Ambālikā are impregnated by their brother-in-law, Vyāsa. The article is composed of two parts. The first examines narratives surrounding the practice of niyoga, or levirate, and reflects on its significance to the construction of the epic plot. The second reflects on the personality and motives of Vyāsa, uncompromising brother-in-law, formidable sage, and near-divine author of the text. The link between the two parts is important for unpacking a key religious orientation of the Mahābhārata. The article argues that Vyāsa's curse of the Bhārata widows is not idiosyncratic but, rather, is a stern example of the author's specific interpretation of virtue, which in turn bespeaks the overarching religious worldview of the text--the karmayogic ideal of equanimity.<br>

Author(s): Bernstein John Andrew<br>
Abstract: Shaftesbury's deism, widely representative of eighteenth-century liberal theology, may be profitably viewed as a reaction against Puritanism in particular and Pauline theology in general. Seen from this perspective, it implies, without explicitly asserting, a reduction of moral standards from the infinite conception of moral law characteristic of Protestantism. Shaftesbury showed no appreciation of the need for redemption or forgiveness, and changed the emphasis in religion from devotion to God above all else to a purely anthropocentric morality which God merely supported. But, in spite of the crudity of his theology and the dubious implications of his ethics, Shaftesbury sought to combat some of the harmful psychological effects to which Paulinism might lead when received in the wrong spirit, and manifested genuine religious insight in this effort.<br>

Date: 3 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Wall John<br>
Abstract: Challenging a long-standing assumption of the separation of ethical from poetic activity, this essay develops the basis for a theory of moral life as inherently and radically creative. A range of contemporary post-Kantian ethicists--including Ricoeur, Nussbaum, Kearney, and Gutiérrez--are employed to make the argument that moral practice requires a fundamental capability for creative transformation, imagination, and social renewal. In addition, this poetic moral capability can finally be understood only from the primordial religious point of view of the mystery of Creation as such. Humanity as an image of its Creator is called to the endless impossible possibility of the re-creation of its own complex, plural, and fallen social world. Such a perspective is opposed to views of moral life as the application of law-like principles or the recovery of past moral histories. Without a better understanding of moral life's radically creative imperative, we miss a vital element of social relations' distinctive humanity.<br>

Author(s): Toma J. Douglas<br>
Abstract: With the rise of alternative inquiry paradigms across academic fields, faculty within the same academic departments choose to ground themselves within different intellectual traditions and distinct academic cultures, not simply those parallel to the positivist tradition. One illustration of the emerging paradigmatic pluralism across academe is the actual paradigm choice by individual scholars. Appreciating these paradigm choices is critical if we are to interpret the faculty work and faculty culture that shape institutional culture and influence resource allocation at universities and colleges. Using qualitative methods, I focus upon a single discipline in my exploratory study, law, but extend these concepts and issues in analyzing and interpreting my findings to how they might apply to faculty working in other academic fields.<br>

Abstract: O autor partindo de textos-base de instituições internacionais, como a O.C.D.E. e a UNESCO, e sobretudo da Lei de Bases do Sistema Educativo Português (L.B.S.E.) ensaia o modo como eles, com especial destaque para o texto da L.B.S.E., possam garantir a pluralidade do pensar na instituição escolar. Por outras palavras, tenta-se dar subsídios que assegurem, pelo menos teoricamente, a formação de uma consciência educativa (democrática) contraposta à lógica reducionista e positivista que sempre tem caracterizado esse mesmo tipo de consciência. Igualmente é apontado que, muito provavelmene, só uma "co-gestão" escolar, tal como o conceito é habitualmente entendido, é possível de garantir o re-nascimento e mesmo a sobrevivência do espírito democrático educacional. /// Sur la base de textes-clés d'institutions internationales tels que l'OCDE ou l'UNESCO, et surtout à partir de la Loi Cadre du Système Educatif Portugais, l'auteur vérifie la façon dont ces textes, et spécialement ce dernier, peuvent garantir la pluralité des idées dans l'institution scolaire. En d'autres termes, on s'efforce de fournir une contribution pour garantir au moins théoriquement la formation d'une conscience. De même, on souligne que très probablement seule une "co-gestion" scolaire ainsi qu'on l'entend habituellement est susceptible de garantir la "renaissance" et même la survie de l'esprit démocratique en matière d'éducation. /// On the bases of fundamental texts of international institutions (O. C. D. E. and UNESCO) and chiefly of the law which determines the Portuguese Educational System (L. B. S. E.), the author seeks to examine the guarantees of having plurality of thought in educational institutions. In other words, there is attempt to suggest ways by which — at least theoretically — the formation of the democratic educational consciousness can be maintained against positivist positions. It is also suggested that only a co-administered education can guarantee the rebirth and even the survival~<br>

Article Title: Lonergan and Girard on Sacralization and Desacralization<br>
Publisher: Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia<br>
Issue: i40014514<br>
Date: 12 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Doran Robert M.<br>
Abstract: The paper appeals to Rene Girard for help in specifying what might be meant by four categories suggested by Bernard Lonergan: (1) a sacralization to be dropped and (2) a sacralization to be fostered; (3) a secularization to be welcomed and (4) a secularization to be resisted. The key text that is analyzed with Girard's help is Lonergan's paper "Sacralization and Secularization," where these cateories are introduced. Key to the discrimination of the sacred is the Law of the Cross, which is here amplified by Guard's analysis of the single victim mechanism and its reversal, as these are definitively revealed in the passion, death, and resurrection of Jesus. But key to the discrimination of the secular are Lonergan's transcendental precepts, which are a specification of nature as a genuine category, one that would enhance Girard's mimetic theory. Lonergan and Girard are judged to be complementary and mutually supportive. /// O presente artigo busca auxílio na obra de René Girard em ordem a especificar o possível significado de quatro categorias sugeridas por Bernard Lonergan: (1) uma sacralização a ser rejeitada e (2) uma sacralização a ser promovida; (3) uma secularização a ser acolhida e (4) uma secularização que deve ser resistida. O textochave a ser analisado com a ajuda de Girard é o artigo de Lonergan "Sacralização e Secularização", no qual estas quatro categorias são introduzidas. A chave para o discernimento do Sagrado é a Lei da Cruz, a qual neste artigo é amplificada mediante a análise girardiana do mecanismo victimário e da sua superação, tal como eles são definitivamente revelados na paixão, morte e ressurreição de Jesus. Mas a chave para o discernimento do secular encontra-se nos preceitos transcendentais de Lonergan, os quais são uma especificação da natureza como categoria genuína, uma que é capaz de aprofundar a teoria mimética girardiana. Em suma, o artigo mostra de que modo Lonergan e Girard devem ser considerados complementares e suportadores um do ou~<br>

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i40016648<br>
Date: 1 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Sperl Stefan<br>
Abstract: Classical Arabic Ḥadīth literature is largely composed of micronarratives recording the sayings and deeds of the Prophet Muhammad. This study seeks to examine their literary form by focusing on selected examples listed in the canonical Hadīth compendia under the heading of adab, a term which may be rendered here as "practical ethics" but which is also commonly used to designate classical Arabic belles-lettres. While the latter is a type of literature quite distinct from the literature of Hadīth the texts here studied point to a certain interface between them. The ethical dimension of adab as it appears in Hadith is examined further in the light of Haydon White's theory on the relation between narrativity and law. Contrasting the micro-narrative of Ḥadīth with the "macronarrative" of the epic provides further insight into its approach to adab and serves to highlight its distinct literary and religious aesthetic.<br>

Author(s): Saavedra Marco Estrada<br>
Abstract: Las reflexiones filosófico-políticas de este ensayo discuten la idea de que la política se fundamenta en la mentira. En contra de esta creencia generalizada, el autor afirma que, si fuera el caso, ni la política ni la democracia serían posibles. Aún más: se postula que la política y la mentira son incompatibles. En el texto se abogan, entonces, por la verdad como fundamento de una cultura de transparencia en la democracia, que ciudadanos, políticos y funcionarios públicos —es decir, todos aquellos preocupados por el interés público— deben compartir y fomentar si es que no quieren poner en riesgo la salud de la república. La mentira como práctica diaria en la polis pone en peligro la transición a la democracia al socavar las bases de la solidaridad civil y de la constitución de un Estado de derecho. /// The philosophical-political considerations of this essay discuss the idea that politics is founded upon lying. Against this widespread belief, the author argues that, if this is true, neither politics nor democracy would be possible. Again, he states that politics and lying are incompatible. The text defends the idea that in a democracy truth is the foundation of a culture of transparency, which citizens, politicians, and officials, i.e., all those concerned with the public interest, must share and foster if they want to safeguard public well being. Lying as a daily practice in public life (polis) endangers democratic transitions by undermining the basis of civil solidarity and the rule of law.<br>

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to outline Ricoeur's outlook on the basis of ethics and on the main elements to shape the ethical intention. Although this topic is not to the fore in his thought, Ricoeur has often raised the ethical problematic and delivered most valuable insights into it. We explain how he let a subjective, intersubjective and neutral moment precede the relationship between freedom and law. We also inquire into his vision on values and on the impact and meaning of evil for ethics. The ground of ethical existence is the fact that man basically is original affirmation of being which manifests itself in longing and striving. This dynamic facticity which is only discoverable through a reflection upon the works and creations of man, represents the starting-point for an autonomous ethics having a historical character. In this way, Ricoeur - in the main stream of J. Nabert - turns against I. Kant whose duty ethics misjudges the basic dialectic of human action. Besides, this starting-point allows ethics to meet the Christian kerygma in a more meaningful way than duty ethics is in a position to it. For the kerygma sacralizes no ethical interdiction but situates man into a history of salvation and proclaims healing and fulfilment to man's longing. A second and decisive moment in ethical existence is the appearance of the other. When the other enters into my life, he calls me up to foster mine and his freedom als well. The other becomes a centre of obligation to me, and I am called up to promote the well being of all mankind. Ricoeur also points out that the very norm of morality is man both as an individual and communitarian being. Furthermore, as human freedom is always mediated, we should fully take into account the economic, political and cultural reality which is ethically most relevant. The practice of freedom raises the question of values. Ricoeur rejects any voluntaristic and essentialistic view. Values are immanent requirements of freedom in its effort ~<br>

Abstract: Cassirer faisait de la connaissance le point culminant du « processus d'objectivation de l'esprit » se révélant ainsi progressivement à soi-même à travers la spécificité de ses diverses configurations symboliques. Nous nous proposons d'élucider ici la loi de constitution propre aux sciences exactes à partir des principales figures de la physique moderne pour nous élever à une philosophie de la culture scientifique et dégager les principaux problèmes que pose sa réalisation comme « Weltbegriff ». Cassirer considered Knowledge as the terminating point of the « process of objectification » of human spirit that leads progressively to its self-consciousness through the differential specificity of symbolic forms. We are mainly concerned here with trying to clear up the constitutive law proper to exact sciences. Our analysis starts from the main figures of modern physics as its starting point in order to set our thought on a philosophy of scientifical culture and to draw the main problems related to its achievement as « Weltbegriff ».<br>

Abstract: En réaction au libéralisme rawlsien pour qui le droit est référé à la liberté d'action des individus, le mouvement communautarien a voulu référer le droit à l'identité culturelle (individuelle ou collective), lui assignant, ultimement, la fonction de stabiliser cette identité. Pour ces auteurs, le lien entre identité et droit est interne, ce qui ouvre la voie à ce qu'on a appelé « les paradoxes de l'identité démocratique » et conduit à la notion problématique de droits collectifs. On montrera ici comment une telle notion repose sur une « réduction identitaire » , par principe opérée au point de vue objectivant de la troisième personne, privant par là même les acteurs sociaux de leur capacité d'autodétermination, À cette vision anti-libérale dans son fondement, qui fait de la sécurité identitaire son horizon, on opposera la vision d'une identité risquée qui ne préjuge pas dogmatiquement des constituants identitaires de chacun et ouvre ainsi la voie aux authentiques principes de la coexistence multiculturelle. In reaction to Rawlsian liberalism, which relates law to freedom of action, the Communitarian movement wants to relate law to cultural identity (individual or collective), assigning it, ultimately, the function to stabilize this identity. For Communitarianism the relationship between identity and law is internal, which opens the path to what has been called « the paradoxes of democratic identity » , and leads to the problematic notion of « collective rights » . It is shown here how such a notion rests on an « identity-reduction » , which by principle is operated from a third-person perspective, depriving individuals of their capacity of self-determination. In opposition to this fundamentally anti-liberal vision, the notion of an open identity is proposed, which doesn't dogmatically predetermine the identities of everyone and opens therefore the path to the basic principles of a multicultural coexistence.<br>

Abstract: Juriste de formation logicienne, longtemps influencé par le positivisme logique, Chaim Perelman a d'abord pensé qu'il était possible d'étendre l'analyse du raisonnement formel à l'argumentation pratique, juridique et morale. L'abandon de ce projet est ce qui l'a conduit à redécouvrir la topique juridique et à proposer, sous le titre de « nouvelle rhétorique », un retour à la Rhétorique et aux Topiques d'Aristote. As a jurist with a background in logics who was influenced by logical positivism for a long time, Chaim Perelman first thought that the analysis of formal reasoning could be extended to practical argumentation in the field of law and ethics. Renouncing this idea was what allowed him to rediscover juridical topics and to go back to Aristotle's Topics and Rhetorics under the name of « new rhetorics ».<br>

Article Title: The Rule of Law or the Rule of Politics? Harmonizing the Internal and External Views of Supreme Court Decision Making<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>

Author(s): White Stephen M.<br>
Abstract: Law professors and political scientists generally subscribe to opposed theories of Supreme Court decision making. Law professors, to a great degree, adhere to an internal view: Supreme Court justices decide cases according to legal rules, principles, and precedents. Political scientists follow an external view: justices decide cases according to their political ideologies or preferences. This article develops an interpretive-structural theory that harmonizes these seemingly opposed views. This interpretive-structural theory not only explains why the internal and external views often are both effective but also why, sometimes, one approach might be more effective than the other. The article concludes by comparing the interpretive-structural theory with the "new institutionalism" that is emerging in political science.<br>

Abstract: La catégorie de « temporalisation » est omniprésente dans les textes fondateurs de la Begriffsgeschichte koselleckienne. Elle renvoie à la question générale de la temporalité humaine et au problème épistémologique des temporalités historiques en particulier. Elle constitue en outre, pour Koselleck, un cadre interprétatif fondamental de notre modernité politique. Ce texte revient sur ces différents problèmes en reconstruisant la « théorie générale de l'expérience historique » qui se trouve à l'arrière-plan. Un inventaire des usages analytiques de la catégorie de « temporalisation » est ensuite proposé. Par là même, le schème de la « temporalisation » apparaît comme un processus global traversant notre modernité politique, en interaction avec d'autres processus englobants, qu'il s'agit aujourd'hui de tenter de typologiser dans la continuité certes, mais au-delà du cadre koselleckien initial. Soucieux de faire apparaître, en les distinguant et articulant ensemble, les différents niveaux d'analyse mis en œuvre par l'entreprise même de l'histoire des langages politiques modernes, cet article tente de réengager le dialogue entre l'histoire (structurelle, culturelle et événementielle) et les sciences politiques en reconnaissant un statut causal propre aux idées politiques et religieuses modernes, à la philosophie politique et juridique moderne, à l'inertie des sémantiques historiques sur la longue durée : toutes choses qui ne peuvent être causalement, et partant disciplinairement, disqualifiées que parce que l'on part d'une vision étriquée et pauvre de ce qu'est l'expérience de l'histoire. The notion of 'temporalization' is one of the key concepts in the Koselleckian Begriffsgeschichte. It refers to the general issue of human temporality and more specifically to the epistemological problem of historical temporalities. In Koselleck's writings, it constitutes a fundamental interpretative framework for political modernity as a whole. This article returns to these different is~<br>

Author(s): Zukin Fred<br>
Abstract: To understand the rise of market fundamentalism from the margins of influence to mainstream hegemony, we compare the U.S. 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunities Reconciliation Act and the English 1834 New Poor Law-two episodes in which existing welfare regimes were overturned by market-driven ones. Despite dramatic differences across the cases, both outcomes were mobilized by "the perversity thesis "-a public discourse that reassigned blame for the poor's condition from "poverty to perversity." We use the term "ideational embeddedness" to characterize the power of such ideas to shape, structure, and change market regimes. The success of the perversity thesis is based on the foundations of social naturalism, theoretical realism, and the conversion narrative. In the poverty to perversity conversion narrative, structural blame for poverty is discredited as empiricist appearance while the real problem is attributed to the corrosive effects of welfare's perverse incentives on poor people themselves-they become sexually promiscuous, thrust aside personal responsibility, and develop long-term dependency. This claim enables market fundamentalism to delegitimate existing ideational regimes, to survive disconfirming data, and to change the terms of debate from social problems to the timeless forces of nature and biology. Coupling economic sociology with a sociology of ideas, we argue that ideas count; but not all ideas are created equal. Only some have the capacity to fuel radical transformations in the ideational embeddedness of markets.<br>

Abstract: O artigo procura discutir a contribuição da perspectiva antropológica para a análise de conflitos, contrastando a ênfase da Antropologia na pesquisa empírica com a orientação predominantemente doutrinária que caracteriza o Direito. Dialogando com textos de repercussão significativa na Antropologia do Direito, o artigo realça a importância da dimensão simbólica dos direitos, caracterizada como aspecto central do universo empírico investigado, e sem a qual demandas por direitos, acordos e decisões judiciais não podem ser adequadamente compreendidos. The article makes a brief assessment of the contribution of Anthropology's perspective to the analysis of conflicts, contrasting Anthropology's emphasis in empirical research with the doctrinarian approach that predominates in Law. Drawing on significant texts in the Anthropology of Law, the article highlights the symbolic dimension of rights, characterized as a core aspect of empirical data, and without which demands for rights, judicial agreements and decisions cannot be adequately understood.<br>

Abstract: Can the act of creation itself be considered like an infinite forgiveness that God turns to the earth and to those who live there after having preferred the waters as his place of first existence? The conference "In the beginning it was the forgiveness" held in L'Aquila in the occasion of a pluriconfessional meeting, suggests some hypothesis starting even from some biblical episodes like: the universal deluge, the Amalek's remembering, Giuseppe and his brothers, Isaac's sacrifice, and furthermore with Moses' death, to end with the forgiveness from the original sin through the entrance in the promise land. A suggestive analysis of the forgiveness in the Hebraism, seen too often as a pure religion of the contraposition law to the forgiveness given from the religion of love. The forgiveness in this way is dealt with the inter-religious point of view, and also with the human one that in the relationship between God and man has its top and beginning in the solemnity of Kippur.<br>

Abstract: In 1884 an Ottoman public prosecutor and fellow officials stood trial for abusing their official authorities when attending to an incident in one of Istanbul's neighborhoods. A published verbatim report of the proceedings is used in this article for discussing Ottoman socio-legal change in the late nineteenth century, employing a microhistorical perspective. Following a major reform in the new court system, which was established in the 1860s (the Nizamiye courts), the judicial authorities used the trial in question for transmitting the commitment of the modernizing state to the rule of law, exhibited by the principle of officials' accountability. Features of the reformed judicial system and its distinctive legal culture are demonstrated in this article by unfolding the judicial aspects of this episode and by discussing connections between them and the immediate socio-political and socio-legal contexts of the trial.<br>

Abstract: This review article discusses the emergence of the subsequent proceedings before the US Military Tribunals from the shadows of the trial of 'Major War Criminals' at the International Military Tribunal as explored in Kevin Jon Heller's The Nuremberg Military Tribunals and the Origins of International Criminal Law. The article applauds Heller's efforts in producing a detailed examination of an understudied aspect of the origins of international criminal law. The essay suggests that given the specific focus of the author on the genealogy of international criminal law, important legal historical questions are left unexamined. It suggests a research agenda that would focus more specifically on the centrality of the Shoah to National Socialism and argues that the current trend in historical scholarship focusing on war crimes trials as a distinct subject of inquiry could provide a fruitful basis for future socio-legal research into the Nazi state and its legal apparatus.<br>

Publisher: International Peace Research Association<br>

Date: 7 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Blatz Charles V.<br>
Abstract: Moving from repression or tyranny toward the rule of law and reason is fraught with difficulties. One question of transitional justice is whether those responsible for the horrors of the previous régime should be punished or whether those involved in the transition should travel a path toward forgiveness and unity. Within this article, it is urged that in the (re-)establishment of the rule of reason among all involved there is a commitment to peace as opposed to force. This commitment marks retribution and utilitarian punishment as incoherent and normatively indefensible. Resorting to punishment is the abandonment of reason, not its reinstatement. Indeed, the point can be generalized. Punishment, as resorting to force, is a move away from establishing or sustaining a framework of justification and its commitment to peace.<br>

Date: 12 1, 1994<br>

Abstract: Pour tous les jacobins, la souveraineté du peuple définit la citoyenneté. Le groupe girondin tient à son propos un discours minimaliste (la formation de l'opinion publique est la première étape de l'exercice de la souveraineté). Les cordeliers et les jacobins radicaux tiennent un discours maximaliste (le peuple fait la loi et juge la conformité de la loi avec le droit naturel). On note une inflexion marseillaise de ces discours. Les patriotes modérés y évoquent « la souveraineté relative et pour ainsi dire locale ». Les patriotes radicaux évoquent à partir du printemps 1793 une insurrection marseillaise prenant le relais de Paris comme moteur de la Révolution, et après le succès de cette insurrection, une organisation du pouvoir exécutif caractérisée par la multiplication des instances intermédiaires. Maignet, représentant en mission dans les Bouches-du-Rhône, tente une synthèse : le partage des fonctions (la Convention fait la loi, les départements s'occupent des problèmes locaux, les districts surveillent l'application des lois, les municipalités et les comités révolutionnaires s'occupent de tout ce qui est relatif aux personnes). For all Jacobins, citizenship was defined by the sovereignty of the people. The Girondin faction stuck to a minimalist discourse whereby the formation of public opinion is the first step in the exercise of sovereignty. The maximalist discourse of the Corde liers and the radical Jacobins held that the people make the law and judge the conformity between the law and natural right. One notes a marseillaise inflexion in this discourse. At Marseille, the moderate patriots evoked "the relative and local sovereignty, so to speak". From spring 1793 the radical patriots evoked a marseillaise insurrection taking its lead from Paris as motor of the Revolution and, after the success of the insurrection, and organization of the executive power characterized by the multiplication of intermediary governmental bodies.

Article Title: La validation des acquis de l'expérience est-elle un moyen de reconnaissance du travail? / Is the process of granting equivalences based on work-related experiences a way to recognize the work performed?<br>
Publisher: Assocaition pour le développement de la sociologie du travail; Elsevier<br>
Issue: i40089829<br>
Date: 3 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Tuchszirer Carole<br>
Abstract: Cet article interroge la validation des acquis de l'expérience, droit instauré en 2002 dans le Code du travail, sur sa capacité à favoriser une meilleure reconnaissance du travail des salariés. Il s'appuie sur une enquête réalisée auprès de 15 entreprises, associations ou branches professionnelles engagées dans des opérations collectives de validation des acquis de l'expérience (VAE). Après avoir identifié quatre logiques distinctes de mise en œuvre du dispositif par les employeurs, les auteurs examinent les canaux par lesquels la VAE, telle qu'elle se pratique dans l'entreprise, pourrait favoriser la reconnaissance du travail. D'un côté, la mise en mots du travail est un puissant moyen de le rendre visible et l'opportunité de confrontation avec les pairs permet de renforcer l'identité professionnelle, mais de l'autre, la VAE influe peu sur la rémunération et l'ambiguïté demeure fréquente sur l'objet même de la validation. Le regard croisé des employeurs et des salariés montre donc à quel point la reconnaissance du travail ne va pas de soi. Mais la voie est tracée pour qu'il puisse en être autrement dans le cadre de procédures plus négociées, notamment avec l'acteur syndical. Based on a survey conducted in 15 firms, associations or occupations where work-based experiences were being validated under the terms of a law that entered the French Labor Code in 2002, questions are raised about this process and its capacity for obtaining more recognition for the work done by wage-earners. After identifying four distinct employer rationales for implementing validation, the channels favoring the obtainment of such recognition are examined when this procedure is actually applied inside firms. Putting one's job into words is a powerful means for making it visible; and the opportunity to face colleagues is an occasion for reinforcing an occupational identity. Nonetheless, validation has little effect on pay, and what is being validated is often ambiguous. Employers' and wage-ear~<br>

Author(s): von Wright Mats<br>
Abstract: Causal explanations of social actions are central to modern as well as to classic sociology. Even in its revised form. the most influential causal theory -- the covering law theory -- has not proved particularly fruitful for the study of social action. But there are alternative and potentially more fruitful theories. This article presents Weber's methodology and critical realism as two different contributions to a generative view of causality in social science which both try to transcend the protracted controversy between a hermeneutic interpretive sociology and a positivistic causal-explanatory sociology. From the generative standpoint. causal explanations are directed not towards the production of empirical correlations between variables or towards the making of predictions on the basis of empirical laws, but towards the uncovering of causal properties and the processes whereby social actions arise out of the complex interaction of internally related mental dispositions. meanings. intentions. social contexts and structures.<br>

Abstract: The aim of the paper is to consider such ethnolinguistic categories as magic, connotation, cognitive blending as possible keys to the following questions: How is it possible that we can perfectly adopt different representations of the past and internalize them as our past? How can we reconcile different representations of the past and how is it possible that diverse representations of the past merge in one social memory? Such amalgamations of various forms of representations and diverse scales of objectification can be clarified by means of the theory of magic, by means of the law of resemblance, and the law of contiguity. Such considerations are supported here by empirical study of the construction of social memories in Teschen Silesia, which was divided between Poland and Czechoslovakia in 1920. On both sides of the new border different state institutions emerged and influenced local memories.<br>

Abstract: In societies coming to terms with historical injustices, public apology has recently emerged as a potent trend. This is particularly true of France, where the state served as a catalyst for a wave of public apologies for acts of intolerance committed during the Second World War. Following Jacques Chirac's 1995 official apology for Vichy's anti-Semitic policies, various groups in civil society publicly atoned for their particular Vichy roles in discrimination against Jews: the medical profession, the law bar, the Catholic Church, and the police. How does public apology, as distinct from court trials, historical commissions, and reparations, affect contemporary France's reconciliation with its past? This article also analyzes how apologizing for Vichy has created demand for an official French apology for the Algerian War. By 2006, the politics of memory in French society decidedly shifted attention from Vichy to post-colonialism: in both cases, the apology turn imposes new dynamics of remembering and forgetting.<br>

Abstract: Quand Suarez aborde la question du sens du mot droit il se réclame de saint Thomas et du droit romain ; en fait l'usage des références et des citations masque un détournement : la réduction, au droit subjectif et à la loi, de l'ancien souci d'attribuer à chacun ce qui lui revient. When Suarez approaches the meaning of the word jus, he refers to Thomas Aquinas and to Roman Law ; in fact his use of references and quotations hides an embezzlement : the reduction of the old care « suum cuique tribuendi » to subjective right and to lex.<br>

Abstract: Il s'agit de montrer comment l'ouvrage de J. Sommet, L'honneur de la liberté, réflexion biographique, avec, pour point fort, l'expérience du camp de Dachau, enracine, dans son récit, une pensée de la liberté, apte à trancher l'indéfini des débats d'école, tant dans le rapport entre liberté et loi que dans la relation avec des groupes différents dans leurs options sur le sens de la vie. In this narrative is shown how, through several experiences (including at Dachau concentration camp) freedom is at work and transcends intellectual discussions in matters concerning the relation between freedom and law and also different conceptions about the meaning of life.<br>

Abstract: A l'opposé des discours philosophiques contemporains, la Philosophie Morale (Paris, 1961) d'Éric Weil reprend pour l'essentiel l'idée kantienne de la loi morale. Mais elle déplace la problématique de la fondation en procédant selon la méthode de l'« analyse génétique » qui concilie « développement phénoménologique » et « exposé encyclopédique ». Le chemin des apories de la réflexion morale conduit à la conscience de soi philosophique de la question morale comme question, et comme question irréductible, c'est-à-dire comme question que se pose une liberté qui a déjà, sans raison, choisi la raison. Contrary to the contemporary philosophical discourses, E. Weil's Philosophie Morale (Paris, 1961) resumes in his essential part the kantian idea of the moral law. But E. Weil displaces the problem of foundation, proceeding by the method of « genetical analysis » which conciliates « phenomenological development » and « encyclopaedic exposition » . The way of the apories of the moral reflexion leads into the philosophical self-consciousness of the moral question as a question, and as an irreducible question, in other words as a question stated to a freedom which has, without reason, already chosen the reason.<br>

Abstract: The effect of a metaphor is based on a shift in expectancy and cannot be established in advance. Various proposals on the meaning of παιδαγωγός are considered in the light of Paul's argumentative strategy in Galatians 3. In the light of this strategy it is evident that Paul uses this metaphor to indicate the temporary and captive nature of the situation under the law. As a persuasive strategy this metaphor provides the reader with an unexpected view on the function of the law, as well as their own position, urging them to return to 'his' gospel.<br>

Abstract: Les "institutions", comme ensemble préexistant et objectivable de ressources de justification, forment le milieu où puisent les agents économiques, pour gérer leurs problèmes de coordination et/ou leurs conflits de reproduction. Les "conventions" sont des représentations collectives de "monde commun justifié", qui activent les institutions, et légitiment les arrangements locaux, au sein des "organisations", dont la production conjointe de marchandises et de règles va reconstituer ou dégrader le milieu institutionnel de départ. Ce modèle conventionnaliste à trois termes cherche à surmonter les difficultés des autres analyses économiques des institutions. Il pose un agent économique rompu aux défauts de coordination et de reproduction, et impensable hors d'un milieu institutionnel composé au minimum du langage, de la monnaie, et du droit. La pluralité des logiques de justification fonde la diversité empirique des institutions. La dynamique des institutions est étudiée à travers les opérateurs qui font et défont les possibilités de "monde commun" à partir de la "pluralité" : la "concurrence" dans l'espace des prix doit être combinée avec la "critique" dans l'espace des valeurs (normes). L'analyse conventionnaliste du capitalisme remet le projet de Marx à l'endroit en déduisant la théorie de l'exploitation d'une théorie de la justice, plutôt que l'inverse. "Institutions", as a set of pre-existing and objective resources of justification, is the milieu where economic agents can find materials to solve their coordination problems and/or their conflicts of reproduction. "Conventions" are collective representations of "justified common worlds" that activate institutions and legitimise arrangements within "organisations", whose joint production of goods and rules will lead to the renewal -or the degeneracy- of prior institutional milieu. This "three terms conventionalist model" endeavors to face the difficulties encountered by the other economic approaches of institutions. I~<br>

Abstract: Les jumelages constituent la première forme d'action internationale impliquant les institutions municipales en tant que telles. L'émergence de cette activité correspond à un processus d'invention de la tradition. Comprendre les tensions politiques occasionnées par ce processus donne accès à des mobilisations méconnues qui ont pourtant affecté les règles du jeu municipal. Retracer ces différents épisodes de l'histoire politique contribue autant à la compréhension de certaines entreprises politiques de la IVe République qu'à la découverte des conditions de possibilité d'évolutions ultérieures du jeu diplomatique, telle la coopération décentralisée. Town twinning can be seen as the first activity to involve municipal institutions as such in wideranging and long-term international action by councilors. Twinning fits Eric Hobsbawm's definition of an invented tradition. The invention of town twinning cannot be studied without a profound knowledge of the dynamic political tensions which emerged in the Cold War French political scene. Mobilizations led to a big turn in common interpretations of the municipal law. The study of this process helps understand the institutional change which made possible the rise of paradiplomacy in France.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo procura alcançar uma reflexão conceptual na qual, a Filosofia Hermenêutica pode ser instituída como fundamento da Filosofía do Direito e do fenómeno jurídico e, consequentemente, como uma base para futuros desenvolvimentos da actual Filosofia Hermenêutica do Direito, de forma a poder ser alternativa ao Direito Natural e ao Positivismo Legal. Por conseguinte, um conceito chave a ser abordado é o de "ser com", visto que a situação do Mundo promove o surgimento do Direito no seu encontro com outro "ser com". Assim, a relação jurídica ficaria sustentada pela hermenêutica, a partir do conceito central de significado, enquanto profundidade e plenitude do ser jurídico, no qual a sua possibilidade de valorização é estabelecida como sentido de justiça. Assim, a Filosofia Hermenêutica do Direito providenciaria um retorno à ética, à luz do que juridicamente lhe diz respeito, de significados abertos à renovação, permitindo uma maneira de mudar a ideia estática de Filosofia do Direito, porque a justificação não assenta nos conteúdos morais, mas no sentido do ser. This article seeks to achieve a conceptual reflection in which Hermeneutical Philosophy can be established as a foundation for Philosophy of Law and the legal phenomenon, and, thus, as a ground for future developments in the current Hermeneutics Philosophy of Law that can be alternative to Natural Law and Legal Positivism, giving answers to common problems. Consequently, a key concept to be addressed in this article is "be with", since the situation in the world fosters the emergence of Law in its encounter with another "be with". Thus, the legal relationship would be sustained by hermeneutics, from the central concept of meaning as deepness and fullness of juridical being, in which m the possibility of its valuation is established as a sense of justice. So, the Hermeneutics Philosophy of Law would provide a return to ethics, in view of what juridically concerns it, with meanings opened to renovation, allowi~<br>

Abstract: O presente texto surge do desejo de pensar a relação entre direito e ética. O diálogo entre estas duas áreas, sentido como um desafio premente para os dias de hoje, coloca em cena a relação da própria ciência jurídica com a sociedade onde se insere. A teoria da argumentação apresentada por autores como Jürgen Habermas, Chaïm Perelman e Paul Ricoeur permite iluminar de modo renovado esta temática clássica, superando a actual dificuldade em estabelecer uma ligação entre os domínios da ética e do direito. A reflexão parte de um primeiro enquadramento teórico, analisando o confronto histórico entre ética e direito e apontando caminhos de conciliação para a actualidade. Em seguida, apresentam-se algumas concretizações do papel da ética na prática jurídica, pelo seu contributo para a elaboração e aplicação do direito. Por último, o texto aborda possíveis contribuições do direito para a uma construção ética. This paper aims to discuss the relationship between law and ethics. The dialogue between both areas is a pressing and current challenge, which puts into play the relationship of legal science with the society. The theory of argumentation presented by authors such as Jürgen Habermas, Chaim Perelman and Paul Ricoeur, illuminates in a new way this classic issue, overcoming the present difficulties in establishing a link between the fields of ethics and law. The reflection starts with a theoretical framework, which analyzes the historical clash between the two approaches and points out a possible path of reconciliation. Then, it presents some embodiments of the role of ethics in legal practice, for its contribution to the elaboration and application of law. Finally, it discusses some possible contributions of law for the moral discourse.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo trata da clássica relação entre as ordens moral e jurídica, no contexto problemático do direito contemporâneo, acentuado pela crise nos países ocidentais do Estado constitucional. O autor defende a necessidade da relação entre o conhecer e o agir no direito, ou seja, de afirmar a relevância de uma unidade autêntica e coesa entre a teoria e a prática jurídicas. Por um lado, a coerência jurídica deve estar baseada no rigor lógico, por outro, essa coerência exige o compromisso e a responsabilidade dos agentes jurídicos. Portanto, neste artigo é sugerida a necessidade de um compromisso verdadeiro com os fins próprios do Direito e, ainda, que a responsabilidade se converta em condição ineludível para, juridicamente, saber distribuir com justiça. This article deals with the classical relations between moral and juridical orders, in the problematic frame of contemporary Law, marked by the current crises, in western countries, of constitutional State. The author argues for the necessity of a relationship, in Law, between knowing and acting, that is, the necessity of affirming the relevance of an authentic and cohesive unity between theory and juridical practice. On the one hand, the juridical coherence must be based on logical rigor, on the other, that coherence requires the commitment and responsibility of legal agents. So, in this article it is suggested the need for a genuine commitment to the purposes of Law and, also, that the responsibility becomes the unavoidable condition to know, legally, how to distribute with justice.<br>

Abstract: O plural e conflituoso entendimento da legitimação da pena no Direito, tem origem nas diversas intencionalidades que lhe conferem sentido. Neste artigo são analisadas as intencionalidades mais relevantes, destacando os seus modelos justificativos: retribuição, reparação, prevenção, expiação, reabilitação e restauração (precedidas pela vingança, extrajudiríca). Para melhor análise destes são também consideradas a variável da temporalidade (passado, presente, futuro) e a variável dos sujeitos, que protagonizam a dinâmica do castigo (infractor, víctima, Estado, sociedade). Depois, num momento comparativo, destacam-se criticamente as confluencias e as oposições. Assim será possível concluir que a intencionalidade restauradora e a sua firme relativização do castigo é aquela que melhor consegue articular as variáveis de sentido-com os seus valores-, a temporalidade e os sujeitos, pelo que se mostra ser a referência mais positiva para a legitimização. Contudo, dada a sua precaridade, devido ao seu surgimento recente, impõe-se reforçá-la reflexivamente e prácticamente. The plural and conflictual understanding of the legitimacy of penalty in law stems from diverse intentionalities that constitute their respective meanings. This article analyzes the most relevant intentionalities. It seeks to highlight the models that justifies them: retribution, reparation, prevention, atonement, rehabilitation and restoration (preceded by vengeance, extrajudirical). To better analyze these models, the variable of temporality (past, present, future) and the variable of the subjects are also considered in view of the fact that they operate in the dynamics of punishment (offender, victim, State, society). Then, establishing comparisons, the confluences and oppositions are critically highlighted. In order to conclude that the restorative intentionality and its strong relativization of punishment is the one who can best articulate the variables of meaning -with their values, involving temporalit~<br>

Abstract: According to German criminal law, a person who violates a criminal law rule will be excused under the conditions of § 35 German Criminal Code (necessity as an excuse). What are the reasons for not holding an offender responsible in these cases although he may have even caused the death of his victim? In section II of this essay, the usual answers to this question are analysed. The result is that none of them is utterly convincing. They all have in common that they underestimate the importance of the victim's interest in his personal freedom. In section III, the author puts forward his own interpretation of § 35 German Criminal Code. This interpretation is based on the distinction between two meanings of legal freedom. In the first place the members of a legal community are obliged to respect the „negative freedom“ of each other. On the basis of this understanding of „freedom“ the defence of necessity appears as an alien element within the system of criminal law. However, the status of the members of a legal community is not confined to their „negative freedom.“ To some extent, the criminal law also recognizes their „positive freedom“: the interest of each individual to preserve his personal integrity. The defence of necessity in § 35 German Criminal Code can be interpreted as acknowledging the offender's „positive freedom.“ In the final section of this essay (section IV) this model of explanation is applied to a range of detailed problems raised by § 35 German Criminal Code.<br>

Abstract: La transition vers l'État de droit et la démocratie qui a eu lieu dans de nombreux pays (Argentine, Chili, Afrique du Sud, Haïti, pour n'en citer que quelques-uns) au cours de ces dernières décennies a remis à l'ordre du jour le problème de l'amnistie. Doit-on, au nom de la réconciliation et de la paix civile, renoncer à traduire en justice les anciens bourreaux ? Ou bien doiton, au nom de la justice due aux victimes, les traduire en justice ? Poser la question de cette façon, c'est suggérer qu'il existe une opposition absolue entre l'amnistie et la justice. Dans notre contribution, nous voudrions montrer que cette opposition n'est pas aussi absolue qu'on le pense et que l'amnistie peut aussi parfois être nécessaire pour préserver ou réinstaurer les conditions de possibilité de la justice. The transition towards a state of law and democracy which has taken place in many countries in the last decades (Argentina, Chili, South Africa, Haïti, to mention just a few) brings up again the problem of amnisty. In the name of reconciliation and civil peace, should former torturers and hangmen be released from justice? Or, to do justice to victims, should they be brought to trial? Put that way, the question suggests an absolute opposition between amnisty and justice. In this article we want to show that this opposition is not so absolute as one might think and that amnisty is sometimes necessary to preserve or to re-instate the condititions for the possibility of justice.<br>

Abstract: L'auteur interroge la thèse de Joseph Weiler, juriste juif américain, spécialiste de droit européen, en faveur de l'idée d'une Europe chrétienne et la met en corrélation avec la théorie éthique de Robert Spaemann, philosophe de conviction catholique, au sujet de la catégorie de personne. Il en résulte des questions critiques, dans le sens d'une éthique de la reconnaissance et de la reconstruction (Jean-Marc Ferry) et d'une plus grande valorisation du théologique comme tel au sein de l'espace public. The author looks at the thesis of Joseph Weiler, a Jewish American jurist specializing in European law and favouring the idea of a Christian Europe, and juxtaposes it to the ethics theory of Robert Spaemann, a Catholic philosopher, with regards to the category of personhood. There result some critical questions in the direction of an ethics of recognition and reconstruction (Jean-Marc Ferry) and of greater value given to the theological as such in the public sphere.<br>

Abstract: Confrontation de diverses lectures d'un récit, d'une scène, d'une tradition religieuse. À partir de la figure évangélique de la pécheresse (Luc 7), les analyses philosophiques du pardon s'inscrivent chez le jeune Hegel dans une réflexion sur l'opposition de la loi (le châtiment) et de la réconciliation (l'amour). Dans son Esthétique, les traités de l'art romantique et de la peinture voient en la Madeleine la figuration d'une beauté où intériorité et extériorité s'accordent harmonieusement. Dans divers écrits sur la religion, le même personnage, qui évoque les traits de la belle âme, n'est pas étranger aux méditations sur destin de Jésus, le pardon des offenses et l'idée de la grâce. Ces diverses représentations induisent une pensée en rupture avec d'autres approches philosophiques de la grâce et du pardon (Spinoza, Kant). Une deuxième partie évoque la pécheresse, souvent confondue avec d'autres femmes des Évangiles, telle qu'on la retrouve chez des écrivains de la spiritualité française (Bérulle 1627, Charles de Saint Paul 1628, Lacordaire 1859) et chez les peintres de l'époque baroque. L'article se termine par une étude des nombreuses évocations de la pécheresse chez Kierkegaard. À la différence de la spéculation philosophique ou des « élévations » mystiques, c'est dans une méditation toujours au plus près de la lettre même du Nouveau Testament que sont alors développés de manière existentielle les thèmes du repentir et du pardon. A look at diverse readings of a story, a scene, a religious tradition. Taking the gospel figure of the adulterous woman (Luke 7) as a starting point, the youthful Hegel sets his philosophical analysis of forgiveness in a meditation on Law (Punishment) versus Reconciliation (Love). In his Aesthetics, the treatises on the romantic art movement and on paintings see in Mary Magdalen the figuration of a beauty in which interiority and exteriority are harmonised. In various writings on religion, the same character, now the figuration of the bea~<br>

Abstract: This introduction of the HSR Special Issue on "Critique and Social Change: Historical, Cultural, and Institutional Perspectives" addresses the question of how critique and social change are interrelated. Conflicts and disputes are considered to be a major source of critique. We distinguish three types of conflicts: (1) Value conflicts result from the ongoing process of rationalization and the differentiation of relatively autonomous "value spheres" (Weber) such as politics, economy, science, law, etc. (2) The growth and expansion of these value spheres, e.g. the growth of capitalism, in turn produce new forms of inequalities and leads to distributional conflicts. (3) As questions of distribution and inclusion are closely linked, critique also originates from identity conflicts, which address the social recognition of individuals and collectivities. In order to understand how critique is related to social change, we suggest that critique can be studied either as a condition for or as an effect from social change. Based on this distinction we provide an overview over the contributions of this volume.<br>

Abstract: This article investigates the effects of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 in structuring an encounter over a decision about building a dam in central Arizona. From the vantage point of three groups with deep investments in the outcome of this decision, it analyzes how the interests and identities of these parties were transformed as a result of this encounter. In defining standing and the terms of relevance, in providing a political forum, and in requiring these groups to explain themselves to others, this law powerfully mediated the politics surrounding this controversial decision.<br>

Abstract: This paper scrutinizes the fundamental assumption governing Gunther Teubner's theory of societal constitutionalism, namely that societal constitutions are ultimately about the regulation of inclusion and exclusion in global function systems. While endorsing the central role of inclusion/exclusion in constitutions, societal or otherwise, I argue that inclusion and exclusion are primordial categories of collective action, rather than functional categories. As a result, the self-closure which gives rise to a legal collective is spatial as much as it is temporal, and subjective no less than material. Inasmuch as legal orders must establish who ought to do what, where, and when, this entails, or so I argue, that any legal order we could imagine—including a global legal order such as cyberlaw—is necessarily bounded in space, time, content, and membership. This impinges directly on the inclusion/exclusion difference: that there can be no inclusion without exclusion entails, most fundamentally, that there can be no (il)legality without alegality, i.e. comportment that contests, sometimes radically, how a legal order draws the distinction between legality and illegality. In this fundamental sense, all legal orders have an outside—literally. Building on this insight, I suggest that the functional cosmopolitanism advocated by a theory of societal constitutionalism retains a residue of the logic of totalization it seeks to overcome. I conclude by exploring how a first-person plural theory of law both supports and transforms the insight that constitutions regulate the inclusion/exclusion difference by putting into place constitutive and limitative rules.<br>

Abstract: This paper explores the
         sugyain the Babylonian Talmud that includes the story of the Oven of Akhnai, in BTBaba metzi‘‘a58b––59b, expanding earlier studies by Jeffrey Rubenstein and Charlotte Fonrobert. It shows that two scriptural quotations involving, respectively, David and Tamar, situated in the first part of thesugya, anticipate the subsequent story and clarify how it functions as a ““foundation myth”” of the Beit Midrash (Fonrobert), and, therefore, of male identity (Boyarin). I suggest that the entiresugyaconstructs male identity by way of contrast with two ““others,”” the divine and the female realms, which are excluded from the Law-making process. The danger of verbal wrong, however, reveals the necessity of reintroducing the excluded ““others.”” The text achieves this by recognizing the existence of a transcendent justice, and by making Tamar, a foreign and female character with no access to the Law, a model of delicacy in verbal communication.<br>

Abstract: One poem, “After Shakespeare,” sounds particularly Shakespearean: it is the only poem in the set that draws exclusively from the Bard's lexical fields (“disloyal moon!”), so that its echoes emphasize the distance between the other sonnagrams and Shakespeare:
         
               
            For lovers oft from thee great boldness draw
               To do like acts of mutiny below;
               A tacit metamorphosis of law
               Informs their fervent antidote to woe
            
               Leftover letters are one of the hazards of the anagram machine. Mohammad explains, “Each Sonnagram, including its title, is an anagram of a standard modern-spelling version of one of Shakespeare's Sonnets, containing exactly the same letters in the same distribution as the original. The title is composed last, using whatever letters are left over once I've assembled a working sonnet in iambic pentameter with an English rhyme scheme.”(RP and F with WS [RP];
               [RP] PP with WH [VD]).
               ———
               [Sonnet 37 (“As a decrepit father takes delight”)]
            
                     
               138
                  
               Some have read the leftover letters in the concluding couplet as presenting a false encryption for the reader, linking it to Shakespeare's mysterious dedication of his sonnets in 1609 to “Mr. WH.”139
            
               The initials are also familiar to readers of modernist poetry: WS might stand in for William Shakespeare, but it might also refer to Wallace Stevens, just as WH are Auden's famous initials … But perhaps it is merely a trap to believe that decoding is possible. The point of the poem may be that knowledge of the canon, or intertextual expertise, leads only to dead ends. But if the leftover letters that stud the poem are read as recombinatory elements that follow the logic of DNA sequencing—so that language itself is a constant reproduction of combinatory possibility—the poem offer~<br>

Article Title: The Plight of Ethics<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Joining hyperbolic ethics with psychoanalysis, then, we might begin to forge ethics and politics in a necessary but tense relation, as the place where we find ourselves: this is our plight as social creatures living together with others. Navigating between Kant's too-easy unification of ethics and politics through universal moral law based on duty, on the one hand, and Levinas's radical separation of the two based on the singularity of infinite ethical repsonsiblity, on the other, let's say that social subjectivity is the thin membrane stretched between infinite ethical responsibility and finite political action. And its depth is the thickness of the flesh in embodied relations with others. Subjectivity is response to others and the environment that binds us to them, on the one hand; and agency is response to social historical situations, or subject positions, that binds us to the language and culture into which we are born—for better or worse—on the other (see Oliver
      2001,2004). Subjective agency is forged through this pledge or bond between politics and ethics made possible, even necessary, by our sociality; we are social embodied animals with fears and desires beyond our control, fears and desires that make love possible but also make hatred and cruelty realities that we cannot ignore. Our social subjectivity is that thin membrane and that thick embodied relationship with those around us, whether they are animal, vegetable, or mineral, human, beast, or machine—or more to the point here, whether they are friend or enemy, loved or hated, welcoming or threatening.<br>

Abstract: And from the conclusion: “The book promises to play a central role in the future debate on the role of law, not merely because of its theoretical contribution, which is monumental, but because its author has generated a new framework, a new architectonic, from which the phenomenon of law in a democratic society can be perceived. In that sense, this book which was written in the shadow of the great German discourses on law authored by Hegel and Weber will cast its own light.”

Article Title: Recovering Hyperbole:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.45.4.issue-4<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: This operative impetus of hyperbole is not one historically ascribed to it. It is somewhat implied but never fully articulated. Paul Ricoeur offers an understanding of this metafunction of hyperbole, but he does not elaborate on his statements in any detail or discuss their implications.
         
               He posits that hyperbole “reorients by first disorienting [the law of paradox and hyperbole] … [and] makes the extraordinary break forth in the ordinary [the law of extravagance]” (1995, 229).2
            
               Hyperbolic paradox stretches the imagination through its extravagance and in one's ambiguous apprehension of it, because it is only in the obscure space of “para” that one is disoriented enough to surrender presuppositions about thought and reality, thereby preparing the way for a newly reimagined perspective.3<br>

Issue: shaw.34.1.issue-1<br>

Author(s): Einsohn Howard Ira<br>
Abstract: Second, like Ricoeur, Shaw posits the poetic imagination, as it reveals itself in religious and other kinds of narrative texts, as the capability best suited for mending the ailing soul and resurrecting the frangible will. The human heart may be deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked, as the prophet laments, but for Shaw (and Ricoeur) it is corrigible. Things can and do change; this is the first law of Shavian evolution. And, in Shaw's judgment, there is no more effective catalyst for provoking restorative transformation, for ridding the world of the ignorance that fuels evil, than the making of imaginative art that is aesthetically pleasing. Why is this the case? Because storytelling can break the infernal spell that enthralls the will. Telling stories, Shaw maintains, can deliver the imbecilic will from slavery, thereby restoring enlightened individual autonomy and the untrammeled capacity to act in accordance with higher rather than lower passions.
      
               “Fine art,” he muses, as exemplified for example in his own dramatic works, by implication, “is the only teacher except torture.”50
            
               In this regard, Shaw is very much like the “artist” and “Bohemian” Jesus he commemorates: the sage and commiserative guide who, “when reproached for resorting to the art of fiction when teaching in parables,” justified “himself on the ground that art is the only way in which the people can be taught.”51
            
               Consider the biblical Testaments, once more. Shaw believes they are unreliable historical documents yet nonetheless finds “in their readable parts”—that is, in their tales, fables, and legends—a treasure trove of tropes vital to the species' wellness (the same is true for Ricoeur).52
            
               However, and this is critical, he cautions that “you cannot read the Bible if you have no sense of literary art.”53
            
               Thus, in addition to whatever else they do, insist~<br>

Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: There was a time when men wandered at large in the fields like animals and lived on wild fare; they did nothing by the guidance of reason, but relied chiefly on physical strength; there was as yet no ordered system of religious worship nor of social duties; no one had seen legitimate marriage nor had anyone looked upon children whom he knew to be his own; nor had they learned the advantage of an equitable code of law…. At this juncture a man—great and wise I am sure—became aware of the power offered by his mind for great achievements if one could develop and improve it by instruction. Men were scattered in the fields and hidden in sylvan retreats when he assembled and gathered them in accordance with a plan; he introduced them to every useful and honorable occupation, though they cried out against it at first because of its novelty, and then when through reason and eloquence they had listened with greater attention, he transformed them from wild savages into a kind and gentle folk.

Article Title: The Problematic of Architecture and Utopia<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: Another way to clarify what Utopia might be for architecture is to begin with Saint (Sir) Thomas More's (1478–1535) originary coinage of the term in 1516 and the definition that extends from it. First, it is worth considering that
         Utopiais a much older word thandystopia. Nevertheless, because More's Utopia depicts an imaginary island enjoying a putatively perfect social, legal, and political system,Utopiahas primarily come to be associated with all such representations of the same, literary, architectural, and political alike.Utopia, though, contains within itself two senses that when taken together establish something of a paradox: referring to the Greekou(no) andeu(good) plustopos(place),Utopiaconnotes both “a good place” and a “no place.” By beinga good no place, Utopia seems to inscribe within itself the most common criticism of it: impossibility (as a placeless place). Worse still, because no (actual) place can be (or even approximate) an ideal state, the value of Utopia seems dubious at best. Even more troubling, because the ideal state depicted in Utopia requires a degree of coercion, as all social organizations do, Utopia has come to be associated with tyranny and is rejected, which deprives the imagination of a concept for possibilities. In the absence of a crucial habit for thinking about how to achieve the possible-impossible, the culturally dominant conviction that “there is no alternative” has taken on the character of a natural law, leading Fredric Jameson to observe: “Someone once said that it is easier to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of capitalism. We can now revise that and witness the attempt to imagine capitalism by way of imagining the end of the world.”
