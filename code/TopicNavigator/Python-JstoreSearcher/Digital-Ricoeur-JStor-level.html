  Author(s) Utley Ebony A.<br>
  Abstract: Rhetorical arguments generally deal with confused notions, with ideas and concepts that do not admit of a single, unequivocal meaning.¹ Consequently, rhetorical argumentation normally does not begin with fixed axioms in the manner of demonstrative reasoning. Instead rhetoricians must draw their starting points from accepted beliefs and values relative to the audience and the subject of discourse. When these beliefs and values are considered at a high level of generality, they become “commonplaces” or “common topics” for argumentation: the attempt to render a systematic account of such topics therefore has been a major concern of rhetorical theory from antiquity to<br>

For Stoker standard time served a double function: it preserved England’s ontological purity by excising the temporally untranslatable, and it provided a model for a total narrative, able to assimilate various classes, nations, and dialects (spoken by the multinational vampire hunters) as well as various media.

  Abstract: Central to the great upheavals marking the transition between the medieval and the modern world were profound disagreements about the nature of order, whether in the social and political realm, in the church, in the cosmos, or in the exalted spheres of metaphysics. High medieval culture, broadly speaking, had tended toward a unified and hierarchical conception of order which assigned to all men, experiences, places, things, and ideas their appropriate positions in a vast, graded system of values. Conversely the attack on medieval civilization at its deepest level, operating simultaneously in both the material and ideal realms, was directed at<br>

  Book Title: Reconfiguring Modernity-Concepts of Nature in Japanese Political Ideology<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Thomas Julia Adeney<br>
  Abstract: Julia Adeney Thomas turns the concept of nature into a powerful analytical lens through which to view Japanese modernity, bringing the study of both Japanese history and political modernity to a new level of clarity. She shows that nature necessarily functions as a political concept and that changing ideas of nature's political authority were central during Japan's transformation from a semifeudal world to an industrializing colonial empire. In political documents from the nineteenth to the early twentieth century, nature was redefined, moving from the universal, spatial concept of the Tokugawa period, through temporal, social Darwinian ideas of inevitable progress and competitive struggle, to a celebration of Japan as a nation uniquely in harmony with nature. The so-called traditional "Japanese love of nature" masks modern state power. Thomas's theoretically sophisticated study rejects the supposition that modernity is the ideological antithesis of nature, overcoming the determinism of the physical environment through technology and liberating denatured subjects from the chains of biology and tradition. In making "nature" available as a critical term for political analysis, this book yields new insights into prewar Japan's failure to achieve liberal democracy, as well as an alternative means of understanding modernity and the position of non-Western nations within it.<br>

  Abstract: In 2003, the Arts Faculty at The University of Western Australia underwent a major restructure involving the distribution of points for its units of study. In the previous model each unit was worth eight points while in the revised version units could be weighted at either 6 points or 12 points. For French Studies, this redistribution of points resulted in the creation of a new series of upper level elective units.

By contrast to the episteme, focused too narrowly on the utterances produced by a society, Foucault’s

  Book Title: Passage to the Center-Imagination and the Sacred in the Poetry of Seamus Heaney<br>
  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Tobin Daniel<br>
  Abstract: Nobel Laureate Seamus Heaney, author of nine collections of poetry and three volumes of influential essays, is regarded by many as the greatest Irish poet since Yeats.
      Passage to the Centeris the most comprehensive critical treatment to date on Heaney's poetry and the first to study Heaney's body of work up toSeeing ThingsandThe Spirit Level. It is also the first to examine the poems from the perspective of religion, one of Heaney's guiding preoccupations. According to Tobin, the growth of Heaney's poetry may be charted through the recurrent figure of "the center," a key image in the relationship that evolved over time between the poet and his inherited place, an evolution that involved the continual re-evaluation and re-vision of imaginative boundaries. In a way that previous studies have not, Tobin's work examines Heaney's poetry in the context of modernist and postmodernist concerns about the desacralizing of civilization and provides a challenging engagement with the work of a living master.<br>

  The Spirit Level from:

  Abstract: In “Place, Pastness, Poems,” Seamus Heaney quotes this passage from T.S. Eliot’s “Little Gidding” to support his view that in lieu of a cultural center the literary tradition is what links “the private experience of a poet to the usual life of the age.”¹ For Heaney, tradition allows the regional poet to affirm the centrality of local experience to his own being, but with the hope of making that experience accessible to readers from wholly different walks of life. Ideally, by raising private experience to the level of cultural expression, Heaney would have tradition transform personal memory into cultural memory.<br>

  Abstract: The problem of thinking is a problem of sublimation. To have language, meaning, and thereby religion, science, culture, and art, there must be sublimation in a broad sense. This book has traced some of the intricacies of sublimation through psychoanalytic theory as it impresses upon theology. Sublimation means that meaning is not direct and unmediated but consists of a detour. At the same time, my readings of theology, continental philosophy, and psychoanalytic theory suggest that sublimation is not an elevation above a material reality. In chapter 1, I appealed to Deleuze to question the two-level model of reality that sublimation<br>

  Book Title: Phenomenologies of the Stranger: Between Hostility and Hospitality-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: What is strange? Or better, who is strange? When do we encounter the strange? We encounter strangers when we are not at home: when we are in a foreign land or a foreign part of our own land. From Freud to Lacan to Kristeva to Heidegger, the feeling of strangeness-das Unheimlichkeit-has marked our encounter with the other, even the other within our self. Most philosophical attempts to understand the role of the Stranger, human or transcendent, have been limited to standard epistemological problems of other minds, metaphysical substances, body/soul dualism and related issues of consciousness and cognition. This volume endeavors to take the question of hosting the stranger to the deeper level of embodied imagination and the senses (in the Greek sense of aisthesis). This volume plays host to a number of encounters with the strange. It asks such questions as: How does the embodied imagination relate to the Stranger in terms of hospitality or hostility (given the common root of hostis as both host and enemy)? How do we distinguish between projections of fear or fascination, leading to either violence or welcome? How do humans sensethe dimension of the strange and alien in different religions, arts, and cultures? How do the five physical senses relate to the spiritual senses, especially the famous sixthsense, as portals to an encounter with the Other? Is there a carnal perception of alterity, which would operate at an affective, prereflective, preconscious level? What exactly do embodied imaginariesof hospitality and hostility entail, and how do they operate in language, psychology, and social interrelations (including racism, xenophobia, and scapegoating)? And what, finally, are the topical implications of these questions for an ethics and practice of tolerance and peace?<br>

The protagonists of this movement, which stretched between the Americas, the Caribbean, and Europe, were African-Americans and Jamaicans as well as Africans. Pan-Africanism was born during the colonial period<br>

  Author(s) Jackson Michael<br>
  Abstract: Conducting ethnographic research on sports, one encounters individuals who almost seem to transcend the boundaries of human capacity. Arguably, one of the thrills of athletic spectatorship is to witness skills and physical abilities honed to such an exceptional degree that an athlete’s performance beggars normal imagination, at once humbling us and at the same time thrilling. For an anthropological discussion of phenomenology, these kinds of people—agents operating at a level of efficacy beyond what is normally possible—offer an opportunity to interrogate the variation of human experience.<br>

  Abstract: Caring for the ill is a great moral task that brings into sharp relief our convictions about life and death. Not only does such care place the caregiver in unavoidable proximity to profound questions, but also the acts of care themselves reveal the nature of deeply held assumptions. Even the language that forms our descriptions of illness indicates some level of how we conceive of illness; our descriptions of illness also indicate how we understand the significance of life when it is in good health. In short, the words used for illness carry strong interpretive and evaluative power.<br>

  Abstract: After Latin America returned to democracy in the 1980s, the Catholic Church faded as a subject of academic research interest. Many specialists turned to the new topic of evangelical growth. However, the Catholic Church did not disappear and it continued to wield much influence, especially on the grassroots level. In this regard, it is interesting to note that in public opinion polls the Catholic Church continues to receive the highest rating as the institution in which most people have confidence.¹<br>

This is not that surprising, as it is a crucial notion (possibly, the highest level of abstraction we can deal with as we talk about music), but, at the same time, a very ambiguous one.¹<br>

  Abstract: It is a common assumption today that two paradigms typify the growing nexus between history and anthropology. One paradigm, which typifies history, is “a movement away from social history … and towards a new cultural history” (Kalb, Marks, and Tak 1996: 7). In its concern with epochs, mentalities, and collective representations, it uses anthropology as a repository of concepts, methods, and empirical data that historians can raid. The other paradigm, which typifies historical anthropology, is the one through which anthropologists operate in order to do history, using a central method of local-level research¹ and exploring issues related to “autonomy, deviance,<br>

  Book Title: Hidden Intercourse: Eros and Sexuality in the History of Western Esotericism-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kripal Jeffrey J.<br>
  Abstract: From rumors about gnostic orgies in antiquity to the explicit erotic symbolism of alchemical texts, from the subtly coded eroticism of medieval kabbalah to the sexual magic practiced by contemporary occultists and countercultural translations of Asian Tantra, the history of Western esotericism is rich in references to the domains of eros and sexuality. This volume, which brings together an impressive array of top-level specialists, is the first to analyze the eroticism of the esoteric without sensationalism or cheap generalizations, but on the basis of expert scholarship and attention to textual and historical detail. While there are few domains where the imagination may so easily run wild, the various contributions seek to distinguish fact from fiction-only to find that historical realities are sometimes even stranger than the fantasies. In doing so, they reveal the outlines of a largely unknown history spanning more than twenty centuries.<br>

  Abstract: Sexual and erotic language and imagery is extremely common in alchemy. Its most visible form occurs in oft-reproduced alchemical emblemata that routinely contain graphic depictions of gendered entities and copulating couples. Alchemical texts regularly employ erotic language as well, often describing extended allegorical sequences that occasionally involve sexual intercourse of various kinds or at least employ highly gendered imagery. Even at the most basic level, alchemists frequently speak of their substances as gendered—some as female, some as male, and some, rather famously, as hermaphroditic. Among modern commentators, the presence of such imagery has engendered a variety of explanations—of<br>

It makes it ooze that specifically homely goodness: intimations of sound nutrition, careful choice of ingredients, and careful labor (of love).

The creative vector constitutes the movement from below upward, from vital, to social, cultural, and personal values. The need to realize vital values on a recurrent basis gives rise to questions at the social level to address the needs of sustainable living. Sustainable living invites questions at the cultural level so that a direction conducive to human living might be found. Questions at the cultural level draw forth our capacity for personal self-transcendence.<br>

  Abstract: The Fourth Gospel presents a distinctive picture of John the Baptist in relation to Jesus. This essay is a high-level overview of this distinctive picture, with the purpose of considering to what extent and with what level of probability elements of this picture may be judged historical. The focus of the Society of Biblical Literature John, Jesus, and History Group at this point in its research agenda is on the works of Jesus, and so that is the focus of this essay. It does require us, however, to begin more broadly and also examine the fourth Gospel’s picture of John<br>

  Abstract: One of the distinctive ways in which John’s Gospel communicates Jesus’ identity as God’s heavenly revealer on earth is by attributing to him a profoundly enigmatic mode of speech. Figurative vocabulary and riddles feature prominently in the discourses of this “stranger from heaven,” not least in the cluster of declarations whose verbal building blocks consist of words to which more than one level of meaning can be ascribed (e.g., John 3:3–4; 4:10–11). among the most well known, and baffling, of these Johannine cases of

  Abstract: A prolific number of studies on minorities have shed light on the historical and political genealogies of what is meant by minority status in Europe (see Cowan 2000, 2010). Scholars such as Jennifer Jackson Preece (1997), Mark Mazower (2004), and Jane Cowan (2010) examine the historical predicament of developing a comprehensive UN framework toward the protection of minority populations after 1918. Looking at the issue of the minorities from a top-down perspective, these studies delve deeply into the logics of treaties and the thorny position of minority recognition on a pan-European level. Subsequently, nation-state recognition of minorities was a criterion<br>

Yet as was the case with most other participants in the UNWCC, other priorities, both domestic and international, soon came to the fore.

  Abstract: Critical studies of African and Caribbean women writing remain scarce.¹ The reasons for this absence are twofold. First, at the beginning of the formation of African literary studies in the mid-twentieth century, there were relatively few women writers in Africa and the Caribbean. This was mainly due to the external violence of colonialism, which privileged the schooling of the male. It was also attributable to internal violence originating from precolonial and postcolonial patriarchal conceptions that prevented women in traditional and contemporary societies from expressing themselves or acquiring the same educational level as men.

He does this, in part, by giving us characters’ conscious responses—at a somewhat shallow level of awareness—without accounting for their deeper motives or even, in some cases, indicating whether the surface awareness is consistent with what lies below. By a shallow level I mean only that the principal action of his novels takes place close enough to the surface of consciousness to alert us to meanings that are almost evident and therefore the more frustrating for their elusiveness.

  Abstract: Thinking about perceptions of body as they are used in the Bible leads, inevitably, to reflecting on clothing and the idea of clothing. Clothing is a powerful image throughout biblical literature and in human society generally.¹ At the most obvious level, clothing covers and conceals the body, protecting it from exposure to the elements and the view of other persons. But the significance of clothing extends much further since garments not only cover and conceal, but also function to display the body in particular ways and with many meanings.

  Abstract: A sensibility is how style presents itself in experience. For the observer, style may become apparent as an interpretative tone, deployed by native expertise. As such it exhibits a distinctive texture in social process, sensed by those immediately involved. Analytically, style can be of any scope and level: it is a scale-invariant concept. And whatever the scope, two basic aspects of style come intertwined: (a) the interpretive tone along with (b) the feedback dynamics. Style is not transposable, though it may get reconstituted.<br>

  Abstract: Part three provides an international perspective on the English experience of neighbourhood planning to amplify its themes and to place it in the context of debates about global shifts in the spatial scale of governance and empowerment. It discusses the concept of locality, identifies the further potential of community planning beyond land use and explores the impact of different state and governance structures on ideas of localism and devolution. This section reminds us that planning at the neighbourhood level can be assembled differently in different places and at different times.

So I assume my readers are ready for an actualization of Christian faith in accordance with the concerns, hesitancies, worries, and questions about affective fulfillment, the meaning of human life, and truth, which were described in the introduction and in chapter 1. With respect to Lonergan’s levels of intentionality, I situate affective fulfillment on the fourth level, meaning on the second, and truth on the third.<br>

  Book Title: How to Do Comparative Theology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): VON STOSCH KLAUS<br>
  Abstract: For a generation and more, the contribution of Christian theology to interreligious understanding has been a subject of debate. Some think of theological perspectives are of themselves inherently too narrow to support interreligious learning, and argue for an approach that is neutral or, on a more popular level, grounded simply open-minded direct experience. In response, comparative theology argues that theology, as faith seeking understanding, offers a vital perspective and a way of advancing interreligious dialogue, aided rather than hindered by commitments; theological perspectives can both complement and step beyond the study of religions by methods detached and merely neutral. Thus comparative theology has been successful in persuading many that interreligious learning from one faith perspective to another is both possible and worthwhile, and so the work of comparative theology has become more recognized and established globally. With this success there has come to the fore new challenges regarding method: How does one do comparative theological work in a way that is theologically grounded, genuinely open to learning from the other, sophisticated in pursuing comparisons, and fruitful on both the academic and practical levels?<br>

  Abstract: The spectrum of narrative phases discussed in the previous chapter is essentially an extension of the narrative level of analysis outlined in chapter 4. As a result, it is—like the narrative level itself—a deductive taxonomy determined by the general principles of musical narrative and superimposed upon the musical domain. Narrative phases thus enable a greater degree of interpretive subtlety: with expansion of the four basic archetypes according to secondary criteria that vary by degree (instead of by kind), more precise comparisons can be made within the larger categorical frames.<br>

The lines of communication quickly become clogged, leaders suffer information overload and are unable to fully appreciate problems at the local level. Decentralisation of knowledge sharing runs the risk of causing local overload, with key information not being prioritised or depending on actors who only have experience at processing local problems.

  Book Title: The Philosophy of Science Fiction Film-  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Sanders Steven M.<br>
  Abstract: The science fiction genre maintains a remarkable hold on the imagination and enthusiasm of the filmgoing public, captivating large audiences worldwide and garnering ever-larger profits. Science fiction films entertain the possibility of time travel and extraterrestrial visitation and imaginatively transport us to worlds transformed by modern science and technology. They also provide a medium through which questions about personal identity, moral agency, artificial consciousness, and other categories of experience can be addressed. In The Philosophy of Science Fiction Film, distinguished authors explore the storylines, conflicts, and themes of fifteen science fiction film classics, from Metropolis to The Matrix. Editor Steven M. Sanders and a group of outstanding scholars in philosophy, film studies, and other fields raise science fiction film criticism to a new level by penetrating the surface of the films to expose the underlying philosophical arguments, ethical perspectives, and metaphysical views. Sanders's introduction presents an overview and evaluation of each essay and poses questions for readers to consider as they think about the films under discussion.The first section, "Enigmas of Identity and Agency," deals with the nature of humanity as it is portrayed in Blade Runner, Dark City, Frankenstein, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and Total Recall. In the second section, "Extraterrestrial Visitation, Time Travel, and Artificial Intelligence," contributors discuss 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Terminator, 12 Monkeys, and The Day the Earth Stood Still and analyze the challenges of artificial intelligence, the paradoxes of time travel, and the ethics of war. The final section, "Brave Newer World: Science Fiction Futurism," looks at visions of the future in Metropolis, The Matrix, Alphaville, and screen adaptations of George Orwell's 1984.<br>

By this restrictive clause, I wish to situate these three disciplines at a higher level than that of the theory of discourse considered within the limits of the sentence. At this level of simplicity, the definition of discourse is not the<br>

  Abstract: We have been dealing with the cognitive processes that underlie experiences which we have variously termed higher states of consciousness, transpersonal experience, or presentational states. These have been understood as a reconstitution on the level of symbolic cognition of presence-openness as the basic structure of perception in motile sentient creatures. Horizonal openness and the flow gradients of the ambient array are “real,” “existent,” and inherent to the structure of sentience, but would only be realized as such, as felt meaning for its own sake, on the human level. Presence-openness emerges into presentational symbolic cognition through the synesthetic translation of the<br>

  Book Title: Translating Life-Studies in Transpositional Aesthetics<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): STEAD ALISTAIR<br>
  Abstract: This volume brings together eighteen substantial essays by distinguished scholars, critics and translators, and two interviews with eminent figures of British theatre, to explore the idea and practice of translation. The individual, but conceptually related, contributions examine topics from the Renaissance to the present in the context of apt exploration of the translation process, invoking both restricted and extended senses of translation. The endeavour is to study in detail the theory, workings and implications of what might be called the art of creative transposition, effective at the level of interlingual transcoding, dynamic rewriting, theatrical and cinematic adaptation, intersemiotic or intermedial translation, and cultural exchange. Many of the essays focus on aspects of intertextuality, the dialogue with text, past and present, as they bear on the issue of translation, attending to the historical, political or cultural dimensions of the practice, whether it illuminates a gendered reading of a text or a staging of cultural difference. The historic and generic range of the discussions is wide, encompassing the Elizabethan epyllion, Sensibility fiction, Victorian poetry and prose, modern and postmodern novels, but the book is dominated by dramatic or performance-related applications, with major representation of fresh investigations into Shakespeare (from A Midsummer Night’s Dream to The Tempest) and foregrounding of acts of self-translation on stage, in the dramatic monologue and in fiction. Contributions from theatre practitioners such as Sir Peter Hall, John Barton and Peter Lichtenfels underscore the immense practical importance of the translator on the stage and the business of both acting and directing as a species of translation.<br>

Today the remnants of that experience pervade the depopulated Irish landscape: abandoned stone cottages, crumbling workhouses and overgrown mass graves, and the endlessly stonewalled and subdivided smallholdings that are testament to the meagre acreage allotted to the Famine poor existing at the very margins of society.

We think of animals and people as migrating, sometimes by choice, sometimes by instinct, sometimes by compulsion. Migration is movement, but not just any movement. It is movement across geographical, national and/or cultural boundaries or differences. So, migration requires difference of some sort. We rarely speak of someone or something as having migrated if no change or adaptation was required, although of course at some level every move is by definition a change. Migration, then, must refer to specific kinds<br>

In the study of religion, a Western discipline devoted to a concept rooted in the histories of Western societies, the relation between individuals and religions is most often framed in two ways, cognitive and social: a person (ideally at least) “believes in” (the cognitive aspect) the core claims of the religion to which he “belongs” (the social aspect).¹ This model of religious participation, usually taken for granted as universally applicable, works well in—because it arose in<br>

  Abstract: Considerations of center and periphery in Heian Japan involve at the highest level the relationship between the central political apparatus and the hinterlands, the sixty-six provinces and two islands (Iki and Tsushima) that constituted the conceptualized polity. Indeed, the very existence of a state presupposes control over the human and material resources of the space thought to constitute the geographical area of that conceptualized state. This was never an easy task for Japanese rulers, despite the insular character of Japan that seems to lend itself to simple mapping of a discrete geopolitical entity.

  Abstract: Paterson, as J. M. Brinnin rightly observes, has “an all-of-a-piece consistency on an intellectual level, but on an emotive level the poem is vastly uneven.”² Accordingly, much of the critical energy devoted to Williams’ poem has centered on an explication—and implicit celebration—of the work’s “intellectual consistency,” combined with a nervous awareness of how difficult it is to reconcile that reassuring surface coherence with its unstable and shifting bases. Yet, I suspect thatPatersonsucceeds only when it abandons its symbolic structure, when, in place of the eponymous hero and his metaphoric landscape, the text directly confronts the “delirium<br>

  Abstract: In the first two chapters, I established a dossier on the sentence, “I am you,” the signature of a tradition. With the discussion of amorous sympathy, the inquiry went a level deeper. From the sentence, we moved to patterns of interpretation, including a strategy of proof, that made the sentence possible. Those patterns circled around two common paradigms, the biological and esthetic, both dealing with the formal coherence of separate things, and with the dynamic by which it becomes possible for many individuals to participate in the same coherence and thus to become one. Evidently, in the tradition represented by<br>

  Author(s) Genette Gérard<br>
  Abstract: Nana, Emile Zola’s 1880 portrayal of courtesan life during the Second Empire, is a novel dominated by sustained waiting. Readers of novels, especially nineteenth-century readers and readers of nineteenth-century novels, have been schooled to seek closure—to overcome gaps, domesticate the unfamiliar, establish connections and coherence, understand motives, and anticipate climax. InNanaone can indeed engage these goals, but only at a relatively general level; the text prevents a narrower application of that understanding, despite the personal focus implied by eponymy. For all its proliferation of data, this novel expands without quite filling out a portrait of Nana herself.<br>

The current level of vulgarization of Nietzsche’s thought is not perhaps as easily seen as what is all around us. What is all around us, in turn, is not so easy to characterize as to see. Heidegger considered Nietzsche’s the “final thought of Western metaphysics” (Heidegger 1984, 2:232).<br>

However, this situation in itself does not prefigure what the outcomes of that change will look like.

In the contemporary world politics can be understood as the interplay of agents who claim to represent the interests of others. As societies grow more complex, people tend to delegate the task of promoting their interests to those who specialize in representation. These specialists may be lobbyists, pressure groups, or political parties. The highest and most encompassing level of representation is indeed that attained by legislators,<br>

  Author(s): Barreto Eric D.<br>
  Abstract: Reading is one of the basic skills a student needs. But reading is not just an activity of the eyes and the brain. Reading Theologically, edited by Eric D. Barreto, brings together eight seminary educators from a variety of backgrounds to explore what it means to be a reader in a seminary context--to read theologically. Reading theologically involves a specific minset adn posture towards texts and ideas, people and communities alike. Reading theologically is not just about academic skill building but about the formation of a ministerial leader who can engage scholarship critically, interpret Scripture and tradition faithfully, welcome different perspectives, and help lead others to do the same. This brief, readable, edited volume emphasizes the vital skills, habits, practices, and values involved in reading theologically. Reading Theologically is a vital resource for students beginning the seminary process and professors of introductory level seminary courses.<br>

  Book Title: The Future of the Word-An Eschatology of Reading<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Kriner Tiffany Eberle<br>
  Abstract: In scripture, Jesus promises a future that potentiall infuses all texts: "my words will not pass away" (Matt 24:28). This book argues that texts--even literary texts--, have an eschatology, too, a part of God's purpose for the cosmos. They, with all creation, moves toward participation in the new creation, in the Trinity's expanding, creative love. This eschatological future for texts impacts how we understand meaning making, from the level of semiology to that of hermeneutics. This book tells he story of how readers participate in the future of the word, the eschatology of texts. If texts have a future i the kingdom of God, then readers' engagement with them--everything from preservation and utterance to translation, criticism, and call and response--can cultivate those futures in the love of the Trinity. Kriner explores how the fallenness and failures of texts, alongside readers' own failures, while seeming to challenge the future of the word, ultimately point to reading as a posture of reconciliation, in which reader and text meet in the Maranatha of all text.<br>

This is so even despite the fact that throughout urban, enclaved, and economically deprived working-class housing areas in Northern Ireland, young people, and particularly young men, are reported as consistently participating in “low-level” violent activities. While no formal definition of this notion of “low-level” violence exists, its use in the Northern Irish context is widespread. Thoughts vary on the origin of the expression<br>

  Book Title: Biography and turning points in Europe and America-  Publisher: Policy Press<br>

  Abstract: This sociological collection advances the argument that the concept of a turning point expands our understanding of life experiences from a descriptive to a deeper and more abstract level of analysis. It addresses the conceptual issue of what distinguishes turning points from life transitions in general and raises crucial questions about the application of turning points as a biographical research method. Biography and turning points in Europe and America is all the more distinctive and significant due to its broad empirical database. The anthology includes authors from ten different countries, providing a number of contexts for thinking about how turning points relate to constructions of meaning shaped by globalization and by cultural and structural meanings unique to each country. The book will be useful across a wide range of social sciences and particularly valuable for researchers needing a stronger theoretical base for biographical work.<br>

  Book Title: From Violence to Speaking Out-Apocalypse and Expression in Foucault, Derrida and Deleuze<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Lawlor Leonard<br>
  Abstract: Drawing on a career-long exploration of 1960s French philosophy, Leonard Lawlor seeks a solution to 'the problem of the worst violence'. Lawlor argues all violence must itself be reduced to its lowest level. He engages with Foucault, Derrida and Deleuze and Guattari to create new ways of speaking to best achieve the least violence.<br>

  Author(s) Porter Robert<br>
  Abstract: Since Foucault started publishing in the early 1960s much ink has been spilled by both his detractors and supporters alike.¹ An interesting point to note, however, is that each tends to assign to Foucault’s work a level of coherence and/or integration that is overall quite difficult to substantiate. One of the most famous of the supportive texts is by Dreyfus and Rabinow (1982), gained from their discussions and interviews with Foucault during his annual research trips to the University of California, Berkeley. Dreyfus and Rabinow appoint to Foucault’s work a definite methodological evolution that clearly separates his ‘archaeological’ and ‘genealogical’<br>

  Abstract: In the first decade of the twenty-first century, religion once more became a prominent topic of public discourse and the language of religion, and of atheism, became the lingua franca in which key issues of the day were formulated. Whatever might be thought of the general level on which it has been taken up in our contemporary debates, this resurgence of religion facilitates the leap of historical imagination required to take us back to the intellectual climate of the nineteenth century, especially its first half. Then, as now, religion offered a crucial focus for debating fundamental issues of human identity<br>

  Abstract: In the wake of the 1989 Tiananmen Square event, the Chinese government has both tightened its authoritarian rule and introduced a wide variety of local mini-democratisation practices, including village elections, township elections, intra-party democracy, participatory and deliberative forums, and participatory budgeting. While these do not jeopardise the monopoly of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on political decision making, they illustrate major trends and characteristics of Chinese democratisation and highlight the Chinese hybrid model of democratisation. This chapter focuses on official democratic mechanisms and institutions initiated at the local level, rather than on more general aspects of democratisation, such as rights<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapter, we have looked at some themes concerning the role of consciousness in thinking differently. To similarly examine the role of the unconscious and nonconscious is, however, more problematic. The lack of insight we have into our mental life below the conscious level, and the seeming antithesis between mental functioning at such levels and social structures, makes the mapping of the former to the latter difficult. The problem has, however, already been addressed by theorists who have attempted to unpack the Freudian unconscious in political terms and it will be useful to canvas such attempts before moving<br>

  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Musheno Michael<br>
  Abstract: Whether on a patrol beat, in social service offices, or in public school classrooms, street-level workers continually confront rules in relation to their own beliefs about the people they encounter. Cops, Teachers, Counselors is the first major study of street-level bureaucracy to rely on storytelling. Steven Maynard-Moody and Michael Musheno collect the stories told by these workers in order to analyze the ways that they ascribe identities to the people they encounter and use these identities to account for their own decisions and actions. The authors show us how the world of street-level work is defined by the competing tensions of law abidance and cultural abidance in a unique study that finally allows cops, teachers, and counselors to voice their own views of their work.Steven Maynard-Moody is Director of the Policy Research Institute and Professor of Public Administration at the University of Kansas.Michael Musheno is Professor of Justice and Policy Studies at Lycoming College and Professor Emeritus of Justice Studies, Arizona State University.<br>

Through the storytellers’ words, we experience the physical and emotional context of their work.

Street-level stories, like other narratives both grand and mundane, help us understand how sense and meaning are made and how norms are conveyed and enforced.

Theories offer not just explanations for complex phenomena, but also an inclusive understanding of the phenomena. They do this by defining the political concepts and thus decontesting them. This is a point worth stressing: theories do offer explanations—that being their manifest function, after all—but on a prior and deeper level, they define political concepts for

  Book Title: Race and the Making of the Mormon People-  Publisher: The University of North Carolina Press<br>
  Author(s): MUELLER MAX PERRY<br>
  Abstract: The nineteenth-century history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Max Perry Mueller argues, illuminates the role that religion played in forming the notion of three "original" American races-red, black, and white-for Mormons and others in the early American Republic. Recovering the voices of a handful of black and Native American Mormons who resolutely wrote themselves into the Mormon archive, Mueller threads together historical experience and Mormon scriptural interpretations. He finds that the Book of Mormon is key to understanding how early followers reflected but also departed from antebellum conceptions of race as biblically and biologically predetermined. Mormon theology and policy both challenged and reaffirmed the essentialist nature of the racialized American experience.The Book of Mormon presented its believers with a radical worldview, proclaiming that all schisms within the human family were anathematic to God's design. That said, church founders were not racial egalitarians. They promoted whiteness as an aspirational racial identity that nonwhites could achieve through conversion to Mormonism. Mueller also shows how, on a broader level, scripture and history may become mutually constituted. For the Mormons, that process shaped a religious movement in perpetual tension between its racialist and universalist impulses during an era before the concept of race was secularized.<br>

  Author(s) Godzich Wlad<br>
  Abstract: Between the formation/cognition of narrative discourse and the construction of narrative significance, there is still one important mediation to consider: that of genre as technê and sociohistorical constraint. In fact, if we had not taken genre into account, implicitly at least, every time we studied individual examples of acts of narrative communication and their texts, we would have made an intolerable qualitative leap from the level of generality at which our method of analysis was situated to particular concrete situations. The purpose of this chapter is to put genre to work as efficiently as possible within the process of theorization<br>

  Abstract: For reasons that probably have more to do with quantity than with quality, in the international relations literature on regions, and particularly in the noneconomic literature, "Europe" is often not included as a region. Thus the two readings of how the self/other perspective may be brought to the study of identity formation at the Europewide level that were presented in Chapters z and 3 played themselves out in a "heterologue," with texts written mainly by historians. Once one turns to regions or, granting that Europe may just as well be treated as a region, subregions in addition to such texts<br>

  Abstract: The United Nations intervention in Somalia from January 1992 to April 1995 offers itself to us as a movie. Reading Somalia as a cinematographic fiction is not only made possible by the explosion of visual media that this post–cold war intervention triggered.¹ It is also influenced by the actors themselves, the level of reality at which their actions take place, and the staged scenarios that they try to follow. In fact, Somalia is one of the first locations where the United Nations has actually been given the opportunity to demonstrate its acting talents. Reinvested by George Bush’s post–Gulf<br>

Elements of the screen interface, such as a compass heading graphic, a mini map, or a radar screen giving extra information about the player’s surrounds, avatar health level, and weapons selection indicators, are common informational supplements to the visual field of perception provided to the player.

  Abstract: The notion of exemplarity can be of only limited use to our reflections about politics unless we develop an understanding of what exemplarity could mean in the public realm and how its inherent normativity could play a role at that level. One way of contributing to such an understanding consists in reconstructing the kind of normativity underlying Rawls’s notions of public reason and of the reasonable. According to a somewhat popular but deeply misguided view, the transition from the framework of

  Abstract: Violent crime in popular entertainment is first and foremost a question of storytelling. On the most basic level, violence demands more story than does sex. Consider, for example, the extreme cases in popular entertainment directed at roughly the same demographic (men): in pornography, storytelling is kept to a minimum, since anything that is not overtly sexual is simply a distraction, and thus sex scenes can be strung together with the flimsiest of narrative threads (“Is that the delivery boy?”). In stories of violence, there is no precise narrative equivalent to pornography, as graphic violence tends to be much more motivated<br>

  Author(s): Soni Vivasvan<br>
  Abstract: Soni explains that this puzzling phenomenon can only be comprehended by studying a structural transformation of the idea of happiness at the level of narrative form. Happiness is stripped of its ethical and political content, Soni demonstrates, when its intimate relation to narrative is destroyed. This occurs, paradoxically, in some of the most characteristic narratives of the period: eighteenth-century novels including
         Pamela, The Vicar of Wakefield, andJulie; the pervasive sentimentalism of the time; Kant's ethics; and the political thought of Rousseau and Jefferson.<br>

  Abstract: In newspapers and on television, and in museums and at heritage sites, the story of de-industrialisation in the USA is often represented through a simplistic historical lens: broad brushstrokes are used to paint the patterns of boom and bust with little interrogation of local-level, personal and shared experiences of it. This broad historical lens is rarely grounded in specific places, while simultaneously being connected to others with similar patterns of development and decline. Respecting and attempting to understand the people, places and intangible cultural heritage of industry’s rise and fall from the perspectives of those living these experiences is central.<br>

This sort of self-identification was not unusual within his Viennese circle of friends; perhaps the closest model is Schoenberg’s identification with Moses in his operaMoses und Aron.² Yet Berg complicates his self-identification with Alwa because, as Patricia Hall has rightly argued, “many sketches for the Rondo suggest that on some level Berg associated the character of Alwa with Tristan from<br>

  Book Title: Imperfection and Defeat-The Role of Aesthetic Imagination in Human Society<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Nemoianu Virgil<br>
  Abstract: Literature is defined in a challenging way as the "science" of imperfection and defeat, or else as a type of discourse that deals with defeat, loss, uncertainty in social life, by contrast with virtually all disciplines (hard sciences or social sciences) that affirm certainties and wish to convince us of truths. If in real history most constructive attempts end up in failure, it follows that we ought to have also a field of research that examines this diversity of failures and disappointments, as well as the alternative options to historical evolution and progress. Thus literature serves an indispensable role: that of gleaning the abundance of past existence, the gratuitous and the rejected being placed here on an equal level with the useful and the successful. This provocative and unusual approach is illustrated in chapters that deal with the dialectics between literary writing and such fields as historical writing, or religious discourses, and is also illustrated by the socio-historical development of East-Central Europe.<br>

Author(s): Young, Jeffrey T.<br>
Abstract: The book’s eleven essays focus on poverty or economic disadvantage: one piece deals with available data on economic variables relating to crime and legal representation, the other ten directly or in passing endorse or reject the independence thesis. The quality of the essays is mixed. On the positive side, Jeremy Waldron quickly adapts an argument from the overinclusiveness of legal rules to reject indigence as a legal justification for property crime. Stephen Morse usefully rehearses and dismisses prevalent invalid inferences from economic disadvantage to criminal nonculpability. Loren Lomasky’s welfarist libertarian case for subsidizing legal representation of criminal defendants is nicely outlined. William Heffernan’s reliance on restrictions on justifications available to decision makers is a potentially fruitful move. At points some of the essays progress by bare assignments of burdens of proof rather than hard argument. Must dependence theorists have in hand a complete theory of distributive justice? Who must show that notions of authority bar judges from invoking controversial normative theories, at least when consistent with authoritative legal sources? Who must show that criteria of legal responsibility should include morally relevant psychological variables, such as stress, in addition to minimal normative and cognitive capacities? Sometimes the argument is too brief. Because legal rules need not advertise their background justifications, defendants often plausibly can claim that deviation from a rule of property law vindicates the rule’s justification. Thus, against Waldron, it is unlikely that the mere “logic” of property rights prevents indigence from being a legal justification for property crimes. More needs to be said. Brevity particularly mars Pettit’s “republican” defense of the dependence thesis in criminal sentencing. Because the defense requires that criminal sanctions aim at assuring nondomination of victims, indigence can ground different sanc~<br>

Abstract: While Ricoeur suggests that recourse to solidarity can go too far in answering these questions, an appeal to the conditions of solidarity provides the basis for his criticism of Rawls. As his account of the subject of rights would suggest, and agreeing with many in the Anglo‐American world, Ricoeur denies that a procedural theory of justice can substitute for the bonds of an ethical community or replace a collective conception of the good. At the same time, he sees Rawls’s analysis as a brilliant articulation of the deontological level of the structure of moral action. For Ricoeur, Rawls’s revisions of his theory of justice in his later work mark his own recognition of the connection between the deontological and teleological levels of moral action since he now explicitly grounds the theory of justice in a particular sort of political community.<br>

Abstract: The new institutionalism (DiMaggio and Powell
            1991) emphasizes the durability and power of taken‐for‐granted understandings in formal institutions. Neoinstitutionalism underscores the persistence of group culture without resorting to older, widely criticized formulations of culture as shared beliefs. The concept of group style firmly upholds their idea and extends it to the analysis of less formal settings and everyday interaction. Neoinstitutionalists usually focus on large‐scale rules or models that shape entire organizations, networks, or institutions (e.g., DiMaggio1991; Becker1999; Clemens1997). Clearly complementing these broader studies, the concept of “group style” highlights everyday interactional routines. The same organization can host different group styles in its different group settings. Patterned or institutionalized cultures—group styles—work at a more microsociological level also.<br>

Abstract: 1. Is paradigm the right choice, and have I used it correctly?There is always a risk in adopting a concept that comes from a different tradition. It is even riskier when we fiddle with it and stretch it to fit a set of data for which it was not designed as I have done. But I believe that the risk is warranted for two reasons. The first is that there is considerable confusion within and outside of anthropology regarding the nature of the anthropological study of language. The oscillation mentioned in the article among a number of labels, including linguistic anthropology, anthropological linguistics, sociolinguistics, and ethnolinguistics, is only the most superficial and yet telling example of the widespread lack of clarity as to what constitutes linguistic research from an anthropological perspective. Further evidence of confusion can be inferred from the typically partial and often clumsy attempts to represent the linguistic subfield (or the study of language) in sociocultural anthropology textbooks. I felt that it was time to come to terms with the fact that perhaps those of us inside the subfield had not been communicating to those outside as effectively as we thought we were. I then realized that to address this issue I needed a notion that by its very nature would force us to think in terms of broad trends rather than particular notions or hypotheses. The popular notions of paradigm and paradigm shift seemed to me the perfect candidates; they could force us to think in terms of the major features of our research projects. CookGumperz and Gumperz are right when they write that Kuhns approach gives a sense of structural containment to the flow of ideas that to those living with them appear much more fluid and overlapping.

Abstract: Hawking’s special conditions impose the mechanization (the hierarchization, standardization, and routinization) of his human/machine based environment.
         39What is at stake behind this coordination and hierarchization of tasks is human life. A false maneuver in any of these operations can result in death.40The graduate assistant will characterize his job not only by its high level of responsibility (in the end what is at stake is the life of a human being) but also by the availability required (“we are on call twenty‐four hours a day”) and the difficulty of living constantly together. What is also at stake is Hawking’s ability to work and to maintain his status as Stephen Hawking the Genius Physicist. This network of competences allows a yes or a no to be operational. A yes answer to the question, Do you want to go to this conference? will enable him to travel from one end of the earth to the other without more than twitching an eyebrow.41<br>

         La Méditerranéeis a history of the Mediterranean and Philip II’s Spanish empire as well as a primary document illustrating the trajectory of twentieth‐century French historical studies and social thought both before and after its publication and revision.97On a biographical level, it was the sum of his personal experiences and studies, as Braudel’s preface to the first edition in 1949 recalls: “I have joyfully dedicated long years of study to it—much more than all my youth.”98Already in his forty‐seventh year at the time of the book’s publication, Braudel had had an eventful life; but it should be remembered that at mid‐century he had not yet made his mark nor won an established academic position in France, as, for example, his colleague Ernest Labrousse (1895–1988) or his American peers Hamilton and Lane had done long before.99Braudel himself knew what his friends thought about his never‐ending book: “among my friends and colleagues it was reported that I would never finish this very ambitious work.”100In 1976 he himself would correct the common false impression of the positive reception in 1947 of his thesis and theAnnalesmovement in general—“without drum and trumpet and with a thousand nice‐sounding words in my ear,” he was rejected for an appointment at the Sorbonne and received condescending criticism at his thesis defense. “One of the judges suavely said to me, ‘You are a geographer: let me be the historian.’”101Braudel saw himself as a perpetual outsider, an exile, not unlike the self‐image of theAnnalesitself, memorialized at the Binghamton inaugural conference, as a historical tradition of resistance.102Yet, in the administrative sphere, in his post‐1950 career as director of theAnnales,the Ecole, and the Maison, Braudel’s keen intelligence, force of personality, power with words, ~<br>

Abstract: The memo has always been considered a bit player in this story; but there is good reason to regard it as a central instance of the control revolution, as Yates implies. The connection between the document and control is attested at the deep level of philology. Our word

Abstract: The analysis of apologetics that divides it into expressive and representational components is not immediately obvious. Ostensibly, the defense of the faith against theological challenges presupposes the prior establishment of a community’s identity. The concern to establish religious identity thus appears to be extrinsic to the apologetic enterprise. On a deeper level, however, religious identity is something that must be continually maintained and expressed,
         56and the contrasts drawn between one’s own community and others constitute one of the forms this expression of identity takes. That a concern to maintain religious identity is intrinsic to apologetics becomes clear when we acknowledge the continuity between apologetics and the formation of doctrine. To the extent that a basic function of doctrine is to delimit the cognitive boundaries of a religious community, there is an intrinsic connection between a community’s doctrines, themselves products of conflict, and the continuing apologetic enterprise of defending these doctrines against new challenges. A community of faith establishes its identity in and through theological dispute, both in the primary mode of doctrinal formation and in the secondary mode of doctrinal defense.<br>

Abstract: Because of the above, we can see how living beings, construed as
      persons, are actively emergent beings living out a process of narrative identity. In the terms used by Gare, we can appreciate how persons are processes of becoming that are emergent inside the cultural dynamics but that the latter also includes institutions that are themselves processes of becoming. Furthermore, if we appreciate that library is not just an aggregate of texts but is rather a level of semantics at which new meanings are being generated, we start to gain a foothold for new theory development.<br>

Abstract: We are now in a position to understand the relationship between the cyborg and women of color. At one level there is no relationship, only oneness. Since in the informatics of domination we all cannot help being cyborgs, women of color are cyborgs. But the ultimate relationship is again analogical. Just as the cyborg is a fusion of human and machine, a monstrous and illegitimate fusion, so, the argument goes, is the constituency of women of color, forged as it is without identity. Thus is it not surprising that race sometimes figures in Haraway’s essay in a similar fashion as it does in Rubin’s: “race, gender, and capital require a cyborg theory of wholes and parts” (Haraway
         1991, 181); “the causes of various women‐headed households are a function of race, class, or sexuality” (167); and “some of the rearrangements of race, sex, and class rooted in high‐tech‐facilitated social relations can make socialist‐feminism more relevant to effective progressive politics” (165). Cyborg identities, mediated through the politics of women of color, help defuse—or to use Wilkerson’s terminology, deny the responsibility of working with—whiteness and white feminist social location. Haraway’s stated reasons for turning to women of color make this clear. Haraway writes: “For me—and for many who share a similar historical location in white, professional middle‐class, female, radical, North American, mid‐adult bodies—the sources of a crisis in political identity are legion. The recent history for much of the US left and US feminism has been a response to this kind of crisis by endless splitting and searches for a new essential unity. But there has also been a growing recognition of another response through coalition—affinity, not identity” (1991, 155). I argued earlier that analogy functions like a colonial fetish enabling the white feminist theorist to displace racial difference onto a safer notion of similarity. We can now add the following: racial analogy within (white) fem~<br>

Abstract: I say “reconfigured strategically” to avoid the impression that my attempt to reconfigure the dialectic of comparative theology and theology of religions as a politically liberating praxis excludes the more elite discourses of the religious traditions involved (such as those of India’s Brahmins and China’s Confucian elites), which are in many cases both hegemonic (within a particular cultural framework) and marginalized (within a larger or global context). The solidary praxis of restoring and enabling subaltern religious representations is aimed at establishing participatory parity as a political reality in which both subaltern and elite representations could take part as decentered centers that are all other to one another and no longer as subaltern or elite in terms of sociopolitical and cultural hegemony. To bring into being such a politically level playing field, in which the more elite discourses find themselves also liberated and with a new voice, I think it is strategically necessary to emphasize first an act of solidarity with the oppressed. I thank the anonymous reviewer of my essay for raising the question of my thesis’s possible exclusion of elite religious discourses.<br>

Abstract: Ibid., 61. Tesauro mentions one eloquent case of divine expression. When in Josh. 10:12 the sun and the moon stood still over Gibeon, the literal meaning corresponds to its historical connotation. The tropological meaning is that the enemies signify the vices against reason and the planets mean the worldly goods. Therefore, man cannot defeat sin unless he uses his goods and is not used by them. The allegorical meaning is that no one can overcome the “enemy” without the beneficial influences of the sun and the moon (Jesus and the Virgin Mary). Finally, the anagogical level becomes evident if we see the enemies as the damned souls, the sun as the divinity, and the moon as the humanity of the blessed souls (ibid., 61–62).<br>

Abstract: Just as the literary canon changes over time, so too does the theoretical canon. If the above‐mentioned theorists are the constants, the authors with whom our authors have engaged, and seemingly will continue to engage, what about those whose rise and/or disappearance may clue us into authors who are becoming more and more the focal point of research?
      CI, and theory more generally, has always been philosophically inclined; Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, and Cavell appear on a regular basis throughout our volumes. But becauseCritical Inquiryis often touted as one of the first multidisciplinary journals, how are other fields represented? Let us take the example of cultural anthropology. Victor Turner is cited six times from 1979 through 1989, but only once in the last fifteen years. This seems surprising, especially given the importance of Turner’s concept of liminality to literary critics such as Sacvan Bercovitch. But perhaps Marcel Mauss has taken his place, having been cited once before 1992, and then ten times since. Other significant anthropologists include Clifford Geertz, ten times between 1982 and 1992, and only one or two times before and after; James Clifford, thirteen times between 1989 and 1995, and then only once every four issues thereafter; and Michael Taussig, who has been cited a total of eight times, but only since 1997. Of the anthropologists on our list, only Lévi‐Strauss has had a consistent level of citation: from three to six citations in each five‐year period. From this we can extrapolate that cultural anthropology was most central to theory a decade or so ago, during the new historicist moment. It is a good guess that at least the immediate future of theory will be colored more by Taussig and Mauss than by Turner or Geertz.<br>

Abstract: Either way, the micro‐level interactions in Mrs. Barrett’s classroom revealed the processes of collective memory formation that in turn paved the way for the students’ position. The prayers Mrs. Barrett had uttered on 9/11 and in the weeks following, her disciplining of students’ fears, and her interpretations of texts, whether ten Boom’s memoir or the suburban landscape, all buttressed belief in a world where God’s control reigns supreme and where, therefore, human agency is diminished. As important as the processes by which collective memory were produced in this school, then, were the analytic dimensions of the memory itself, the highly problematic messages about agency, citizenship, democracy, and history embedded in its narrative.<br>

Abstract: It could also be—if we become genuinely interested, which cannot be taken for granted; all we can take for granted is “our world”—that we adopt a more abstract perspective and, by comparing the other’s ideas and customs with our own and those of people we know a little better, try to understand the “other” confronting us. That is when one can speak of an observer perspective. Adopting an observer perspective is like entering a helicopter and ascending from ground level into the sky—not too high, otherwise one can no longer see the tiny men, women, buildings, streets, villages, and cities, but high enough to be able to survey the whole panorama so as to impose some sort of structure on the mishmash of data: a structure of similarities and dissimilarities.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur, in contrast, is one of a few philosophers who offer, however briefly, a phenomenology of forgetting, although he too voices skepticism about an
         ars oblivionalison par with thears memoriae.He distinguishes between three levels or approaches to memory and forgetting. These are obstructed memory and forgetting (l'oubli et la mémoire empêchée,on the level of the psychopathological), manipulated memory and forgetting (l'oubli et la mémoire manipulée,on the practical or instrumental level), and controlled memory and forgetting (l'oubli et la mémoire commandée/obligée,on the ethical‐political level).110In the last context, forgetting and pardoning are intrinsically linked through the problematic of the past: forgetting, to memory and fidelity to the past; pardoning, to culpability and reconciliation with the past. “Indeed, a happy forgetting is the horizon of the pacified memory.”111Ricoeur further differentiates between forgetting through deletion and a more measured, reserved kind of forgetting, closely connected to the opposition between amnesia and amnesty. In considering amnesty as institutional forgetting, Ricoeur notes that it aims at reconciliation and civil peace.112In this sense one can hypothesize by analogy that persecution, punishment, and eradication, even if explicitly articulated as forgetting, may serve as institutional reminders but can also (sometimes consciously) exacerbate societal tensions.<br>

Abstract: The creative moral capability is ultimately best imagined through the strange language of myth. Myth can simultaneously capture the narrative thickness of actual social dynamics yet also press it toward its own more primordial creative possibilities. Myth arises out of and subjects to critique particular historical conditions. Moral creativity is more concretely imagined the more its mythologization—as, for example, in McFague’s all‐embracing Motherhood—disrupts and transforms present history in a freshly inclusive way. The symbolism of a kingdom of God, by contrast, may now imply such hierarchical social domination that it can no longer function well as a symbol of the hoped‐for new human community. Gustavo Gutiérrez offers still another possibility of the symbolism of “creative freedom” through “work”: “Humankind is created in the image and likeness of God and … fulfills itself only by transforming nature and thus entering into relationships with other persons. Only in this way do persons come to a full consciousness of themselves as subjects of creative freedom which is realized through work.”
         38In whatever form, such moral myths are themselves on some level all‐too‐human creations. Even the myth of the Creator Mother can transform human society only so far. Nevertheless, the value of myth for moral practice and thought lies precisely in its capacity for opening and transforming moral life. It can provoke our easily lost yet always also available faculty for creating together a more profoundly humanized social world.<br>

Abstract: Another scenario can be used here to connect values to ALA’s Code of Ethics. The main speaker at a library association conference program dealing with codes of ethics focuses on the ALA Code of Ethics (the revised version adopted by the ALA Council in 1995). The code includes items about intellectual freedom, intellectual property rights, privacy and confidentiality, and ensuring that personal or private interests do not interfere with access to information. The speaker, though, spends most of his time on one item of the code: “We provide the highest level of service to all library users through appropriate and usefully organized resources; equitable access; and accurate, unbiased, and courteous responses to all requests” [
         17]. The speaker adamantly defends this part of the code. A responding speaker on the program challenges the main speaker’s position and that item of the code saying that the addition of accuracy in the statement introduces bias. The second speaker argues that accuracy is a construction based on domination and oppression and should be challenged in the interests of pluralism and cultural sensitivity. She brings up the report of ALA’s Core Values Task Force II and points out that accuracy appears nowhere in it; not even the value of service mentions accuracy. She further says that the value of social responsibility implicitly urges advocacy on social issues and argues that advocacy trumps accuracy, becoming our genuine ethical goal. Can/should a code of ethics explicitly address things such as accuracy? Is there a realistic and/or objective norm for accurate responses to questions? Should truth be a tenet of a code of ethics?<br>

Issue: ci.2007.33.issue-2<br>
Date: 01 2007<br>
Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: Before we elaborate further on Derrida’s response to Patočka in
      The Gift of Death, a brief and very sketchy outline of what this text seeks to achieve is warranted. We should keep in mind Derrida’s observation in the first chapter, “Secrets of European Responsibility,” that what separates Patočka’s interpretation of the motif of the care of the soul from Heidegger’s influence is its essential Christianity. Whereas Heidegger constantly seeks to separate himself from Christianity, “repeating on an ontological level Christian themes and texts that have been de‐Christianized,’” “Patočka makes an inverse yet symmetrical gesture” by ontologizing “the historic themes of Christianity and attribut[ing] to revelation or to themysterium tremendumthe ontological content that Heidegger attempts to remove from it.” Thus, Derrida holds that Patočka’s gesture “amounts to the same thing” as Heidegger’s because it is symmetrical and merely the inverse. He adds that Patočka’s “own heresy [regarding Christianity] intersects with what one might call, a little provocatively, that other heresy, namely, the twisting or diverting by which the Heideggerian repetition, in its own way, affects Christianity” (GD,p. 23).The Gift of Deathis, of course, not limited to the mapping of the similarities and differences between Patočka and Heidegger; it also includes an analysis of Lévinas and, above all, of Kierkegaard’s Protestant interpretation of the Abrahamic story of the sacrifice of Isaac. It is inThe Gift of Deaththat Derrida seeks to establish the matrix, if I may call it that, that at once makes these four undeniably distinct positions on responsibility possible but also limits their range, distinctiveness, radicalism, and even their originality. Indeed, by inquiring into the various modalities of giving (oneself) death and of taking death (upon oneself), Derrida develops an economic model that accounts for the different positions on responsibility, their mutual contamination and passag~<br>

Author(s): Harootunian Harry<br>
Abstract: It is important to recognize that the historical present as a global unity already marks the coevality and immanence of the noncontemporaneous contemporary moment. A historical present filled with mixed temporalities has always been a condition of capitalist modernization, even as its copresent uncanniness was suppressed by both the authority of the future perfect and the expectations of progress that vowed to raise all societies to the same level. The effect was to displace the uncanny temporal figure to the world outside of Euro‐America and put its societies under the sign of underdevelopment, which announced comparative lack. The force of the collective singular lay in singularizing all plural histories capital encountered along its way and in assimilating them to its exemplar. This return to a perspective of the historical present might allow us to rewind the narrative of acculturation that has reinforced the externality of clock and calendar time to disclose the texture of the uncanniness of mixed temporalities it had smoothed out and straightened.
         21What seems promising about the opening supplied by the present is the specularity of unevenness, which both constitutes its sign and defines its relationship to the industrial societies of Euro‐America, and its capacity to now become the mirror of our own nature. Specifically, this experience among so‐called late developers actually made available to the “enfeebled center” of Euro‐America both the recognition of the temporal immanence of the marginally uneven and the spectacle of its existence in our own backyard.22<br>

Abstract: Professional self‐awareness is widely considered a necessary condition for competent social work practice. Alternate prescriptions for self‐awareness rely implicitly on varying definitions of what it means to be a “self” and what it means to be “aware.” I will review three approaches to professional self‐awareness conventionally adopted in the literature: (
         a) simple conscious awareness (awareness of whatever is being experienced), (b) reflective awareness (awareness of a self who is experiencing something), and (c) reflexive awareness (the self's awareness of how his or her awareness is constituted in direct experience). Strengths and limitations of these three epistemological approaches are discussed. An alternate framework, based on Anthony Giddens's “structuration theory,” is developed and advanced as a more macro‐level and less exclusively psychological understanding of practitioner self‐awareness. The article concludes with illustrations from practice.<br>

Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: This is not to argue against the kind of verification fundamental to scientific history, though it does side with Warnock’s observation that a positivist approach can miss the role of human imagination in not merely perceiving but also constructing reality. Rather, it is to argue for something besides the power of description at work in certain narratives, especially those that rise to the level of mythos and make a claim to religious authority. Smith’s narratives do not display fact to be assented to but draw the reader into a malleable reality by means of the malleable plots that traditionally provided the basis for Jewish and Christian ethos and ethic. It can be said that Smith was translating time, not text. Specifically, he translated biblical time in service to, he said, an “ushering in of the dispensation of the fullness of times … a whole and complete and perfect union, and welding together of dispensations, and keys, and powers … from the days of Adam even to the present time.”
         97Whatever his intention, the effect was to deploy the biblical text in a manner that radically subverted centuries of theologizing on who God is and how humans are to worship God.<br>

Although Śaṅkara’s is the oldest extant commentary on theBrahma‐sūtra, it largely preserves the perspective of an earlier tradition.49This is indicated by the surprising level of agreement between Śaṅkara’sBhāṣyaand that of Bhāskara, who otherwise shows extreme hostility toward the teachings of Śaṅkara.50Ingalls explains this agreement with the hypothesis, reminiscent of the Q hypothesis in New Testament studies, that Śaṅkara and Bhāskara both relied upon an earlier, although no longer extant, commentary.51More recent scholarship has since called into question the claim that Bhāskara relied on an earlier commentary besides Śaṅkara’s.52Nevertheless, Ingalls’s core proposition that Śaṅkara relied on an earlier commentator in composing his Bhāṣya still stands. Bhāskara and Śaṅkara’s followers both refer to this earlier commentator simply as the “commentator” (vṛttikāra). Ingalls, following this tradition, dubs him the “Protocommentator.”53<br>

Abstract: In Soren Kierkegaard’s
               Either/Or, Faust and Don Juan are two archetypes within the aesthetic level of human existence. This level of existence, according to Kierkegaard, is exemplified by passions that drive an individual’s actions, be those passions intellectual, as in the case of Faust, or sensual, as in the case of Don Juan.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Abstract: Theorizing for theory’s sake certainly has its place, and not every book needs to be focused on practical issues. Nonetheless, even the most gymnastic theoretician needs some grounding connection to relevant cases. Reynolds is profoundly uninterested in this level of analysis. While he flies through the theoretical air with great speed in
   The Broken Whole, it is unclear whether the book can make any sort of stable or decisive landing.<br>

Even Riffaterre's approach to the structuring unsaid of textual writing can be seen to represent on its own terms a shift from the ontology of narrative toward its epistemology at the level of form rather than content. By the deliberate provocation of his title, his semiotic narratology is interested not just in the structural essence of fiction as art but in its specific

Abstract: The mourning strategies adopted respectively by Augustine and Marcel suggest that the death of the beloved may teach us how to disrupt the foundation of self‐reflexivity upon which, as we saw with regard to the split selves of Augustine and Marcel, we tend to erect our own identity. In
         Memory, History, Forgetting, Ricoeur advocates a mourning strategy equivalent with a similar goal. At first, he says, the death of the beloved brings about “a genuine amputation of oneself.” But then the experience of mourning entails “internalization,” a new level of personal identification for both the love object, lost to death, and our own self as a subject predicated on affections that now manifest themselves in absentia. This new self‐identification, in turn, trains us in the “anticipation” of our own futural self as predicated on the “plurality” that death will one day bestow on us in the memory of our dear ones.67This is the equivalent of the compassionate reciprocity with the subject of one’s grief that, as mentioned in my opening remarks, justifies the state of mourning, or, in Nussbaum’s words, makes compassion “comprehensible.”68<br>

Author(s): Hall,  W. David<br>
Abstract: Hall sees that this argument as it develops across Ricoeur’s writings raises questions about the role of reciprocity in the Ricoeur texts he considers. He acknowledges that Ricoeur’s recognition that not all human relations are face‐to‐face leads him beyond a narrow call for solicitude and friendship at this level to a concern for the level of institutions as well. It is at this level of institutions that the question of justice really arises, and with it new questions regarding responsibility and possible reciprocity, particularly regarding our ability to respond to others who we may never meet face‐to‐face. As Hall says, “love often demands a dimension of self‐sacrifice, most notably in the form of renouncing a strict reciprocity” (150). His case could have been stronger here if he had incorporated Ricoeur’s discussions of the work of John Rawls and the antisacrificial notion of justice he saw there. Beyond this, Hall’s focal idea of a relation between love and justice marked by what he calls a poetic tension should also have included some discussion of what Ricoeur says in
   The Course of Recognition(Institute for Human Sciences Vienna Lecture Series, trans. David Pellauer [Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2005]; originally published asParcours de la reconnaissance[Paris: Éditions Stock, 2004]) about the limits of existing philosophies of recognition, which he saw as not getting any further than a notion of reciprocal recognition in just the sense Hall criticizes. Ricoeur’s own answer was to begin there to lay out the idea of mutual recognition beyond mere reciprocity, a higher form of recognition that stands closer, as Hall anticipates, to something like the reception of a gift that expects nothing in return but which may lead to a second gift given to others. Readers who wish to build on Hall’s argument will want also to look at this last major book from Ricoeur.<br>

Abstract: The reconstruction of theological ethics in the face of its critics requires, in terms of knowledge, replacing making with a multidimensional network of lateral connections. In terms of power, it replaces concern for unbridled forces with the relation between power and responsibility in world creation and orienting human life. What then about the most basic claim of value; that is, what ought to form the normative conviction of a theological and ethical vision? If we jettison here as well monocentric approaches, if we insist that we cannot define the good just around human flourishing or just around the divine, if we try to tread a path in and through but finally beyond anthropocentrism, theocentrism, or the current neohumanist focus on the finality of other human beings or even an ad hoc postmodernism, what do we have? This returns us, I think, to the elusive and tenacious ambiguity of human life that comes to expression in both religious and humanistic outlooks. It requires us to shift to a more existential level of reflection on responsibility and also the good we can and ought to serve.<br>

Author(s): Eades Caroline<br>
Abstract: Such diversity inevitably generates interpretive contradictions and makes the author's stated goals—to compare the films' thematic content and form with those of the colonial cinema that preceded it and to use postcolonial film as a barometer for assessing how French collective memory has come to terms with its imperialist history—difficult to achieve. While Eades's painstaking analysis of the continuities and ruptures between colonial and postcolonial cinema is impressive, her contention that the latter “forced recognition of a reality grudgingly accepted by political authorities and the general population” (22) until the mid‐1990s and “called into question imperial ideology in all its dimensions” (203) is less convincing. While the majority of these films do at some level acknowledge the failures and abuses of French imperialism, most also avoid explicit reference to controversial issues and events (most notably, the French army's practice of torture in Algeria) and ignore the subjective experience of colonized peoples, highlighting instead the plight of colonizers caught in morally untenable situations because of the corrupt system that surrounds them. The result, as Eades recognizes, is that the colonized tend to remain little more than stereotypes while audiences are encouraged to identify with the European perspective. In so doing, postcolonial cinema implicitly perpetuates the epistemological prejudices of overtly imperialist films from the 1920s and 1930s.<br>

Abstract: Here is why. Technological media may generally strive for and promise immediacy,
         66but cinema quickly became—and, at its most interesting, still remains—an object of gaps and absences. From the outset, cinema's remarkable psychological and cultural voltage has been built on delay and slippage. What I have dubbeddécalagelies at the heart of the medium and of each particular film, a gap between here and there as well as now and then.67This French term connotes discrepancy in space and deferral or jumps in time. At the most primary level, the film image leaps from present to past, for what is edited and shown was filmed at least days, weeks, or months earlier. This slight stutter in its articulation then repeats itself in the time and distance that separates filmmaker from spectator and spectators from each other when they see the same film on separate occasions. The gap in each of these relations constitutes cinema's difference from television and new media. Films display traces of what is past and inaccessible, whereas TV and certainly the internet are meant to feel and be present. We live with television as a continual part of our lives and our homes; sets are sold as furniture. Keeping up a twenty‐four‐hour chatter on scores of channels, TV is banal by definition. In contrast, wego outto the movies, leaving home to cross into a different realm. Every genuine cinematic experience involvesdécalage, time‐lag. After all, we are taken on a flight during and after which we are not quite ourselves.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur,  Paul<br>
Abstract: This volume is something of a companion to Ricoeur’s earlier collection,
      The Just(Chicago, 2000), but positions the question differently. Ricoeur characterizes the aim of the earlier volume as a focused treatment of the relationship between justice as a moral ideal and justice as a system of institutions. “In the present volume, the adjective ‘just’ is traced back to its terminological and conceptual source, as we find it in Plato’s Socratic dialogues” (1). The volume is divided into three parts, titled respectively, “Studies,” “Readings,” and “Exercises.” This tripartite structure is one that appears constantly in Ricoeur's work. The essays in the first section isolate the idea of justice. In this initial section, Ricoeur brings thought to bear on the principal phenomenological structures through which the problematic of justice manifests itself: the necessary distance introduced into the question of justice by the imposition of a rule of justice, the relation of passivity and autonomy in the articulation of the imperative of justice, the paradoxical nature of authority, and the aporia that opens between the reflection of justice as an abstract, transhistorical ideal and justice as a historically conditioned set of institutional practices. The essays in the second section place the idea in the context of thought about justice. The principal figures who come into the discussion here are Kant, Weber, and Charles Taylor. The essays in the third section deal with the ideal of justice in the realm of practical, or regional, ethics; Ricoeur’s primary interests here are legal and medical ethics and their similarities, differences, and relations. In each of these proceeding sections, issues raised in the first section are taken up and dealt with at a progressively less abstract level. There is then a discernible trajectory that holds these essays together, one that might be characterized, without too much oversimplification, as a movement from abstract structuring of~<br>

Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: Gauchet's is a decidedly “political history of religion” that attaches paramount importance to the state. The rise of this “sacral transforming agent” imposed the otherness that once characterized the gods of the first religions on and in society. As a result, the divine appeared ever more remote as an “organizing principle,” and humans were left in a position to “reappropriate” the world. This theologico-political transformation ushered in a long procession of events culminating in the emergence of Christianity, the religion that functioned as a theological conduit for departing from religion. The final act of Gauchet's passion play of the sacred unfolds during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, with the Protestant and Catholic Reformations and the rise of political absolutism; the former enshrined the freedom of the conscience, while the latter completed the process of cleaving the terrestrial from the divine sphere. Ultimately, individuals came to assert themselves in the void left by a transcendent divinity: “God's greatness, taken to the highest level, puts humans on an equal footing with the mystery of creation and validates their independence as cognitive subjects.” The appearance of the modern individual and the modern state signaled the completion of what Gauchet calls a “revolution in transcendence,” predicated on human reoccupation of the space once entirely controlled by the divine. Nevertheless, the self's past alienation from its origins was not simply overcome but instead transferred to psychological, social, and political dualities that persist both within and among individual selves. As Gauchet observes, “Leaving religion is not like waking from a dream. We originated in religion, we continue to explain ourselves through it, and always will.”

Abstract: At a more intricate level, the metaphorical switch of the ritual actor might be deemed textural, not just structural. Structural metaphorical switches tend to translate between contemporary and ancient models based on some isomorphism of structure or similarity of relationship of parts (structural similarities), whereas textural transformations, according to Fernandez, tend to assimilate ritual actors to new personas based on similarity in feeling tone, contiguities in previous experience, or syntagmatic habit.
         86In this case a simulation of heroic mentality may have been produced by ritual acts such as reciting, praying, blowing Quranic verses into one’s possessions, purifying the body, and so on, which together induced a transformation irreducible to the sum of its parts. As Ricouer might see it, the metaphor was thickened and enriched by a spectrum of images, practices, and stories that attached themselves to the imaginative process when the ritual actor encountered the enacted metaphor, thus enhancing the paradoxical figuration of the 9/11 ritual actor as a seventh‐century holy warrior.<br>

Abstract: A few days following the announcement of Israel's independence, Blanchot wrote to Lévinas to ask after his reaction given that Lévinas had in earlier discussions emphasized his position that Zionism did not seem to be in accordance with Judaism's destiny. Lévinas responds by explaining his current ambivalence, one that is punctuated, on the one side, by a sense of the miraculous and, on the other, by the feeling that such an event reduces Judaism to the level of the mundane, to the “thirst of ministers, ambassadors, functionaries, and military officers who will finally have their protocols” (Lévinas, “Lettre à Maurice Blanchot sur la création de l'État d'Israël,”

Abstract: It is a truism to state that there are as many Augustines as there are interpreters or, in any case, schools of interpretation.
      
            His work could be called an1
         opera aperta, albeit in quite a different sense from the way this expression was meant by its inventor, Umberto Eco.
            Eco's use of this phrase mainly concerned modernist works, such as Joyce's2
         Ulysses, whose very structure allows the reader to find his way in the labyrinth of the artwork without ever arriving at—or, for that matter, departing from—one single, fixed level of meaning. The metaphor of theopera apertaopened up a peculiar combination of structure and randomness, the latter made even more mysterious by modernism's emphasis on austerity of form. While it cannot be denied that for Joyce the fact that every line and every word were meticulously planned and put in their proper place was the precondition for the emergence of riddles and clues, thus widening up the scope of language and meaning, for Augustine things seem to be quite different inasmuch as the flow and width of his discourse is in place right from the beginning. In his case, randomness seems to be part of the structure of the discourse itself, to the extent of beguiling Henri-Irénée Marrou—still the most prominent historian of Augustinian rhetoric—into accusing Augustine of a lack of rhetorical skills: “Saint Augustin compose mal.”
            Fortunately, Marrou retracted this accusation in a later edition of his book:3
         
            One wonders whether this new appreciation of Augustine's style, being part of aI took for incapacity or indifference what was in fact conscious discretion, calculated flexibility, expressive deformation, brought about by adroit maneuvering.

Abstract: Neither—to return to the earlier objection—has Kaufman quite yielded to the narrativity brigades by agreeing to tell that time-honored story, “Charlie becomes a writer.”
         36To be sure, the fictional character Charlie “grows” and “adapts” and “learns” and “overcomes obstacles to succeed in the end.” But above and behind Charlie, we sense the existence of an entity who doesnotgrow and adapt and learn, an entity who may well feel, with Susan, that “for a person, adapting is almost shameful; it's like running away,” an entity who has been more or less the same since the days ofBeing John Malkovitch. Here is where the distinction between Charlie and Kaufman, which might seem like a technical issue, actually becomes of prime importance (figs. 5–6). In the movie, one might say, Charlie becomes Donald. But, in real life, there is no Donald; in real life, there is only Kaufman, someone who is, we assume, an amalgam of Charlie and Donald, at once, enduringly, with an inexorable combat being unchangingly waged in his head, that marvellous, mysterious head into which Valerie Thomas, in the opening scene, expresses a desire to climb. From this point of view, the film is a spurious diachrony concealing a genuine synchrony; only superficially the story of how Charlie became Donald,Adaptationis, at a deeper level, the entirely nonnarrative portrait of a never-changing Kaufman.37<br>

Abstract: Finally, it remains unclear how the explicit commitment that I compared to
      prohairesisrelates to the nonreflective level at which commitment still operates in any particular direction of action, even in “letting oneself go in a flight of passion” (64). As I suggested, it seems that the “commitment” necessarily found in spontaneous or unreflective action or omission is no more than the weak endorsement of some reason implicit in any intention, including those of wantons and unwilling addicts. Arguably then, authenticity in actions involving no explicit practical reflection would depend on their being guided by the deeper kind of commitment formed by explicit avowals, in which the more generic type of commitment is made “one’s own” in the deeper sense.<br>

Abstract: Pablo Wright observes that while I leave behind Geertz’s concept of a cultural system with respect to morality, I retain the Geertzian concern with symbols and meaning. I would not dispute Wright’s statement that meaning is the master concept on a methodological level prior to the substantive issue of evil but would stress that in addition to idiom, code, practice, and symbol, experience must figure into a comprehensive account. Wright’s evocative references to “moral installation in the world” (one might consider terms like investment, suffusion, and tonality, as well as installation) and morality as a “practiced ontology in the micropolitics of social life” deserve further elaboration. Wright endorses a pluralized notion of moralities, but I reiterate that even more important is an adjectival sense of moral rather than the nominal morality. Like Parkin, Wright poses the question of how to reintroduce the ethnographically salient notions of cosmological and radical evil once evil is first construed as a human and intersubjective phenomenon. The answer is to ask how these dimensions come into play in the experiential immediacy of social life, for example, how a cosmological battle between angels and devils is experienced concretely on the human scale. Finally, he suggests that concepts of power from Otto and the shadow from Jung may be alternatives to the notion of evil, though I rejoin that they are just as much in need of critique with respect to Christian overtones. They may be valuable for the study of morality but are not suitable replacements for evil in the sense for which I have argued.<br>

Abstract: Despite these caveats,
   Contemplative Nationis highly recommended for scholars of Jewish studies, religious studies, philosophy, and theology. The book is an excellent example of how to apply hermeneutical theories to the study of Judaism, how to bridge the gap between continental philosophy and analytic philosophy, and how to expand the scope of Jewish studies by appreciating the nature of theological discourse. While Judaica scholars could use the book in university-level courses, and rabbis could apply its approach to synagogue life, the claim that “Israel” is a “contemplative nation” will hardly resonate with most Jews today. It is very doubtful that the book could “guide the way for [the] future” of the Jewish people’s survival (226), precisely because Jews today are overwhelmingly secular, and the culture in which Jews live, both in Israel and in the Diaspora, is anti-intellectual and antitheological. Furthermore, if Fisher is so keen on Philo, he should have also reminded his readers of the fate of Philo’s enterprise: it was no coincidence that Philo became one of the Church Fathers and that his exegetical/hermeneutical project was not adopted by the tradition that became normative Judaism. When “Israel” denotes a nation of divine contemplators, “carnal Israel” (namely “Israel” as a historical, cultural, and ethnic entity) is marginalized, denigrated, and persecuted. It is true that Jewish religious life is theological, but being Jewish cannot be reduced to contemplating God.<br>

Abstract: In such a bridging use of history, Varro was no exception. Despite the production of much partisan narrative, there was a strong current in Roman historiography that aimed at creating a history common to the Roman families from all over Italy and different layers of society. Annalistic history, narrating Roman history year by year with ever changing protagonists, and the projection of a long line of military victories into the calendar by means of founding dates, offered the possibility to level out differences in individual or gentilician contributions, to write a history without hierarchy. Cato attempted a history without naming individuals. This option, however, was not followed by history of religion as attempted in Varro’s
      Antiquitates.<br>

Abstract: Likewise I propose that as readers we turn away from Satan and nighttime, from inblown venom and ambiguous angels, and turn our attention to the scene of the dream’s enunciation. Can we imagine Adam’s puzzled expression when Eve introduces as a main character in her story something that looks and is shaped like one of those creatures of Heaven they have often seen? Can he understand what it means to be chilled by “damp horror” (5.65)? What would he make of the mere fact of Eve saying things like “
         Nowis the pleasant time…Nowreigns / Full orbed the moon” (5.38–42)? (Innocent patriarchal houyhnhnm that he is, Adam might have wondered why Eve was suddenly saying the thing which is not.) At a more abstract level, does Adam know that the dream voice is in quotation marks? Is he as certain as many of Milton’s editors that these words do not belong to Eve in any sense? Finally, does he feel that for all its strangeness the voice is somehow familiar? We know that he hears “resemblances” in the dream to their previous evening’s talk. Does he experience himself as in part its origin or speaker—as Eve initially had done—even for a moment? However we imagine it, this must have been one of the strangest events in the relatively brief history of Paradise.<br>

Abstract: The theme of suffering, which permeates Bonhoeffer’s entire theology, in Tegel acquires a place in his critique of religion: Religion is incapable of cosuffering.
            
                  While a religious interpretation springs from the will to power that rests comfortably with the suffering of others in the name of some larger cause, the nonreligious call of Christianity embodies solidarity with the powerless.122
               
                  In his123
               theologia crucis, Bonhoeffer elevates participation in God’s own suffering and powerlessness amid worldly life to the level of a Christian attitude par excellence. Unlike the follower of a “religion” understood as a privilege, who cannot be there for others and thus participate in God’s suffering in the world, the nonreligious Christian lives by being drawn “into God’s messianic suffering in Jesus Christ.”
                  One of the reasons why Bonhoeffer resonated so strongly with the theologians of liberation is that he grasped that the way one responds to suffering corresponds in no small measure to the ways that one defines God.124
               
                  The God projected into the other-worldliness is de facto a “false God,” a vision of God that often occludes the God found in the gospels, namely the “crucified God” who wins power and space in the world by weakness. Thus the incarnate presence of God in Christ makes Bonhoeffer sensitive to the universality of suffering in the world and leads him to admit that only the suffering God can help.125

Abstract: If metaphor adds nothing to the description of the world, at least it adds to the ways in which we perceive; and this is the poetic function of metaphor. This still rests upon resemblance, but at the level of feelings. In symbolizing one situation by means of another, metaphor “infuses” the feelings attached to the symbolizing situation into the heart of the situation that is symbolized. In this “transference of feelings,” the similarity between feelings is induced by the resemblance of situations. In its poetic function, therefore, metaphor extends the power of double meaning from the cognitive realm to the affective.

Abstract: The Ionian cosmogonies of the sixth century b.c.e. explained how an ordered world evolved out of an undifferentiated initial state of “things.” In the fifth century, science became more particularly an inquiry into the ultimate constitution of material substance: the uniform and permanent “nature of things.” The notion of substance derives from tactile sensation. The belief in substantial things outside us reverts to the original detachment of self from the object. With Heraclitus of Ephesus, philosophy focused on knowing the thing, not on that which is known. Thought controls the phenomena as it constitutes the thinker. The problem of understanding nature was taken to a new level. The Milesian school of philosophers had moved it to the realm of the intellect in that they claimed the universe to be an intelligible whole. The manifold was to be understood as deriving from a sustaining principle or first cause, but was to be perceived in the phenomena.<br>

Abstract: This paper explores visual response methods as a representation of student learning in a college-level interdisciplinary curriculum integrating art and engineering. The visual response methods, specifically visual journals and postcards, are examples of authentic assessment and alternative data collection methods embedded in a mixed-methods (qualitative dominant) practitioner research case study. In the paper, we focus on different means for analyzing these visual responses (e.g., through hermeneutic analysis, document analysis, and narrative analysis) and deliberate the contribution of diverse analysis methods to the researchers’ understanding of students’ experiences of interdisciplinarity in this course.<br>

Abstract: Among other interpretations one should also think of this rhetoric as a means to justify the subdivision of power within architectural offices. Sociologist Judith Blau stated, in her
               Architects and Firms: A Sociological Perspective on Architectural Practice(Cambridge and London: MIT Press, 1987), 26, that in architecture similar training and shared knowledge create a bond between different echelons within the firm. Blau and Cuff (Architecture,130–37), demonstrate that this bond brings the sense of purpose to entry-level architects' every day activities—but it could also lead to subtle forms of exploitation. Clearly, the presentation of the production of working drawings as pleasurable and enjoyable was directed toward aspiring architects and the lower echelons of architects' offices, to encourage an understanding of the material qualities of a project, and this rewarding and pleasurable aspect of being an architect. See Woods,From Craft to Profession, 141–46, for her depiction of the complex mixture of camaraderie and exploitation that took place in architectural offices at the turn of the century.<br>

Publisher: The University of California Press<br>
Issue: ncl.2012.67.issue-1<br>
Date: 6 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: This essay argues that Emily Dickinson’s poetry intervenes in the broad cultural assessment of epistemology provoked by the evolutionary debates of the 1860s. While scholars have begun to explore the thematic correspondences between Dickinson’s poetry and some aspects of this cultural conversation, this essay examines the ways in which her intervention occurs at the level of poetic form and is in fact profoundly dependent upon form. Specifically, it analyzes a set of her poems from the early 1860s through the early 1870s in which she uses the dual structure of metaphor to elicit a way of thinking about truth that is aligned with the empirical methods of research that were widely embraced in the mid nineteenth century; however, in the face of an increasingly contingent notion of truth, Dickinson’s way of thinking significantly revises cultural assumptions about what those methods might yield. The metaphors examined here amplify the distinctions between two material entities—lightning and fork, or sunset and lilac, for example—rather than merging them or leaping beyond them to stable, transcendent meaning. What Dickinson plays with is the possibility of a revised version of revelation or truth, one that is not only derived from the observation of material difference through the two parts of a metaphor, but that is more radically contingent on the perpetuity of such dual perception. Altogether, Dickinson’s metaphors are both critical and recuperative, as they contribute to the dismantling of fixed truth while embracing the limited revelations made possible by—
         onlymade possible by—sustained process.<br>

Author(s): Webster James<br>
Abstract: 3. A brief account of the crucial role of the 1790s in these developments, focusing on the complementary achievements of Haydn and Beethoven. For Beethoven, Haydn's and Mozart's music was, precisely, modern. Together, he and Haydn dominated the Viennese scene, producing ever-more-imposing masterworks in every genre except opera. This explicitly modernist orientation was fostered, if not indeed in part created, by their patrons. After 1800 Beethoven maintained and further developed this same tradition. These years "between" Enlightenment and Romanticism were no mere transition; they constituted an equally weighty phase, on the same historical-structural "level," as those that preceded and followed it. Concomitantly, Romanticism as such did not become predominant in music until 1815, in Viennese music (except for the Lied) perhaps not even until 1828/30. For both reasons, it makes sense to regard the beginning of the music-historical nineteenth century as having been "delayed," until around 1815 or 1830.<br>

Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: ncm.2012.36.issue-1<br>
Date: July 2012<br>
Abstract: Framed in such a way, the early movements of Mahler's Second Symphony—characterized by the alternation between halting sections that dissolve almost as soon as they begin and long-breathed melodies that seem to unfold effortlessly—suggest the melancholic subject's struggle between despair in the face of abject meaninglessness and a manic euphoria, neither of which addresses the loss. By contrast, the text in the symphony's final movement, adapted by Mahler from Friedrich Klopstock's chorale on the resurrection of the dead, encourages true remembrance of the deceased as a figure beyond death. Heard as a musical enactment of mourning, the final movement suggests that the dead who are mourned are resurrected through remembrance. Forcing us to acknowledge Mahler's death on some level, the final movement completes the work of mourning by engendering the composer's own resurrection in our memories as we witness each performance of his Second Symphony.<br>

Author(s): Newman Sara<br>
Abstract: In the
         Rhetoric, Aristotle identifies "bringing-before-the-eyes" as a capacity that is crucial to metaphors because it allows rhetors to actualize actions immediately before audiences, leading those audiences to insight. Because this description suggests that metaphors activate cognitive mechanisms on the part of their listeners, "bringing-before-the-eyes" has been considered a key element within Aristotle's theory and the nexus of that approach to metaphor and contemporary conceptual ones. Yet, no study has probed these claims to any degree. Accordingly, this paper examines Aristotle's references to "bringing-before-the-eyes" as well as to two associated concerns,energeia/actualization and sense perception. This examination demonstrates that "bringing-before-the-eyes" is not explicitly cognitive but instead a perceptive capacity. In this, Aristotle's theory anticipates recent approaches to language because it allows the audience to participate in the persuasive process at a level that extends its role beyond the traditional Aristotelian understanding that it is the target of emotional appeals.<br>

Abstract: AbstractThe rise of prose in Greece has been linked to broader cultural and intellectual developments under way in the classical period. Prose has also been characterized as challenging poetry's traditional status as the privileged expression of the culture. Yet throughout the classical period and beyond, poetry was still regularly invoked as the yardstick by which innovation was measured. This paper investigates how poetry figures in the earliest accounts of prose style. Focusing on Isocrates, Alcidamas, and Aristotle, it argues that although each author distinguishes between the styles of prose and poetry, none is able to sustain the distinction consistently. The criteria for what constitutes an acceptable level of poeticality in prose were unstable. The diverse conceptions of poetic style were tied to intellectual polemics and professional rivalries of the early- to mid-fourth century bce and reflect competing aims and ideals for rhetorical performance in prose.<br>

Abstract: It is argued that autobiographical texts, such as life-historical interviews, provide the richest possible source of information about a person's temporality and a culture's historical past. It is proposed that time-consciousness can be inferred from such texts. To this end, ethnographic and other studies of Australian Aboriginal time-consciousness were used to construct a seven-part model of patterned-cyclical time-consciousness. Turning these seven attributes of patterned-cyclical time-consciousness into their opposites yields seven features of one-dimensional, ordinary-linear time-consciousness, thereby establishing a structured temporal polarity. A lexical-level, content-analytic methodology, Neurocognitive Hierarchical Categorization Analysis (NHCA), is introduced, in which folk-concepts of time from
         Roget's International Thesauruswere used to construct wordlist indicators for 9 of the 14 definitional components. Then, using NHCA for a comparative analysis of texts consisting of life-historical interviews, earlier results of an empirical study were brieflv re-presented. Australian Aborigines, compared to Euro-Australian controls, used a significantly smaller proportion of words for an index of ordinary-linear time but a higher proportion of words for an index of patterned-cyclical time, indicating a time-consciousness that is primarily patterned-cyclical rather than linear. Females were less linear and more patterned-cyclical than males in both cultures. These cross-cultural results contribute predictive validity to the proposed polarity of time-consciousness. Implications for the culture-and-cognition paradox and its resolution in dual-brain theory are addressed.<br>

Abstract: Sociology and neighboring disciplines have produced different analytic tools to examine the dialogical relationship between individuals and society ("narrative work," "identity work," "moral career," "moral breakdown"). However, the question of how individuals negotiate the interpretation of personal experience over their lifetimes in a changing cultural context remains unexplored. This article introduces narrative elasticity as a feature of narrative work and as a time-sensitive analytic tool for conducting inquiries into processes of temporal retraction and expansion of what storytellers conceive as the normal order of significance. The application of this tool to the analysis of mature and elderly Chileans' life stories shows how cultural change occurs at the individual level, considers factors that motivate and inhibit processes of reinterpretation of personal experience, and identifies different levels at which it operates.<br>

Article Title: 'I Used to Get Mad at My School': Representations of Schooling in Rock and Pop Music<br>
Publisher: Carfax Publishing Co.<br>
Issue: i260459<br>
Date: 3 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Willis Kevin J.<br>
Abstract: This article draws upon theories from a wide range of disciplines, including cultural studies and literary theory, to analyse representations of schooling in rock and pop songs. The songs selected cover a period from the beginning of rock 'n' roll in the 1950s, to Britpop and the present. It is argued that schooling is overwhelmingly represented as the antithesis of leisure and that in the 1960s conjuncture the representations of schooling became more and more critical. Even so, the resolution to the perceived oppression of schooling takes place at an imaginary level of fantasy. Other features of these representations are discussed, including the challenge provided in pop and rock songs to the notion of schools as spaces where relationships, romantic and/ or sexual, do not take place. The way in which temporal aspects of schooling are represented and the division between clock time and time as experienced is discussed. The formal analysis is located within a larger project of ideology critique and its strengths and weaknesses are signalled.<br>

Article Title: Rethinking the Political: Some Heideggerian Contributions<br>
Publisher: University of Notre Dame<br>
Issue: i261382<br>
Date: 10 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Pangle Fred<br>
Abstract: Recent literature on Heidegger concentrates heavily on his (temporary) involvement in or collusion with Nazi ideology and policies. Without belittling the gravity of the issue, this article shifts the focus somewhat by invoking a distinction which recently has emerged (or reemerged) in political thought: namely, the distinction between "politics" and "the political" or between politics viewed as partisan ideology or policy making, on the one hand, and politics seen as regime or paradigmatic framework, on the other. The main thesis of the article is that Heidegger's promising contributions to political theory are located on the level of ontology or paradigmatic framework rather than that of ideological partisanship. While not neglecting the dismal intrusions of the latter plane, the article probes Heideggerian cues for a "rethinking of the political" by placing the accent on four topical areas: first, the status of the subject or individual as political agent; second, the character of the political community, that is, of the polity or (in modern terms) the "state"; thirdly, the issue of cultural and political development or modernization; and finally, the problem of an emerging cosmopolis or world order beyond the confines of Western culture. In discussing these topics, an effort is made to disentangle Heidegger from possible misinterpretations and to indicate how, in each area, his thought pointed in the direction of an "overcoming" of Western political metaphysics.<br>

Issue: i263722<br>
Date: 12 1, 1960<br>
Author(s): Edwards William J.<br>
Abstract: Part 1 shows that while Edwards and Berkeley both regard nature as God's discourse and speak of this discourse in similar ways, Edwards differs from Berkeley in believing that the signs of this discourse signify spiritual and divine realities. Part 2 explains why Edwards thought it reasonable to believe that our world is a world of types and images. Because our world is a world of resemblances and imitations, because spiritual things are its "alpha and omega," and because its beauty is a reflection of God's beauty, our world can be expected to contain images or shadows of divine things. Scripture provides evidence that this expectation is realized. Part 3 shows that these images are not symbols but emblems, and that because emblems are consciously invented, their occurrence implies theism. Part 4 attempts to show that, given the assumptions of classical Christian theism, it is in principle no more difficult to decipher the meaning of the book of nature than to decipher the meaning of an allegorical poem or tale. Part 5 criticizes Perry Miller. Edwards's reflections on types were not influenced by the new science. He did not anticipate Coleridge on the imagination, nor did he "elevate nature to a level of authority coequal with revelation."<br>

Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263710<br>
Date: 12 1, 1966<br>
Author(s): Winter Charles R.<br>
Abstract: Through the provision of a set of theses for the interpretation and evaluation of theologies of liberation, this paper attempts to mediate the existing conflict between academic theologians and theologians of liberation. It seeks to establish the legitimacy of theological discourse focused on the problem of alienation and liberation if carefully executed according to a clear set of guidelines. The paper begins with the argument that all interpretations of theologies of liberation must begin with an analysis of the theological genre within which these works fall. After insisting that theologies of liberation belong neither to the genre of systematic theology nor that of Christian social ethics, the paper develops the second thesis that theologies of liberation are best understood as members of a genre whose distinctive characteristics and functions are analogous to those intrinsic to secular ideologies. This thesis hinges upon a revisionist understanding of ideology drawn from the works of Clifford Geertz et al. and upon a careful specification of the generic similarities between the two forms of discourse. The second part of the paper moves from the level of interpretation to that of evaluation. It argues that theologies of liberation share with ideologies a tendency to occlude self-critical reflection. It suggests that a conscious recognition that theologies of liberation do not exhaust the possibilities of theological discourse but are relative models which select and interpret Christian symbols and doctrines in the light of the central dynamic of alienation and liberation might provide an antidote to this pathology. It maintains with Rosemary Ruether that there is no absolutely adequate model of alienation and liberation and that various models of alienation and liberation must be "interstructured" in order to overcome the perspectival biases of models which focus upon a single root of oppression. To establish relative degrees of adequacy between various theologi~<br>

Author(s): Yorke D. M.<br>
Abstract: In recent years personal construct theory has become increasingly used to underpin research into teachers' thinking, and a number of researchers have opted to give methodological prominence to the repertory grid. This paper points to the limitations of the theory in respect of research outside the domain of psychotherapy and to some of the problems associated with repertory grid studies. It is argued that repertory grids are inherently positivistic and are thus in philosophical tension with the theory on which they are based, a tension that is not removed by researching in a 'conversation paradigm'. The importance of events in personal construct theory is discussed, and it is suggested that an emphasis on events requires the researcher to adopt an approach that is informed by phenomenology and the philosophy of history. Finally, a return is made to the level of research practice,i and a methodological approach is outlined which is-to a greater extent than the repertory grid-consistent with the main thrust of personal construct theory. Stress is given to the importance of the quality of the relationships between constructs, since these have implications for connections between construing and action-an issue which is of crucial importance is the study of teachers' thinking.<br>

Author(s): Westermann Brian<br>
Abstract: The present contribution examines the use of animal terminology--wild dogs--in Ps. lix and endeavours to interpret this terminology within the framework of a working definition of metaphor as a stylistic feature of BHP and its function therein. As a result, it would appear that the author's metaphorisation of his enemy (either personal or national) as a pack of wild dogs foaming at the mouth and terrorising the city at night allows him to introduce elements of imprecation. Indeed, animal terminology, focusing particularly on mouth, teeth etc. is common among the so-called psalms of imprecation. At a second level, it is possible to detect traces of a further metaphorisation in which the author invites the divinity to behave as wild dogs would in destroying his enemy.<br>

Publisher: Butterworths Scientific Limited<br>
Issue: i272292<br>
Date: 1 1, 1984<br>
Author(s): Llosa Roberto<br>
Abstract: Notre analyse repose sur deux hypothèses générales complémentaires. La première hypothèse affirme l'existence non pas d'une crise de la pensée politique mais de trois situations critiques auxquelles doit faire face le pensée politique et qui déterminent des formes d'incertitude spécifiques, irréductibles les unes aux autres. La deuxième hypothèse affirme que l'intelligibilité des crises que connaît la pensée politique passe par celle des conditions politiques dans lesquelles s'exerce cette pensée. Pour préciser ces deux hypothèses nous faisons appel à un modèle construit à partir de la structure d'une action. Trois formes d'incertitude sont ainsi repérées: une incertitude concernant les valeurs, une incertitude concernant l'état des choses et une incertitude portant sur les voies d'action. Transposées sur le plan ou la dimension de la structure sociale, ces trois formes d'incertitude sont à saisir et à examiner respectivement comme crise au niveau du système de légitimation et de motivation, comme crise au niveau du système organisationnel ou des institutions et comme crise au niveau des stratégies ou système "opérationnel". Nous localisons la première forme de crise dans les sociétés du capitalisme "central", la deuxième dans les formations sociales socialistes et la troisième dans les sociétés du capitalisme "périphérique". A partir d'une analyse des conditions politiques qui ont rendu possible l'émergence de ces formes spécifiques de crise nous essayons de déterminer au moins certaines conditions nécessaires--mais non pas suffisantes--de leur dépassement. /// Two general complementary hypotheses underlie this analysis. The first contends that, although political science does not confront a crisis, it faces three critical challenges giving rise to uncertainty in the discipline. The second hypothesis asserts that to understand the present challenges testing political theory, it is necessary to relate the latter to the prevailing political context. To clarify the tw~<br>

Publisher: The Association for Asian Studies, Inc.<br>
Issue: i309685<br>
Date: 8 1, 1976<br>
Author(s): Ricoeur Jeff<br>
Abstract: This article suggests that two distinct modes of text-building constraints coincide in the Indonesian novel "Surabaya." The first set of constraints consists of narrative functions that shape sentence-level grammar within the story; the second level of text-building constraints shapes the thematic structure of the story. The author argues that, unlike its narrative structure, which is bound by the linearity of time, the thematic structure, of "Surabaya" is defined by a hierarchy of "heavier" and "lighter" themes, the "heavier" themes being evoked more often than are the "lighter" themes. He suggests that heaviness of theme is a strategy of text building found in classical Malaysian (Hikayat) texts, gamelan orchestra musical organization, and in calendric reckoning in much of Indonesia. He argues, in sum, for a method of writing that encourages grammatical description from two or more perspectives. "Binocular vision," to use Gregory Bateson's words, is necessary in writing to provide a more honest, richer description of a text than a single mode of grammatical description can provide; it makes available to readers more than one means of access to the text.<br>

Abstract: The paper considers early death as violent death caused by another person in the context of the Nazi concentration camps. With Hannah Arendt death is understood as destruction of personal identity, because writers cannot write a poem about their own physical death. Therefore, the present contribution based on the concept of the narrative identity (Paul Ricœur) will examine by the example of the poem „Der Häftling“ („The Inmate“) by Fritz Löhner-Beda how identity can be destroyed and stabilized by techniques of narrative defiguration and refiguration at level of the first person narrator of the poem and at level of the author's subject.<br>

Abstract: In sociohistorical inquiry, no epistemology prevails as a widely accepted account of knowledge. Positivism yet retains its defenders. As alternatives, both structuralist and hermeneutic challenges to science are undermined as foundations of knowledge by their own accounts, yielding the postmodern loss of certitude. Conventionalism, rationalism, and realism have been proposed as "local epistemologies" under the new conditions, and on a broader level, pragmatic and transcendental theories of communication substitute for epistemology classically conceived. As yet, these contending developments do not resolve the crisis of sociohistorical knowledge.<br>

Abstract: This close reading of one poem by Dickinson, « Crisis is sweet », wishes to demonstrate that the poet makes us share in a multiple experience of crisis combining sexual climax, mystical revelation, and the destruction of the poetic image. Positing a multi-level definition of crisis, the poem shows that the very process of definition — undoubtedly one of Dickinson's preferred modes of tackling with reality — entails a fundamental crisis and criticism of representation.<br>

Abstract: In this paper I explore the questions of why and how sociologists should be interested in narrative. The answer to the first question is straightforward: Narrative texts are packed with sociological information, and a great deal of our empirical evidence is in narrative form. In an attempt to answer the second question, I look at definitions of narrative, distinguishing narrative from non-narrative texts. I highlight the linguistic properties of narrative and illustrate modes of analysis, paying close attention to both the structural properties of the text and its subtle linguistic nuances. I guide the reader through a detailed analysis of a short narrative text. I show how linguistics and sociology interplay at the level of a text.<br>

Abstract: À partir la distinction des trois sens de la conscience dans la Cinquième Recherche logique de Husserl, nous tâchons d'évaluer les rapports entre conscience, impression et réflexion. Seule la prise en compte de la temporalité immanente de la conscience permet de comprendre l'articulation des trois. Mais on souligne la fonction de connaissance et d'unification égologique qui confère à la réflexion un poids méthodologique considérable dans la phénoménologie de Husserl comme dans la pensée du jeune Fink. Enfin, la critique de Michel Henry permet de préciser à quelles conditions le niveau préréflexif ou impressionnel peut acquérir une teneur propre, voire une relative autonomie. This study has its departure point in Husserl's distinction of three concepts of consciousness (Fifth Logical Investigation); it seeks to evaluate the relationship between consciousness, impression and reflection. Their articulation requires that the immanent temporality of consciousness be taken into account. At the same time, this paper stresses the cognitive function and the egological meaning of reflection, which explain its considerable methodological weight in Husserl's phenomenology and in the early thought of Fink. Finally, Michel Henry's objections enable us to establish to what extent the pre-reflective, impressional level can be credited with consistency and autonomy.<br>

Issue: i23353270<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Guery François<br>
Abstract: La précaution a été critiquée non en elle-même, mais comme « principe », à la fois sur le plan juridique et scientifique. Les formulations du principe prêtaient à confusion, à cause du jargon « scientifique » utilisé (cf. absence de preuves, de « certitudes scientifiques »). Liée à l'urgence, la précaution ressortit à une philosophie de l'agir, qui comporte menace, vulnérabilité, anticipation, appréhension, et c'est de ce côté qu'il faut chercher la logique de la précaution. En premier lieu, une « déduction sémantique a priori » (Derrida) permet de mettre en évidence les caractéristiques de la peur, qui justifie la précaution. En second lieu, un rappel de la tradition philosophique confirme cette déduction, rappel qui va d'Aristote (Rhétorique : ce qu'est la peur et comment on est quand on l'éprouve; Éthique à Nicomaque : le courage, l'intrépidité, la disposition acquise) à Heidegger (Être et Temps : la peur comme disposition insigne, esquisse de l'angoisse, du souci, de la responsabilité, de la résolution), en passant par des étapes essentielles : Augustin (la cura, la curiosité), Kant (derniers écrits), Nietzsche (Seconde Inactuelle). Enfin, et en conclusion, la précaution apparaît non comme une démission de la connaissance, mais comme une incitation à mieux scénariser, à mieux gérer l'avenir, en cultivant une imagination anticipative, complémentaire de l'innovation. If Precaution has been criticized, on both a legal and a scientific level, it is not as an approach in itself but as a Principle. The way the Precautionary Principle has been formulated was confusing, jargonistic : lack of proof, of scientific certainty. Linked as it is to the notion of Emergency, Precaution is part of an Acting Philosophy which includes Threat, Vulnerability, Anticipation and Apprehension; its logic is to be found therein. Firstly, a « semantic deduction a priori » (Derrida) will help to define the characteristics of Fear, which justifies Precaution. Secondly, we shall confirm this d~<br>

Abstract: Cet article vise à mettre en valeur le niveau discursif du langage des géographes. Plus particulièrement il se penche sur la métaphore. Celle-ci est d'abord cernée en tant que procédé mis en œuvre dans tout discours. Puis l'exemple de l'organicisme, très répandu dans la pensée du siècle dernier, est utilisé pour examiner les principales modalités de l'emploi d'une métaphore, celle de l'organisme, dans les discours géographiques. A partir de cet examen, on en vient à préciser les finalités de cet emploi et la portée générale du langage métaphorique en géographie. Il apparaît que le recours à la métaphore révèle la nature profonde de l'activité scientifique, aussi bien dans ses dimensions cognitives que créatrices. The aim of this article is to emphasize the discursive level of the language of geographers. More particularly, it is concerned with metaphor. First, metaphor is characterized as a method which is used in any discourse. Then, thanks to the example of organicism which was wide-spread in nineteenth century thought, the major patterns of the use of a metaphor in geographic discourses (the metaphor of the organism) are investigated. It is then possible to specify what are the main reasons for such a use of metaphor and what is the full significance of metaphorical language in geography. It becomes clear that the resort to the use of metaphor reveals the true nature of scientific activity, in its cognitive as well as creative dimensions.<br>

Publisher: BRILL<br>
Issue: i23548425<br>
Date: 1 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): BLOOMQUIST L. GREGORY<br>
Abstract: In this article I suggest ways in which rhetorical analysis can complement sociological analysis of early Christianity. On the basis of a universally acknowledged saying of Jesus ("blessed are you poor"), I suggest that those who use social scientific perspectives need to clarify more accurately the levels of data from which they are working (i.e., when they are working with probably early material, possibly the words of Jesus himself, and when they are working with the later elaboration of the traditional material) and to identify the rhetorical value of each level. I then show how, contrary to sociological analysis that depicts Jesus as merely proclaiming reversal, the historical Jesus proclaimed a reversal that had already happened but one that was away from God's intended order: what the historical Jesus was calling for was a future restoration to a state that existed before the reversal. Attention to the rhetorical nature of his follower's use of this proclamation, however, shows that when the author of the Gospel of Luke and the Lukan Acts of the Apostles uses the language of reversal and restoration, he now does so to describe what was happening not primarily vis-à-vis "the world" but in their own, now Christian communities Jesus' message of reversal of the fate of the poor becomes in this way the Lukan message of the apostolic governance of that reversal, that is, the broker's (the apostolic leadership's, after the model of Jesus) dispensation of the patron's (God's) resources.<br>

Abstract: Freud's metapsychology, although it is not identical with the whole field of psychoanalytic psychology, originated under the controlling influence of a questionable positivistic model of science. The analysis begun in a previous study (Gregorianum, 61 [1980] 97-136) continues in this study of the relationship in Freud's thought between theory and empirical observation. We also treat the attempts by Freud and by the later neopositivist schools of classical ego-theory to articulate psychoanalytic insights about the person in terms taken from neurophysiology, biology, and classical mechanics. Such terms pervade the terminology used to express the metapsychological viewpoints, albeit in disharmonious juxtaposition with more specifically psychological terms. Freud's whole work was affected by his desire to propose psychoanalysis as a natural science on the model of the positivistic outlook of late nineteenth century Viennese physicalism. Opposition arose in the 1950s and 1960s to understanding psychoanalysis as a natural science, especially because of problems of conceptual definition, language, and verification or validation. Orthodox Freudians themselves were troubled by the problem of psychic energy and the discussion finally led to critical doubts about Freud's whole metapsychology. One reason was the dependence on a physical and mechanical model of science and on a neurophysiology no longer tenable. Other frames of reference in the exact sciences were sought, such as cybernetics and information theory, in an attempt to remain to some extent in harmony with the original epistemological ideology. There are those today who remain convinced that psychoanalysis is an exact science, and who in turn reject the different psychologies of understanding and the hermeneutical sciences. In the context of a basic-level discussion, this contribution explores, in their context, the principles of the worldview found at the most theoretical level of metapsychology. Among these, the p~<br>

Abstract: The relationship between Sören Kierkegaard and Johann Gottlieb Fichte has been a desideratum of philosophical inquiry for a considerable time. And this for two reasons: firstly, we do not know enough about Kierkegaard's relationship to German idealism, as long as we limit ourselves to the relationship of Kierkegaard-Hegel or Kierkegaard-Schelling. Secondly, there are quite a number of publications, which see in Fichte the most noteworthly intellectual relationship to Kierkegaard within the framework of idealism. It is necessary therefore to raise the following questions: what can we determine from the texts and historical material, which we possess, about Kierkegaard's relationship to Fichte? Is the opinion justified that Fichte is intellectually related to Kierkegaard? The present article's research gives the following answers to these questions: historically speaking there are again and again texts in which Kierkegaard relates to Fichte. Particulary for the early years, a certain occupation with him cannot be denied. As a matter of fact a whole series of formal agreements cannot be overlooked. Nevertheless there can be no question of a real meeting of minds. Fichte was merely an occasion for Kierkegaard to form his own philosophy, in no way however an intellectual partner. This historical result in no way excludes the possibility of comparing Kierkegaard and Fichte on the same intellectual level. Seen from this point of view there is actually a certain reason in establishing an intellectual relationship in the secondary literature. But nevertheless the differences outweigh the agreements. This can not only be ascertained fundamentally insofar as both come from a completely different understanding of reality, but also as regards their concept of subjectivity. Especially, as far as the structures, which ascertain the self-realization of the subjectivity, are concerned, the differences are particulary noticeable. With this result one does not however intend to say, t~<br>

Author(s): Lawrence Frederick G.<br>
Abstract: Dès ses premiers écrits, Lonergan a été attentif à la dimension d'amitié qui caractérise les ordres trinitaire et créé. L'homme est par essence ouvert au delà de lui-même; ne pouvant pas coïncider à soi, il est appelé à quelque conversion. La pensée moderne, qui par contre l'a prétendu capable de présence à soi; soutint l'individualisme où le rapport à l'autre devenait instrumental. La réaction postmoderne, qui accentue l'idée d''autre', réveille la conscience à ses traits plus humains, en favorisant en même temps un retour à la tradition philosophique et théologique sur l'amitié, où d'ailleurs son idée d''autre' se voit elle-même enrichie. La réflexion thomiste sur la charité comme amitié divine est ici décisive. Lonergan la reprend en explicitant l'essence du corps mystique. L'attention à l'expérience concrète invite enfin à conduire la réflexion jusqu'au plan de l'éducation, d'où on ne peut pas abstraire l'exigence du don de soi, à l'exemple du Christ qu'y s'est abaissé jusqu'à nous. From his earliest writings Lonergan was attentive to the friendship dimension that marks the trinitarian and created orders. Humanity remains essentially open to what is beyond itself: unable to coincide with itself, it is called to some conversion. Modern thought by contrast has focussed on self-presence, thus giving rise to individualism where relationship to others becomes instrumental. The reaction of the post-modern is to underline the idea of the 'other', awaking conscience to more human traits, thus promoting a retrieval of a philosophical and theological tradition on friendship. In this way the idea of the 'other' finds itself enriched and Thomist reflection on charity as divine friendship becomes crucial. Lonergan adapts this tradition to explain the essence of the mystical body. Attention to concrete experience pushes us to extend our reflection to the level of education, where one cannot ignore the requirement for self-giving, on the example of Christ who lowered himself t~<br>

Author(s): HAYS GEORGE<br>
Abstract: This article examines Campbell's concept of 'foreign policy' and its application to identifiers 'below' those utilized by Campbell. Campbell's discussion of 'foreign policy' at the level of the ruling elite, though perhaps necessary for the historical breadth of his analysis, provides a skewed and privileged understanding of both national identity and its creation. Through an analysis of 'foreign policy' at the sub-elite level, using the three versions of The Quiet American as illustrative examples, this article demonstrates that a separation of 'foreign policy' from Foreign Policy can yield multiple potentially conflicting national identities. While at times taking on the form of an argument ad absurdum, it is not the intent of this article to disprove Campbell's work. Rather, its intent is to use the concept of 'foreign policy' with a different level of identifier to demonstrate that the tenuousness and indefiniteness of national identity are actually greater than those proposed by Campbell.<br>

Abstract: Cet article traite d'une part de la question de l'intersubjectivité — au sens merleau-pontien — dans le processus de la recherche, d'autre part des relations entre critique littéraire et histoire des sciences et des idées. L'examen de ma dette intellectuelle envers Gérard Simon conduira à l'analyse de la question de l'optique chez Marcel Proust, et tout particulièrement au décryptage des rapports, à première vue dépassés à son époque, qu'il établit entre regard et rayon visuel. The first part of this article deals with intersubjectivity and how I became interested in research from a Merleau-Pontian point of view. Part two explores the relationship between literary studies and the history of science and ideas. Indeed, I shall analyze the intellectual influence Gérard Simon had on my work, which then led me to a study of optics in Marcel Proust. I focus on the boundaries he draws between sight and visual ray, a distinction which, on a surface level, might appear to be outdated in his time.<br>

Author(s): ZIRK-SADOWSKI MAREK<br>
Abstract: The aim of the paper is to indicate that it is impossible to describe the difference betweeen logical sentences and norms on the level of the structure of the language but it has to be done only on the level of the use of the language, viz. the act of speech. The author stresses specificity of the natural language in which every legal norm is formulated. He emphasizes the difference between extensional and intensional language stating that the natural language should be ranked among the latter. La tâche de l'article est de démontrer que la différence entre les phrases logiques et les normes ne peut pas être décrite sur le niveau de la structure de la langue, mais seulements sur le niveau de son usage, c'est-à-dire sur le niveau d'un acte de la parole. L'auteur souligne la specificité de la langue naturelle dans laquelle de chaque norme juridique est formulée. Il met l'accent sur la différence entre le langues extensionelles et intensionelles et constate que la langue naturelle est la langue intensionelle. Dieser Artikel bezweckt, nachzuweisen, daß man den Unterschied zwischen logischen Sätzen und Normen auf der Strukturstufe der Sprache nicht beschreiben kann, sondern nur auf der pragmatischen Gebrauchsstufe der Sprache, d.h. des Sprechaktes. Der Autor betont einen spezifischen Charakter der Umgangssprache, in welcher jede Rechtsnorm formuliert ist. Er akzentuiert den Unterschied zwischen extensionalen und intensionalen Sprachen und stellt fest, daß die Umgangssprache eine intensionale Sprache ist.<br>

Abstract: Although Hannah Arendt distinguishes three human activities from each other in Human Condition — labor, work and action — they are supposed not to be three different types of human activities but to be three different aspects of human activity. Assuming this to be the case, this paper demonstrates that social theory has not enough taken action in the sense of Arendt into account, even modern scholars such as Bourdieu, but it has continued to remain almost always on the level of work because of its concept of time. The second question is what consequence social theory may draw, if this aspect of human activity is recognized as essential and its concept of time changed. One answer proposed by the author is the sociology of forgiveness even though it has not been treated as a subject for modern sociology.<br>

Abstract: La biométrie mesure l'unicité d'un individu à partir des parties inchangeables de son corps. Elle est présentée comme la méthode la plus scientifique pour identifier les individus avec certitude et pour contrôler le futur. Cet article examine l'adoption d'un dispositif sophistiqué de surveillance et d'identification par la biométrie comme faisant partie d'une problématique de la maîtrise de la fluidité par l'Etat. Défié dans ses fonctions weberiennes par la globalisation et la transnationalisation, l'Etat cherche à restaurer son monopole sur l'identification des personnes et sur la surveillance des mouvements en recourant aux technologies biométriques. Or, cette préoccupation de « sécuriser » dépasse les limites de l'Etat et constitue un enjeu de surveillance au niveau global. Par conséquent, il faudra repenser l'Etat dans un cadre post-weberien où la globalisation de la biométrie participe à la déterritorialisation des contrôles. Biometrics measures the uniqueness of an individual from the unchanging parts of his/her body. It is presented as the most scientific method for identifying individuals with certainty and controlling the future. This article examines the adoption of a sophisticated identification and surveillance apparatus operating through the deployment of biometrics. This apparatus is here approached through the problématique of the mastering of fluidity by the state. Challenged in its Weberian functions by globalization and transnationalization, the state seeks to restore its monopoly over the identification of individuals, as well as over the surveillance of movements, by resorting to biometrics. However, this preoccupation of guaranteeing certainty goes beyond the limits of the state and constitutes a surveillance issue at the global level. Consequently, the state needs to be reconceptualised in a post-Weberian framework for which the globalization of biometrics contributes to the de-territorialisation of control.<br>

Abstract: The current methods in psychoanalytic studies of God images and representations have focused almost exclusively on individual, internal processes. This article examines how psychological anthropologists go about formulating symbolic representations of deity in their research, in comparison with the object relations method of God-representations. Drawing on Melford Spiro's integrative proposal for interpreting the mental and collective representations in religious symbol systems, this paper proposes that there is a need for a comprehensive model of the representational process in the Eastern world in order to suit its cultural traditions. The author uses both theoretical and historical materials as well as personal narrative throughout its entirety to balance the two in a mutual and coherent flow of understanding. Noting the culturally patterned interactions with culturally postulated God-symbols, the object relations method of God-representations will be utilized to probe how God is both created and found on a collective (cultural) level as well as individual level.<br>

Author(s): Picone Michelangelo<br>
Abstract: The problem that Petrarch's Canzoniere poses for the modern reader is the same as that posed by all collections of poems assembled by their author: it is a matter of understanding the connection between each of the poems and the collection, the relation between the whole and the parts. On the one hand, the collection presents a discontinuous series of poems composed separately that can be read as discrete works; on the other hand, the same poems come together as part of a love and/or existential story. Our task is to study the Canzoniere as a macrotext and to clarify the relation of each of the compositions to the collection of lyric verse to which it belongs. Petrarch's desperate attempt to complete his work is the same hopeless challenge that the mythical Arachne dared to make to Minerva. At the deepest level Petrarch reveals an awareness of the fact that every human endeavor is a spider's web that is woven in the course of a lifetime, and thus is never completed. The destiny of human beings therefore is to weave a tapestry that is never finished, just as the fate of the poet is to write an in-finite work; namely, a work that in the end can never reach the perfection and integrity of the divine work.<br>

Abstract: Within the papal eneyelieals (exhortations) ranging from Leo XIII (1878) to Pope Francis (2013), concern for authority in general and for obedience and duty, in particular, is in decline. This longterm trend signals intra-ecclesial secularization at the elite level. A second negative trend supports this finding: textual indicators for Catholic uniqueness such as: Catholic, Doctrine and Pope have steadily lost prominence. Upwardly directed, the textual indicators for God, Jesus, Gospel, Spirituality and Love follow positive long-term trends. The traditional eschatological code, with its keywords sin, death, final judgment, heaven or hell, reaches only low levels of attention. Overall, there is an eschatological loss, where Heaven, due to a slower decline, wins over Hell. Christ the Inexorable Judge is retreating in favor of the loving Jesus and God as Love. The millennia-old process of civilizing God persists. Technically, the quantitative content analysis was carried out mainly with TEXTPACK.<br>

Author(s): Gaillard Emilie<br>
Abstract: Faire appel à la notion de crimes contre les générations futures est assurément la marque de la progression d'une nouvelle conscience de responsabilité envers l'avenir, la condition humaine future, les autres espèces vivantes et l'environnement. Elle contribue à un changement de paradigme temporel déjà en marche aussi spécifique que nécessaire à notre temps. Reflet d'un nouvel imaginaire international, le projet de formalisation de crimes contre les générations futures recèle des potentialités de transformations inédites et puissantes sur le champ juridique. En prenant appui sur les théories éthiques de la responsabilité transgénérationnelle, il est permis de fournir un éclairage spécifique de la notion de crimes contre les générations futures. Des affinements théoriques peuvent s'avérer nécessaires en considération du contexte de connaissances. C'est une véritable conversion intellectuelle qui se profile avec l'admission d'un principe de non-discrimination temporelle en vertu duquel l'absence d'existence temporelle ne serait plus synonyme d'absence de droits ni de garantie juridique. Une complexification des logiques juridiques pour la mise en œuvre des crimes contre les générations futures est alors imaginable. Formuler des crimes contre les générations futures est également maïeutique en ce qu'ils appellent dans leur sillage la consécration d'un principe de dignité des générations futures. Un tel principe insufflerait une dynamique de recomposition du droit des droits de l'homme en l'ouvrant à la perspective transgénérationnelle. Des perspectives prospectives pour la notion de crimes contre les générations futures sont ouvertes avec l'idée d'intégrer également la protection de la condition humaine future. Quelques mises en garde prospectives sont formulées. Evoking the notion of crimes against future generations is certainly an indication of the development of a new awareness regarding accountability for the future of human, other living species and the environme~<br>

Abstract: Le Comment il faut écrire l'histoire de Lucien est reconnu comme le seul traité antique de méthodologie historiographique qui nous soit parvenu. Si, au fil des siècles, son intérêt a été discuté par les historiens et les spécialistes de la rhétorique, il importe de montrer que Lucien avait pleinement conscience de l'originalité de son propos. Il est particulièrement intéressant d'observer comment il problématise l'activité de l'historien, l'acte même de l'écriture historique défini par le verbe συγγράϕειν, en jouant sur les relations de différents niveaux d'écriture indiqués par d'autres composés du verbe γράϕειν (ἐπιγράϕειν, ὑπογράϕειν, μεταγράϕειν, etc.). L'écriture de l'histoire est un édifice que l'on construit à plusieurs et chaque couche d'écriture est importante. L'anecdote finale du phare d'Alexandrie, qui décrit l'épiphanie d'un sous-texte, prend alors une véritable dimension théorique. Lucian's treatise, How to write history, is recognized as the only ancient work of historiographical methodology that reached us. If, over centuries, its interest has been discussed by historians and specialists in rhetoric, it is important to show that Lucien was fully aware of the originality of his treatise. It is particularly interesting to see how he rethinks the writing of history, the activity of συγγράϕειν, playing on different levels of writing, expressed by the compounds of the verb γράϕειν (ἐπιγράϕειν, ὑπογράϕειν, μεταγράϕειν, etc.). The writing of history appears as a construction involving many actors and in which each level of writing is important. The final anecdote of the lighthouse of Alexandria, that describes the epiphany of a sub-text, takes an important theoretical dimension.<br>

Abstract: En 1906 los "cabezas de familia" de cinco comunidades indígenas le pidieron al abogado Wistano Luis Orozco que los representara en sus pleitos legales por la defensa de sus tierras. Parte de la estrategia legal fue escribir un memorial de los agravios experimentados y dirigirlo a Porfirio Díaz. El memorial y el proceso judicial que desencadenó ejemplifican cómo los actores sociales daban forma a la cultura política en los ámbitos locales, estatales y nacionales, a finales del porfiriato. In 1906, the heads of household from five indigenous communities asked the lawyer Wistano Luis Orozco to represent them in their legal battle for the defense of their land. Part of their legal strategy was to prepare a written statement detailing their grievances and addressing it to Porfirio Díaz. The written statement and the legal process it sparked exemplify how social actors gave form to political culture at the local, state and national level towards the end of the Porfiriato.<br>

Abstract: Having a voice, either at the level of the individual or the community, has been one of the atavistic ways of defining or asserting humanity. This allows for the inscription of the twin-capped hegemony of successes or victories and frustrations at both the private locus and the public sphere. The disruptions of this possibility by rifts between natives in pre-colonial South Africa were aggravated in the heat of the colonial suppression it suffered, and was compounded by the operation of apartheid rule. By reason of this misrule, voices were suppressed, with a few cacophonies of dissention breaking forth. The culmination of these disenchantments into the demise of apartheid significantly presaged the need for reconstruction and redefinition of citizenship and cohabitation, and hence the necessity for establishing a public sphere, or put alternatively, a public domain in the form of the Archbishop Desmond Tutu's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. This paper, therefore, seeks to interrogate the dramatic world(s) created using the material properties of the TRC in John Kani's Nothing but the Truth and Zakes Mda's The Bells of Amersfoort. The paper argues that the domination and manipulation of this public realm by the state at the expense of the individual is not only counterproductive, but constitutes a denial of the relevance of such spheres. The paper, going by indices in the plays, therefore, concludes that every individual should not only be: given a voice, and be heard, but be allowed equal unbiased participation. Otherwise, the public sphere would not just be impotent, but the idea of nation-building and desirable citizenship would be a mere ruse. Avoir une voix, que ce soit au niveau individuel ou communautaire, a été l'un des moyens ataviques de définition et d'affirmation de l'humanité. Cela tient compte de l'inscription de l'hégémonie à double face des succés ou victoires et des frustrations tant au niveau de l'espace privé que de la sphère publique. Les pa~<br>

Abstract: 1 deliberately refrain here from saying "the neutrinos as investigated by the physicist." To move
automatically from the former to the latter is the origin of the penchant for idealism in much of con-
temporary history and philosophy of science, for the "as" lifts the neutrino from the level of reality
to that of the scientist's language.<br>

Abstract: The word 'ethical' often has a spécifie meaning. In that case it is placed on a level with other
terms having a normative significance such as 'aesthetic', juridical', 'religious' and means
about the same thing as 'moral'. An ethical problem thus regarded is a typical problem of
morality. The word can also have a comprehensive meaning, however, as in the ancient
Greeks. 'Ethical' is in that case more or less identifiable with 'normative'. That is so with the
term 'ethical pluralism'. What is usually meant by it is a pluralist view of moral and other
norms. In this essay I shall also use the term in this way. Yet I prefer to speak of a 'pluralism
of norms and values' (a) because I like to reserve the term 'ethical' for moral normativity and
(b) because in this study I also want to deal with logical and technological normativity, and
in common language these fall in any case outside the concept of 'ethical', even if it is
understood comprehensively.<br>

Abstract: There is a certain order here: character is a set of dispositions at the level of the act-
structure; temperament is the ensemble of dispositions that is anchored in the psychical sub-
strncture; typical tendencies in motor behaviourand bodily expression are related to the biotic
and physical substnicture. It is interesting that the distinction between character and tem-
perament, after having become obsolete at the end of the fifties and after decades of absence
in the scientific literatnre on personality and personality development, has re-emerged some
15 years ago and has begnn a second life.<br>

Abstract: An example may help to illustrate this point. The scientist who investigates the neuro-
hormonal regulation of mood should ask whether this inquiry concerns mostly the area of the
biotic substructure, for example in the case of molecular-biological study of receptor changes;
or whether the inquiry is in the area of the psychical substructure, for example in the case of
various types of mood changes due to (pharmacological) manipulation at receptor level. In the
first case the mood regulation comes into (anticipatory) view as psychical object function
within the biotic substructure. In the second case we are dealing with a biotic subject function
within the psychical substructure (or as biotic object in the psychical modal function). The
problem in this sort of research is that the two perspectives alternate, and so easily lead to a
short-circuit. Mood changes are then causally attributed to neuronal processes. In terms of
Dooyeweerd's system this attribution implies a double short-circuit: modal and in terms of
entities. The principle of (modal) sphere sovereignty does not allow causality between functio-
nal modes (it does allow coherence). The idea of foundational enkapsis allows no causality
between substructures. It does allow coherence and integration within a structural whole. Com-

Abstract: This article presents the results of empirical research regarding Siberian regional identity with a particular focus on regional identity formation and transformation. Based on biographical interviews with residents of three Siberian cities, it analyzes the processes of regional identity formation in a "resettlement" society and identity (re)construction under conditions of social crisis. In order to capture the individual dimension of such (trans)formation in a resettlement society the authors introduce and use a methodology combining the so-called "actionist" version of the social constructionist approach to identity studies and narrative analysis. The final section of this article offers a detailed analysis of the life stories of three Soviet-generation women, demonstrating different scenarios of regional identity transformation on the level of the individual. The results suggest that the effect of dramatic social change on personal identity depends upon the core identity of an individual. Those whose identity was rooted in the Soviet privileging of Siberian economic development face the hardest challenge. Those who have multiculturalism or such values as work or family at the core of their identities handle the crisis more easily, and the consequences of social transformation for their identities are less severe.<br>

Abstract: Lerner's interpretation is that as a result of the Fall, "humanity, in this act of
acquiring a higher level of 'knowing,' assumes the burden of distinguishing between good
and evil and of choosing the good in order to be saved"; but so far as humanity's newly-won
knowledge is, in part, sexual knowledge, the burden falls more heavily on the woman,
because God forbids her the "free and open sexuality of the fertility-goddess," symbolized,
at the time Genesis was written, by the serpent (The Creation of Patriarchy [New York: Oxford
UP, 1986] 196-97).<br>

Abstract: This essay examines how activists in rural southern India have sought to reshape the field of political communication by encouraging lower-caste women to submit written, signed petitions to district-level government offices, and so represent themselves to the state. I argue that contradictions between democratic recognition and the will to development that inhere to the political structure of contemporary governance in rural India correspond to tensions within the semiotic structure of signature itself, between constative representation and performative creation. Governmentality and the forms of communication that it requires often rest on the notion that written self-representation constitutes an act of political agency. But the limits of a governmental communicative reason that would conflate written subject and agent become especially clear in postcolonial contexts where the construction of those citizens that would be represented is in fact a product of the very act of representation. It is the narrative of development-as-pedagogy that holds out the promise of a future alignment of communicative frameworks, technologies, and participant roles, allowing for the transparent self-representation of an already-constituted citizen. By tracking the ambivalent experience of one group of women in particular, this account focuses on how the logic of signature as self-representation has served to recontextualize the marginality of petitioners as something within the state's broader field of power.<br>

Abstract: The attentions given to textual production in composition scholarship have led to a neglect of the dynamics of textual reception. Renewed acquaintance with the discipline of hermeneutics will provide scholars and instructors with a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between interpretive processes and rhetorical strategies. Building on the work of Phelps, Mailloux, and Crusius, this article revisits Gadamer and Ricoeur, two of the more prominent scholars of modern hermeneutics, for the purpose of applying their principles to learning objectives and class assignments in college-level writing courses.<br>

Author(s): Watkins Trevor<br>
Abstract: When prehistoric archaeologists write accounts of the Epi-palaeolithic or Neolithic of southwest Asia, they resort to an archaic narrative style of culture-history that was formulated by Gordon Childe in the first half of the last century. These narratives frame their account of events within the format of a succession of archaeological cultures. In addition, the received form of the narrative is founded within a core-area of the Levant, the Mediterranean corridor zone; it is assumed that all the important social and economic innovations of the Epi-palaeolithic and early Neolithic occurred within that corridor, from where the cultures and their innovations spread through diffusionary processes to dominate wider parts of the region. The first part of this paper is a critique of the unwarranted assumption of the existence of archaeological cultures, and of the Levantine primacy hypothesis. The second part proposes an alternative to the notion of the archaeological culture. First, we review the evidence for wide-area cultural networking through the exchange of goods and materials and the sharing of cultural behaviours that characterises the Neolithic. We can view the Epi-palaeolithic and early Neolithic periods as a time when new cultural processes were being employed to build and maintain novel sedentary, permanently co-resident communities of unprecedented scale. At a higher level, we see communities engaged in the construction and maintenance of more and more extensive networks of communities, in a form similar to, but not identical with, the peer polity interaction sphere model first described by Colin Renfrew in a different context.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>

Author(s): Crocker J. Christopher<br>
Abstract: Anthropologists have overlooked the importance of the metaphor in human culture. Core etaphors can help us identify ultimate cosmic constructs underlying a given social or religious world view. But, even more centrally, metaphors can serve as key data in our attempts to understand how a cultural system adapts to and incorporates sensated experience from the physical world. Metaphors thus provide both a "reality" principle and a "tool" for change. Their special status rests on the way in which a metaphor moves between two different types of thought (Fernandez, CA, 1974). A variety of comments which E. R. Leach and C. Levi-Strauss have made on this issue are summarized, and it is pointed out that both men have underestimated the possibilities for images to develop meaning at the level of affect and motor experience alone, without recourse to opposition or to categorical contrast. Along similar lines, it is argued that many authors mistakenly attempt to isolate metaphoric from metonymic thought. This is taken as a false problem, and the continuity of a process which uses both paradigm contrast and analogic continuity is seen as fundamental. The paper concludes by suggesting that the contemporary theological and anthropological approaches to metaphor are roughly complementary. It is hoped that they will come to interact. Fernandez's article is seen as a useful step in this direction.<br>

Author(s): Webster Steven<br>
Abstract: Using the hermeneutical theory of Paul Ricoeur, it is possible to discern symbolic dimensions in cultural anthropology. Symbols, here, are dominant images in anthropologists' texts, creatively posited by inquirers, that, most importantly, possess a surplus of meaning. A symbol's fullest surplus of meaning is a prereflexive and comprehensive "understanding" (Verstehen) that may encompass a scholar's attempts at "explanation" (Erklaren). Examples of this symbolic dimension are the "understandings" that lie implicit in two elaborate anthropological systems: Levi-Strauss's structuralism and Harris's cultural materialism. Amid their commitments to anthropological "science" and "explanation," the works of each disclose a distinctive Verstehen. For Levi-Strauss, this "understanding" is nurtured by his image "world of reciprocity." For Harris, it is carried by the image "nature." This "understanding" has two major functions. On the level of the intellectual coherence of their texts, it gives unity to their intercultural interpretations of other societies and to their intracultural interpretations of their own traditions. On a moral level, it includes modes of being-in-the-world that Levi-Strauss and Harris prefer and ocasionally press upon their readers. Discernment of symbolic dimensions of "understanding" in anthropologists' texts may be an initial step toward reflection on the matrices out of which diverse explanations are presented in anthropological literature.<br>

Abstract: Este ensaio pretende estabelecer correlações entre Literatura, História e História da Literatura do ângulo da Estética Expectacional. Essa posição desloca o tradicional enfoque da literatura da perspectiva da produção para a da recepção, extraindo da obra literária uma abundância de sentimentos em harmonia com as expectativas de cada período, de cada grupo social, de cada nível cultural, tornando-a, assim, uma estrutura móvel, capaz de valer em diferentes contextos e de dar respostas diversas, conforme a demanda de verdade estética. Com isto, a História da Literatura tem condições de incorporar a marcha das ondas inovadoras no percurso da prática textual em dada sociedade, assim como reter, para cada época, as qualificações do horizonte de expectativa, que tornam instantâneas todas as épocas pregressas do fazer literário. /// This essay tries to establish correlations between Literature, History and History of Literature as viewed by Expectational aesthetics. Such a view shifts the traditional approach of literature from production to reception, extracting from the literary work a profusion of feelings in harmony with the prospect of each period, of each social group, of each cultural level. This makes it a movable structure capable of functioning in different contexts and of providing several answers, according to the demand of aesthetic truth. Thanks to this, the History of Literature is capable of incorporating the shifts of innovative waves in the trend to textual practice in a certain society, as well as retain, for each age, the qualifications of the horizon of expectation. This turns all the previous ages of literary making momentary.<br>

Abstract: Beginning with an exemplary case study, this paper diagnoses and analyses some important strategies of evasion and factors of hindrance that are met in the teaching of medical ethics to undergraduate medical students. Some of these inhibitions are inherent to ethical theories; others are connected with the nature of medicine or cultural trends. It is argued that in order to avoid an attitude of evasion in medical ethics teaching, a philosophical theory of emotions is needed that is able to clarify on a conceptual level the ethical importance of emotions. An approach is proposed with the help of the emotion theory Martha Nussbaum works out in her book Upheavals of thought. The paper ends with some practical recommendations.<br>

Abstract: El surgimiento de una identidad aymara entre la población indígena del norte grande de Chile es un fenómeno reciente, como lo han demostrado algunos investigadores en los últimos años. En este artículo se aborda el vínculo problemático que se establece entre indentidad y memoria como parte de este fenómeno nuevo en el que los sujetos involucrados, principalmente aymaras urbanos, sienten la necesidad de articular una memoria representativa de ese colectivo amplio que es el pueblo aymara, planteándose, al mismo tiempo, el desafío de construirla, o como sus promotores sostienen, de "conocerla" y "descubrirla". El análisis tiene como punto de partida las tensiones que cruzan este proyecto y cómo éstas se reflejan en los documentos producidos por distintas organizaciones aymaras a partir de los años noventa. Nuestro interés se concentra en aquello que los sujetos dicen acerca de la memoria aymara (nivel de metamemoria), los esfuerzos desplegados en su construcción y los recursos utilizados en este intento. The emergence of an Aymara identity among the indigenous population in the northern part of Chile is a recent phenomenon, as some researchers have shown in the last few years. This paper discusses the difficult link between identity and memory as a part of a new phenomenon, where the concerned individuals, mainly urban Aymara, feel the necessity of articulating a memory that would represent this broad collective group, the Aymara people. At the same time, they assume the challenge to build this memory, or, in their own words, to "know" and "discover" it. The analysis focuses on the tensions that exist in this effort and on the way in which these tensions appear in the writings of different ethnic organizations since the nineties. Our interest centers on what the subjects say about Aymara memory (the level of metamemory), as well as on the efforts they put on its construction, and the resources they use.<br>

Abstract: Muftis are literate scholars who specialise in Muslim legal-religious interpretation. They provide an example of a higher level of systematic indigenous interpretation than the common sense, everyday constructions of reality that have been discussed in anthropological accounts. I discuss the institutional form of the muftiship, and contrast it with the judgeship, with reference to indigenous ideal-types found in several categories of written Muslim social thought. This ideal form is then compared with the identities of historical and contemporary muftis in Yemen. The interpretive method employed by muftis joins a Greek-derived concept of analogy with recitation and hermeneutics. While their method is structurally similar to scriptural interpretation, muftis are worldly interpreters who address practical life problems posed by lay questioners.<br>

Abstract: A Classical Latin text, Ovid's metamorphosis about Echo, is analyzed using Givón's notion of topic continuity. The analysis reveals iconicity on the paradigmatic level of discourse. A problem encountered in applying Givón's iconicity principle is raised, and this leads to an alternative approach to iconicity in discourse, following Becker. This approach uncovers instances of another type of iconicity in the text, this time on the syntagmatic level, and leads to a discussion of the role of iconicity in the aesthetics of the text.<br>

Abstract: Las políticas a través de las cuales los gobiernos democráticos trataron de poner fin a los debates sobre la represión de las dictaduras, en el Cono Sur de América Latina y en Sudáfrica, han fracasado. Esos intentos, representados por el modelo de "la comisión de verdad y reconciliación" -hoy en día activamente promovido en el nivel internacional- no permitieron la reconciliación deseada. La retórica del perdón empleada por los gobiernos fue estéril, confirmando el veredicto de la filosofía moral: no es posible un "perdón político". Sin embargo, este artículo defiende la conveniencia de un análisis de esa retórica. En primer lugar, tomar en cuenta esa retórica ayuda a discutir las explicaciones propuestas por las ciencias sociales y por los juristas de los procesos de transición a la democracia. En segundo lugar, la retórica del perdón produjo efectos políticos en cierto modo contradictorios. Impulsada por los gobiernos para poner un "punto final" a los debates sobre la violación de los derechos humanos, en los hechos impidió su clausura. Pero, por otro lado, esa retórica condujo a la escritura de una historia pacificadora. /// The policies through which democratic governments in the Southern Cone of Latin America and South Africa tried to put an end to the debates on repression during previous dictatorships have failed. Those attempts, embodied in the "Commission for Truth and Reconciliation" model actively promoted today at the international level, did not enable the reconciliation sought after. The rhetoric of forgiveness used by governments was futile, confirming the verdict by moral philosophy: "political forgiveness" is not possible. However, this article contends there are benefits in analyzing that rhetoric.

Abstract: This article argues that Jürgen Habermas's view of religion as anathema to rational critical discourse reflects his misunderstanding that religion comprises a monolithic and immutable body of dogma that is closed to reason. Illustrative data from Catholic history and theology and empirical data gathered from contemporary American Catholics are used to show the weaknesses in Habermas's negation of the possibility of a self-critical religious discourse. Specifically, I highlight the doctrinal differentiation within Catholicism, its longstanding theological emphasis on the coupling of faith and reason, institutional reflexivity, and the doctrinally reflexive reasoning that contemporary Catholics use in negotiating what might appear as "contradictory" identities (e.g., being gay or lesbian and Catholic). Although the data presented take issue with Habermas's disavowal of religion, the article shows that the practical relevance of doctrinal reasoning at both the institutional and the individual level vindicate Habermas's faith in the emancipatory potential of reasoned argumentation to advance participative equality.<br>

Abstract: There can be ethical understanding of organizational policy issues and that is important. However, there can be policy understanding about what the organization should do without understanding of individual level responsibility. There can be cognitive understanding of both policy and individual level ethics responsibilities and that is important. However, there can be cognitive understanding without affective, emotive concern. intellectual understanding without affective concern can lead to understanding without motivation. There can be cognitive understanding and affective concern and that is important, but not enough. There can be cognitive understanding and affective concern without effective political method. An action-learning approach to organizational ethics can join cognitive understanding of policy and individual level issues with both affective concern and effective political method. Joining of cognitive understanding, affective concern, and effective political method can stimulate and enable ethical character.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000757<br>

Author(s): Novak David<br>
Abstract: Jewish ethics like Judaism itself has often been charged with being "particularistic," and in modernity it has been unfavorably compared with the universality of secular ethics. This charge has become acute philosophically when the comparison is made with the ethics of Kant. However, at this level, much of the ethical rejection of Jewish particularism, especially its being beholden to a God who is above the universe to whom this God prescribes moral norms and judges according to them, is also a rejection of Christian (or any other monotheistic) ethics, no matter how otherwise universal. Yet this essay argues that Jewish ethics that prescribes norms for all humans, and that is knowable by all humans, actually constitutes a wider moral universe than does Kantian ethics, because it can include non-rational human objects and even non-human objects altogether. This essay also argues that a totally egalitarian moral universe, encompassing all human relations, becomes an infinite, totalizing universe, which can easily become the ideological justification (ratio essendi) of a totalitarian regime.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000790<br>
Date: 10 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Ferreira M. Jamie<br>
Abstract: Levinas's ethics of other-centered service has been criticized at the theoretical level for failing to offer a conception of moral agency adequate to ground its imperative and at the practical level for encouraging self-hatred. Levinas's explicit resistance to the incorporation of the phrase "as yourself" in the Judaeo-Christian love command might seem to validate the critics' complaints. The author argues, on the contrary, that Levinas does offer a strong and compelling conception of moral agency and that his ethics, properly understood, does not entail self-abnegation. Levinas's attempt to counter excessive and manipulative self-concern and self-inflation by insisting on the dependent and situational position of the self has been wrongly overinterpreted as an abandonment of the self and its just claims. The author seeks to establish a more balanced understanding by focusing attention on the "ethics of welcome," on Levinas's distinctive conception of passivity, and on the role of "the third" in all human relations.<br>

Publisher: Martinus Nijhoff Publishers<br>
Issue: i40010631<br>
Date: 3 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Svenaeus Fredrik<br>
Abstract: In this paper I develop a phenomenology of falling ill by presenting, interpreting and developing the basic model we find in Jean-Paul Sartre's Being and Nothingness (1956). The three steps identified by Sartre in this process are analysed, developed further and brought to a five- step model: (1) pre-reflective experience of discomfort, (2) lived, bodily discomfort, (3) suffered illness, (4) disease pondering, and (5) disease state. To fall ill is to fall victim to a gradual process of alienation, and with each step this alienating process is taken to a new qualitative level. Consequently, the five steps of falling ill have not only a contingent chronological order but also a kind of logical order, in that they typically presuppose each other. I adopt Sartre's focus on embodiment as the core ground of the alienation process, but point out that the alienation of the body in illness is not only the experience of a psychic object, but an experience of the independent life of one's own body. This facticity of the body is the result neither of the gaze of the other person, nor of a reflection adopting the outer perspective of the other in an indirect way, but is a result of the very otherness of one's own body, which addresses and plagues us when we fall ill. I use examples of falling ill and being a patient to show how a phenomenology of falling ill can be helpful in educating health-care personnel (and perhaps also patients) about the ways of the lived body.<br>

Abstract: O sentido da intersubjectividade em Marcel liga-se à intenção de "restituir à experiência humana o seu peso ontológico", o que obriga à recusa do racionalismo contemporaneo, caracterizado pelos principios de inerencia e de objectividade, adoptando uma epistemologia pluralista e relativista em que o universal se degrada em colectivo e o necessário em repetível. O conhecimento válido para todos reduz-se ao verificável, tudo o mais é apenas objecto de crença, da ordem do subjectivo. Esta concepção situa-se no ambito do problemático, isto é, do objectivo, do posto completamente em face de mim. O mundo actual situa-se a esse nivel, corresponde à esfera do ter e a análise desse mundo mostra que ha na experiéncia humana como tal aspectos que transcendem o problemático, pertencendo ao dominio do mistério, que diz respeito à esfera do ser. Para, alcançar o que Marcel designa por mistério ontólogico analisamse, fora do registo lógico, certos dados propriamente espirituais, como a fidelidade, o amor, a esperança, que nos conduzem a um eu, subjectividade livre, que é experimentado com referencia a um tu. O compromisso entre eu e tu traduz-se em disponibilidade e apelo e estabelece uma relagao que é o nós, um co-esse, uma intimidade espiritual. Dentro da economia do pensamento marceliano ever é conceder crédito a um tu. No limite, se o tu for absolute, o credito deverá ser também absoluto. O tu absoluto, Deus, é existente suprapessoal e nunca pode ser tratado como objecto e, portanto, demonstrado, mas está presente à invocação. Afim da crença temos a esperanga que, no significado auténtico, se situa num contexto de provação. Distingue-se do optimismo e do desejo, transcende toda a técnica, não se desenvolve sobre um saber. É própria dos seres desarmados e nisso reside, misteriosamente, a sua eficácia. Consiste num esperar em, experiéncia absoluta no piano do mistério e certeza de transcender o que se encontra em perigo na provação, e participação numa realidade absoluta que me e~<br>

Abstract: Partindo de alguns pressupostos que explicitam a questão nuclear da "instância do sujeito" na obra de Ricoeur (anteriores ou contemporâneos ao debate com o estruturalismo), e que tipificam a via filosófica ricoeuriana, e partindo também da articulação axial do pensamento de Lévi-Strauss (relacionada com esse debate), são depois propostos os tópicos dessa controvérsia. Tais tópicos, que se desenvolvem em torno dos elementos já considerados, gravitam à volta da inteligibilidade do sentido e do sentido da inteligibilidade, da complementaridade dos métodos, e dos níveis semiológico e semântico, este último estabelecido mediante a pregnância da frase na linguagem, e da palavra (mot) como operador entre a estrutura e o acontecimento. /// La présente analyse commence par mettre en relief quelques présupposés qui explicitent la question nucléaire de "l'instance du sajet" dans l'oeuvre de Ricoeur (présupposés antérieurs ou contemporains du débat avec le structuralisme) et qui caractérisent le chemin philosophique de celui-ci; on prend également pour point de départ l'articulation centrale de la pensée de Lévi-Strauss relative à ce débat, afin de proposer ensuite les lignes mai-tresses de cette controverse. Ces lignes maitresses, qui se développent autour des éléments déjà mentionnés, gravitent autour de l'intelligibilité du sens et du sens de l'intelligibilité, de la complémentarité des méthodes et des niveaux sémiologique et sémantique, en établissant ce dernier niveau par le biais de la prégnance de la phrase dans le langage, et du mot comme opérateur entre la structure et l'événement. /// After presenting the presuppositions which underlie a question which is central to Ricoeur's work, "the subject as act, as instance", and which exemplify Ricoeur's way of doing philosophy, as well as presenting Lévi-Strauss' thought concerning this question, the article proposes the fundamental topics which define the controversy.

Abstract: La ciudad habla a sus habitantes. En este artículo se presenta a la ciudad como texto, susceptible de distintas lecturas. Este nivel significativo orienta los comportamientos urbanos, da cuenta de su trama social y contiene las huellas de las decisiones históricas que incidieron en su construcción. En tanto expresión de la cultura, resultado histórico de la vida social, la ciudad es comparada con la lengua, planteándose en ambos casos el peso relativo del poder político en su constitución y en las hablas o prácticas que propician. La competencia ciudadana indica la capacidad de actuar con eficacia, abrirse camino en el laberinto de signos que la ciudad emite. La ciudad es múltiple y diversa, y propone distintos modos de percepción y apreciación. Da cuenta de la desigualdad social y, en algunos casos, es más explícita que el lenguaje, que a veces carece de palabras para designar aspectos de la vida social. El artículo está referido, sobre todo, a la ciudad de Buenos Aires. Se examinan también aspectos vinculados con la vida urbana en el plano de los espacios de interacción. Se señala que la ciudad ha ido perdiendo condiciones que la tornaban humana y habitable. Fue evolucionando hacia una mayor inseguridad y ello, junto con el desarrollo massmediático y la reducción de espacios públicos propicios, ha contribuido al aislamiento de sus habitantes y la disminución progresiva de la interacción y la participación. Estos aspectos tienen relación con las formas de representación política y la erosión de la condición de ciudadanía. En la última parte (poscriptum) se da cuenta de aspectos de la actual crisis política y económica que, sobre todo a partir de finales del año 2001, han producido una transformación en muchos aspectos de la vida urbana. En especial se observa un cambio notable en las formas de interrelación y uso de los espacios públicos junto con una intensificación de las formas de interpelación, de participación en la vida política y del protagonismo de los habi~<br>

Abstract: Accounts of intergroup conflict are symbolic constructions that are meaningful to informants in communicational contexts. Their use in comparative methodologies usually overlooks their meaningfulness to subjects in favor of some other level of reality, e. g., ecological, which is presumed to be more basic. The author argues that the social and cultural contextualizing of such data is logically prior to other analytical approaches and he illustrates his interpretive method by examining a "traditional," Eskimo (Takamiut) account of an Eskimo victory over Naskapi Indians as emergent from a particular socio-cultural context.<br>

Abstract: This article discusses irony both as a narrative archetype in tonal music and as an interpretative strategy on the part of the listener. Beginning with a discussion of Northrop Frye's four narrative archetypes (romance, comedy, tragedy, irony), the article turns to a semiotic interpretation of the archetypes by James Liszka and an application of that work for music analysis by Byron Almén. Arguing that ironic narratives in tonal music often take as their premise a topical field associated with romance or comedy that leads to an unexpected failure, the article also claims that our interpretation of musical narratives must be invested in the semantic level (topics, codes, conventions, genres) as well as the syntactic one (harmony, voice leading). The four archetypes function as structures of the musical text and as master signifiers that the listener uses to organize an interpretation. As such, the archetypes function as ideologies of the musical text and as ideologies of the reader. The article illustrates these ideas with analyses of Chopin's Nocturne in B, op. 32/1, Chopin's Second Ballade, and Brahms's Rhapsody in Ek op. 119/4.<br>

Abstract: Lately, the concept of experience, which postmodernist theoreticians declared dead, has seen renaissance. The immediacy of experience seems to offer the possibility of reaching beyond linguistic discourses. In their attempt to overcome the "linguistic turn," scholars such as Ankersmit, Gumbrecht, and Runia pit experience against narrative. This paper takes up the recent interest in experience, but argues against the opposition to narrative into which experience tends to be cast. The relation between experience and narrative is more complex than is widely assumed. Besides representing and giving shape to experience, narratives are received in the form of a (reception) experience. Through their temporal structure, narratives are crucial to letting us re-experience the past as well as to representing the experiences of historical agents. This potential of narrative is nicely illustrated by Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War in which "side-shadowing" devices restore history's experientiality. Through "side-shadowing," narrative can challenge the tendency toward teleologies inherent in merely retrospective histories and can re-create the openness intrinsic to the past when it still was a present. However, the "side-shadowing" devices used by Thucydides are fictional. To conceptualize the price and gain of "side-shadowing" in historiography, the paper advances the concept of a "narrative reference" (a concept analogous to Ricoeur's "metaphorical reference"). Introspection, speeches, and other "side-shadowing" devices sacrifice truth in a positivist sense, but permit a second-level reference, namely to history's experientiality. In a final step, the paper turns toward modern historians—most of whom are reluctant to use the means of fiction—to briefly survey their attempts at restoring the openness of the past.<br>

Abstract: The influence of Husserl on the Russian Formalism and the Structuralism of the Prague School of Linguistics is especially manifest in the work of Jakobson. A direct literary dependence is traceable in the so-called „antipsychological” tendency, in the program of a Universal Grammar and in several questions of the theory of meaning. Objective points of contact can be found in the theses of the intersubjective and the associative constitution of objects, but also concerning the central topics of Husserlian phenomenology, the analysis of essence (the elaboration of invariants and universals) and the phenomenological attitude (e.g. in phonology the priority of the perceptual level against the articulatory (physiological) and the acoustic (physical) level). A comparison of Jakobson and Husserl yields not only a mutual confirmation of fundamental aspects of their linguistic and philosophical thought. It opens also interesting ways for further research in both fields.<br>

Abstract: Le thème de la communication exprime le conflit entre deux expériences fondamentales de la condition humaine : comprendre le monde et se soucier d'autrui. Le conflit apparaît d'abord sur le plan de la société. On peut retrouver ce conflit au niveau de l'existence sous forme d'une contradiction entre l'intérêt pour le langage et l'intérêt pour l'Autre, ou entre l'herméneutique et l'éthique. Si cette contradiction nest pas insurmontable, comme i'essaye de le montrer, même la contradiction sur le plan social pourrait être résolue. There exists a conflict between two fundamental experiences of the human condition : that of understanding the world and taking heed of the Other. In the first place the conflict manifests istelf on the social level. The conflict is also to be found on the existential level in the form of a contradiction between hermeneutics and ethics. However, if this contradiction is not insurmountable, as this paper attempts to show, it should oho be possible to resolve the contradiction on the social level.<br>

Abstract: L'auteur met en évidence l'ambiguïté de la théorie phénoménologique de la négation telle qu'elle est soutenue par Husserl. Husserl hésite entre une conception de la négation comme acte et l'incorporation de la négation au sens lui-même : entre une conception illocutionnaire et une conception propositionnelle de la négation. En définitive, il choisit la seconde conception, mais en l'étendant au niveau infrapropositionnel (à la perception). L'auteur traite ce problème comme révélateur de l'ambiguïté de la philosophie phénoménologique, suspendue entre acte et sens, langage et perception. The author shows the ambiguity of the phenomenological theory of negation, such as it is held by Husserl. Husserl hesitates between a conception of negation as an act and of negation belonging to the meaning itself : that is, between an illocutionary and a propositional view of negation. Eventually, he chooses the later, but by extending it to the subpropositional level (i.e. to perception). The author takes this problem to be revealing of the ambiguity of phenomenological philosophy, standing between act and meaning, and between language and perception.<br>

Author(s): Keck Frédéric<br>
Abstract: En lisant l'œuvre de Lévy-Bruhl à travers le problème de la causalité mentale, on voit que le concept de participation, emprunté à la philosophie de Malebranche, lui permet de dépasser l'opposition entre deux conceptions : — d'une part, la « causalité naturelle » , empruntée à Tylor et à Tassociationnisme britannique, qui explique les opérations magiques par des erreurs intellectuelles ; — d'autre part, la « causalité sociale » , élaborée par Durkheim et la sociologie française, qui explique les phénomènes moraux et religieux par l'intervention de la « société » comme sujet collectif. Le concept de participation désigne un mode de causalité qui opère au niveau de l'expérience naturelle sans lui ajouter un niveau surnaturel et proprement social : « Cette analyse est comparable à celle de l'imagination chez Bergson et éclaire la réception ambivalente de Lévy-Bruhl dans la phénoménologie et dans le structuralisme. » Reading Lévy-Bruhl's work through the topic of mental causality, one sees that the concept of participation – borrowed from Malebranche's philosophy – enables him to overpass the opposition between two conceptions : — on the one hand, « natural causality », borrowed from Tylor and British associationnism, which accounts for magical operations through intellectual mistakes, and — on the other hand, « social causality », elaborated by Durkheim and French sociology, which accounts for moral and religious events through the intervention of society as a collective subject. The concept of participation refers to a mode of causality which works on the level of natural experience without adding to it a supernatural and specifically social level: « This analysis can be compared to that of imagination by Bergson, and throws a light on the ambivalent reception of Lévy-Bruhl by phenomenology and structuralism. »<br>

Abstract: Il s'agit d'éclairer plusieurs déplacements qui se sont produits dans les trente dernières années. Tout d'abord la création d'un milieu d'experts intermédiaires entre la politique, l'administration et la recherche. Ensuite un changement du cadre à l'intérieur duquel se situe la réflexion. Il s'agit moins de penser la cohésion d'une société dans un cadre national qu'à la manière dont le pays peut maintenir son rang dans la compétition internationale. Enfin un changement d'orientation politique : le souci de la formation de l'élite redevient primordial même s'il ne s'agit plus de maintenir une tradition culturelle mais de sauvegarder ses parts de marché. Le texte étudie ces évolutions en France en distinguant trois périodes : une période de « politique à l'état gazeux » où la gauche tente de transformer les idéaux libertaires de 1968 en programme de gouvernement ; une tentative de passage à l'état solide avec la loi d'orientation de 1989 et la création de la Direction de l'évaluation et de la prospective ; une déstabilisation de ce système par le ministre Claude Allègre qui jette le système éducatif français dans le grand bain de la concurrence internationale. Il s'ensuit une période à la fois « sous influence » et d'incertitude. The idea is to explain several moves that have happened in the last thirty years. First of all, the creation of a body of experts, middlemen between politics, government and research. Then a change in the setting of the thinking process. It is less to think about social cohesion within a national setting than the way the country can live up to its ranking when competing at the international level. Finally, a change in political orientations: teaching the elite becomes a crucial problem again even if it does not mean keeping cultural traditions alive any more but securing market shares. This article studies those changes and defines three periods: firstly, a period of politics in "gaseous-state" in which the left tried to change 1968's liberta~<br>

Abstract: The article contributes to the ongoing debate on the Polish intelligentsia and the role of intellectuals in the politics. The pre-war Polish state is characterized by its domination by intelligentsia, furthering its self-assigned modernizing mission. Communism was reinterpreted as offering another chance for this purpose and when this stagnated, the Solidarity revolution put forward a third chance. The anti-populist argument is seen as expressing the intelligentsia's concern about preserving its unique position. The rarity of university-level education supports this aim while new careers in business undermine it.<br>

Abstract: As the twentieth century comes to an end, and with it a millennium, there has been much heated reflection on the passing age and the period of transition. Among the many characteristic phenomena of modern times, globalization has attracted particularly much attention. The process of European integration may be traced back to ancient times (vide Roman imperialism or Carolingian universalism). Recently, however, globalization has expanded and it has accelerated considerably. The author of this paper focuses on the current, paradoxical coexistence of global tendencies toward integration on the one hand and very clearly manifested, diversifying (or even separatists) national and nationalist tendencies on the other hand. The author analyzes these homogenizing tendencies at the level of media pop culture on the one hand and the increasing, even acute, awareness of diversity, including the diversity of national cultures, on the other hand. She does so within the framework of the symbolic culture concept. Contemporarily, tendencies toward globalization are suspended between the Scylla of uniformizatdon and the Charybdis of diversity. Sociology is particularly qualified to study these phenomena, at both local and universal levels.<br>

Abstract: This study argues that the exponential growth of divinatory texts variously attributed to ᶜAlī and Jaᶜfar al-Ṣādiq included at the end of Qur'ans produced during the Ṣafavid period provides further evidence for the widespread interest in divination during the tenth/sixteenth and eleventh/seventeenth centuries in Iran. Treatises on 'divination by the Qur'an' (fāl-i Qur'ān) indicate that it was considered permissible to seek guidance by means of holy scripture at this time. On a more symbolic level, fāl-i Qur'āns can be understood as a kind of restoration of the 'defective' ᶜUthmānic codex by re-Shïᶜifying it-if not by reinserting supposedly dropped verses on the ahi al-bayt, then at the very least by adding terminal divinations attributed to the figureheads of Shīᶜī Islam. This particular practice therefore follows general 'Shīᶜification' trends found in a number of cultural and artistic practices of the Ṣafavid period, which also are potentially discernible within the domain of Qur'an production. هذه الدراسة تذهب إلى أن النمو الهائل من النصوص التي تتنبأ بالمستقبل والمنسوبة بأشكال مختلفة لعلي وجعفر الصادق والملحقة بنهاية المصاحف التي أنتجت ﺧﻼﻝ الفترة الصفوية تقدم مزيداﹰ من اﻷدلة على اﻻهتمام واسع النطاق بالعراﻓﺔ في ايران ﺧﻼﻝ القرون / العاشر والحادي عشر السادس عشر / السابع عشر . وتشير المصنفات في الفأل بالقرآن إلى أنه ﺧﻼﻝ تلك الحقبة كان التماس التوجيه من الكتاب المقدس يعتبر أمرا جائزاﹰ. على مستوى أكثر رمزية، فإن فأل القرآن يمكن أن يفهم على أنه معالجة للمصحف العثماني بإعادة " تشييعه " وهذا وإن لم يكن من ﺧﻼﻝ إعادة آيات تتعلق بآل البيت يدعى أنها مسقطة من اﻷصل، فعلى اﻷقل من ﺧﻼﻝ زيادة تنبؤات في آخر المصحف بعد النص القرآني منسوبة لرموز الشيعة. لهذا فإن هذا العمل يتبع توجهات " تشييع " وجدت في عدد من الممارسات الثقافية والفنية في العصر الصفوي يمكن أيضاﹰ ﻣﻼحظتها في إطار إنتاج المصاحف .<br>

Abstract: Dans un contexte d'utilisation croissante des comparaisons internationales par les instances politiques à des fins de pilotage des systèmes éducatifs, par le biais notamment de rétablissement de normes de compétences et donc d'évaluation en vue de l'introduction de réformes, cette contribution entend d'abord réitérer la nécessaire distinction, opérée par Max Weber dès 1922, entre l'entreprise scientifique et l'action politique, mais aussi et surtout rappeler le principe de séparation et de médiation dont relève la démarche comparative en éducation. Les concepts qui composent une langue, circulent et s'imposent dans un monde social renvoient à une histoire, à des usages dynamiques, et sont culturellement enracinés. Négliger cet ancrage social et culturel des mots expose à la construction de la comparabilité sur de seules équivalences fonctionnelles; bien que les pressions en ce sens soient fortes, c'est probablement le moyen le plus sûr de comparer l'incomparable (Marcel Détienne). La rationalité purement instrumentale qui favorise la diffusion de tels cadres ou schémas interprétatifs paraît en effet indifférente aux questions du sens et de la culture, outre qu'elle est irrationnelle sur le plan axiologique, si l'on suit Weber. L'étrangeté, si ce n'est l'altérité, tend à s'y effacer. On se demandera donc quels enjeux impose désormais au comparatiste l'illusion de la spontanéité de la traduction réduite à une équivalence fonctionnelle. Dans la responsabilité de médiation qui incombe au chercheur, c'est à un travail de clarification et d'intercompréhension (inspiré de Taylor) qu'invite la recherche, substituant à la standardisation des mots l'éclairage critique des variations semiotiques que génère leur usage. Governments are making increasing use of international comparisons as a tool to run and reform education systems, through the establishment of competency norms and assessment standards. In light of this trend, this paper wishes not only to reiterate the crucial d~<br>

Abstract: We analyse the French noun livre « book » according to an argumentative conception of language. A summary is presented of the theories of Anscombre (Theory of stereotypes) and of Carel and Ducrot (Theory of semantic blocks), which are used to reveal the argumentative dimensions of livre. Argumentation is argued to derive from a common sense system (Sarfati) leading to the ascription of doxa in language governed by a topohbased device, which corresponds to discursive object. Semiotisation is supported by phenomenological processes: the Indexicality of meaning (Lebas 1999, Cadiot and Visetti 2001) is concerned at the Linguistic level with the construction of semantic forms along three dimensions of meaning, known in the Theory of semantic forms as motifs, profiles, and themes. The contributions of the discursive levels to the constitution of a semantic form are raised in view of the phenomenon of lexical anticipation. What we call "inserted motifs" reveals the genericity of Discursive Formations. In the course of "profiling", these motifs constitute a pre-syntactic zone of stabilisation. The "doxic profiles" allows the construction of topoï by thematisation.<br>

Abstract: In the quest for a more sustainable environment, there appears to be a need to confront issues of tradition vs. modernity and culture vs. technology in a world where boundaries once dividing these issues are collapsing, and differences once separating them are disappearing. This study demonstrates, through examination of a series of built examples, the successful integration of tradition and modernity as they are reflected in Muslim cultures. In practice, the notion of culture and technology is addressed through the built context, ultimately establishing the identity of a society through its architecture. This paper argues for the preservation of a culture through understanding the level of symbolism established in its built environment: the higher the level of symbolism, the further detached an artifact becomes from its place of origin. This research focuses on possible scenarios involving the conscious application of past and present typologies of form and technology in search of a recognizable cultural identity.<br>

Abstract: The article develops an understanding of public deliberations during a peace process, focusing on the interaction between the elite level negotiations and the "public peace process." It does so by examining the dialogical mechanisms that are set to work in the public sphere once the elite consider the possibility of identifying the former enemies as allies or friends. These dialogical mechanisms, the author argues, add up to a shift in the manner the public interprets the discourse that regulates its relationship with the elite toward what the author calls, following Paul Ricoeur, 'hermeneutics of suspicion.' Thus, the peace process generates a need for the public to re-examine the terms of understanding that defined its relationship with the former enemy. However this same process might also lead the public to re-examine the terms by which it understands its relationship with the elite.<br>

Abstract: Valentin Lebedev is a pioneer of space and earth science in Russia. He is also the first ethnographic diarist of outer space. In 1982, while "on orbit" for 211 days as a fieldworking cosmonaut, Lebedev produced a thickly descriptive account of the intimate sociality and technoculture of the Soviet space complex Salyut 7. Crafted to defamiliarize (ostranenie) a spaceworld that publics saw as flawlessly engineered and managed, the diary is an argument for the value of exospheric (exo-) surprise in human experience. But on another level, we learn that the surprise is on humans who would claim to conquer "space-as-itself"—a "zero gravity" environment of force fields both extremely inhospitable to life as we know it and also generative of life in all its expressions.<br>

Author(s): Wilson Henrik<br>
Abstract: A theory of the embodiment of action is proposed. Reflections on relations between human intentions, the human body and the notion of agency lead us to argue that phenomenological analysis is not sufficient for such a theory. Our consideration, that the most fundamental level of embodied agency is that of life itself, brings us to the philosophy of biology and the theory of the organism: briefly, certain parts of the natural environment are intrinsic to the constitution of organisms and, in their more sophisticated configuration, as agents. Action is embodied in the sense that certain physiological processes are internal in relation to it and play a constitutive role in its performance. The way in which environment, context and consciousness affect and constitute the nature of agency at personal and sub-personal levels is elaborated. We see that human agents perceive and act upon their world through a complex shifting between those levels. A summary of the ways in which the social sciences can be enriched by this more comprehensive view of human agency provides the basis of justification for claiming Actor-Network Theory (ANT), originally developed by sociologists studying science and technology, as a promising framework for the continuation of this reasoning.<br>

Abstract: El artículo propone una lectura de la novela de Antonio Gil, Cosa mentale (1994), como construcción artificiosa del pasado a través de la puesta en juego de los procedimientos pictóricos aplicados a la poesía. El dictum horaciano ut pictura poiesis será revisado a partir del registro delirante y experimental de una novela que indaga en las maneras de configurar el pasado histórico recurriendo a temporalidades alternativas al tiempo de la modernidad histórica. De esta manera, según un criterio analógico, es posible identificar retóricas de la imagen y de la representación a nivel narrativo, en correspondencia con la narratividad pictórica. Finalmente, se entrega una interpretación sobre la perspectiva transhistórica del narrador que permitiría entender las anacronías narrativas como rupturas entre tiempo de la modernidad y tiempo del mito. This article proposes a reading of the Antonio Gil's novel, Cosamentale (1994), as an artificial construction of the past through the pictorial procedures applied to poetry. Horatio's dictum ut pictura poiesis will be revised on the basis of this delirious and experimental novel that explores a ways to configure the historic past resorting to alternatives temporalities in respect of historical modernity time. In this way, according to an analogical criterion, we identified rhetorics of the image and the representation in the narrative level, in correspondence with the pictorial narrative. Finally, we give an interpretation about the transhistoric perspective of the narrator that explains narrative anachronisms between the time of modernity and the time of the myth.<br>

Author(s): Zollmann Mary Ann<br>
Abstract: This article explores the thesis that educators are called to define and describe truth morefoundationally than we have ever done before if tve are to facilitate existence that is right, just, correct on both a personal and communal level. This thesis is sourced in ever-deepening attentiveness to, appreciation for, and affirmation of this statement of Adrian van Kaam: "The work of reformation starts in the heart by means of the human spirit; it is the reclamation of the soul, via the spirit, of its innermost form direction. " Suggesting that education which would be truly correctional must, therefore, reach into the very heart of being, the author describes the current paradigm shift from the Newtonian model of what it means to be human with its positivistic approaches to learning to a more Einsteinian or fullfield understanding of human being and its requirement of more formative learning processes. In consonance with the truth of being as full-field, formative correctional education is reflective and experiential, dialogical, narrative in form, and globally inclusive. In her discussion of each of these methodologies, the author illustrates how each one draws us deeper into the truth of who we are and inspires us to be the unique presence that we are in the world. Through such methods and processes, individuals are formed, reformed, and transformed not only in self-appreciation and openness to their own possibilities, but in appreciation for the meaning and value of their existence with others in the world.<br>

Abstract: Patočka summarized his conception of style in the essay „Umění a čas" [Art and Time] (1966), in which he observes style over historie periods and its increasing departure from a priori, metaphysically ascertained and universally valid meaning. In modern art, style is established by the freedom of the Creative act; its centre of gravity shifts to the level of „signifier". Patočka's essay „O minulém rázu umìění" [Concerning the Former Nature of Art] (written 1965) helped to clarify „aesthetic attitude". In this essay, he develops an interpretational duet: a critique of Hegel's metaphysical starting point, which distances itself from the experience of modern art, and an appraisal of Hegel's interpretation of time, which remains inspirational. In accordance with it, Patočka the phenomenologist considers art the place of „destructive creation", of vivifying revelation, whose source is in man. The next part of the article calls attention to a lecture by Paul Ricoeur „Vyprávění, metafora a teorie interpretace" [Narrative, Metaphor and the Theory of Interpretation] (1987), in which Ricoeur introduced a modern hermeneutic approach to literary studies. What is most relevant here is the concept of the „double reference". The first aspect of reference relates to empirical reality; the second to the „productive reference", which designs a world created by the literary work. Semantic innovation in the narration of a story has a parallel in the semantic innovation of the metaphor. In both cases there emerges „the new, the as yet unsaid, the inexpressible - in language".<br>

Abstract: In the twentieth century the phenomenon of the subjective body was integrated into ontology in philosophy, moving from Phenomenology to Existentialism. The rediscovery of the body and affect as a way of thinking also led contemporary cognitive science to the topic of the relationship between emotion and cognition, to the necessity of expanding the model of the mind and of experiencing emotions and physical sensation. The extension of the explanatory possibilities of a scholarly metalanguage into the area of the emotions and physical sensation is also important for the analysis of the acoustic aspect of lyric verse. In the acoustic flow of verse, the sounds of language have, apart from a phonemic function, their own sensuous (emotional) effect of the articulating body. In literary studies so far the acoustic flow has been interpreted only at the segmental level as a sequence of phonemes or sounds (for example in constructs of acoustic succession, phonetic instrumentation, or phonetic composition). At the suprasegmental level the acoustic flow must be conceived of as a sequence of syllables, a sequence of articulated phonations, the semantic movement of the phonemic flow. A syllable has no semantic value, but does have an experiential form, which influences motivation, behaviour, and experience. In addition to sonic and tonal modulation at the suprasegmental level, qualitative modulation, modulation of timbre, and the sequences of tones and of noise are also employed. In modelling the semantic movement of syllables in a phonemic flow the methodological approaches of experimental psychosemantics have been used. Connotational objectivization took place in three dimensions that were polarized on the basis of domestic and alien, light and darkness, activity and passivity, and research was conducted with a sample of 2,800 respondents. The analysis of the acoustic side of lyric verse would be incomplete if in addition to accentual rhythm and melody we did not also consider ~<br>

Abstract: Bohumil Nuska points out the predominant limited conception of rhythm, which is usually linked only with acoustically symbolized and aurally perceived rhythms, while the rhythms that are optically symbolized and visually perceived are utterly ignored. In lyric verse, the double, parallel mental construction, which stems from the opposition of syllable and morpheme as constituents of a higher construct of the word, creates parallel Iines of mixed mental spaces of linear and non-linear rhythms (the rhythm of verse, the rhythm of the situation; the atmosphere of the verse, and the atmosphere of the situation). Shared abstract structures in generic spaces within individual mixed spaces of lyric rhythm are shared axiological structures, represented at the highest level of abstraction by tension and relaxation (detension). The dynamic nature of these structures stems from the asymmetric distribution of tension and relaxation with regard to the dualistic symmetrical model of the axiological system. And thus deviations from its axial scheme emerge, creating these four parallel rhythmicized lyric structures (in terms of form). Similarity amongst the individual mixed mental spaces is only possible in a fractal dimension. In this theory, presented as a working hypothesis, it is assumed that the forms of the rhythm of the verse, the rhythm of the situation, the atmosphere of the verse, and the atmosphere of the situation, will be similar to each other, and their fractal mutual similarity emerges from the text.<br>

Abstract: In view of the pluralism of current exegetical methodologies, constant recourse is had to models for interpretation of texts, be these more ancient stages of the text, as in historical-critical exegesis, or schemes of a logical character as in structural exegesis. What advantages does the use of a model offer to interpretation? With the analysis limited to a narrative text, an examination of the contribution from the philosophy of history (H.-I. Marrou), from epistemology (K. R. Popper), and from philosophical hermeneutics (H.-G. Gadamer,), helps to see in the logical dimension of the different models, the source of their interpretative power. At the hermeneutical level this opens up a perspective of unity in the exegetical methodologies.<br>

Abstract: The difference between literal and figurative language becomes evident by comparing the Dutch novel The Journey of the Customs Officer to Bentheim (1983) by Willem Brakman with Proust's Remembrance of Things Past. Certain passages in the Dutch novel can be read either as literal or as metaphorical descriptions. The reader having a reading attitude which activates that frame of "reality" which is strictly separated from the frame of reference called "fiction and representation" will read crucial passages in this novel figuratively. The reader for whom fiction and reality are inseparable and situated on the same ontological level will read them literally. Both reading attitudes, the modernist aqd postmodernist ones, are personified in the two main characters of the novel. This twofold reading implies a critique of Hrushovski's descriptive method for the analysis of metaphor which is used throughout this paper. If the position of frames of reference is undefined in his theory, in his interpretive practice it becomes clear that for him frames of reference are situated in the text. Yet The Journey's ambiguity as to whether one or two frames is applicable undermines this position. It is up to the reader to differentiate or not hierarchically between reality and fiction.<br>

Abstract: Analyse de l'évolution intellectuelle depuis le début des années 50 jusqu'à nos jours du Professeur Stegmüller, un des principaux représentants de l'epistemologie germanophone contemporaine. L'importance de son oeuvre est considérée d'abord en général — c'est à lui avant tout que l'on doit le renouveau de la tradition analytique et formelle en Allemagne dans les trente dernières années. Ensuite, à un niveau plus concret, comme un des fondateurs de ce qu'on appelle le programme structuraliste dans la reconstruction des théories scientifiques depuis le début des années 70. This essay is devoted to an analysis of Professor Stegmüller's intellectual evolution from the early 1950's to the present day as one of the main figures of contemporary German-speaking epistemology. The significance of his work is mainly seen on two levels : first, in general, as the main responsible for the revival of the analytic and formal tradition in Germany in the last 30 years ; secondly, on a more concrete level, as one of the founders of the so-called structuralist program in the reconstruction of scientific theories since the early 1970's.<br>

Abstract: À l'encontre d'une école récente d'interprétation qui tend à voir dans les Essais de Montaigne une pensée du renoncement à toute maîtrise de l'action, nous voulons montrer qu'il y a chez lui une authentique pensée de la prudence. Si les références aristotéliciennes et stoïciennes sont sollicitées par Montaigne, il reste que le caractère mouvant et imprévisible de la fortune ainsi que la part de fortuit inscrite dans l'être l'obligent à redéfinir les contours de la notion traditionnelle de prudence. À un premier niveau de prudence qui consiste à savoir agir dans le monde s'ajoute un second niveau, qui consiste à savoir se préserver face aux sollicitations du monde. Montaigne inaugure ainsi une pensée moderne de la prudence, qui trouvera, mutatis mutandis, une expression contemporaine chez Hannah Arendt, Georg Gadamer et Paul Ricœur. Contrary to a recent school of interpretation which aims to see in Montaigne's Essays a thought of renouncement to any control of action, we intend to show the presence of an authentic thought of prudence. If Montaigne refers to aristotelician and stoician texts, the unsettledness and unpredictableness of fortune, as well as the part of fortuitness which is part of the being, require him nevertheless to redefine the outlines of the traditionnal notion of prudence. To a first level of prudence, which consists in knowing how to act in the word, one must add a second level, which consists in knowing how to preserve oneself facing with word's appeals. Montaigne thus inaugurates a modern thought of prudence, which will find, mutatis mutandis, a contemporary expression in Hannah Arendt, Georg Gadamer and Paul Ricœur.<br>

Abstract: The problem being dealt with in this paper is whether a text has only one legitimate meaning, or no meaning at all. The question becomes even more acute when the contexts of sender and receiver are different. Polysemy and ambiguity are well-known obstacles to communication on the level of the word. The necessity of a general semiotic theory is stressed, and explains the difference between denotation and connotation. The functionality of metaphor in biblical language points to the interpretive value of polyvalency. The impression of unlimited indeterminacy created by the recent emphasis on the active role of the reader, is in a sense misleading since author and reader function as a textual strategy. On the other hand, the actualization of the textual expression as the content of the text by applying the various codes and subcodes, implies a continuous interaction between intensional and extensional approaches. In this respect topics, thematics, ideological and world structures are operative. Since interpretation and application are not to be separated in a pragmatic context, as is the case with the text of the Bible, there inevitably remains the possibility of multiple interpretations due to the interpreting and applying of the text of the Bible in a concrete situation. Yet this interpretation and appropriation should always be done as comprehension of the text and in continuity with the tradition.<br>

Abstract: Since the early 1990s, the concept of historical consciousness has been central to didactic research in Sweden. It has mostly been used as a theoretical framework on a macro-level or as an attempt to identify students' historical consciousness. This article applies the theoretical concept of historical consciousness to tangible source material:history textbooks from the twentieth century. It focuses on whether Swedish history textbooks for lower secondary school have articulated contexts that may be conducive to developing historical consciousness. The article employs a number of theoretical concepts—narratives, multichronology, identity, and values—in order to analyze perspectives that can be utilized to trigger historical consciousness.<br>

Abstract: Giuseppe Capograssi (1889-1956) was an important legal philosopher and had a lively influence on the development of legal studies. The centre of his reflections lay in his many investigations into the concept of experience, which aimed to supersede the prevalent orientation in Italy, focussed on vertexes, emphasizing instead the importance of practices, both on the theoretical level and in the analysis of legal activity and political reality. Capograssi therefore paid great attention to the relationship between state and society viewed in a dynamic and pluralist perspective. No less illuminating are Capograssi's investigations into the value of the constitution and the principle of legality. During the Fascist period, Capograssi upheld the values of individual liberty and democratic principles, seeing as indispensable the continual involvement of citizens in the development of political action. This perspective played a further, particularly important role in the "ideas of Capograssi", after the war and the advent of the republican legal order. According to Capograssi, more space needed to be given to social life and to the spiritual links on which political community is based. In this sense, Capograssi found the teachings of Catholicism fundamental. His Catholicism placed great emphasis on freedom and solidarity and contained a lively, underlying sense of the cultural and spiritual, inspired by the ideal of "charity".<br>

Abstract: S'appuyant sur l'histoire électorale française, l'article tend à établir que l'appréhension traditionnelle de la notion de compétence politique autonomise par trop cette dernière d'autres matrices sociales, culturelles ou religieuses qui contribuent pourtant à forger l'Opinion que se font les citoyens au moment des élections. Parce qu'il privilégie l'échelle des acteurs et celle des communautés locales, parce qu'il partage le souci de restituer les logiques de mobilisation et de participation électorales, et donc de retrouver les formes différenciées de politisation(s) des citoyens, le regard socio-historique favorise le renouvellement des paradigmes susceptibles de rendre compte des mécanismes de production sociale de la compétence à opiner « politiquement ». Au paradigme de la domination privilégié, on associera ici celui de la « traduction » susceptible de penser la politisation en termes d'échanges et de transferts culturels. Based on French electoral history, the article tends to establish that the traditional apprehension of the notion of political competence exaggerates its autonomy from the other social, cultural or religious matrices which contribute to forging citizens' opinions at the time of the elections. Because it privileges the level of the actors and that of the local communities, because it shares the concern to restore the logics of mobilization and electoral turnout, and thus to find the various familiar forms of politicization of the citizens, the socio-historical approach facilitates the renewal of paradigms able to account for the mechanisms of social production of « political » beliefs. To the paradigm of privileged domination, we associate that of the « translation » making it possible to account for politicization in terms of exchanges and cultural transfers.<br>

Abstract: The 1990s and 2000s saw a memory and remembrance boom at both the national and supra-/transnational level. Crucially, many of these emerging memory frames were not simply about a glorious and heroic past, as in, for example, traditional nationalist narratives. Rather, groups started to narrate their symbolic boundaries in a more inclusive way by admitting past wrongdoings. In this article, we look at a corpus of so-called 'speculative speeches' by leading politicians in the European Union and, against the aforementioned historical background, analyse their representations of Europe's past, present and future. By utilising the discourse-historical approach in critical discourse analysis, narrative theory and elements of Reinhart Koselleck's conceptual history (Begriffsgeschichte), we illustrate how, first, a 'new Europe', based on admitting failure, is narrated. However, second, we also show that such a self-critical narration of a 'bitter past' is, paradoxically, transformed into a self-righteous attitude towards Europe's 'others'.<br>

Abstract: La 'démonstration' présentée dans Rhet. Her. 4,68 est le point de départ pour une étude qui vise à souligner comme traits qui lui sont propres la complémentarité de ενάργεια et de ενέργεια. À ce propos on prend en considération l'une après l'autre ces deux notions et les textes des auteurs anciens où l'on peut mieux comprendre leur nature et leur fonction à l'intérieur d'un discours. Après avoir mentionné les définitions de Γένάργεια données par l'Anonyme de Seguière et par Denys d'Halicarnasse et après avoir souligné la différence entre ενάργεια et σαφήνεια on s'attache à examiner quelles sont les conditions qui permettent au locuteur de 'mettre sous les yeux' des auditeurs ce qu'il dit. À l'importance des détails mentionnée par les différents auteurs s'ajoute en fait l'effet suggestif de ce que les Grecs appelaient φαντασίαι et les Latins visiones. On se penche donc sur les textes de Quintilien et de l'auteur du Sublime qui en traitent longuement et on met en relief le rôle joué à ce propos par Γένέργεία des faits, c'est-à-dire par leur façon d'être 'en acte'. Une fois cette notion éclaircie à l'aide de la Métaphysique et de la Rhétorique d'Aristote on conclut cette brève recherche par la mention du niveau le plus haut que l'évidence rhétorique peut atteindre : l'effet émotionnel du couple ενέργεια - ενάργεια qui pousse les auditeurs à se voir, eux-mêmes, sur la scène. The "demonstration" presented in Rhet. Her. 4,68, is the starting point of a study which aims at underscoring as specific features of the demonstration the complementarity of enargeia and energeia. In order to suit our purpose, we have examined one after the other those two notions and the texts of ancient writers in which we can better apprehend their nature and function within a discourse. After mentioning the definitions of enargeia given by the Anonym of Seguière and Denys of Helicarnassus, and after having underscored the difference between enargeia and energeia. we go on to examine the conditi~<br>

Author(s): Mische Ann<br>
Abstract: While there is an extensive subfield in sociology studying the sources, content, and consequences of collective memory, the study of future projections has been much more fragmentary. In part, this has to do with the challenge of measurement; how do you measure something that has not happened yet? In this article, I argue that future projections can be studied via their externalizations in attitudes, narratives, performance, and material forms. They are particularly evident in what I call "sites of hyperprojectivity," that is, sites of heightened, future-oriented public debate about possible futures. As a pilot project, I examine contending narratives about possible futures in the online documents of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development and the accompanying "People's Summit," held in Rio de Janeiro in June 2012. I propose a framework for studying how public interventions into debates about "sustainable futures" and the "green economy" differ on various dimensions of projectivity, including their temporal reach, attention to contingency and causality, and network mapping of future actors. I present a preliminary analysis at the level of narrative and grammar, by analyzing the use of predictive, imperative, and subjunctive verb forms in both programmatic and oppositional texts. I close with a discussion of how different genres of future projection might be put to analytical use in studying processes of interest to social scientists, such as coalition formation, institution building, political mobilization, and policy change.<br>

Abstract: L'interprétation du Cantique ne fait pas l'unanimité. Il se présente comme une composition polémique en réaction contre l'establishment civil et religieux et les mœurs de l'époque du second Temple. La langue tout entière du Cant, est une sorte de pastiche des traditions bibliques. Elle réutilise les métaphores prophétiques sur l'amour de Dieu et d'Israël dans le sens des relations erotiques d'un homme et d'une femme. Le passage le plus difficile du Cant. est étudié de ce point de vue herméneutique, pour voir s'il s'ouvre à notre investigation. The interpretation of Song of Songs escapes any consensus. Canticles has been written as a polemical piece in reaction against the religious and civil Establishment, and against the prevailing mores in the Second Temple period. The language is through and through a pastiche of sorts of the biblical traditions, thus bringing the prophetic metaphors on the loving relationships between God and Israel back to the human level of eros. The most difficult text of Cant, is explored from the point of view of the hermeneutical thesis, to see if it can be successfully exegeted.<br>

Author(s): Johnson Nuala C<br>
Abstract: Drawing on the theoretical insights of Paul Ricoeur this paper investigates the geographies of public remembrance in a post-conflict society. In Northern Ireland, where political divisions have found expression through acts of extreme violence over the past 30 years, questions of memory and an amnesty for forgetting have particular resonance both at the individual and societal level, and render Ricoeur's framework particularly prescient. Since the signing of the Belfast Agreement in 1998, initiating the Peace Process through consociational structures, discovering a nomenclature and set of practices which would aid in the rapprochement of a deeply divided society has presented a complex array of issues. In this paper I examine the various practices of public remembrance of the 1998 bombing of Omagh as a means of understanding how memory-spaces evolve in a post-conflict context. In Omagh there were a variety of commemorative practices instituted and each, in turn, adopted a different contour towards achieving reconciliation with the violence and grief of the bombing. In particular the Garden of Light project is analysed as a collective monument which, with light as its metaphysical centre, invited the populace to reflect backward on the pain of the bombing while at the same time enabling the society to look forward toward a peaceful future where a politics of hope might eclipse a politics of despair.<br>

Abstract: En se servant de la métaphore comme fil conducteur, le présent article ambitionne d'explorer l'un ou l'autre rapport que l'on peut déceler entre le discours de la science et celui du philosophe. Mais au lieu d'opérer empiriquement, l'analyse s'efforce de se situer sur un plan méta-conceptuel. Pour cela, elle se fonde sur une présentation des deux perspectives théoriques essentielles suivant lesquelles est conçue la métaphore : la perspective extensionnelle et la perspective intensionnelle. Alors que l'usage conventionnel et référentiel de la métaphore s'accorde avec la première perspective, l'usage innovant s'accorde plutôt avec la seconde. Envisagée comme une connaissance sans objet, la philosophie s'accommode parfaitement du modèle intensionnel de la métaphore. Celui-ci rend compte, en effet, non seulement des métaphores avérées mais aussi des concepts philosophiques eux-mêmes. En revanche, le modèle extensionnel convient apparemment mieux au discours scientifique qui porte en principe sur un objet. Il soulève néanmoins des difficultés importantes qui conduisent à réviser une approche par trop rationnelle de la science. Taking the metaphor as a vital lead, this article explores the various links between scientific and philosophical discourse. But rather than be empirical, this analysis is situated on a meta-conceptual level. As such, it offers two essential theoretical perspectives of the metaphor : the extensional and the intensional. While the usual and referential convention of the metaphor agrees with the first perspective, innovative use agrees rather with the second. As non-objective knowledge, philosophy perfectly accommodates the intensional model of metaphor, which, in effect, takes into account not only proven metaphors but also philosophcial concepts themselves. On the other hand, the extensional model is better suited to scientific discourse, which, in principle, is objective. The article nevertheless points out important difficulties that call for a r~<br>

Abstract: L'herméneutique du soi proposée par Paul Ricoeur dans les années quatre vingt-dix fait une large place au récit autobiographique. Elle place ainsi au cœur de la constitution de l'identité personnelle la capacité défaire retour sur soi en termes narratifs. Abordée sous l'angle non seulement de la permanence d'un noyau substantiel – la mêmeté – mais également de celle impliquée dans l'acte de tenir parole – l'ipséité – l'identité est ici conçue comme étant narrative. Seul un sujet capable de se raconter serait ainsi capable du maintien de soi dans la parole donnée. Or, confrontée à l'hypothèse de l'inconscient, cette conception narrative de l'identité fait problème: que ce soit au niveau anthropologique et métapsychologique d'une part, ou au niveau de la méthode et de la clinique psychanalytique d'autre part, le récit autobiographique ne saurait rendre compte de la dimension inconsciente de l'expérience. Elle ne peut en ce sens constituer un concept directeur dans le champ théorico-clinique ouvert par Freud. The hermeneutics of the self proposed by Paul Ricoeur in the 1990's gives a large place to autobiographical narrative. At the heart of what constitutes personal identity, then, is the capacity to reflect on oneself in narrative terms. Seen not only from the angle of the permanence of a substantial core – selfsameness – but also from that implied in the act of discourse – ipseity – identity is conceived of as being narrative. Only a subject capable of telling about itself can maintain the self in what is told. However, when confronted with the hypothesis of the subconscious, this narrative conception of identity is problematic: whether at an anthropological or a meta-psychological level on the one hand, or on the level of method and of clinical psychoanalysis on the other, autobiographical narrative cannot render an account of the unconscious dimension of experience. It cannot in this sense be a directive concept in the clinical theory field opened by Freud.<br>

Abstract: Le Venezuela de la fin de la période coloniale se distingue sur bien des points des autres régions d'Amérique espagnole: une prospérité économique flatteuse fondée sur le commerce du cacao et que confirment les réformes bourboniennes de la fin du siècle; une configuration sociale contrastée mais extrêmement fluide et une aristocratie créole, les mantuanos, dont le discours et les généalogies sociales sont repris à leur compte par les autres groupes sociaux émergents, notamment par le monde des pardos (métis); mais également l'une des révolutions d'Indépendance les plus violentes du continent. Les sensibilités métisses vont de pair avec une mémoire partagée, au quotidien ou lors d'événements bien particuliers tels que visitas ou procès. D'autant qu'un autre élément contribue à faire de cette société métisse une société en mouvement: les femmes, quel que soit leur statut social ou ethnique. Transgressions des normes sociales et morales par les aristocrates mantuanas, revendications des pardas se voulant nobles et défendant leur « honneur »: se situant dans la perspective de l'histoire des sensibilités, cette étude tentera de faire le point sur ce métissage des représentations, ainsi que sur la subversion du modèle culturel hispanique qui en découle dans les pratiques effectives. At the end of the colonial period, Venezuela is quite different from any other regions of Spanish America: first an economic prosperity which benefits from the cacao trade and strengthened by the Bourbon reforms at the very end of the century; a very contrasted but fluid social configuration; a creole aristocracy, the mantuanos, whose words and social genealogies are retrieved by other emergent social groups, such as the pardos (mestizos, half-caste); one of the most violent revolutions of Independence in the mainland. Hybrid sensibilities emerged along with a shared memory at the everyday level or at specific events such as visitas or trials. In this half-caste society, women, whatever their ~<br>

Abstract: Summary: On the Relations between the Sociology and the Semiology of Music. The aim of this article is to inquire what relations are possible between the semiology and the sociology of music. The first section attempts a definition of semiology: it may be understood as the science of signs, as the use of linguistic models in the description of non-linguistic fields, or as a programme of research specific to the humanities and the social sciences which distinguishes between the aspects of production, reception and the immanence of the meaning in question. The second section, through a critical analysis of a text by Barthes, explores the question of whether semiology can be understood as the science of musical ideologies. It demonstrates that semiology has no specific methodology with which to meet these problems. The third section investigates the possibility of using semiology to assist in reconciling musical and social structures. After briefly recalling several positions on this subject, we suggest that the 'neutral level' of description, presented above as one of the elements of semiological analysis, can serve as a necessary preliminary to the harmonising of musical with social structures.<br>

Abstract: This article focuses on the concepts of deliberative democracy and African palaver to conceptually (re) formulate and make intelligible the practices and performance of governance in Africa, with the aim of achieving a genuine normalization of societal behavior. Based on an analysis of the texts and a synthesis of texts analyzed, and drawing on the evidence at the present time, this is about establishing that the African palaver, often excluded from the cartography of official epistemology and relegated to the level of indigenous knowledge and practice, can define the conditions of possibility and feasibility for deliberative democracy, a political paradigm deemed dominant universal. However, the issue is that of cognitive decentering. How can one imagine that African conceptual categories, labeled as cheesy and reduced to the mere field of ethnological studies, can interact and correlate with modern recipes, with the idea of starting a process of governability, the realization of which is resilient democracy?<br>

Abstract: This paper emerges out of an ethnographic study conducted at the University of Cape Town that explored the dynamics of an intervention providing a ‘safe space’ for university staff to engage in alternative ways with South Africa's apartheid past, the university's institutional culture and with each other. This paper focuses on the social politics that arose between the intervention, its participants and imagined non-participants in relation to the university's ‘transformation’ vision. The interventionist intention was reworked by participants at a ground level into key symbols by which participants shaped the patterns of their behaviours and gave meaning to their experiences. Utilising Ortner's (1973) model for recognising and using key symbols, I argue that ‘transformation’ and ‘safe space’ are
         elaboratingsymbols in that they have conceptual and action elaborating power. These elaborating symbols operate in relay with a kind of logic that ‘crystallises commitment’ from participants to the intervention in an emotionally powerful and relatively undifferentiated manner. In so doing, they render the intervention a ‘summarising’ symbol capable of expressing what their experience means to them as an imagined community in relation to others.<br>

Abstract: Allusion and citation in Philip's
         She Tries Her Tongueexplicitly works to harness cultural capital from the literary canon. As she puts it, her poems are squatters in the house of language: “We have been linguistic squatters, possessing adversely what is truly ours.”
               This appropriation is of a piece with what Oswald De Andrade and K. Silem Mohammad are about in their splicing of Shakespeare, which I mentioned at the outset. In130
            Sonnagrams, Mohammad combines aleatory procedures with the strict observance of traditional meter and rhyme in his recombination of Shakespeare's sonnets. Somewhat like Pierre Menard's re-authoring ofDon Quixote, Mohammad sought to create new poems that were “quantitatively equivalent to Shakespeare's poems,” although this meant they were equivalent only “at the most basic linguistic level: the letter.” Mohammad explains his combinatorial process: “I feed each of Shakespeare's 154 sonnets one line at a time into an internet anagram engine … thus generating a new list of words from each line … The textual output … gives me a bank of raw material.”
               A quatrain from sonnet #3 (“Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest”) becomes:131
            
               As Heather McHugh puts it, Mohammad offers an “anagram as scrupulous as it is full of slang and sass.”Go softly to the Disneyland Hotel,

               His re-authoring is, moreover, consciously situated within a tradition of anagrams (especially those of Ferdinand De Saussure) and rewritings of Shakespeare's sonnets (he names Ted Berrigan, Bernadette Mayer, Jen B~<br>

Abstract: Contrary to Aristotle's belief, other animals do imitate, and that contributes to their learning process. In Aristotle's understanding, though, humans raise imitation to the level of culture, to a thing that can be made (
         poesis), and that can be orchestrated for leisure and educational purposes. Humans are storytelling animals; the difference in human and animal imitation lies in our ability to re-create actions that can be imitated over and over and performed in multiple forms for our pleasure. This is where Aristotle places tragedy, which he defines as “an imitation of an action that is admirable, complete and possesses magnitude; in language made pleasurable, each of its species separated in different parts, performed by actors, not through narration; effecting through pity and fear the purification of such emotions” (10).<br>

Abstract: I am lingering on this example because perhaps it can help make clear where ethics and politics intersect and intertwine, to the point of putting us in a bind, even a double bind, reflected in the following series of questions: Can we say not only “I am Troy Davis” but also “I am Troy Davis's executioner” and “I am also Lawrence Brewer and his executioner”? Can we avow our responsibility for, and complicity with, both their crimes and their executions? And what would it take to avow the differences between our comfortable lives and that of Troy Davis? Or, more to the point, to avow that at some level, the comfort of our lives is still dependent upon state-sanctioned killing, including the death penalty in all of its forms, most especially institutionalized poverty and state-sanctioned war? What would it take to avow that we are, in some way, also those whom we abhor and those whose actions from which we disassociate ourselves in the most adamant ways? That we are, so to speak, our own worst enemies?<br>

Abstract: The account of the aspect in Husserlian phenomenology is well known. With his theory of adumbrations, Husserl described how the perceived object is given in a one-sided, partial manner. The perception of its actual profile or aspect is given against the horizon of a set of potential perceptions of its other sides. Together these actual and potential perceptions are unified to form the sense of the thing that is perceived. For Deleuze, though, Husserl's account operates on the level of aftereffects because it does not ever consider the genesis or coming into being of the aspect itself. It is this event—the genesis of the aspect as such—that Deleuze's work brings to the fore. The Deleuzian aspect is separated from every figure and context. Think of it as being like the smile of the Cheshire Cat, which wanders away from the cat's body. This is not simply an imaginary or hallucinatory appearance; instead it indicates the genesis of a sensation prior to the work of figuration or its placement within a context. Every figure or form is a secondary coagulation or solidification of this primary sensation. To the extent that the aspect disarticulates itself from every position or background field, it can rightly be called an in-visible. This is how a minimal phenomenology approaches the invisible. That is, it approaches this minimal threshold of sense—the threshold that gives rise to sensation and conscious experience.<br>

Abstract: Within this story, however, is also an errant subject. The wandering and wondering subject within the text—which is also to say beyond the text—who is “greatly astounded” (Mark 10:26) is left to wrestle with his or her subjectivity on a hermeneutical level and err toward an insight indicated through the disorienting hyperbole, for example, one's relation to God and to money as well as one's conception of the kingdom of God. Hyperbolic errancy, then, is not only a rhetorical strategy of exaggeration. To arrive at the truth by falsehood is also a mode of thought and an act of becoming, as noted by Genette and Bakhtin. The lie of hyperbole presents one with an opportunity to explore the hermeneutical possibilities for expanding one's conception of truth(s) beyond its conventional bounds.<br>

Abstract: To sketch how prefiguration works in public memory, I return briefly to the example of contemporary juvenile biographies. Such texts are shaped by enduring commonplaces of U.S. public culture that “prefigure” the narratives in the texts and thus render them intelligible on a basic level to members of that broader culture. Individual life stories become recognizable historical narratives because they resonate with late twentieth- and early twenty-first-century American perceptions of historical action. The introduction to the popular Americans All series of biographies provides an example. This widely circulated series published in the 1960s and 1970s features dozens of juvenile biographies. These books focus on individuals that have “uniquely contributed to the American way of life,” including figures such as Henry Ford, Martin Luther King Jr., and Sojourner Truth. Elaborating on these generic contributions, a short introduction to each text explains that “often despite great odds, these famous people have attained success in their fields through the good use of ability, determination, and hard work” (Patterson 1970, inside cover). Readers of this series learn not only about individual people; they learn about the public culture in which these lives were lived and in which these stories were constructed. As Ricoeur explains, “To understand a story is to understand both the language of ‘doing something’ and the cultural tradition from which proceeds the typology of plots” (1984, 1:57). The “language of ‘doing something’” that shapes children's biographies often stems from cultural assumptions about what it means to be historically significant. Did the subject have a lasting impact on society? Was she or he associated with other prominent figures? In American public culture, other values affect the way in which individual lives will be narrated: liberal individualism; the myth of progress and its individualized variant, “personal growth”; and the ideal of freedom, amo~<br>

Abstract: To sum up, hope and faith are crucial to human wellness, singly and in the aggregate; they are, in this respect, salutary virtues. Both are indispensable to the species' prospects for flourishing, but in the ordinary course of events, neither is indestructible. Each can wane, to one degree or another; and, in extremis, each may succumb to the experientially insurmountable. And when one expires, the other loses its efficaciousness in the process. In theory, faith is simultaneously source, foundation, and trigger whereas hope is at once derivative, dependent, and active. Without faith, hope fades to nothingness, and so too does living, leaving the race impoverished at every level. The hopeless, if they survive at all, live grim, stunted, and joyless lives. Without a therapeutic intervention, the prognosis for the hopelessly morose is bleak: unrelenting gloom, or worse. Hope—be it cognitively or emotionally based, or mixed—is the anticipation of future goods, and faith is the conviction that future goods can be realized. Faith has multiple sources, among them religion, science, esteemed others, or the self, no one of which is necessarily infallible or unconditionally trustworthy. Hence, the faith-hope nexus may exist in a healthy or a pathological state, depending on whether the forward-looking gaze is tied to objective actuality, escapist idealism, or distortive ideology. If eyes are irrevocably fixed in the wrong direction, wishes are bound to be disappointed and harm, on a grand scale, may be the result. Yet even if faith, as well as any correlative hope it generates, is firmly grounded in reality, there is no guarantee of success. Things go awry, for a variety of reasons, some predictable, some not. Faith, then, is always a wager, and a risky, sometimes perilous, one at that. Faith can stumble, fail, or disintegrate, extinguishing in its demise any lingering vestiges of hope.<br>

Issue: utopianstudies.22.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 1 1, 1998<br>
Abstract: William Blake's poem
         Jerusalem(1804–20), like all Perennial utopias, achieves a dialectical synthesis of the ideal and the actual through the narrative focalization of a religious experience at the level of character, one that is at once transhistorical and universal. By reading the poem through the lens of the Perennial paradigm, we discover that the temporal aspects ofJerusalemare intimately tied to the religious dimensions of Blake's utopian vision. In addition to giving us a new way to understand the well-documented distinctiveness of Blake's religious message, the Perennial paradigm shows Blake's soteriology inJerusalemto be utopian rather than salvationist (that is to say, individual-religious as opposed to collective-political). Because of the ultimately subjective nature of apprehension of the Divine Vision, Blake's utopian thought is not “clearly a forward-directed anticipatory and visionary concept,” as Magnus Ankarsjö has recently argued (15). Blake does not rally the reader towards some “ensuing peaceful millennium” (15) but rather to find enlightenment in the eternal moment. In light of Blake's suspicion of ratiocination, combined with his deliberate use of narrative focalization of Albion's religious vision, readingJerusalemas a Rational utopia grounded in Judeo-Christian of notions of Apocalypse is to miss Blake's core religious message.<br>

Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Although Burke had not read Bloch when he formulated his theory of dialectical-rhetorical transcendence, the similarities between the two theorists are remarkable. In particular, both Burke and Bloch emphasize the important role that art and creative letters play in this function of utopia/transcendent rhetoric. For Burke, there are two ways that political and social opposition can be transcended. One, which he says is exemplified by Mannheim, would still think in politically partisan terms. The other is Burke's own reinvention of Plato's dialectical process as an interpretive and generative tool. This way would transcend political partisanship at the level of poetic myth: Myth bursts into the discourse to reveal something out of the ordinary context, and we move beyond the limitations of reason into the potentialities of imagination. He illustrates this process with a reading of Castiglione's
         The Courtier. “By gradations,” writes Burke, “it builds a ladder of courtship dialectically, into a grand design that, in its ultimate stage, would transcend the social mystery, ending Platonically on a mystic, mythic vision of celestial mystery.”
               The handbook is usually studied as a book of manners, but Burke suggests that it had a strong rhetorical influence—perhaps a utopian-rhetorical influence—on the motives of Elizabethan poets and other courtiers of the period. The ultimate aim seems to be merging as closely with the ideal of a perfect courtier as possible and then to become the instructor of a prince (Aristotle and Alexander are cited as examples of this motive).34<br>

Abstract: This unceasing flow is precisely what, according to Julia Kristeva, articulates the semiotic function of writing in what she calls a “pulsating
         chora”
               —an idea glossed by Brivic as “the level of maternal pulsation in language.”158
            
               Kristeva identifies this159
            choraas a “totality formed by the [semiotic] drives … in a motility that is as full of movement as it is regulated.”
               She cites Joyce's work as representative of that rare set of literary texts that “cover the infinity of the [signifying] process, that is, reach the semiotic160
            chora.”
               In that Joyce's writing confronts patriarchal regulation with this deconstructive, progressive, and chaotic flow, its attraction to feminist theorists is clear: as Brivic notes, “Joyce's experiments directly inspired two of the leading thinkers of the161
            écriture fémininemovement, Hélène Cixous and Julia Kristeva.”
               Like poststructuralist feminism, Joyce's work advances a mode of Utopianism that necessarily resists categorization. In discussing her notion of162
            écriture féminine(a literary form in which she includes Joyce's work—indeed she wrote her doctoral thesis on Joyce),
               Hélène Cixous has suggested that it is impossible to define such modes of writing and that “this is an impossibility that will remain, for this practice can never be theorized, enclosed, coded—which doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.”163
            
               While Herbert Marcuse may have suggested that the Utopian is validated by its categorization as such (and thereby by its exclusion from normative, hegemonic discourse), the mode of Utopianism expressed by Kristeva's164
            choraor Cixous'sécriture féminineis validated by virtue of the fact that it cannot be so categorized. Like Joyce's “word known to all men,”
               Utopia is too fluid for such reductive definition.165<br>

Abstract: While there is real value in considering the associations between architecture and Utopia, an argument for architecture
      asUtopia is less promising. If architecturemustembody the four elements introduced above to be called a Utopia (which is the assertion here), then identifying any individual work of architecture or larger urban ensemble as a Utopia would be all but impossible. But shifting the scale somewhat, so that a requirement fortotal application(as is associated with Utopia in its blueprint form) is surrendered, conceptualizing Utopia as ever unfinished—and acceptably so—becomes possible. Thinking of architecture as havingutopian potential, or autopian dimension, enables a more productive way to consider how Utopia could enrich architecture. Rather than requiring an absolute embodiment of the four elements of Utopia introduced above, some persuasive admixture of them that renders a work convincinglyutopianwould be acceptable, even at the level of a single building, as apartial Utopia. Even so, detailed description of the proposed transformation, particularly its social dimension, and how this would ostensibly improve conditions, is requisite.

Abstract: In this article, Ilya Kliger and Nasser Zakariya treat Lev Tolstoi’s conception of brotherhood from a narratological perspective. In the process, they trace the outlines of late Tolstoian narrative poetics, situating it within a variegated landscape of Tolstoi’s own more properly “realist” literary practice, and offering broader suggestions on the workings of narrative in its capacity to model social relations and ethical action. A narratological focus here allows them to elucidate how stories take part in contemporary understandings of social influence, human connectedness, and alienation—not only on the level of themes but also, and more deeply, on the level of the narrative organization of events. Their main focus is on one of Tolstoi’s late novellas “The Forged Coupon” and his last novel

Abstract: This essay examines the role of agency and metatextuality in Élisabeth Vonarburg's B
         ridgeCycle, comprised mainly of a group of short stories originally published between 1977 and 2002 and then revised in their definitive French versions for the collectionLe Jeu des coquilles de nautilus(2003). The cycle's main storyline involves the uncertain journey between parallel worlds by a series of recurring characters. Three intimately linked narrative components—each closely related to certain protocols of reading fiction and of particular interest to science fiction—form the theoretical and analytical bases of this study: the three recurring topoï of the protagonist-Voyager's travels; character agency that in part drives the sense of these realms and their occupation; and the dénouement which gives a certain meaning and closure to the spaces in their diverse manifestations and to the characters who pursue their quests in these spaces. Vonarburg's narratives place their protagonists in a situation precisely similar to that of the reader as she must negotiate the trans-world context, come to grips with her own relative lack of agency, and at the same time seek some level of control through knowledge. Suchmise en abymeallows the author, through the choice of dénouement, to comment on the manner in which this universe and the real one are imagined, represented, and decoded, and on how meaning is conveyed.<br>
