  Book Title: The Political Style of Conspiracy-Chase, Summer, and Lincoln<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Pfau Michael William<br>
  Abstract: The turbulent history of the United States has provided a fertile ground for conspiracies, both real and imagined. From the American Revolution to the present day, conspiracy discourse-linguistic and symbolic practices and artifacts revolving around themes, claims, or accusations of conspiracy-has been a staple of political rhetoric. Some conspiracy theories never catch on with the public, while others achieve widespread popularity. Whether successful or not, the means by which particular conspiracy theories spread is a rhetorical process, a process in which persuasive language, symbolism, and arguments act upon individual minds within concrete historical and political settings.Conspiracy rhetoric was a driving force in the evolution of antebellum political culture, contributing to the rise and fall of the great parties in the nineteenth century. One conspiracy theory in particular-the "slave power" conspiracy-was instrumental in facilitating the growth of the young Republican Party's membership and ideology.
      The Political Style of Conspiracyanalyzes the concept and reality of the "slave power" in the rhetorical discourse of the mid-nineteenth-century, in particular the speeches and writing of politicians Salmon P. Chase, Charles Sumner, and Abraham Lincoln. By examining their mainstream texts, Pfau reveals that, in addition to the "paranoid style" of conspiracy rhetoric that inhabits the margins of political life, Lincoln, Chase, and Sumner also engaged in a distinctive form of conspiracy rhetoric that is often found at the center of mainstream American society and politics.<br>

  Abstract: Christian Fundamentalism is an undeniable facet of public and political life in the United States.¹ Yet its status within the public sphere remains an ongoing source of confusion and frustration for political theorists, pundits, and ordinary citizens. Seemingly out of nowhere, Fundamentalist believers rose up in the late 1970s to transform the American political and social landscape. Pastors have joined with media personalities and conservative politicians to advocate against defense-spending cuts, gun-control legislation, abortion, and feminism. Fundamentalist perspectives dominate debates over welfare reform, rights for same-sex couples, and education standards in the public schools. Questions abound: What motivates Fundamentalist politics?<br>

  Book Title: Enigmas of Sacrifice-A Critique of Joseph M. Plunkett and the Dublin Insurrection of 1916<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Cormack W. J. Mc<br>
  Abstract: Enigmas of Sacrifice: A Critique of Joseph M. Plunkett and the Dublin Insurrection of 1916is the first critical study of the religious poet and militarist Joseph M. Plunkett, who was executed with the other leaders of the Dublin insurrection of 1916. Through Plunkett the author gains access to areas of nationalist thought that were more often assumed or repressed than publicly formulated.In this eye-opening book, W. J. Mc Cormack explores and analyzes Plunkett's brief life, work, and influence, beginning with his wealthy but dysfunctional family, irregular Jesuit education, and self-canceling sexuality. Mc Cormack continues through Plunkett's active phase when amateur theatricals and a magazine editorship brought him into the emergent neonationalist discourse of early twentieth-century Ireland. Finally, the author arrives at Holy Week 1916, when Plunkett masterminded the forgery of official documentation in order to provoke and justify the insurrection he planned. Mc Cormack analyzes Plunkett's significant texts and provides context through critical perspectives on his milieu.Enigmas of Sacrificeis unique in its effort to understand a major figure of Irish nationalism in terms that reach beyond political identity.<br>

  Book Title: Mourning Animals-Rituals and Practices Surrounding Animal Death<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kalof Linda<br>
  Abstract: We live more intimately with nonhuman animals than ever before in history. The change in the way we cohabitate with animals can be seen in the way we treat them when they die. There is an almost infinite variety of ways to help us cope with the loss of our nonhuman friends-from burial, cremation, and taxidermy; to wearing or displaying the remains (ashes, fur, or other parts) of our deceased animals in jewelry, tattoos, or other artwork; to counselors who specialize in helping people mourn pets; to classes for veterinarians; to tips to help the surviving animals who are grieving their animal friends; to pet psychics and memorial websites. But the reality is that these practices, and related beliefs about animal souls or animal afterlife, generally only extend, with very few exceptions, to certain kinds of animals-pets. Most animals, in most cultures, are not mourned, and the question of an animal afterlife is not contemplated at all.
      Mourning Animalsinvestigates how we mourn animal deaths, which animals are grievable, and what the implications are for all animals.<br>

  Author(s) MARGULIES LIZA WALLIS<br>
  Abstract: Despite living most of my life within a fifteen-minute drive of the country’s oldest pet cemetery, it wasn’t until a brisk late-winter afternoon that I visited there for the first time. I had just said a final goodbye to my bonhomous black lab, Ben, and brought him to the crematory on the grounds of the cemetery. The arrestingly cheerful woman behind the desk invited me to walk around the place while he was being cremated. She said it would take roughly two hours. In the end I would leave with a container of ashes.<br>

  Abstract: Claire came to live with me in 2009. I made the decision to euthanize her on July 5, 2011, because she suffered from osteomyelitis, a painful bone infection. I’ve lived with animals since I was four. In my adult life, I have loved, nursed, and mourned the loss of beloved animal companions. But when I reflect on Claire’s life, I am haunted by questions that I never had to ask when those other animals died. Would she have rather I left her where I met her, living in a cardboard box in a windowless bathroom? Or would she have made<br>

  The “Hellenic” Rationality of Interreligious Dialogue: from:

  Abstract: Simone Weil’s
                  The Need for Roots (L’Enracinement), written during the last months of her life (1909–43) and with her dying strength, is a fitting companion piece toBattling to the End (Achever Clausewitz), the last book by René Girard (b. 1923). Compatriots, Weil and Girard each retell the long story of French history from the Middle Ages, beginning in medias res and dwelling upon many of the same modern turning points—1789, 1815, 1914, 1940. Girard explicitly links his own childhood memories of the war years with the Free French radio broadcasts from London and the names of Maurice<br>

  Book Title: Intimate Domain-Desire, Trauma, and Mimetic Theory<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Reineke Martha J.<br>
  Abstract: For René Girard, human life revolves around mimetic desire, which regularly manifests itself in acquisitive rivalry when we find ourselves wanting an object because another wants it also. Noting that mimetic desire is driven by our sense of inadequacy or insufficiency, Girard arrives at a profound insight: our desire is not fundamentally directed toward the other's object but toward the other's being. We perceive the other to possess a fullness of being we lack. Mimetic desire devolves into violence when our quest after the being of the other remains unfulfilled. So pervasive is mimetic desire that Girard describes it as an ontological illness. In
      Intimate Domain,Reineke argues that it is necessary to augment Girard's mimetic theory if we are to give a full account of the sickness he describes. Attending to familial dynamics Girard has overlooked and reclaiming aspects of his early theorizing on sensory experience, Reineke utilizes psychoanalytic theory to place Girard's mimetic theory on firmer ground. Drawing on three exemplary narratives-Proust'sIn Search of Lost Time,Sophocles'sAntigone,and Julia Kristeva'sThe Old Man and the Wolves-the author explores familial relationships. Together, these narratives demonstrate that a corporeal hermeneutics founded in psychoanalytic theory can usefully augment Girard's insights, thereby ensuring that mimetic theory remains a definitive resource for all who seek to understand humanity's ontological illness and identify a potential cure.<br>

  Abstract: Oprah Winfrey, icon of popular culture, pens a monthly column titled “What I Know For Sure.” Less bold than Oprah, who has been espousing sureties for years, I am certain of few things. However, beyond a doubt, I know that our early life experiences shape our lives in profound ways. My conviction has been tutored by psychoanalytic theory, which offers a compelling account of the lasting impact on us of our early experiences, especially within the family.<br>

  Abstract: Marcel Proust’s
                     In Search of Lost Timeis a powerful account of mimetic desire. Proust confronts us with the bankruptcy of the narrator’s desires as well as with our own; so also does he enable us to participate in the narrator’s release from the strictures of desire and his transformation. Chronicling hope and not only despair, the narrator ofIn Search of Lost Timeattests to salvation that is threaded through life trauma.<br>

  Abstract: How can intimacy become a subject for critical reflection?¹ Intimacy is typically understood to focus on emotions of love and supportive family bonds. But if family life is the beginning point for reflection on intimacy, it is not the only terrain we can explore in an effort to understand it. Helpfully, Julia Kristeva both broadens and narrows the field for critical reflection on intimacy. She broadens it when she links intimacy to art, religion, and psychoanalysis and cites the unique capacity of these forms of cultural expression to
                  protect the singularity of human life.² Kristeva narrows the context for critical<br>

  Book Title: The Genesis of Desire-  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Webb Eugene<br>
  Abstract: We seem to be abandoning the codes that told previous generations who they should love. But now that many of us are free to choose whoever we want, nothing is less certain. The proliferation of divorces and separations reveal a dynamic we would rather not see: others sometimes reject us as passionately as we are attracted to them.Our desire makes us sick. The throes of rivalry are at the heart of our attraction to one another. This is the central thesis of Jean-Michel Oughourlian's
      The Genesis of Desire, where the war of the sexes is finally given a scientific explanation. The discovery of mirror neurons corroborates his ideas, clarifying the phenomena of empathy and the mechanisms of violent reciprocity.How can a couple be saved when they have declared war on one another? By helping them realize that desire originates not in the self but in the other. There are strategies that can help, which Dr. Oughourlian has prescribed successfully to his patients. This work, alternating between case studies and more theoretical statements, convincingly defends the possibility that breakups need not be permanent.<br>

  Book Title: Christianity and the Mass Media in America-Toward a Democratic Accommodation<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Schultze Quentin J.<br>
  Abstract: The mass media and religious groups in America regularly argue about news bias, sex and violence on television, movie censorship, advertiser boycotts, broadcast and film content rating systems, government regulation of the media, the role of mass evangelism in a democracy, and many other issues. In the United States the major disputes between religion and the media usually have involved Christian churches or parachurch ministries, on the one hand, and the so-called secular media, on the other. Often the Christian Right locks horns with supposedly liberal Eastern media elite and Hollywood entertainment companies. When a major Protestant denomination calls for an economic boycott of Disney, the resulting news reports suggest business as usual in the tensions between faith groups and media empires.Schultze demonstrates how religion and the media in America have borrowed each other's rhetoric. In the process, they have also helped to keep each other honest, pointing out respective foibles and pretensions. Christian media have offered the public as well as religious tribes some of the best media criticism- better than most of the media criticism produced by mainstream media themselves. Meanwhile, mainstream media have rightly taken particular churches to task for misdeeds as well as offered some surprisingly good depictions of religious life.The tension between Christian groups and the media in America ultimately is a good thing that can serve the interest of democratic life. As Alexis de Tocqueville discovered in the 1830s, American Christianity can foster the "habits of the heart" that ward off the antisocial acids of radical individualism. And, as John Dewey argued a century later, the media offer some of our best hopes for maintaining a public life in the face of the religious tribalism that can erode democracy from within. Mainstream media and Christianity will always be at odds in a democracy. That is exactly the way it should be for the good of each one.<br>

  Abstract: The groundwork for my encounter with the work of René Girard was laid early in my life. I grew up in a tumultuous era that sensitized me to violence. Trips with my parents through the U.S. South enabled me to observe the persistence of Jim Crow in “colored” and “white” schools. Even as a child, I saw and felt that race-based disparities in educational opportunity constituted a reprehensible act of violence. The Vietnam War shaped my experience in high school and college. Especially in college, I brought the resources of my liberal education to bear upon the violence around me.<br>

  Abstract: The groundwork for my encounter with the work of René Girard was laid early in my life. I grew up in a tumultuous era that sensitized me to violence. Trips with my parents through the U.S. South enabled me to observe the persistence of Jim Crow in “colored” and “white” schools. Even as a child, I saw and felt that race-based disparities in educational opportunity constituted a reprehensible act of violence. The Vietnam War shaped my experience in high school and college. Especially in college, I brought the resources of my liberal education to bear upon the violence around me.<br>

  Author(s) Niewiadomski Jozef<br>
  Abstract: Born in the early 1950s in Poland, I grew up in a farmer’s family in a small rural village. Just like all the other villagers, I was socialized in the Catholic parish. I experienced the safety and security of the religious environment entirely from the perspective of unbroken childlike trust. As a fourteen-year-old, I went to the big city and moved into a Communist boarding school. It was not difficult to connect the problems of puberty and the feeling of homelessness with Communist ideology. The ideal concept of home life as defined by the Church was not damaged in the<br>

  Abstract: In my early twenties, I joined a Byzantine Catholic commune in the south of France, La Communauté de la Théophanie. It was at the crossroads of a number of influences, especially Gandhian nonviolence and the discovery and practice of Eastern Christianity, along with a third influence, the Charismatic Renewal, with its religious fervor and warm ecumenical impulse. Nonviolence was a whole program. It meant a simple, rural daily lifestyle tending toward economic self-sufficiency and a refusal to participate in any form of violence, direct or institutional, such as military service. A disciple and friend of Gandhi, Lanza del Vasto, had<br>

  Abstract: The year 1985 was a “before and after” year for me. It was one of those years when you experience a significant event or change, so you tend to remember and identify things in your life as before or after it. I first encountered Girard’s work in April 1985 when I was in Strasbourg, France, for three weeks. While there, I presented a paper to the professors of the Catholic and Protestant faculties of biblical studies of the University of Strasbourg in which I sketched patterns in the enemy brother stories of the book of Genesis and noted one striking<br>

  Abstract: There were surely several circumstances in my life that prepared me to become interested in mimetic theory while I was studying theology at the University of Innsbruck in Austria. First, I have maintained a long ongoing interest in anthropology. During my time in high school, I was already starting to read books about foreign cultures (both modern and premodern) and even seriously thinking about becoming an anthropologist. Second, I was also very much in love with literature and therefore starting to study German language and literature, in addition to theology.

  Book Title: Nosotros-A Study of Everyday Meanings in Hispano New Mexico<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): KORTE ALVIN O.<br>
  Abstract: Much knowledge and understanding can be generated from the experiences of everyday life. In this engaging study, Alvin O. Korte examines how this concept applies to Spanish-speaking peoples adapted to a particular locale, specifically the Hispanos and Hispanas of northern New Mexico. Drawing on social philosopher Alfred Schutz's theory of typification, Korte looks at how meaning and identity are crafted by quotidian activities. Incorporating phenomenological and ethnomethodological strategies, the author investigates several aspects of local Hispano culture, including the oral tradition, leave-taking, death and remembrances of the dead, spirituality, and the circle of life. Although avoiding a social-problems approach, the book devotes necessary attention to

  Abstract: Truitt had breakthroughs in Tokyo, but they were hard won. Despite the professional recognition that Truitt achieved while she lived in Japan from 1964 to 1967, it was a time of deep isolation, sadness, and frustration with her studio practice. At the turn of the 1970s, Truitt looked back on the sculptures she made in Japan and found them “simply intelligent,” “lifeless,” and inconsistent with the conceptual thrust of her work since First — and in December 1971, she had the majority of these Japanese works destroyed, nineteen sculptures in all.¹ Yet, despite this iconoclasm, after Truitt returned to the United<br>

A projection of Surrealist yearning, the idea of a process, an ʺact of dreamingʺ by which ʺthe mind makes contact with whatever mystery it is that connects the Dreaming [the Eternal Dream Time] and the Here and Now,ʺ is fundamental to mythic thought throughout the world and is at its most developed in the traditions<br>

T. Kirby indicates (above, p. 266), the clownʹs ʺsacredness,ʺ like the shamanʹs, hooks into an extraordinary initiatory/visionary experience and rebirth. Ortiz terms this rebirth ʺa new, omnipotent mode of existenceʺ (1977 ms: 22)—what Mircea Eliade speaks of as the ʺdivine election,ʺ and Black Elk, with specific reference<br>

  Abstract: ʺ[Among] the oldest pure performers in the history of settled human life,ʺ notes Alfonso Ortiz (1977 ms: 4–5), the sacred clowns in their Pueblo form ʺwere around at least by the end of the 1st millennium, a.d., because petroglyphs and other representations of them are traceable to that period.ʺ As E.

  Abstract: ʺNegritudeʺ was—from one of its directions—a culmination of Surrealist concepts of an alternative consciousness ʺopposed to the values of Europeʺ and ʺviolently departing once and for all from the ways of thinking and feeling which have made life no longer bearable.ʺ (Thus: André Breton, the master of French Surrealism, in his preface—1943—to the Martinican poet Aimé CésaireʹsNotebook of a Return to the Native Land.)The young French-speaking black poets (Césaire, Senghor, et al.) who launched the movement in the 1930s tied all that tothisparticular culture or network of cultures—ʺA frica,ʺ then colonized—<br>

During that time, according to Griaule, Ogotemmêli ʺlaid bare the framework of a world system: … a cosmogony as rich as that of Hesiod, poet of a dead world, and a metaphysics that has the advantage of being expressed in a thousand rites and actions in the life of a multitude of living beingsʺ (1965: 3).

This compound dis/plays the juxtaposition of life and time so elemental to our way of being in the world: what most impresses our thinking about the life-that-is-passing is the passing-that-is-life, a passing that lies at the root of our rootlessness. We are perpetually cast in the mold of temporal beings, always, it seems, being in time for the time being. Time flies, runs, flees, passes too quickly, too slowly, and yet at the end of day—invariably the beginning of night—the question persists:<br>

  Author(s) QUINONES RICARDO J.<br>
  Abstract: The
                  Purgatoriowas one of the great discoveries of the twentieth century. The post-Napoleonic nineteenth century not only was preoccupied with but also identified with the overwhelming, larger-than-life personalities that impose themselves on us from within the pages of theInferno.Twentieth-century readers, traumatized and chastened by two world wars, were not in a position to gain much pleasure from doomed, heroic personalities, but they did find much to identify with in thePurgatorio,particularly in its mixed condition of sadness and of hope, its remarkable elegiac lyricism and strong personal conviction, its structural polyphonism, and its delicate interweaving of<br>

  Author(s) Ross Charles<br>
  Abstract: Canto X begins the great cycle of penitence and education that characterizes Purgatory proper. The souls in Purgatory follow the order of the seven mortal sins as defined by Christian doctrine. They traverse the seven circles of the mountain, pausing in each circle, for a time, according to their inclination toward each sin that has remained in them after their life on earth. They are not punished for any specific crimes they may have committed, as happens in Dante’s Hell. Instead, at each stage of Purgatory, penitence regularly consists of a meditation and a

  Abstract: The subject of Canto XX is avarice, for Dante the most detestable of vices. Avarice—in this case the collective avarice of the kings of France, who in the poet’s lifetime thwarted the election of an emperor and effectively subjugated the papacy—destroys the ordered fabric of life, and the canto is notable for an impassioned speech delivered by a shade, Hugh Capet, who is a mouthpiece for the poet’s anti-gallicism. Canto XX is virtually devoid of lyricism, as befits the gravity of the vice, and it can be seen to fall into three parts, with a sustained central speech<br>

  Abstract: Since the end of the colonial era, many of the territories where anthropologists have worked have been witness to an increasingly visible “humanitarian presence.” The massive army of volunteer workers, international experts, local staff, and soldiers associated with humanitarian intervention has had a remarkable impact on local cultural landscapes. Despite the increasing proliferation of these zones of humanitarian and military intervention, anthropologists are only beginning to examine the theoretical and practical consequences of these new forms of intervention. Intervention studies present a perilous but necessary challenge to the anthropological community. They force us to consider both new sites of intervention<br>

  Author(s) Pinto Sarah<br>
  Abstract: In considering languages of grief in relation to languages of certainty, there is a tension in the ways death can be thought of in connection to modern knowledge. On the one hand, we can consider death as that which underlies the possibility of knowledge, as that end point to the fostering or disallowing of life that stands for the modern configuration of power/knowledge (as Foucault [1978] had it). And on the other hand, we can imagine death as that which cannot be spoken in languages of modernity (as de Certeau [1986] suggested). Put differently, this is the distinction between death<br>

  Abstract: Participant observation in hundreds of services and events, as well as with church members in everyday life over the course of three years, left me with little doubt that hardship and suffering have permanent seats in Venezuelan Evangelical discourse. Exhortations to gain control of one’s life through Jesus Christ were mixed with warnings of what will happen if one backslides from the Way, were interspersed with testimonies about God’s power to resolve intractable problems and impossible situations. My findings agree, then, with the dominant social scientific interpretation that Latin American Evangelicalism is a religion oriented toward those experiencing sustained life<br>

  Abstract: In the preceding chapters I showed that Evangelical religious practice can fit into projects of self-reform among poor Caracas men. But I am yet to address the most difficult question: how can people intentionally adopt a set of religious beliefs and practices in order to confront life problems? The tradition of thought that defines religion and culture in contradistinction to individual rationalistic action can be traced to Durkheim if not earlier. But despite this long-term conceptual trend, the incompatibility of intention and belief has been built on as a presupposition, not established through argument. One exception is the political philosopher<br>

  Book Title: Between One and One Another-  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Jackson Michael<br>
  Abstract: Michael Jackson extends his path-breaking work in existential anthropology by focusing on the interplay between two modes of human existence: that of participating in other peoples’ lives and that of turning inward to one’s self. Grounding his discussion in the subtle shifts between being acted upon and taking action, Jackson shows how the historical complexities and particularities found in human interactions reveal the dilemmas, conflicts, cares, and concerns that shape all of our lives. Through portraits of individuals encountered in the course of his travels, including friends and family, and anthropological fieldwork pursued over many years in such places as Sierra Leone and Australia, Jackson explores variations on this theme. As he describes the ways we address and negotiate the vexed relationships between “I” and “we”—the one and the many—he is also led to consider the place of thought in human life.<br>

  Abstract: In the late 1930s, Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead did pioneering ethnographic fieldwork in a Balinese village, using still and movie cameras to capture some of the “intangible aspects” of Balinese culture and everyday life, including trance, eating, gesture, mourning, family interactions, children’s play, art, and shadow-play puppets. In her introductory essay to their 1942 monograph, Mead speaks of a Balinese passion for being part of a noisy, festive crowd. Whether a marketplace, temple court, theatrical event, elaborate carving, or close-packed array of offerings on an altar, “the crowd preference is seen everywhere in Balinese life.¹ Women are said to<br>

  Abstract: At the heart of contemporary anthropology lies a dilemma: How can we do justice to what is at stake for people in their “local moral worlds”¹ and
                  at the same timestrive to broaden our analytical horizons to encompass the general and global conditions of human life on earth? This dilemma is at once methodological and empirical.

                  perfect accordwith any one but himself”¹ and extolling the virtues of self-sufficiency, Schopenhauer nevertheless acknowledges that, for many people, the inner life is so empty and unsatisfying that they are driven “to the company of others which consists of men like themselves, forsimilis simili gaudet” (Birds of a feather flock together).² Elsewhere, he makes this point with a parable.

Hustvedt was born in America of Norwegian parents, and her childhood map of the world “consisted of two regions only: Minnesota and Norway, my here and my there.”¹ This was the “yonder” her father described as a place “between here and there,” a place that could not be occupied without it becoming “here” and thereby creating another elusive and indeterminate yonder, elsewhere.

  Abstract: In the late 1930s, Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead did pioneering ethnographic fieldwork in a Balinese village, using still and movie cameras to capture some of the “intangible aspects” of Balinese culture and everyday life, including trance, eating, gesture, mourning, family interactions, children’s play, art, and shadow-play puppets. In her introductory essay to their 1942 monograph, Mead speaks of a Balinese passion for being part of a noisy, festive crowd. Whether a marketplace, temple court, theatrical event, elaborate carving, or close-packed array of offerings on an altar, “the crowd preference is seen everywhere in Balinese life.¹ Women are said to<br>

  Abstract: If I have recourse to metaphors of water and darkness to describe myself at twenty-one, it is partly because I spent that turbulent year in a harbor city buffeted by high winds and ransacked by winter storms. In this emotional maelstrom, I knew only one person who seemed to have the knack of staying afloat. And so I clung to him as to a life raft, buoyed by his concern for my welfare, guided by his advice, secure in his example.

  Abstract: In his much-cited Letter of Lord Chandos, the fin de siècle Viennese poet Hugo Von Hofmannsthal describes the despair of a writer who has become so disenchanted with language that he can no longer write. In the winter of 2009, something akin to Von Hofmannsthal’s “inexplicable condition” afflicted me. At first I suspected that my inability to write stemmed from a disenchantment with language that had been deepening for many years—a doubt that words could ever capture or convey a sense of the life one lived or the world one lived in but only gesture pathetically and longingly toward<br>

  Abstract: At the heart of contemporary anthropology lies a dilemma: How can we do justice to what is at stake for people in their “local moral worlds”¹ and

This dilemma is at once methodological and empirical.

  Book Title: Between One and One Another-  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Jackson Michael<br>
  Abstract: Michael Jackson extends his path-breaking work in existential anthropology by focusing on the interplay between two modes of human existence: that of participating in other peoples’ lives and that of turning inward to one’s self. Grounding his discussion in the subtle shifts between being acted upon and taking action, Jackson shows how the historical complexities and particularities found in human interactions reveal the dilemmas, conflicts, cares, and concerns that shape all of our lives. Through portraits of individuals encountered in the course of his travels, including friends and family, and anthropological fieldwork pursued over many years in such places as Sierra Leone and Australia, Jackson explores variations on this theme. As he describes the ways we address and negotiate the vexed relationships between “I” and “we”—the one and the many—he is also led to consider the place of thought in human life.<br>

  Author(s): KLEINMAN ARTHUR<br>
  Abstract: This innovative volume is an extended intellectual conversation about the ways personal lives are being undone and remade today. Examining the ethnography of the modern subject, this preeminent group of scholars probes the continuity and diversity of modes of personhood across a range of Western and non-Western societies. Contributors consider what happens to individual subjectivity when stable or imagined environments such as nations and communities are transformed or displaced by free trade economics, terrorism, and war; how new information and medical technologies reshape the relation one has to oneself; and which forms of subjectivity and life possibilities are produced against a world in pieces. The transdisciplinary conversation includes anthropologists, historians of science, psychologists, a literary critic, a philosopher, physicians, and an economist. The authors touch on how we think and write about contingency, human agency, and ethics today.<br>

  Abstract: We can gain a sharper sense of the peculiar nature of the cultural order that Sanskrit helped to create, and the kind of political order for which it was cultivated, if we consider both from an explicitly comparative perspective. There is a natural tendency, exhibited even (or especially) in social and cultural theory, to generalize familiar forms of life and experience as universal tendencies and common sense. Comparison offers an antidote to this by demonstrating the actual particularity of these apparent universalisms. Among those forms of life and experience, Latin literary culture and the Roman political formation, as well as<br>

  Abstract: Few things seem as natural as the multiplicity of vernacular languages used for making sense of life through texts—that is, for making literature. And few things seem as unnatural as their gradual disappearance in the present, especially from the pressures exerted by globalizing English. Literary-language loss is in fact often viewed as part of a more general reduction of diversity in a cultural ecosystem, a loss considered as dangerous as the reduction of biological diversity, to which—in another instance of cultural naturalization—it is often compared. Today’s homogenization of culture, of which language loss is one aspect, seems<br>

  Book Title: After the Massacre-Commemoration and Consolation in Ha My and My Lai<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Faust Drew<br>
  Abstract: Though a generation has passed since the massacre of civilians at My Lai, the legacy of this tragedy continues to reverberate throughout Vietnam and the rest of the world. This engrossing study considers how Vietnamese villagers in My Lai and Ha My-a village where South Korean troops committed an equally appalling, though less well-known, massacre of unarmed civilians-assimilate the catastrophe of these mass deaths into their everyday ritual life. Based on a detailed study of local history and moral practices,
      After the Massacrefocuses on the particular context of domestic life in which the Vietnamese villagers interact with their ancestors on one hand and the ghosts of tragic death on the other. Heonik Kwon explains what intimate ritual actions can tell us about the history of mass violence and the global bipolar politics that caused it. He highlights the aesthetics of Vietnamese commemorative rituals and the morality of their practical actions to liberate the spirits from their grievous history of death. The author brings these important practices into a critical dialogue with dominant sociological theories of death and symbolic transformation.<br>

  Abstract: Dead people, in popular Vietnamese culture, can be powerfully sentient and salient beings who entertain emotions, intentions, and historical awareness. The ethnological literature about their mortuary customs and religious imaginations confirms this. Remembering ancestors means, in Vietnam, according to Le Van Dinh, relating to them “as if they were alive.”¹ A French Jesuit missionary to Vietnam and author of classical studies on Vietnamese popular religions, Léopold Cadière, wrote that the Vietnamese perception of the world incorporates the awareness that the life of the dead is intertwined with that of the living, and that the Vietnamese idealize a harmonious relationship between<br>

A number of residents in Khe Thuan subhamlet claimed that they had seen old women ghosts licking and sucking the arms and legs of small child ghosts, and they interpreted the scene as an effort by the elderly victims to ease the pain of the wounded children. Some in Khe Dong subhamlet also graphically described several young women ghosts, each walking with a small child held in her arms and lamenting over the child’s lifeless body.

  Abstract: Heroes, ancestors, and ghosts coexist in the village environment. While revolutionary politics and traditional religious heritage separate them, the three social classes in afterlife associate in popular ritual practices. Although they constitute a hierarchy, the hierarchy that structures their relative values varies at different sites of memory. Their status changes between the state war memorial and the community temple, and the war heroes who occupy the symbolic center in the former are relegated to the margins, outside the village ancestors, in the latter. The position of ghosts also shifts in this movement of memories. The memory of tragic death is<br>

  Abstract: The title of this collection is derived from Friedrich Nietzsche’s essay “On the Uses and Disadvantages of History for Life.”¹ The central argument of this passionate work, judiciously qualified, reflects my own deepest convictions about the value of historical scholarship. Nietzsche opened his essay with a quotation from Goethe: “I hate everything that merely instructs me without augmenting or directly invigorating my activity.” This meant to him that a vital historiography must serve the “life and action” of society. There is, Nietzsche argued, a “natural relationship of an age, a culture, a nation with its history—evoked by hunger, regulated<br>

  Abstract: Although European historians have increasingly recognized the impact of large-scale change or significant events on human culture, they have paid little attention to the importance of the less dramatic aspects of social experience for shaping the attitudes of men. The result has been, for most of us, a schism between social and intellectual history that has impoverished both. As Frederic C. Lane has reminded us, the routine tasks of daily life are likely to impress those engaged in them with a profound sense of what the world and especially men are like and to produce patterns of expectation and systems<br>

It is true that we have good editions of his most important writings and an increasing body of information concerning his life and surroundings. Yet there is still no satisfactory general work on Sarpi, nor is there any generally accepted interpretation of his personality, his thought, and his purposes.<br>

  Abstract: It is a curious reflection on the historical profession that I have only once been invited to express my views about the teaching of history. There is something distinctly odd about this. Our society, after all, supports us not simply because we are historians, but primarily because we are
                  teachersof history. It does so on the assumption that we are the guardians, not simply of a professional discipline, but of something that, in a deep sense, belongs to society itself, something precious and even essential to its life, with which we have been entrusted not only to preserve and<br>

  Book Title: The Maternal Factor-Two Paths to Morality<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Noddings Nel<br>
  Abstract: In this provocative new book, renowned educator and philosopher Nel Noddings extends her influential work on the ethics of care toward a compelling objective—global peace and justice. She asks: If we celebrate the success of women becoming more like men in professional life, should we not simultaneously hope that men become more like women—in caring for others, rejecting violence, and valuing the work of caring both publicly and personally? Drawing on current work on evolution, and bringing concrete examples from women’s lived experience to make a strong case for her position, Noddings answers this question by locating one source of morality in maternal instinct. She traces the development of the maternal instinct to natural caring and ethical caring, offering a preliminary sketch of what a care-driven concept of justice might look like. Finally, to advance the cause of caring, peace, and women’s advancement, Noddings urges women to abandon institutional, patriarchal religion and to seek their own paths to spirituality.<br>

  Abstract: Much work is being done today on the evolution of morality. Anthropologists, psychologists, evolution scientists, and philosophers are looking for the roots of altruism, empathy, solidarity, and cooperation.¹ Surprisingly, in seeking these roots, scholars rarely look at female experience. It may well be that one wide and increasingly influential approach to moral life—care ethics—can be traced to maternal instinct.<br>

  6  Partisan Historiography: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1ppj3r">Gatekeepers of the Arab Past</a><br>
  Abstract: After the outbreak of World War II and increasingly throughout the 1940s, Egyptian public life was radicalized. Parliamentary politics was viewed as detached from the country’s real problems, and politicians appeared as self-serving and corrupt. Successive governments rose and fell, and the existing political order began to lose both credibility and respect. Thus, the largest opposition group, the Muslim Brotherhood, openly challenged the state by murdering Prime Minister Maḥmūd Fahmī al-Nuqrāshī. The government responded in the same fashion and eliminated the brotherhood’s leader, Ḥasan al-Bannā. On a number of occasions the state brutally suppressed the communists. The popular anti-British struggle<br>

  Book Title: Tales of the Neighborhood-Jewish Narrative Dialogues in Late Antiquity<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Hasan-Rokem Galit<br>
  Abstract: In this lively and intellectually engaging book, Galit Hasan-Rokem shows that religion is shaped not only in the halls of theological disputation and institutions of divine study, but also in ordinary events of everyday life. Common aspects of human relations offer a major source for the symbols of religious texts and rituals of late antique Judaism as well as its partner in narrative dialogues, early Christianity, Hasan-Rokem argues. Focusing on the "neighborhood" of the Galilee that is the birthplace of many major religious and cultural developments, this book brings to life the riddles, parables, and folktales passed down in Rabbinic stories from the first half of the first millennium of the Common Era.<br>

  FIVE  Between Us: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pppfc">Tales of the Neighborhood</a><br>
  Abstract: The tales of the neighborhood that have been the focus of this book tell about the “neighborhood” of the Galilee in the first half of the first millennium of the Common Era. This neighborhood was at the time the birthing-ground for major religious and cultural formations that would prove consequential for many groups and peoples on a number of continents. Our entry into this milieu through the concept of a neighborhood has stressed small-scale processes, such as human relations and everyday life, rather than the major events of the period. The way religion and concrete details of reality are interwoven<br>

  Abstract: When blues legend Howlin’ Wolf sings, “Nature cause me to mess up my life,” we know how he feels.¹ Caught by the inevitable, yet never entirely blameless, a person trapped by “nature”—“bad-ass nature” in this case—will surely sing the blues. And yet, despite our instinctive respect for nature’s power, we rarely define what we mean by the term. Nature may mean a person’s individual nature, as it seems to for Howlin’ Wolf, or human nature in general. Alternatively, it may mean physical nature, the concrete world external to ourselves, or it may mean the nature of circumstances, the<br>

  CHAPTER 5  Baba Tatsui: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1ppt3b">Reconfiguring Modernity</a><br>
  Abstract: Torn between antinomies, the life of Baba Tatsui (1850–88) bears a Romantic aspect. Indeed, given Baba’s early, lonely death in a strange land (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), his biographers have seldom resisted the trope of Romantic tragedy in describing his turbulent career and sad demise. Nakae Chōmin’s touching reminiscence of his friend and fellow Jiyūtō (Liberal Party) member begins by evoking Baba’s death in the “Meriken” hospital.¹ Yasunaga Gōro starts his rather hagiographic narrative at Baba’s tall grave marker in the Woodlands Cemetery.² The opening pages of Hagihara Nobutoshi’s 1967 biography continue this convention, inviting the reader to imagine Baba’s almost<br>

  5  Conversion Narratives from:

  Author(s) Gooren Henri<br>
  Abstract: The emphasis in this chapter is on
                  howpeople tell the story of their conversion. I follow a historical and phenomenological approach to the conversion narrative, analyzing it as a social construction and not necessarily as a factual description of the main events in an individual’s life. A comprehensive conversion experience changes one’s self-image. This transformation, which is a process taking longer than just one day or one week, is gradually reflected in the most important indicator of conversion:biographical reconstruction.¹ People who undergo a conversion experience literally reconstruct their lives, giving new meanings to old events and putting different<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1ppx1q">Fighting Words</a><br>
  Author(s) Renard John<br>
  Abstract: Thomas Hobbes famously observed in his
                  Leviathanthat human life is “nasty, brutish, and short.” He and other influential philosophers have identified violence as virtually a “state of nature” that humankind has struggled endlessly to ameliorate, and with precious little success. Religious authors in every age and culture have likewise filled libraries with their analyses of the roots and remedies of this scourge, this “mark of Cain.” Every credible religious or ethical system condemns murder, yet sacred texts claimed by adherents of most (if not all) religious traditions describe in often grisly detail how believers have had recourse to divinely<br>

  Abstract: Henry More, who had enormous influence on Isaac Newton (the latter’s idea of “absolute space” is, arguably, a tidied-up version of More’s “Infinite Immovable Extended”), found in René Descartes a much more recalcitrant thinker. Beneath the
                  politesseof their correspondence in the last year of Descartes’s life, one detects an abyss of difference opening up. They differ not just because More is a spiritualist and Descartes a materialist but, more crucial, because of their variant views on extension—which, by the middle of the seventeenth century, had become the key to the nature of space. It is revealing that already<br>

  Book Title: The Wherewithal of Life-Ethics, Migration, and the Question of Well-Being<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Ouédraogo Ibrahim<br>
  Abstract: The Wherewithal of Lifeengages with current developments in the anthropology of ethics and migration studies to explore in empirical depth and detail the life experiences of three young men - a Ugandan migrant in Copenhagen, a Burkina Faso migrant in Amsterdam, and a Mexican migrant in Boston - in ways that significantly broaden our understanding of the existential situations and ethical dilemmas of those migrating from the global south. Michael Jackson offers the first biographically based phenomenological account of migration and mobility, providing new insights into the various motives, tactics, dilemmas, dreams, and disappointments that characterize contemporary migration. It is argued that the quandaries of African or Mexican migrants are not unique to people moving between 'traditional' and 'modern' worlds. While more intensely felt by the young, seeking to find a way out of a world of limited opportunity and circumscribed values, the experiences of transition are familiar to us all, whatever our age, gender, ethnicity or social status - namely, the impossibility of calculating what one may lose in leaving a settled life or home place; what one may gain by risking oneself in an alien environment; the difficulty of striking a balance between personal fulfillment and the moral claims of kinship; and the struggle to know the difference between 'concrete' and 'abstract' utopias (the first reasonable and worth pursuing; the second hopelessly unattainable).<br>

  Explorations and Encounters: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.20851/j.ctt1sq5wjr">Explorations and Encounters in French</a><br>
  Author(s) MROWA-HOPKINS COLETTE<br>
  Abstract: The theme of exploration requires little explanation in terms of its relevance to the constant strivings of human life and, by extension, to the activities of learning and scholarship; indeed, with its corollary of the journey, it underlines, as do writings since time immemorial, including many a school motto, the intimate relationship between seeking and discovering; striving and finding; quest and knowledge. The title of this volume —
                  Explorations and Encounters in French— can therefore be seen as self-evident, announcing as it does its essentially investigative nature and its position within a field of study. However, if the title<br>

  Author(s) Edwards Natalie<br>
  Abstract: Why would a writer publish a text that seemingly undoes the literary innovation of her life's work? Annie Ernaux has achieved fame by writing short, pithy narratives that recount isolated autobiographical moments. Rather than recounting events and extrapolating their meaning to her life within an autobiographical text, such as Michel de Montaigne falling off a horse, Jean-Jacques Rousseau stealing a ribbon, or André Gide travelling to North Africa, Ernaux chooses a specific incident — a love relationship, an abortion, a scene of domestic violence, for example — and describes this in sparse, unlyrical prose with no discussion of its consequences<br>

Color, design, beauty, creativity, and wonder are encapsulated—as best they can be—in words. And as best we can, we use our finite words to capture the infinite. Theology—faith seeking understanding—is most often articulated in language, words, sentences, grammar, structure, paragraphs, papers, and books. As a<br>

Animate movement advertises affects to other animate minds in the context of sharing a life together. In developing this account, Augustine makes liberal use of “life,” “nature,” and “animate movement,” but he does not unpack these concepts. It is here that Aristotle’s expertise recommends itself. My consideration of Aristotle is not intended to be of merely historical interest. As I detailed in the first chapter, I join a variety of thinkers, both analytic and continental, in<br>

  1  Folklore, Film, and Video: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt130hnq5">Documenting Ourselves</a><br>
  Abstract: The folklore documentaryis ubiquitous. In a world bombarded by visual images, most of us have become not only receivers of the image but its manipulators as well. We take photographs, produce home movies, and shoot videotape of life’s events. Often, these visual documents represent the realm of folklore: they record such events as birthday parties, weddings, ethnic gatherings, and religious occasions. At the same time, the films and videos we create reveal much about ustous and others.¹ As a folklorist, filmmaker, and videographer, I believe the use of film and video becomes a reflexive process of interpreting<br>

  3  The Death of the Father from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt130j86j">The Shriek of Silence</a><br>
  Abstract: The line of Jewish ancestry is matrilineal, since it is from the body of the mother that the human being is born into life. The mouth of the father, however, transmits the word that sustains life—transmits it from mouth to mouth, not from mouth to ear. When handed down through tales, the word “belongs as much to the listener as to the teller,” Elie Wiesel has written. “You listen to a tale and all of a sudden it is no longer the same tale” (
                  Beggar107). The telling of the tale becomes part of the tale itself; or, as<br>

  Abstract: In
                  The Dialogic ImaginationMikhail Bakhtin argues that the novel “and the world represented in it enter the real world and enirch it, and the real world enters the work and its world as part of the process of its creation, as well as part of its subsequent life, in a continual renewing of the work through the creative perception of listeners and readers” (254). This statement describes what we have called a phenomenological approach to the novel as an event. Examining what occurs in the process of the novel’s creation, we deal not only with author and character but<br>

  1  Senses of Place: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt130jbjp">Passage to the Center</a><br>
  Abstract: In “Place, Pastness, Poems,” Seamus Heaney quotes this passage from T.S. Eliot’s “Little Gidding” to support his view that in lieu of a cultural center the literary tradition is what links “the private experience of a poet to the usual life of the age.”¹ For Heaney, tradition allows the regional poet to affirm the centrality of local experience to his own being, but with the hope of making that experience accessible to readers from wholly different walks of life. Ideally, by raising private experience to the level of cultural expression, Heaney would have tradition transform personal memory into cultural memory.<br>

  9  Things Apparent and Transparent: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt130jbjp">Passage to the Center</a><br>
  Abstract: From the outset of his career, the calling of poet has required Heaney to embark on a quest for self-definition, a quest in which every imaginative return to origins precipitates a new journey outward whereby the poet’s art and identity are redefined and enlarged. Yet, despite Heaney’s seemingly inexhaustible ability to reinvent himself in his work, the original binding connection between poet and place remains constant. The evolution of his poetry, even as it comes to embrace a vision of art and life linked to emptiness, thus consistently exemplifies what he has more recently described as a “covenant between language<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt130jd70">Poetry Of Discovery</a><br>
  Abstract: Eladio Cabañero’s background differes considerably from those of the other major poets of his generation. Born and raised in the small town of Tomelloso, Cabañero worked as a laborer in his youth and was largely self-educated when he arrived in Madrid in his late twenties. His early poetry is affected by this background in two different ways. On the one hand it contains many references to farm life and village people and scenes; on the other it is marked by the use of carefully controlled forms and patterns, suggesting the poet’s conscious efforts to learn from and assimilate previous traditions,<br>

  Book Title: Whistling in the Dark-Memory and Culture in Wartime London<br>
  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Freedman Jean R.<br>
  Abstract: Jean Freedman interviewed more than fifty people who remember London during the war, focusing on under-represented groups, including women, Jews, and working-class citizens. In addition she examined original propaganda, secret government documents, wartime diaries, and postwar memoirs. Of particular significance to Freedman were the contemporary music, theater, film, speeches, and radio drama used by the British government to shape public opinion and impart political messages. Such bits of everyday life are mentioned in virtually every civilian's experience of wartime London but their interpretations of them often clashed with their government's intentions.<br>

  Book Title: The Creative Word-Canon as a Model for Biblical Education<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Erickson Amy<br>
  Abstract: Every faith community knows the challenges of inviting new members and the next generation into its shared life without falling into an arid traditionalism or a shallow relativism. Renowned scholar Walter Brueggemann finds a framework for education in the structure of the Hebrew Bible canon, with its assertion of center and limit (in the Torah), of challenge (in the Prophets), and of inquiry (in the Writings). Incorporating the best insights from his own career and from the fields of canonical criticism, Old Testament theology, and pedagogical theory, Brueggemann offers a vision of how the community can draw on the shape of Scripture to educate its members. First published in 1982, The Creative Word is now updated and introduced with a foreword by Amy Erickson of Iliff School of Theology.<br>

Among the favorite scenes for contemplation are the five chapters of the Bhāgavata Purāṇa that narrate the story of therāsa līlā, the dance Kṛṣṇa performs with his belovedgopīs. In this celebrated passage, Kṛṣṇa calls the cowmaidens to him with the sound of his flute.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13wzvhj">Tastes of the Divine: Hindu and Christian Theologies of Emotion</a><br>
  Abstract: Like Rūpa Gosvāmin, the medieval Christian theologian Bernard of Clairvaux (1090–1153) elevates love over all other emotions in the devotional life. He finds ample material for the devotional sentiment of love in the biblical Song of Songs. He writes no fewer than eighty-six sermons on the first chapters of this short book of Hebrew wisdom literature, which consists of a series of poetic exchanges between two lovers. Bernard ranks “reverence” and its attendant emotions of “horror or stupor or fear or wonder” (characteristic of
                  śāntain Rūpa’s system) far below the intimacy of love (Serm. 83.3).¹ For him, nuptial<br>

  Abstract: There is no inherent reason that European philosophical traditions must govern Christian theology across the globe. The cultures of Asia, Africa, and South America, where the majority of Christians now live, offer categories for imagining the life of faith, not only for local or indigenous theologies but for the theological “mainstream” as well. As an aesthetic perspective that relates contextual and bodily aspects of emotion to religious experience,

  Abstract: In 2010 the National Gallery of London and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., organized an exhibition on seventeenth-century Spanish painting and sculpture under the name
                  The Sacred Made Real: Spanish Painting and Sculpture 1600–1700. The exhibition curators sought to show how the realism of the paintings of Velázquez, Ribalta, Zurbarán, and others had its roots in the artists’ sculptural approach to rendering figures and scenes in a two-dimensional medium. In turn, the painted, polychromed religious sculptures of the era represented real life—the real life of Christ, Mary, and the saints, that is. The most popular<br>

  Abstract: What is it to hear with Christian ears, to see with Christian eyes, to touch with Christian hands? It would be, first of all, to live in a full, rich interpretation of the first epistle of John, to live in response to “the life” that “was manifested” (1 John 1:2), that “was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled” (1 John 1:1).¹ It would be a matter of “bear[ing] witness” to that life, of showing others “that eternal life, which was with the<br>

  Abstract: It is
                  bad timingfor the global economic system to enter a self-feeding black hole—at least from the perspective of “climate change.” The economic implosions of the credit collapse have, essentially, foreclosed any geopolitical will to address the gathering indicators of ecocatastrophic logics, had that ever been plausible. The interplay between the economic and ecological, the “eco-eco” disaster, tends to occlude the exponential curves of issues that lie outside the screen—collapsing marine life, mass extinction events, “peak” everything (oil, humans, water …), projections of “population culling,” and so on.

  Abstract: Autobiographical works such as Augustine’s
                  Confessionsare the very foundation of Catholic Studies.¹ Even a cursory look at the footnotes in the comprehensive histories of American Catholicism published since the 1950s reveals how deeply our understanding of the evolution of Catholic life in North America is grounded inlife-writings, an elastic term for personal narratives presented in a variety of genres and formats, from travel narratives and traditional memoirs to autobiographical fiction and specialized hybrids (conversion and departure narratives, “Why I am a Catholic” books, and so on). Life-writings are pervasive and various, yet they are frequently neglected as a<br>

  Author(s) O’DONNELL MARY ELLEN<br>
  Abstract: “Just as we reject the principle of divorcing faith and works, so we reject the principle and the practice of divorcing the life of faith and the life of study,” wrote Father Leo Ward of the University of Notre Dame in 1961.¹ Describing the ideal for the Catholic school, Ward’s rejection invites reflection on Catholic intellectual life. However, this comment, which might galvanize Catholic professors who perceive themselves as exemplars of the ideal, might also solicit quite a different reaction from those outside the professionally academic arena. The public perception of Catholicism does not always incline toward a scholastic tradition.<br>

  Abstract: In the question concerning the necessity of grace from Aquinas’s

  Book Title: Veiled Desires: Intimate Portrayals of Nuns in Postwar Anglo-American Film-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SABINE MAUREEN<br>
  Abstract: A provocative, interdisciplinary study of nuns on the big screen, from The Bells of St. Mary's (1945) to Doubt (2008), that shines fresh light on the cinematic nun as a woman and a religious in the twentieth century. Ingrid Bergman's engaging screen performance as Sister Mary Benedict in The Bells of St. Mary's made the film nun a star and her character a shining standard of comparison. She represented the religious life as the happy and rewarding choice of a modern woman who had a "complete understanding" of both erotic and spiritual desire. How did this vibrant and mature nun figure come to be viewed as girlish and naive? Why have she and her cinematic sisters in postwar popular film so often been stereotyped or selectively analyzed, so seldom been seen as women and religious? In Veiled Desires--a unique full-length, in-depth study of nuns in film--Maureen Sabine explores these questions in a groundbreaking interdisciplinary study covering more than sixty years of cinema. She looks at an impressive breadth of films in which the nun features as an ardent lead character, including The Bells of St. Mary's (1945), Black Narcissus (1947), Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison (1957), Sea Wife (1957), The Nun's Story (1959), The Sound of Music (1965), Change of Habit (1969), In This House of Brede (1975), Agnes of God (1985), Dead Man Walking (1995), and Doubt (2008). Veiled Desires considers how the beautiful and charismatic stars who play chaste nuns, from Ingrid Bergman and Audrey Hepburn to Susan Sarandon and Meryl Streep, call attention to desires that the veil concealed and the habit was thought to stifle. In a theologically and psychoanalytically informed argument, Sabine responds to the critics who have pigeonholed the film nun as the obedient daughter and religious handmaiden of a patriarchal church, and the respectful audience who revered her as an icon of spiritual perfection. She provides a framework for a more complex and holistic picture of nuns on screen by showing how the films dramatize these women's Christian call to serve, sacrifice, and dedicate themselves to God, and their erotic desire for intimacy, agency, achievement, and fulfillment.<br>

  Abstract: When Audrey Hepburn appeared on-screen in 1959, looking immaculate in a black-and-white habit, the nun was still a figure veiled in mystique. This mystique derived its power from the traditional religious view that she “binds herself to

  Abstract: In the five previous chapters, I have explored the range and complexity of the desires that nuns unveil on-screen and shown how these subvert one view of religious life voiced by Sister Luke, that “a nun is not a person who wishes or desires.” While traditional nuns regard the selfless surrender to God in agape as their supreme purpose, they paradoxically allude to the desires associated with eros when they acknowledge that “this letting go” of the self can awaken “the deepest yearnings of the human heart” (Donovan and Wusinich 2009: 28).

  Book Title: The Phenomenology of Prayer-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): WIRZBA NORMAN<br>
  Abstract: This collection of ground-breaking essays considers the many dimensions of prayer: how prayer relates us to the divine; prayer's ability to reveal what is essential about our humanity; the power of prayer to transform human desire and action; and the relation of prayer to cognition. It takes up the meaning of prayer from within a uniquely phenomenological point of view, demonstrating that the phenomenology of prayer is as much about the character and boundaries of phenomenological analysis as it is about the heart of religious life.The contributors: Michael F. Andrews, Bruce Ellis Benson, Mark Cauchi, Benjamin Crowe, Mark Gedney, Philip Goodchild, Christina M. Gschwandtner, Lissa McCullough, Cleo McNelly Kearns, Edward F. Mooney, B. Keith Putt, Jill Robbins, Brian Treanor, Merold Westphal, Norman Wirzba, Terence Wright and Terence and James R. Mensch. Bruce Ellis Benson is Associate Professor of Philosophy at Wheaton College. He is the author of Graven Ideologies: Nietzsche, Derrida, and Marion on Modern Idolatry and The Improvisation of Musical Dialogue: A Phenomenology of Music. Norman Wirzba is Associate Professor and Chair of the Philosophy Department at Georgetown College, Kentucky. He is the author of The Paradise of God and editor of The Essential Agrarian Reader.<br>

  Abstract: How could there be a vibrant religious life without the practice of prayer? In both theistic and nontheistic traditions, religious followers are generally counseled to steadfast prayer—to pray “without ceasing.” Without prayer, religious sensibility would likely atrophy and perhaps die.

  Abstract: In

Irigaray goes on to warn that “a religion centered on speech, without the insistence on breathing and the silence that makes it possible, risks supporting a non-respect for life” (51).

One could picture Cerberus, in the antique representations of hell, guarding the entry to the netherworld, or Horus, in Egyptian mythology, weighing the good and bad actions as they are presented to him by those newly arrived, as figures of radical hospitality, since they are the ones that separate the living from the dead.

  Abstract: At first glance, it might appear that the title of this chapter brings together two mutually exclusive themes. Asceticism, conventionally understood, implies rigorous discipline of body and mind, the adoption of an austere lifestyle, which can lead to the abrogation of desire, expressed as denial and mortification. Eroticism, by contrast, entails the sense of ecstatic rapture that ensues from inspirited indulgence in bodily matters and the full embrace of the sensual. In the case of both, there is a confluence of life and death, albeit from opposite ends of the spectrum: Asceticism promotes the negation of life in the simulation<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapter I asserted that Derrida’s
                     Le toucher, Jean-Luc Nancyis an extremely odd or exceptional work of mourning. It mourns someone who is not yet dead, since Nancy survived his heart transplant operation to persist in what might be called a posthumous life. This has lasted down to the day I am writing this. For this I rejoice. Nancy has survived Derrida’s death to write more about Derrida. As I showed, he is having the last word about matters on which they did not quite agree, now that Derrida cannot answer back.<br>

  Author(s) Schwartz Regina Mara<br>
  Abstract: What is the relation of theology to politics? Of revelation to revolution? To approach this question, I want to turn not to the constitution of the subject (Alain Badiou’s preoccupation) or to the constitution of the community (Paul’s preoccupation), because in the end these entities are not sufficient to achieve the robust political ends imagined for them. Instead, I want to turn to the question of justice (the preoccupation of the Hebrew Bible), for the infusion of this ethical concern is vital: political life must be lived under the horizon of justice.

  Abstract: In accordance with both Christian tradition and his vision of phenomenology, Marion answers the question of how God might enter into human thought in terms of the gift. For Marion there is an essential coherence, if not a correlation, between what takes place at the outer limits of thought and what theology identifies as the inbreaking of God in human life.

  Book Title: Regard for the Other: Autothanatography in Rousseau, De Quincey, Baudelaire, and Wilde-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burt E. S.<br>
  Abstract: Although much has been written on autobiography, the same cannot be said of autothanatography, the writing of one's death. This study starts from the deconstructive premise that autobiography is aporetic, not or not only a matter of a subject strategizing with language to produce an exemplary identity but a matter also of its responding to an exorbitant call to write its death. The I-dominated representations of particular others and of the privileged other to whom a work is addressed, must therefore be set against an alterity plaguing the I from within or shadowing it from without. This alterity makes itself known in writing as the potential of the text to carry messages that remain secret to the confessing subject. Anticipation of the potential for the confessional text to say what Augustine calls the secret I do not know,the secret of death, engages the autothanatographical subject in a dynamic, inventive, and open-ended process of identification. The subject presented in these texts is not one that has already evolved an interior life that it seeks to reveal to others, but one that speaks to us as still in process. Through its exorbitant response, it gives intimations of an interiority and an ethical existence to come. Baudelaire emerges as a central figure for this understanding of autobiography as autothanatography through his critique of the narcissism of a certain Rousseau, his translation of De Quincey's confessions, with their vertiginously ungrounded subject-in-construction, his artistic practice of self-conscious, thorough-going doubleness, and his service to Wilde as model for an aporetic secrecy. The author discusses the interruption of narrative that must be central to the writing of one's death and addresses the I's dealings with the aporias of such structuring principles as secrecy, Levinasian hospitality, or interiorization as translation. The book makes a strong intervention in the debate over one of the most-read genres of our time.<br>

  INTRODUCTION. from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x02w0">Regard for the Other: Autothanatography in Rousseau, De Quincey, Baudelaire, and Wilde</a><br>
  Abstract: In the numerous studies that have been devoted to autobiography in the past 30 years, surprisingly few take on directly the question of the other. The reason for the surprise is simple enough: One can hardly envision the self without the other against which it is defined or an autobiography that does not involve the other both in its narrative and as the one to whom the “I’’ addresses itself in its act of confessing. In representing itself, the I must not only represent the others encountered in life, but must also address that representation to another. What is more,<br>

The negative motivation for this turn is a critique of moral theory. Two elements of this critique strike me as especially forceful. First, moral theory depends on arguments that do not persuade those outside the hermeneutic circle within which the arguments occur.

  Abstract: Among the most challenging issues facing environmental hermeneutics is how to think about person-world relationships in an integrated manner—not by way of conceptually separated natural environments and social spheres—as if there were either some “pure nature” untouched by our interpretations and actions or any human life apart from environmental dynamics. Rather, the interactions of the physiochemical and biological, the individuating and communal dimensions—at all scales—provide our subject matter. For instance, it makes little sense to carry on studying “sense of place” and “identity” as we have been, assuming that these phenomena are stable and that the<br>

  CHAPTER 7  Environmental Hermeneutics with and for Others: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x04rw">Interpreting Nature: The Emerging Field of Environmental Hermeneutics</a><br>
  Author(s) Bell Nathan M.<br>
  Abstract: Narrative identity has been a significant area of focus in environmental hermeneutics. This concept of identity builds on Paul Ricoeur’s formulation of the ethical intention of the self: “
                  aiming at the ‘good life’ with and for others, in just institutions.”¹ While Ricoeur’s ethical intention has come up in relation to environmental identity, a full formulation of an environmentally focused version of it has not yet been developed. My intention in this essay is to examine Ricoeur’s ethic as it applies to environmental ethics and philosophy. This application is a fresh way to address several major issues of environmental philosophy, while<br>

  Author(s) Byrne Patrick H.<br>
  Abstract: It is daunting to be asked to communicate why Bernard Lonergan is such an important thinker. The magnitude of his achievement is great, and I owe a great personal debt for all that I have learned from him. Over the course of his life, Lonergan wrote extensively and profoundly about an amazing range of topics—painting and music; economics and politics; epistemology, metaphysics, and ethics; quantum mechanics and relativity theory; statistics and evolution; sexuality and marriage; logic, ordinary language, and symbolic meaning; religion and feelings; common sense; the theory of history; sin, grace, and the theology of the Christian doctrines<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x04wz">Finding God in All Things: Celebrating Bernard Lonergan, John Courtney Murray, and Karl Rahner</a><br>
  Author(s) Murray Elizabeth A.<br>
  Abstract: Bernard Lonergan is counted among the major Catholic thinkers of the twentieth century. His contribution to philosophy with his major work,
                     Insight, and to theology with his crowning achievement,Method in Theology, has been widely recognized at international conferences and is evidenced by a growing body of scholarly publications. Some consider Lonergan to be primarily a philosopher; more consider him to be a theologian. There is also growing interest in his economic manuscripts, the fruit of his life-long avocation. Yet, he himself once remarked: “Fortunately, I don’t think I come under any single label.”²<br>

  Author(s) Hughson Thomas<br>
  Abstract: Catholics and other Christians most likely know John Courtney Murray as a protagonist in the production of the Declaration on Religious Freedom at the Second Vatican Council, published almost forty years ago. Its significance for the public life of Catholicism in religiously pluralist societies remains hard to overestimate. Social ethics, fundamental theology, practical theology, public theology, and communications are theological specialties that also have found substance in his writings.<br>

  Author(s) Egan Harvey D.<br>
  Abstract: “Strengthened by the Church’s sacrament and accompanied by the prayers of his Jesuit brothers, shortly after completing his eightieth year, Father Karl Rahner has gone home to God. He had loved the Church and his religious order and spent himself in their service.” So read part of the official Jesuit announcement of the death of Father Karl Rahner, S.J., on March 30, 1984. With his death, the Catholic Church lost one of her most loyal sons. Although well known for his controversial reinterpretations of the Christian tradition and for his criticisms of much in the Church’s practical life, Rahner always<br>

  Author(s) Stagaman David<br>
  Abstract: It was a pleasure to collect and assemble with Mark Bosco these centenary essays on Bernard Lonergan, John Courtney Murray, and Karl Rahner. Reading through them, I was reminded how much these three Jesuit theologians influenced my young Jesuit life both intellectually and spiritually. In my own contribution, the reader will learn where this influence most deeply touched me, especially as someone fully engaged in teaching and research in theology over the last thirty years. To set the context for my remarks, I will begin by examining the contribution of the father of Transcendental Thomism, Joseph Maréchal, for it is<br>

  Book Title: Translating Investments: Metaphor and the Dynamics of Cultural Change in Tudor-Stuart England-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: The title Translating Investments, a manifold pun, refers to metaphor and clothing, authority and interest, and trading and finance. Translation, Latin translatio, is historically a name for metaphor, and investment, etymologically a reference to clothing, participates both in the complex symbolism of early modern dress and in the cloth trade of the period. In this original and wide-ranging book, Judith Anderson studies the functioning of metaphor as a constructive force within language, religious doctrine and politics, literature, rhetoric, and economics during the reigns of the Tudors and early Stuarts. Invoking a provocative metaphorical concept from Andy Clark's version of cognitive science, she construes metaphor itself as a form of scaffolding fundamental to human culture. A more traditional and controversial conception of such scaffolding is known as sublation-Hegel's Aufhebung, or raising,as the philosophers Jacques Derrida and Paul Ricoeur have understood this term. Metaphor is the agent of raising, or sublation, and sublation is inseparable from the productive life of metaphor, as distinct in its death in code or clich. At the same time, metaphor embodies the sense both of partial loss and of continuity, or preservation, also conveyed by the term Aufhebung. Anderson's study is simultaneously critical and historical. History and the theory are shown to be mutually enlightening, as are a wide variety of early modern texts and their specific cultural contexts. From beginning to end, this study touches the present, engaging questions about language, rhetoric, and reading within post-structuralism and neo-cognitivism. It highlights connections between intellectual problems active in our own culture and those evident in the earlier texts, controversies, and crises Anderson analyzes. In this way, the study is bifocal, like metaphor itself. While Anderson's overarching concern is with metaphor as a creative exchange, a source of code-breaking conceptual power, each of her chapters focuses on a different but related issue and cultural sector. Foci include the basic conditions of linguistic meaning in the early modern period, instantiated by Shakespeare's plays and related to modern theories of metaphor; the role of metaphor in the words of eucharistic institution under Archbishop Cranmer; the play of metaphor and metonymy in the writings of Luther, Zwingli, and Calvin and in John Donne's Devotions; the manipulation of these two tropes in the politics of the controversy over ecclesiastical vestments and in its treatment by John Foxe; the abuse of figuration in the house of Edmund Spenser's Busirane, where catachresis, an extreme form of metaphor, is the trope du jour; the conception of metaphor in the Roman rhetorics and their legacy in the sixteenth century; and the concept of exchange in the economic writing of Gerrard de Malynes, merchant and metaphorist in the reigns of Elizabeth and James. What emerges at the end of this book is a heightened critical sense of the dynamic of metaphor in cultural history.<br>

  Book Title: Debates in Continental Philosophy: Conversations with Contemporary Thinkers-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): KEARNEY RICHARD<br>
  Abstract: This important book brings together in one volume a collection of illuminating encounters with some of the most important philosophers of our age-by one of its most incisive and innovative critics.For more than twenty years, Richard Kearney has been in conversation with leading philosophers, literary theorists, anthropologists, and religious scholars. His gift is eliciting memorably clear statements about their work from thinkers whose writings can often be challenging in their complexity. Here, he brings together twenty-one originally published extraordinary conversations-his 1984 collection Dialogues: The Phenomenological Heritage, his 1992 Visions of Europe: Conversations on the Legacy and Future of Europe, and his 1995 States of Mind: Dialogues with Contemporary Thinkers. Featured interviewees include Stanislas Breton, Umberto Eco, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Herbert Marcus, George Steiner, Julia Kristeva, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jean-Fran?ois Lyotard. To this classic core, he adds recent interviews, previously unpublished, with Paul Ricoeur, Jean-Luc Marion, Jacques Derrida, and George DumZzil, as well as six colloquies about his own work.Wide-ranging and accessible, these interviews provide a fascinating guide to the ideas, concerns, and personalities of thinkers who have shaped modern intellec-tual life. This book will be an essential point of entry for students, teachers, scholars, and anyone seeking to understand contemporary culture.ContentsPrefacePart One: Recent DebatesJacques Derrida: Terror, Religion, and the New PoliticsJean-Luc Marion: The Hermeneutics of RevelationPaul Ricour: (a) On Life Stories (b) On The Crisis of Authority (c) The Power of the Possible (d) Imagination, Testimony, and TrustGeorges Dumzil: Myth, Ideology, SovereigntyPart Two: From Dialogues: The Phenomenological Heritage, 1984Emmanuel Levinas: Ethics of the InfiniteHerbert Marcuse: The Philosophy of Art and PoliticsPaul Ricour: (a) The Creativity of Language (b) Myth as the Bearer of Possible WorldsStanislas Breton: Being, God, and the Poetics of RelationJacques Derrida: Deconstruction and the OtherPart Three: From States of Mind, 1995Julia Kristeva: Strangers to Ourselves: The Hope of the SingularHans Georg Gadamer: Text MattersJean-Franois Lyotard: What Is Just?George Steiner: Culture-The Price You PayPaul Ricour: Universality and the Power of DifferenceUmberto Eco: Chaosmos: The Return to the Middle AgesPart Four: Colloquies with Richard KearneyVillanova Colloquy: Against OmnipotenceAthens Colloquy: Between Selves and OthersHalifax Colloquy: Between Being and God Stony Brook Colloquy: Confronting ImaginationBoston Colloquy: Theorizing the GiftDublin Colloquy: Thinking Is DangerousAppendix: Philosophy as Dialogue<br>

  Book Title: Debates in Continental Philosophy: Conversations with Contemporary Thinkers-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): KEARNEY RICHARD<br>
  Abstract: This important book brings together in one volume a collection of illuminating encounters with some of the most important philosophers of our age-by one of its most incisive and innovative critics.For more than twenty years, Richard Kearney has been in conversation with leading philosophers, literary theorists, anthropologists, and religious scholars. His gift is eliciting memorably clear statements about their work from thinkers whose writings can often be challenging in their complexity. Here, he brings together twenty-one originally published extraordinary conversations-his 1984 collection Dialogues: The Phenomenological Heritage, his 1992 Visions of Europe: Conversations on the Legacy and Future of Europe, and his 1995 States of Mind: Dialogues with Contemporary Thinkers. Featured interviewees include Stanislas Breton, Umberto Eco, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Herbert Marcus, George Steiner, Julia Kristeva, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jean-Fran?ois Lyotard. To this classic core, he adds recent interviews, previously unpublished, with Paul Ricoeur, Jean-Luc Marion, Jacques Derrida, and George DumZzil, as well as six colloquies about his own work.Wide-ranging and accessible, these interviews provide a fascinating guide to the ideas, concerns, and personalities of thinkers who have shaped modern intellec-tual life.

  Author(s) de Lussy Florence<br>
  Abstract: Simone Weil provides an excellent case study of the problems of commitment (
                     engagement) in relation to French Catholic thought in the mid–twentieth century. Weil was a thoroughgoing intellectual for whom life and thought were inextricably linked. She was and is an uncomfortable figure. She lived her life as a kind of martyrdom, and she remains difficult to come to terms with even today.<br>

  Author(s) Davies Katherine<br>
  Abstract: Taking his cue from François Mauriac, literary critic Albert Thibaudet contemplated the currency of sincerity in a 1929 article for the
                  Nouvelle revue française. While stressing the polysemic nature of sincerity—its meaning slips and slides depending on the vocation and philosophical disposition of the subject—Thibaudet’s commentary was indicative of the imaginative space it occupied in French intellectual life.² As a hinge for literary debate, the notion of “sincerity toward oneself” crystallized in no small part around the figure of André Gide. His sincerity lay in the cultivation and celebration of the conflicting dimensions of the self, the total<br>

  Author(s) Dunlop Joseph<br>
  Abstract: Though a preeminent example of French intellectual culture, the influence of the
                  renouveau catholique—the early twentieth-century revival of French Catholic literature and thought—stretched out beyond metropolitan France and even francophone Europe to touch an island of European intellectual life in North America: Quebec. Perceiving themselves as part of a larger European intellectual milieu, young French Canadians seized upon the new ideas emerging from Catholic France to refashion their understanding of faith and its relationship to politics, culture, and society. One of the most important vehicles for this Catholic revival in Quebec was the Montreal-based periodicalLa Relève, founded<br>

  Author(s) LaCocque André<br>
  Abstract: In
                  Romance, She Wrote: A Hermeneutical Essay on Song of Songs,¹ I argue that the Song contains erotic descriptions that neither ask for nor require justification. In vivid contrast to the prophetic writings, in which eros is employed only in condemnation, it affirms, even revels in, sensual life. In fact, the Song’s eroticism is deliberately subversive in its challenge to the institutions of the Hellenistic era (ca. 333–175 bce), the probable time of its composition. I take it that the book’s author is a woman and that this female authorship adds to its polemical celebration of “free” love, that<br>

  Abstract: As is true of no other Scripture, I find myself compelled to return to the Song of Songs time and again. A return to a text as rich as this one can only be stimulating, for rereading is its own reward. And yet, coming back to the Song brings me something more—an infusion of joy. In afterlife, the Song has a formidable presence: It lingers in the present, gathering up the past of its origins and thus ensuring its own future. The Song is robustly alive in every rereading.<br>

  Abstract: When I think now of my introduction to the Song of Songs—at Jewish summer camp, at fifteen, when they were looking for volunteers to chant it—I can’t decide whether to emphasize that it was a fluke or one of those moments in life for which we Ashkenazic Jewish reserve the untranslatable Yiddish word

  Book Title: Believing Scholars: Ten Catholic Intellectuals-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burrell David B.<br>
  Abstract: How do Catholic intellectuals draw on faith in their work? And how does their work as scholars influence their lives as people of faith?For more than a generation, the University of Dayton has invited a prominent Catholic intellectual to present the annual Marianist Award Lecture on the general theme of the encounter of faith and profession. Over the years, the lectures have become central to the Catholic conversation about church, culture, and society.In this book, ten leading figures explore the connections in their own lives between the private realms of faith and their public calling as teachers, scholars, and intellectuals.This last decade of Marianist Lectures brings together theologians and philosophers, historians, anthropologists, academic scholars, and lay intellectuals and critics.Here are Avery Cardinal Dulles, S.J., on the tensions between faith and theology in his career; Jill Ker Conway on the spiritual dimensions of memory and personal narrative; Mary Ann Glendon on the roots of human rights in Catholic social teaching; Mary Douglas on the fruitful dialogue between religion and anthropology in her own life; Peter Steinfels on what it really means to be a liberal Catholic; and Margaret O'Brien Steinfels on the complicated history of women in today's church. From Charles Taylor and David Tracy on the fractured relationship between Catholicism and modernity to Gustavo Gutirrez on the enduring call of the poor and Marcia Colish on the historic links between the church and intellectual freedom, these essays track a decade of provocative, illuminating, and essential thought. James L. Heft, S.M., is President and Founding Director of the Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies and University Professor of Faith and Culture and Chancellor, University of Dayton.

  Abstract: If a woman told the truth about her life, “the world would split open,” the poet Muriel Rukeyser observed.¹ This was gospel for the earliest feminist theologians. Mary Daly gave this now classic explanation, “In hearing and naming ourselves out of the depths, women are naming toward God.”² Or, to paraphrase the playwright Ntozake Shange, as feminist theologians working in the late 1970s and ’80s sometimes did, women found God in themselves and “loved her fiercely.”³ When women told what they had undergone, what had sustained them, oppressed them, and set them free, how they had endured and survived, what<br>

  Book Title: Political Theologies: Public Religions in a Post-Secular World-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SULLIVAN LAWRENCE E.<br>
  Abstract: What has happened to religion in its present manifestations? In recent years, Enlightenment secularization, as it appeared in the global spread of political structures that relegate the sacred to a private sphere, seems suddenly to have foundered. Unexpectedly, it has discovered its own parochialism-has discovered, indeed, that secularization may never have taken place at all.With the return of the religious,in all aspects of contemporary social, political, and religious life, the question of political theology-of the relation between politicaland religiousdomains-takes on new meaning and new urgency. In this groundbreaking book, distinguished scholars from many disciplines-philosophy, political theory, anthropology, classics, and religious studies-seek to take the full measure of this question in today's world. This book begins with the place of the gods in the Greek polis, then moves through Augustine's two cities and early modern religious debates, to classic statements about political theology by such thinkers as Walter Benjamin and Carl Schmitt. Essays also consider the centrality of tolerance to liberal democracy, the recent French controversy over wearing the Muslim headscarf, and Bush's God talk.The volume includes a historic discussion between Jrgen Habermas and Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI, concerningthe prepolitical moral foundations of a republic, and it concludes with explorations of new, more open ways of conceptualizing society.<br>

  Abstract: In modern society there is typically a multiplicity of religious beliefs and identities, and—so we are told—they can be held together only by a formal separation between religious belonging and political status, and by the allocation of religious belief to the private sphere. To be fully part of a democratic community, citizens holding different religious beliefs (or none) must share values that enable them to have a common political life. These values reflect the unity of the state that represents them. Without shared values there can be no integration, without integration no political stability, without some measure of<br>

  Author(s) Asad Talal<br>
  Abstract: In modern society there is typically a multiplicity of religious beliefs and identities, and—so we are told—they can be held together only by a formal separation between religious belonging and political status, and by the allocation of religious belief to the private sphere. To be fully part of a democratic community, citizens holding different religious beliefs (or none) must share values that enable them to have a common political life. These values reflect the unity of the state that represents them. Without shared values there can be no integration, without integration no political stability, without some measure of<br>

  Book Title: Political Theologies: Public Religions in a Post-Secular World-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SULLIVAN LAWRENCE E.<br>
  Abstract: What has happened to religion in its present manifestations? In recent years, Enlightenment secularization, as it appeared in the global spread of political structures that relegate the sacred to a private sphere, seems suddenly to have foundered. Unexpectedly, it has discovered its own parochialism-has discovered, indeed, that secularization may never have taken place at all.With the return of the religious,in all aspects of contemporary social, political, and religious life, the question of political theology-of the relation between politicaland religiousdomains-takes on new meaning and new urgency. In this groundbreaking book, distinguished scholars from many disciplines-philosophy, political theory, anthropology, classics, and religious studies-seek to take the full measure of this question in today's world. This book begins with the place of the gods in the Greek polis, then moves through Augustine's two cities and early modern religious debates, to classic statements about political theology by such thinkers as Walter Benjamin and Carl Schmitt. Essays also consider the centrality of tolerance to liberal democracy, the recent French controversy over wearing the Muslim headscarf, and Bush's God talk.The volume includes a historic discussion between Jrgen Habermas and Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI, concerningthe prepolitical moral foundations of a republic, and it concludes with explorations of new, more open ways of conceptualizing society.<br>

  Introduction: from:

  Author(s) de Vries Hent<br>
  Abstract: What has happened to “religion” in its present and increasingly public manifestation, propelled by global media, economic markets, and foreign policies as much as by resistance to them? How should we understand the worldwide tendencies toward the simultaneous homogenization
                  andpluralization of our social and cultural practices, that is to say, of our individual and shared forms and ways of life? To answer these questions, we must interrogate a complex and shifting semantic, axiological, and imaginative archive, whose historical origins and modern disseminations have pragmatic ramifications for burning contemporary issues of the political (le politique) and politics (la politique), of<br>

  Prepolitical Moral Foundations of a Free Republic from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x06k8">Political Theologies: Public Religions in a Post-Secular World</a><br>
  Author(s) Nguyen Anh<br>
  Abstract: In the acceleration of the tempo of historical developments in which we live, two factors, it seems to me, stand out above all others as characteristics of a development that, earlier, began only slowly. The first is the formation of a world society in which individual political, economic, and cultural powers depend, more and more, on each other, and come into contact and permeate each other in their different spheres of life. The other is the development of man’s possibilities, of his power to make and to destroy, possibilities that, exceeding everything to which we have previously been accustomed, raise<br>

  Bush’s God Talk from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x06k8">Political Theologies: Public Religions in a Post-Secular World</a><br>
  Author(s) Lincoln Bruce<br>
  Abstract: Most discussions of George W. Bush’s religious faith draw heavily on his campaign autobiography,
                  A Charge to Keep: My Journey to the White House(1999), which puts religion at the beginning, middle, and end of the story.¹ Deliberately vague in its chronology, the book describes a man who drifted until middle age, when Billy Graham “planted a mustard seed” in his soul and helped turn his life around.² Modifying the conventions of conversion narratives, the book acknowledges Bush’s youthful indiscretions but downplays the nature and severity of his sins. It does not single out one decisive, born-again moment, but describes<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x06n9">Passing on the Faith: Transforming Traditions for the Next Generation of Jews, Christians, and Muslims</a><br>
  Author(s) Smith Christian<br>
  Abstract: All human communities face the general challenge of social reproduction—that is, socializing subsequent generations to carry on community identities and practices. Meeting this challenge successfully requires effective practices of socialization, identity formation, role modeling, intergenerational transference of authority, and so on. Many other factors, however, typically play into the success or breakdown of social reproduction, including competing institutional demands and changing social environmental conditions that make passing on a collective way of life over time more or less difficult. Religious communities are only one among many types of human communities that face this general challenge of reproducing themselves in<br>

  Abstract: Organized religion in the United States is on the threshold of a seismic shift. Today, religious and community leaders are witnessing a crisis in the transmission of religious memory, practice, and tradition to the next generation. In major urban centers across the United States, there is a generalized perception that individuals in their twenties and early thirties constitute a “black hole” in congregational life. Members of the young-adult population are simply missing from most churches, synagogues, and mosques. Religious and community leaders are given to lamenting about the throngs of young people who are “spiritual but not religious” as a<br>

  Abstract: The dialogues that take place among organized religions matter less than the dialogue, such as it may be, that each religion has with the institutions and attitudes of international secularism. Within the life of any organized religion, those most exposed to secular institutions and most imbued with secular attitudes are likely to be young adults, some of whom will be making their way from the more or less religious homes of their youth into the larger culture in which they will make lives and homes of their own. Therein lies the originality and relevance of an encounter drawing together bona<br>

  Book Title: Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness traces the reflections of the French philosopher and musicologist Vladimir Jankelevitch on the conditions and temporality of forgiveness in relation to creation, history, and memory. The author demonstrates the influence of Jewish and Christian thought on Jankelevitch's philosophy and compares his ideas about the gift character of forgiveness, the role of retributive emotions in conceptions of justice, and the limits of reason with those of Aristotle, Butler, Kant, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Scheler, Arendt, Derrida, Levinas, and Ricoeur. The Shoah was the pivotal historical event in Jankelevitch's life. As this book shows, Jankelevitch's question "Is forgiveness possible as a response to evil?" remains a potent philosophical conundrum today. Paradoxically, for Jankelevitch, evil is both the impetus and the obstacle to forgiveness.<br>

  Abstract: For Vladimir Jankélévitch, the protest against forgetting that which is irrevocable is not merely an intellectual endeavor. It entails the emotive and passionate task of justice itself. Consequently, at the limits of passion, he conceives this protest as a duty to both values and to the individuals. Values, according to Jankélévitch, are not simply to be conceded with the cold eye of rationality; they rather form the lifeblood of ethical-emotional life. His assessment of ressentiment therefore shows that the ethical life is not dispassionate. To the contrary, justice, he explains, must be a love of justice and must include a<br>

  4  Translating Resentment from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x06pt">Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness</a><br>
  Abstract: For Vladimir Jankélévitch, the protest against forgetting that which is irrevocable is not merely an intellectual endeavor. It entails the emotive and passionate task of justice itself. Consequently, at the limits of passion, he conceives this protest as a duty to both values and to the individuals. Values, according to Jankélévitch, are not simply to be conceded with the cold eye of rationality; they rather form the lifeblood of ethical-emotional life. His assessment of ressentiment therefore shows that the ethical life is not dispassionate. To the contrary, justice, he explains, must be a love of justice and must include a<br>

  Book Title: Technologies of Life and Death: From Cloning to Capital Punishment-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Oliver Kelly<br>
  Abstract: The central aim of this book is to approach contemporary problems raised by technologies of life and death as ethical issues that call for a more nuanced approach than mainstream philosophy can provide. To do so, it draws on the recently published seminars of Jacques Derrida to analyze the extremes of birth and dying insofar as they are mediated by technologies of life and death. With an eye to reproductive technologies, it shows how a deconstructive approach can change the very terms of contemporary debates over technologies of life and death, from cloning to surrogate motherhood to capital punishment, particularly insofar as most current discussions assume some notion of a liberal individual. The ethical stakes in these debates are never far from political concerns such as enfranchisement, citizenship, oppression, racism, sexism, and the public policies that normalize them. Technologies of Life and Death thus provides pointers for rethinking dominant philosophical and popular assumptions about nature and nurture, chance and necessity, masculine and feminine, human and animal, and what it means to be a mother or a father. In part, the book seeks to disarticulate a tension between ethics and politics that runs through these issues in order to suggest a more ethical politics by turning the force of sovereign violence back against itself. In the end, it proposes that deconstructive ethics with a psychoanalytic supplement can provide a corrective for moral codes and political cliches that turn us into mere answering machines.<br>

  Abstract: If we interpret deconstruction as a form of translation as transference, we have moved into the territory of psychoanalysis. Indeed, if poetic majesty acts to unseat sovereign majesty through the cut that carries with it rebirth, as in the story of Little Red Riding Hood, then psychoanalysis may be the discourse best equipped for articulating the dynamics of this wound that is also a source of life. In other words, psychoanalysis may provide the tools with which to analyze the thorny relationship between violence and life, particularly through the concepts of death drive and sublimation.

  Book Title: Terms of the Political: Community, Immunity, Biopolitics-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Campbell Timothy<br>
  Abstract: Terms of the Political: Community, Immunity, Biopolitics presents a decade of thought about the origins and possibilities of political theory from one of contemporary Italy's most prolific and engaging political theorists, Roberto Esposito. He has coined a number of critical concepts in current debates about the past, present, and future of biopolitics-from his work on the implications of the etymological and philosophical kinship of community (communitas) and immunity (immunitas) to his theorizations of the impolitical and the impersonal. Taking on interlocutors from throughout the Western philosophical tradition, from Aristotle and Augustine to Weil, Arendt, Nancy, Foucault, and Agamben, Esposito announces the eclipse of a modern political lexicon-"freedom," "democracy," "sovereignty," and "law"-that, in its attempt to protect human life, has so often produced its opposite (violence, melancholy, and death). Terms of the Political calls for the opening of political thought toward a resignification of these and other operative terms-such as "community," "immunity," "biopolitics," and "the impersonal"-in ways that affirm rather than negate life. An invaluable introduction to the breadth and rigor of Esposito's thought, the book will also welcome readers already familiar with Esposito's characteristic skill in overturning and breaking open the language of politics.<br>

  Abstract: Never before has the notion of the person constituted such an indispensable point of reference for all philosophical, political, and juridical discourses that lay claim to the value of human life as such. Setting aside ideological and theoretical differences, not one of them casts doubt on the importance of the category of the person, which is the indisputable (and undisputed) premise of each perspective. This tacit convergence is especially evident in the contentious field of bioethics. Actually, though, the clash (however bitter) between secularists and Catholics hinges upon the precise moment in which a living being can be considered a<br>

In its place is the view that philosophy provides exceedingly clever and conflicting answers to puzzles that do not particularly relate to the conduct of life or the discovery of its profoundest meanings. Most of those puzzles have to do with the problems of the justification of beliefs, putting philosophy in an auxiliary relationship to the project of knowledge.

  Abstract: Though Dewey is frequently recalled primarily as an educational theorist, it would be better to remember him as a philosopher who located every aspect of his thought within the general problematic of the nature and purpose of the democratic life. Dewey’s theory of education is guided by his conception of what a democratic culture must be. Every political and educational theory reflects fundamental commitments about human nature and what constitutes a well-lived or meaningful life. In this essay, I intend to sketch a portrait of Dewey’s ideal of democratic culture and to discuss its bearings upon the role of the<br>

  Abstract: Among the thinkers of the past century who offer themselves to the future for its reflection, Santayana must stand out as a singular figure, one whose thought is dedicated to the overarching possibility of the spiritual life undertaken without religious faith or metaphysical dogma. Among the throngs that fill the philosophical bestiary of the twentieth century, Santayana may be the one genuine contemplative of note. The majority of doctrines dominant in the century have been directed either toward the goal of action (Marxism, pragmatism, existentialism) or the problem of knowledge, truth, and meaning (pragmaticism, positivism, analytic philosophy, phenomenology).

  Book Title: Malicious Objects, Anger Management, and the Question of Modern Literature-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kreienbrock Jörg<br>
  Abstract: Why do humans get angry with objects? Why is it that a malfunctioning computer, a broken tool, or a fallen glass causes an outbreak of fury? How is it possible to speak of an inanimate object's recalcitrance, obstinacy, or even malice? When things assume a will of their own and seem to act out against human desires and wishes rather than disappear into automatic, unconscious functionality, the breakdown is experienced not as something neutral but affectively--as rage or as outbursts of laughter. Such emotions are always psychosocial: public, rhetorically performed, and therefore irreducible to a "private" feeling. By investigating the minutest details of life among dysfunctional household items through the discourses of philosophy and science, as well as in literary works by Laurence Sterne, Jean Paul, Friedrich Theodor Vischer, and Heimito von Doderer, Kreienbrock reconsiders the modern bourgeois poetics that render things the way we know and suffer them.<br>

  Abstract: This study focuses on the obstinate obtrusiveness of what Martin Heidegger calls
                  Zeug, a recalcitrant term that so thoroughly defies translation that only colloquial terms give some handle on what Heidegger is after. Often translated by “equipment,” the term is probably better understood as the underlying stuff of everyday life,¹ the tools and equipment that are at one’s disposal. Malicious objects refuse to disappear into their automatic, unconscious functionality and instead remain stubbornly conspicuous. Endowed with agency, these cunning and perfidious intruders into the lifeworld of the subject seem to actively interrupt his or her intentions, unleashing anger and rage<br>

  Abstract: Around 1900, following Julius Robert Mayer’s research on the laws of thermodynamics and his later discovery of processes of ignition, the German chemist Wilhelm Ostwald developed a general theory of

It broadened and expanded the first two laws of thermodynamics, which state the conservation of energy and the general tendency toward entropy, beyond the realm of physics, mechanics, and chemistry to the life sciences and even the social sciences and the humanities, as the title “The Energetic Foundations of Cultural Studies” (Die energetischen Grundlagen der Kulturwissenschaft) from 1909 suggests.¹ Ostwald introduces a “classification of pure sciences”² that differentiates between<br>

  Abstract: In
                  On the Genealogy of Morals, Nietzsche describes Judeo-Christian morality as a result of the resentment of the weak who affirm themselves only by hating others: “Slave morality from the outset says No to what is ‘outside,’ what is ‘different,’ what is ‘not itself.’”¹ God in all His forms and the pious adherence to religion, philosophy, or science are the creations of weak wills who need something transcendent in order to justify and redeem earthly life. The master morality, on the other hand, is not so much the affirmation of difference or an embrace of others as a noble indifference<br>

  Abstract: I work my way through things by writing. So, whenever I read what others have written about my work, whenever what I have written is read back to me by others—never, of course, without a gloss—it is as if the inert pages of books and journals have come to life and begun to talk back to me (and sometimes even to bite back). It is as if something that is structurally private, written in solitude, my most secret thoughts, meant only for me and God—like Augustine confessing to God in writing, “

  ONE  MARCEL’S REFLECTIVE METHOD from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0ckp">Doing Philosophy Personally: Thinking about Metaphysics, Theism, and Antiblack Racism</a><br>
  Abstract: Gabriel Marcel’s theistic philosophy traditionally has been labeled as a form of religious existentialism. While this is an accurate description of Marcel’s philosophy, I prefer to describe his philosophy as a sort of
                  reflective method. This way of describing his philosophy allows us to trace it back to its Kantian transcendentalist roots. Once we recognize the Kantian transcendentalist roots of his reflective method, we can better appreciate why he performs a detailed examination of the meaningfulness of human existence through such detrimental, life-affirming, or life-altering events as the death of a loved one, religious faith, despair, communion, hope, and love:<br>

  Abstract: In an important article on the relation of Spenser’s late lyrics to
                  The Faerie Queene, Paul Alpers is especially concerned to defend Spenser’s Melibee, the kindly old shepherd destroyed in the sixth book by marauding brigands, from other readers’ charges of laziness, carelessness, or blindness. In terms of traditional morality, Alpers seeks to defend Melibee from the charge of imprudence in the style of his life. To this end he asserts Melibee’s “parity” in Book VI with Colin Clout, Spenser’s own pastoral persona, who invokes the celebrated vision of the Muses on Mount Acidale.¹ By “parity,” Alpers means that both<br>

  Abstract: In Shakespeare’s
                  Venus and Adonis, the switch from Venus as manhandler to Venus as the pathetic—some would say tragic—mourner over the body of dead Adonis has always been problematical. Although passion and grief are twinned conditions of want(ing), the shift in this poem from an aggressive, comic mode to a helpless, pathetic one proves larger than life and challenges credible mimesis and, otherwise put, human credibility. Or perhaps I should say balanced human credibility, since Venus’ behavior makes sense as an obsessive fixation transferred from hunger to loss. Yes, Venus is a goddess and a figure of myth<br>

  Book Title: Value and Values-Economics and Justice in an Age of Global Interdependence<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Hershock Peter D.<br>
  Abstract: The most pressing issues of the twenty-first century-climate change and persistent hunger in a world of food surpluses, to name only two-are not problems that can be solved from within individual disciplines, nation-states, or cultural perspectives. They are predicaments that can only be resolved by generating sustained and globally robust coordination across value systems. The scale of the problems and necessity for coordinated global solutions signal a world historical transit as momentous as the Industrial Revolution: a transition from the predominance of technical knowledge to that of ethical deliberation. This volume brings together leading thinkers from around the world to deliberate on how best to correlate worth (value) with what is worthwhile (values), pairing human prosperity with personal, environmental, and spiritual flourishing in a world of differing visions of what constitutes a moral life.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x1k8c">Value and Values</a><br>
  Author(s) Di Xu<br>
  Abstract: Developments in science, medicine, technology, and national economies have rapidly resulted in aging societies in both developed and developing countries around the world. The increasingly large number of elderly people has caused various problems to the political and economic systems of societies, including family structure, ethical relationships, lifestyles, and values, as well as to the emotional state of their members. Neither the spontaneous capitalistic market nor a state welfare system can easily resolve these issues. In a modern market economy ruled by the logic of capital and profit, elderly people, who, usually unemployed, are considered mere consumers, thus present a<br>

  Author(s) Higgins Kathleen M.<br>
  Abstract: In his essay “The Moral Equivalent of War” (1910), William James observes that despite its obvious destructiveness, war has long had its defenders, who stress the important role that war time military service has traditionally served in developing discipline, toughness, and character in young men. Although himself motivated by the desire for a peaceful world, James concedes that “militarism is the great preserver of our ideals of hardihood, and human life with no use for hardihood would be contemptible.”¹ Given the harms that come from war, he argues that we need a “moral equivalent” of war, a nonviolent alternative to<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x1k8c">Value and Values</a><br>
  Author(s) Standish Paul<br>
  Abstract: “Social justice” is a phrase that recurs with some force in contemporary political and academic discussion, and in many respects this is understandable. One can scarcely imagine a form of human life for which justice does not remain a question, and the effects of the adjective point up the particular pressures to which that question is exposed in an overcrowded and, in some ways, environmentally depleted world. How are we to live together in justice, in our own countries and continents, and in the world as a whole?<br>

  Abstract: How do economic goods, for example, the necessities for life (food, shelter, etc.), relate to the common goods, such as the virtues (justice, moderation, courage, wisdom, etc.), which are good not only for us but also for our relationships with one another; and how do these goods contribute to the good life? Such questions, though not necessarily formulated in these terms, are asked and answered by philosophers from ancient Greece to classical China. Drawing on the wisdoms of Aristotle and Confucius as representatives of these disparate philosophical traditions, I explore their answers to these questions and examine the lessons they<br>

  Book Title: Gender and Nation in Meiji Japan-Modernity, Loss, and the Doing of History<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Karlin Jason G.<br>
  Abstract: Gender and Nation in Meiji Japan is a historical analysis of the discourses of nostalgia in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Japan. Through an analysis of the experience of rapid social change in Japan’s modernization, it argues that fads (ryūkō) and the desires they express are central to understanding Japanese modernity, conceptions of gender, and discourses of nationalism. In doing so, the author uncovers the myth of eternal return that lurks below the surface of Japanese history as an expression of the desire to find meaning amid the chaos and alienation of modern times. The Meiji period (1868–1912) was one of rapid change that hastened the process of forgetting: The state’s aggressive program of modernization required the repression of history and memory. However, repression merely produced new forms of desire seeking a return to the past, with the result that competing or alternative conceptions of the nation haunted the history of modern Japan. Rooted in the belief that the nation was a natural and organic entity that predated the rational, modern state, such conceptions often were responses to modernity that envisioned the nation in opposition to the modern state. What these visions of the nation shared was the ironic desire to overcome the modern condition by seeking the timeless past. While the condition of their repression was often linked to the modernizing policies of the Meiji state, the means for imagining the nation in opposition to the state required the construction of new symbols that claimed the authority of history and appealed to a rearticulated tradition. Through the idiom of gender and nation, new reified representations of continuity, timelessness, and history were fashioned to compensate for the unmooring of inherited practices from the shared locales of everyday life. This book examines the intellectual, social, and cultural factors that contributed to the rapid spread of Western tastes and styles, along with the backlash against Westernization that was expressed as a longing for the past. By focusing on the expressions of these desires in popular culture and media texts, it reveals how the conflation of mother, countryside, everyday life, and history structured representations to naturalize ideologies of gender and nationalism.<br>

  CHAPTER 1  Competing Masculinities in Meiji Japan from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x1k9w">Gender and Nation in Meiji Japan</a><br>
  Abstract: As officials and leaders in the Japanese government traveled to the West in the Meiji period, they looked to the lifestyle of the European gentleman as a model of sophistication and style. They cultivated a concern for fashion, accomplishment of manners, and superiority in taste as an expression of refinement and civility. This genteel form of masculinity reconciled with their belief in civilization and progress and conformed to their desire to appear civilized in the eyes of the West. Nevertheless, their attempts to master the corporeal signs and social conventions of European bourgeois society made them the targets of derision<br>

  CONCLUSION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x1k9w">Gender and Nation in Meiji Japan</a><br>
  Abstract: I began this book by considering how the Meiji Restoration had nurtured the sentiment that the revolution was incomplete. The calls to action that adhered around the notion of the “incomplete Restoration” in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries were (re)productive of the myth of the Meiji Restoration. For both the state and its critics, revolutionary action was legitimized by invoking the Restoration: the state pursued the modernization of all aspects of social life, denouncing customs and practices incompatible with its ideology of progress as backward and barbarous, while its opponents condemned the state for its decadence and superficiality arising from<br>

  Abstract: This chapter examines the transformation of the Korean rural economy and society from 1910 to 1937 and its impact on the lives of peasants, who accounted for 80 percent of the Korean population. In so doing, it adds to the rich scholarship on Korean rural affairs and the commercialization of agriculture during the Chosŏn and colonial periods by including writings and observations on rural life by intellectuals and religious figures from the colonial period. Numerous studies of rural Korea have provided valuable statistical and quantitative data that show how rural life changed under colonialism, but these studies have left out<br>

  Abstract: After the 1919 March First Movement, peasants, agriculture, and the countryside figured prominently in nationalist discourse. In 1929, Sa Kong-pyo declared in
                  Leninjuŭi(Leninism), a leading leftist journal, “If we do not boldly take up peasant problems in the revolution and fail to fight for the political and economic demands of peasants, there is no possibility for the revolution to advance.”¹ Sharing the leftist view on the urgency of solving the vast troubles besetting the agrarian economy and peasant life, bourgeois nationalists called for wide- ranging reforms to attack the destitution of peasants.² For leaders like An Chae-hong, overcoming the<br>

  Abstract: The current proliferation of sequels in both literary and cinematic venues suggests an abiding interest in stories that follow up on and expand previously circulated stories. Sequel novels are written, published, and read for many different reasons, the most commonly expressed being a desire by the reader for repetition, but with difference; a wish by the author to explore in more detail a character or situation from a previous book; and a need expressed by the author or publisher, or both, to continue an economically successful venture. One of the most oftquoted commentaries on sequels is Terry Castle’s 1986 study<br>

  Abstract: In her final novel,

She told Eleanor Wachtel at the beginning of 2002 that goodness was “the main preoccupation of [Unless]” and that she had been “interested in the idea of goodness for a number of years” (Wachtel 153). An earlier comment on a more contained version of goodness focused on Shields’s fondness as a child for the world and characters of “Dick and Jane readers” and the way in which “everyone was terribly good to everyone else.”<br>

When new media technologies rise to the fore the mediation of identity changes along with it, and play offers a range of fruitful perspectives to understand these changes. Another common thread in these chapters involves questioning the intricate connections between play and everyday life. From being a more or less separate space for experimenting with<br>

Reasons include the lagging state of fixed telephony in homes; its affordability even for low-income people; and omnipresent branding that induces an acute sense of “must have”. Most importantly and central in this chapter, mobile phones offer urban Indonesians rich opportunities for identity construction and expression. In this chapter, I look at how mobile media shape the construction and performance of identities that are specific to life in Indonesia’s capital city, Jakarta. Jakarta is both<br>

  Book Title: Dis-Enclosure: The Deconstruction of Christianity-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Smith Michael B.<br>
  Abstract: This book is a profound and eagerly anticipated investigation into what is left of a monotheistic religious spirit-notably, a minimalist faith that is neither confessional nor credulous. Articulating this faith as works and as an objectless hope, Nancy deconstructs Christianity in search of the historical and reflective conditions that provided its initial energy. Working through Blanchot and Nietzsche, re-reading Heidegger and Derrida, Nancy turns to the Epistle of Saint James rather than those of Saint Paul, discerning in it the primitive essence of Christianity as hope. The religion that provided the exit from religion,as he terms Christianity, consists in the announcement of an end. It is the announcement that counts, however, rather than any finality. In this announcement there is a proximity to others and to what was once called parousia. But parousia is no longer presence; it is no longer the return of the Messiah. Rather, it is what is near us and does not cease to open and to close, a presence deferred yet imminent.In a demystified age where we are left with a vision of a self-enclosed world-in which humans are no longer mortals facing an immortal being, but entities whose lives are accompanied by the time of their own decline-parousia stands as a question. Can we venture the risk of a decentered perspective, such that the meaning of the world can be found both inside and outside, within and without our so-immanent world?The deconstruction of Christianity that Nancy proposes is neither a game nor a strategy. It is an invitation to imagine a strange faith that enacts the inadequation of life to itself. Our lives overflow the self-contained boundaries of their biological and sociological interpretations. Out of this excess, wells up a fragile, overlooked meaning that is beyond both confessionalism and humanism.<br>

In the earliest and most decisive wave of the attack (launched by Eliot, Pound, and their associates) the battleground was literary: the proposition that textual meaning is independent of the author’s control was associated with the literary doctrine that the best poetry is impersonal, objective, and autonomous; that it leads an afterlife of its own, totally cut off from the life of<br>

  Book Title: Italian Irish Filmmakers-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): Lourdeaux Lee<br>
  Abstract: "This penetrating study examines how these filmmakers confronted their cultural heritage and used it as a counterpoint to their depiction of mainstream America." --American Cinematographer In this unique film history, Lee Lourdeaux traces the impact of Irish and Italian cultures on four major American directors and their work. Defining the core values and tensions within each culture, and especially focusing on the influence of American Catholicism, he presents John Ford, Frank Capra, Francis Coppola, and Martin Scorsese as ethnic Americans and film artists. Lourdeaux shows each filmmaker on set with writers and actors, learning to bypass stereotypes in order to develop a shrewd reciprocal assimilation between his ethnic background and Anglo America. Beginning with D. W. Griffith's depiction of Irish and Italian immigrants, the author discusses Hollywood's stereotypical portrayals of ethnic priests, cops, politicians, and gangsters, as well as their surface acculturation in the movies of the 1920s. By the decade's end, John Ford was using all-American stories to embody the basic myths and tensions of Irish-American life. In his later westerns and foreign films, he tried to understand both Irish political strife and the key figures of Irish liturgy. Frank Capra pitted Italian family values against the Anglo success ethic, turning out social comedies about oppressed little people. Several decades later, Martin Scorsese and Francis Coppola were highly critical of their religio-ethnic heritage, though they gradually discovered that to outline its weaknesses, like the blind pursuit of success, was to fashion a critical mirror of mainstream America. Lourdeaux discusses a number of recent films by Coppola and by Scorsese that have not yet been analyzed in any book. And, in the chapter on Scorsese, a personal interview with the director reveals how his ethnic childhood shaped his work in film. Examining the conflicts within American culture, Lourdeaux shows how the filmmakers themselves had to confront the self-destructive aspects of their ethnic background, not only to accommodate WASP audiences but to better understand their own heritage. He also observes that ethnicity is a strong draw at the box office, as in The Godfather, because it creates a sense of the Other who can both be admired and at the same time ridiculed. Illustrated with scenes of the movies discussed, this fascinating film history tells how four of America's most famous filmmakers assimilated their ethnic backgrounds on set and on screen. "Mr. Lourdeaux walks a tricky path in analyzing the films of each [director]: avoiding the trap of excessively detailing their lives and many films, while steering clear of ethnic stereotyping. Those interested in ethnic influences on outstanding persons or in the production of films by four of the best will find the book enjoyable." --The Baltimore Sun "This is an invaluable book because it arouses critical awareness of the ethnicity underlying many Hollywood movies that might otherwise appear merely to represent American archetypes." --Journal of American Studies "A valuable addition to the literature on ethnic identity in film. The insights Lourdeaux offers into major figures like Griffith, Ford, Capra, Coppola, and Scorsese contribute significantly to our understanding of their films." --Virginia Wright Wexman, University of Illinois at Chicago "For a number of years now, church historians have been giving us an account of American Catholicism that is much richer and more varied than the older institutional accounts of the Catholic Church ever let on. In this comprehensive and insightful study, Lee Lourdeaux shows us how much the ethnic movies of directors like Ford and Capra, Coppola and Scorsese have to teach us as well about Irish- and Italian-Catholic mores and instincts." --John B. Breslin, S.J., Director "A wonderfully sensitive, intelligent study of the complex issue of how the Catholic imagination works in the creative personalities of those raised in the Catholic heritage." --Andrew M. Greeley<br>

  CHAPTER 5  Francis Coppola and Ethnic Double Vision from:

  Abstract: As a child, Francis Coppola often changed schools to keep pace with his father’s musical career. Growing up in various suburbs, he experienced ethnicity not as a way of life on the streets but as a way of relating within a middle-class family. Coppola the filmmaker constantly mirrors both this close-up familial vision of the self and anger towards the symbolic absent father. Although this conflicted familial vision might seem to negate the social values of John Ford and Frank Capra, Coppola does assert similar themes of family and home, law and decency and democracy in seemingly self-contradictory narratives: In<br>

  Book Title: The Roots Of Thinking-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): Sheets-Johnstone Maxine<br>
  Abstract: "A significant contribution to the study of early humans, this book is a philosophical anthropology.... it makes genuinely novel, and highly persuasive, claims within the field itself." --David Depew In this ground-breaking interdisciplinary study about conceptual origins, Maxine Sheets-Johnstone shows that there is an indissoluble bond between hominid thinking and hominid evolution, a bond cemented by the living body. Her thesis is concretely illustrated in eight paleoanthropological case studies ranging from tool-using/tool-making to counting, sexuality, representation, language, death, and cave art. In each case, evidence is brought forward that shows how thinking is modeled on the body-specifically, how concepts are generated by animate form and the tactile-kinesthetic experience. Later chapters critically examine key theoretical and methodological issues posed by the thesis, Sheets-Johnstone demonstrates in detail how and why a corporeal turn in philosophy and the human sciences can yield insights no less extraordinary than those produced by the linguistic turn. In confronting the currently popular doctrine of cultural relativism and the classic Western metaphysical dualism of mind and body, she shows how pan-cultural invariants of human bodily life have been discounted and how the body itself has not been given its due. By a precise exposition of how a full-scale hermeneutics and a genetic phenomenology may be carried out with respect to conceptual origins, she shows how methodological issues are successfully resolved. "Ranging across the humanities and sciences, this thoroughly original book challenges both traditional metaphysics and contemporary cultural relativism. In their place, it persuasively develops a phenomenonological, tactile-kinesthetic account of the origins of thinking. This philosophical anthropology could not be more timely. It replaces the 'linguistic turn' with a promising new 'corporeal turn.'" --John J. Stuhr, University of Oregon "This work takes a much-needed stand in the inter-disciplinary field of philosophical anthropology. Sheets-Johnstone is well-read in the history of philosophy and in contemporary anthropology. The point of view she offers is inventive, insightful, well-established, and fruitful." --Thomas M.

  Book Title: The Strange Music of Social Life-A Dialogue on Dialogic Sociology<br>
  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): Goetting Ann<br>
  Abstract: The Strange Music of Social Lifepresents a dialogue on dialogic sociology, explored through the medium of music. Sociologist and composer Michael Mayerfeld Bell presents an argument that both sociology and classical music remain largely in the grip of a nineteenth-century totalizing ambition of prediction and control. He provides the refreshing approach of "strangency" to explain a sociology that tries to understand not only the regularities of social life but also the social conditions in which people do what we do not expect.<br>

  Abstract: In his essay “Strange Music: Notes toward a Dialogic Sociology,” Michael Bell (this volume) echoes a concern about the epistemological foundation of sociology that has been developing over the past few years. Along the lines of Andrew Abbott’s (2007) call for a “lyrical sociology,” Bell proposes a sociology with two attributes: (1) an appreciation of the dimension of social life that is unpredictable and (in his view) therefore unexplainable and (2) an eradication of the detachment between researcher and object of study. Critical of the discipline’s penchant for “total explanation,” Bell suggests a sociology that views its task less as<br>

  Abstract: Michael Bell’s proposal for a “dialogic sociology” (this volume) is a response to what he perceives to be an obsession in the discipline with “total explanation,” which means that the sociological researcher attempts to develop a comprehensive understanding of a phenomenon using a conceptual apparatus that emphasizes causality, predictability, objectivity, and neutrality. He argues that sociologists are so preoccupied with discovering whether their preconceptions about social life are correct that they do not attempt to understand the social conditions in which people behave in ways that sociologists do not expect.<br>

  Abstract: Joy is crucial to human life and central to God’s relationship to the world, yet it is remarkably absent from contemporary theology and, increasingly, from our own lives! This collection, the result of a series of consultations hosted by the Yale Center of Faith and Culture, remedies this situation by considering the import of joy on human flourishing. These essays—written by experts in systematic and pastoral theology, Christian ethics, and biblical studies—demonstrate the promise of joy to throw open new theological possibilities and cast fresh light on all dimensions of human life. With contributions from Jurgen Moltmann, N. T. Wright, Marianne Meye Thompson, Mary Clark Moschella, Charles Mathewes, and Miroslav Volf, this volume puts joy at the heart of Christian faith and life, exploring joy’s biblical, dogmatic, ecclesiological, and ethical dimensions in concert with close attention to the shifting tides of culture. Convinced of the need to offer to the world a compelling Christian vision of the good life, the authors treat the connections between joy and themes of creation, theodicy, politics, suffering, pastoral practice, eschatology, and more, driven by the conviction that vital relationship with the living God is integral to our fullest flourishing as human creatures.<br>

  Author(s) Crisp Justin E.<br>
  Abstract: Why joy—and why now? It is perhaps counterintuitive for joy to occupy a central place in a Christian theology, or at least in a theology capable of taking seriously the state of the world in which we live. Have not the masters of suspicion sufficiently warned theologians away from commending religious sentiments that, in their spiritual purity, distract their subjects from the material situation of life and issue in a total flight from the world? Did not the manifold tragedies of the mid-twentieth century disabuse theologians once and for all of their Pollyanna-ish penchant for progress, their sure confidence<br>

  Abstract: Thus far, we have considered religious, moral, and intellectual conversions and their foundational role in the life of the theologian seeking to be an authentic subject engaged in theological work. The question can arise as to whether this is an exhaustive account of the foundational theological subject. What other types of conversion might we consider? Previously we have mentioned our fundamental orientation to meaning, truth, and goodness. Goodness and values relate to moral conversion, while questions of meaning and truth relate to intellectual conversion.

  Abstract: Since the era of Vatican II, it has become a commonplace to speak of revelation as an act of
                  divine self-communication. This terminology, derived from the work of Karl Rahner and adopted by Pope John Paul II, seeks to express the fact that God does not simply communicate various “facts” about God’s life and his relationship to us; rather God communicates God’s very self to us.¹ God is both the communicator and what is communicated. As Scripture puts it, we have become sharers in the divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4). God communicates something of the divine nature to us in<br>

  Abstract: “We are trapped in the jaws of something shaking the life out of us.” With these words from his historical novel,
                  Philadelphia Fire, John Edgar Wideman conveys a sense of what it means to be caught out on stage, vulnerable at the point of having one’s life taken, shaken out, by what I have term “the theatrics of state terror.” Wideman’s discernment carries rage and lament. It is full of frustration and fear. There is consternation and a vexed wrestling with the entrapping “jaws” that belong … well, to “something.” State terror’s theatrics are like that, unleashing forces that brutalize<br>

  Author(s) Chalamet Christophe<br>
  Abstract: Several well-known contemporary philosophers have been struck in recent years by the apostle Paul and, in at least one case, by the theme of “universalism.”¹ But Paul is, of course, not only the author of the famous sentence of Gal. 3:28: “There is no such thing as Jew and Greek, slave and freeman, male and female; for you all are one person in Christ Jesus” (neb).

  Abstract: When William James sniffed nitrous oxide in the spring of 1882, he resurrected and transformed an experimental gesture which had been central to the practice of Christian mysticism. For centuries, Western ecstatics had attempted to transcend the boundaries of the human personality, and thus approach a knowledge of the divine life through the employment of ascetic and meditative techniques. The writings of Père Surin, Madame Guyon and Catherine of Genoa give minute and often horrifying descriptions of these methods: Surin crippled himself jumping from a window into the River Garonne; Catherine starved herself; while Mme Guyon (perhaps the most extreme<br>

Across the principality the familiar pattern of religious life was rent asunder as women and workers were being driven into public ecstasies and seized by religious raptures.

  Abstract: Does Douglas Coupland’s fiction ‘speak’ with ‘a voice from nowhere’? Is he a Canadian who strategically chooses to write with a US accent, an involuntary American novelist who happens to hold a Canadian passport or a writer whose narrative concerns transcend national boundaries? The anonymous narrator of Coupland’s short story, ‘In the Desert’ (1994), a wanderer lost in the scorched American wilderness, makes revealing connections between the simulated, late twentieth-century ‘electronic dream’ of shared televisual memory and the dubious coherence of his own life story. This insecurity about the capricious, unstable nature of identity – including a sense of ambivalence about<br>

                  Scène lyrique’,Pygmalion, in which the sculptor’s creation, Galathée, comes to life and touches her creator, saying ‘It’s me.’ Moving away, she touches a marble sculpture and says ‘It’s no longer me. . .’ Finally, touching Pygmalion again, she sighs: ‘Ah! Me once again . . .’, and he exclaims: ‘it is you, you alone, I give you all my being; I shall no longer live except through you’ (Rousseau 1776 pp. 32–4). Such a culmination of the<br>

  Book Title: The arc and the machine-Narrative and new media<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Bassett Caroline<br>
  Abstract: The Arc and the machine is a timely and original defence of narrative in an age of information. Stressing interpretation and experience alongside affect and sensation it convincingly argues that narrative is key to contemporary forms of cultural production and to the practice of contemporary life. Re-appraising the prospects for narrative in the digital age, it insists on the centrality of narrative to informational culture and provokes a critical re-appraisal of how innovations in information technology as a material cultural form can be understood and assessed. The book offers a careful exploration of narrative theory, a sophisticated critique of techno-cultural writing, and a series of tightly focused case studies. All of which point the way to a restoration of a critical - rather than celebratory approaches - to new media. The scope and range of this book is broad, its argumentation careful and exacting, and its conclusions exciting.<br>

Those who had expected another meditative study of life in 1950s Yorkshire were either bemused or delighted to discover that a strange and colourful new hybrid – part contemporary campus comedy, part historical romance, part literary detective story – had been added to Byatt’s oeuvre. By 1990, Byatt had gained a reputation as a traditional, academically minded novelist, whose work embodied a Leavisite vision of English culture and Arnoldian standards of ‘high seriousness’.<br>

  Abstract: What is scripture?¹ Wilfred Cantwell Smith challenges us to pause and ponder this question. All religious traditions that ground themselves in texts must grapple with certain questions. In worship services and public and private readings, Christians often turn to scripture for guidance: to the stories of Abraham or Moses, to the Psalms, to the prophecies of Isaiah, to the life of Jesus, to the letters of Paul, to the vision of John. Therefore, Christians must confront their own set of questions. Indeed, to ask the question, what is scripture? is to become mired in a muddy pool of questions: What<br>

  Abstract: The Counter-Reformation is a period in the history of the Roman Catholic Church during which the Church dealt with issues arising from the emergence of Protestantism. Though Catholic reform predated Martin Luther, nonetheless the challenges that he and other reformers presented led the Church to make serious and sustained changes. The focus of the Counter-Reformation was the Council of Trent (1545–63), an event that left few areas of Catholic life untouched. The Council issued broad dogmatic decrees on the sacraments, the scriptures, justification, and Church government, in addition to passing many ordinances on internal Church reform.

  Abstract: The Christian tradition has been characterized by its commitment to the significance of the Bible for life and thought. Indeed, Christian communal identity has largely been formed around a set of literary texts that together form canonical scripture. As David Kelsey remarks, acknowledging the Bible as scripture lies at the very heart of participating in the community of Jesus Christ, and the decision to adopt the texts of Christian scripture as “canon” is not “a separate decision over and above a decision to become a Christian.”¹ Yet the past two centuries have seen considerable change in the nature and function<br>

                  mashal. The whole of Jewish tradition is bidimensional; it is built into the halakah (legal dispositions) and the haggadah (paradigmatic stories illustrating the meaning, impact, and relevance of a biblical theme or text). Historically, it must be said that preference has been given by Jewish readers to the halakic side of the tradition because of its obvious bearing on ways of life according to the divine order.

  Abstract: The text of the gospel contains a canto of citations from the Hebrew Scriptures, and this for good reason, for the gospel writers wanted the Jewish roots of its message to be strong and conclusive.¹ Even an apparently non- Jew like Luke is eager to “prove” the authenticity of the messianic identity of Jesus by frequently citing the Hebrew Bible. In fact, this dependence of the gospel on Jewish traditions goes well beyond these quotations. The Hebrew Scriptures provided a rich hermeneutic treasure trove for the evangelists to build pesharim and haggadoth, illustrating the providential events of the life of<br>

Suspicious of collective life and averse to power-sharing, Egyptian governance structures weaken but do not stop the public’s role in the remaking of their city. What happens to a city where neo-liberalism has scaled back public services and encouraged the privatization of public goods, while the vast majority cannot afford the effects of such policies? Who wins and loses in the “march to the modern and the global" as the government transforms urban spaces and markets in the name of growth, security, tourism, and modernity? How do Cairenes struggle with an ambiguous and vulnerable legal and bureaucratic environment when legality is a privilege affordable only to the few or the connected? This companion volume to Cairo Cosmopolitan further develops the central insights of the Cairo School of Urban Studies.<br>

  Abstract: As an essential part of human life worlds, landscapes have the potential to absorb something of people’s lives, works and thoughts. But landscapes also shape their own life histories on different timescales, imprinted by human existence, affecting personal lives and transcending individual human life cycles. This combination of reciprocity and distinctness creates a strong but complex intertwining of personhood and place – an intertwining which most people become aware of during their own lifetime. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that the ‘co-scripting’ of landscapes and people figures prominently in literature, autobiographies and academic research, as well as in our<br>

  Author(s) Holtorf Cornelius<br>
  Abstract: Although things are not living beings, in a metaphorical sense they can be considered to have lives. Things are made; they often do something; and over time many things move from place to place. Their meanings and functions change in different contexts. As time goes by things age and eventually they end up at a final resting place where they gradually disintegrate. Things can reach very different ages, from a few minutes to many millennia, but once dead only very few are brought back, for example as antiques or collectables, and given additional meanings in a new life.

  Book Title: Post-Holocaust France and the Jews, 1945-1955-  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Katz Steven T.<br>
  Abstract: Despite an outpouring of scholarship on the Holocaust, little work has focused on what happened to Europe's Jewish communities after the war ended. And unlike many other European nations in which the majority of the Jewish population perished, France had a significant post‑war Jewish community that numbered in the hundreds of thousands.

  Author(s) MANDEL MAUD<br>
  Abstract: Was World War II a radical break in French Jewish history—a turning point in notions of community, identity, and political expression—or did the restoration of Jewish citizenship and the Fourth Republic’s promise to protect and defend all citizens regardless of religion or ethnic origin allow long-standing patterns of Jewish identification to reinstate themselves? This chapter will address this question by turning to an aspect of Jewish communal life that transcended the pre- and postwar years—that of how to integrate incoming Jewish refugees and immigrants into communal institutions and French society more broadly. To be sure, the question<br>

  Author(s) GHILES-MEILHAC SAMUEL<br>
  Abstract: Anti-Semitic persecutions targeting French and foreign Jews in France from 1940 to 1944 had deep consequences when it came to Jewish political organization. This chapter focuses on one of the most striking of these consequences: the creation in the winter of 1943–44 of the Conseil représentatif des israélites de France (Representative Council of French Israelites, CRIF). This organization symbolized unification of the different cultural and political Jewish groups that were active illegally under German occupation. The chapter therefore presents the events leading to this revolution and focuses on the political life of this new organization in postwar France.<br>

  Author(s) KAPLAN EDWARD K.<br>
  Abstract: This chapter traces the inception of André Neher’s significant role in the renewal of French Jewish intellectual and spiritual life after the Shoah. Born in 1914 in Obernai, in the Bas Rhin region of France, he was educated as both a secular intellectual and a religiously observant Jew. (His family moved to Strasbourg, which became French in 1918.) In 1936, aged twenty-two, he began to teach German language and literature at the Collège de Sarrebourg while also pursuing yeshiva studies in Montreux, Switzerland.¹ Mobilized in 1939, Neher made a crucial life decision when the Vichy government removed him from teaching<br>

  Book Title: A Godly Humanism-Clarifying the Hope That Lies Within<br>
  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): George Francis Cardinal<br>
  Abstract: For Francis Cardinal George, the Catholic Church is not a movement, built around ideas, but a communion, built around relationships. In A Godly Humanism, he shares his understanding of the Church in lively, compelling prose, presenting a way to understand and appreciate the relationships of God to human beings and of human beings to one another. These loving relationships are continually made present to us in and through the Church, from the time of Jesus' first disciples down to our own day. We are introduced to how the spiritual and intellectual life of Christians, aided in every generation by the Holy Spirit working through the Apostles and their successors, resist the danger of splitting apart from one another. Though they take different outward forms at different times, both wisdom and holiness are made possible for every Christian of every station of life. Sign-posting his conversation by the milestones of his own spiritual and intellectual journey, Cardinal George invites us to view the Church and her history in ways that go beyond the categories of politics - through which we find merely human initiative, contrivance, and adjustment - and rather to see the initiative as God's first and foremost. God is the non-stop giver, we are non-stop recipients of his gifts, and the recent popes, no less than the Father of the Church, have made every effort to make us aware of the graces - that is, of the unearned benefits - that God confers on us as Catholics, as Christians, as believers, and simply as human persons. Pope Francis, he reminds us, contrasts human planning with God's providence, and this book is at once an exposition of that providence and a personal response of gratitude for the way it has operated in one man's life.<br>

  CHAPTER 2  An Integrated Life from:

  Abstract: The catholic intellectual tradition begins with Catholics who become intellectuals or intellectuals who become disciples of Christ in his body the Church. But because both discipleship and the intellectual life are universal in scope, the life and worth of Catholic intellectuals is lived in the Church and in society at large. The institutionalization of that conversation between the human intellect and the faith that comes to us from the apostles began with the conversion of philosophers in ancient Rome and moved, over the centuries, from their schools and their coteries of disciples to the monastic schools during feudal times, then,<br>

In the German city of Cologne, there’s a small church right next to the famous cathedral. The church’s chapel is dedicated to St. Stephen and is under the pastoral care of the Dominican friars. It houses the tomb of St. Albert the Great. Albert was not originally buried there, and when they moved his body from its former grave, they opened his casket and found still-very-well-preserved vestments, most of his crozier, and his bones.

  Abstract: If the second vatican council’s contribution to the dialogue between faith and reason in our day has to be understood as a word of continuity in principle, with recognition of discontinuity in situations, then it is equally important to recognize how the situation has been redefined by the Magisterium and ministry of Pope St. John Paul II. Seldom has a papacy been so grounded in guiding the conversation between faith and reason and in showing how, in the life of the pope himself, intellectual and spiritual lives are intertwined.<br>

  Book Title: Experiencing Scripture-Intimacy with Ancient Text and Modern Faith<br>

  Author(s): Campbell Antony F<br>
  Abstract: This book aims to enable a user to become closely familiar with a limited number of Older Testament texts and so be in a position to form judgments about them and, resulting from that, to have an under- standing of the nature of biblical text itself. Beyond this, the reality that these are key texts for the understanding of the Bible means that they have fundamental impact for the basics of faith today our understanding of ourselves before God, essential to faith in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Israel's prophets reflect on the role of God in human life; faith in God's love, God's passion for justice, the essential place of fidelity in faith. Israel's foundational narratives explore the nature of human lives before God; they include issues such as creation, human freedom, and faith in God's unshakeable commitment to human life. Alongside these concerns, there is the importance of getting a feel for the nature of scripture.<br>

  Abstract: On 17th October 2010, Australia celebrated the canonisation of its first official saint, Saint Mary of the Cross MacKillop (1842—1909). In this chapter, I propose that Mary MacKillop’s life-story, example, and spirituality can be examined through categories of Edward Schillebeeckx’s theology, in ways that might aid Australian theologians in the contextualisation of this nineteenth century saint for twenty-first century Catholic Australians. Hopefully, this task will also be fruitful for others.<br>

  Abstract: For many people in Australia and New Zealand, the death of Jesus on a Roman cross constitutes a problem of integrity in their life of faith. They ask: how could a loving God send the divine Son to be tortured to death? The theology of redemption they have imbibed involves God willing the death of Jesus on a cross as the means of our salvation. The biblical texts which say that Jesus ‘must’ suffer (Mk 8:31; Lk 24:26) are understood to mean that there was a divine requirement for the cruel death on the cross. This forms a pastoral problem<br>

  Abstract: This has been a study of the mystical-political dialectic as it has emerged in theological reflection and through historical practice within the modern Roman Catholic period. I have suggested that such a reflection is necessitated by the universal call to holiness articulated at the Second Vatican Council. This proposes the secularity as a significant locus for the pursuit of the spiritual life. In this context a negotiation between ‘the mystical’ and ‘the political’ and the attempt to live a particular integration between them will only increasingly become apparent. It is, perhaps, the spiritual challenge of the legacy of Vatican II.<br>

  Abstract: The fiftieth anniversary of the Second Vatican Council has offered the opportunity to remember and re-appropriate the new life that the Council brought to the Church.

The editors have asked me to reflect on the future of the Catholic biblical studies in the wake of the Council. Although writing primarily from a Catholic perspective, I hope that my reflections might be of some worth for all<br>

Part One inquires into the rhythms of faith as it interacts with themes of uncertainty and doubt, the nature of theological discourse, the task of systematic theology, evangelism and the various ways in which theology is done. Part Two discusses the importance of place in relation to the church, and themes of innovation, undecideability and new forms of monastic community. Part Three addresses themes in discipleship: simplicity, mysticism, the passions and pilgrimage. A red thread connecting these essays is the character of the triune God who is the energy and life in between all things.<br>

  Abstract: What place does theology occupy in Australian Anglicanism? Australian pragmatism and impatience with matters of the intellect has had little enthusiasm for or apparent need of theologians in the Church. Some kinds of theological activity—overly academic, elitist and irrelevant—might only confirm such prejudice! If theology occupies a somewhat marginal place then perhaps this is as it should be. After all, in a management and market driven world what is the value of theology in the life of the Church? It is a question once addressed by that famous ex-Anglican John Henry Newman.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt163t981">In-Between God</a><br>
  Abstract: Innovation derives from the Latin
                  innovare, meaning to renew or alter; essentially to bring in or introduce something new. Hence we may speak of novel practices and/or doctrines. It is a controversial feature of the life of the Christian church. Innovation is almost endemic to Christianity. The very nature of the gospel suggests that notions of surprise and novelty belong to the life of discipleship because they first inhere in the very character and action of God.

  Abstract: How do Adventists who live in the twenty-first century understand the observations of Ellen White with respect to lifestyle? Most of her instructions were written over one hundred years ago in a very specific cultural and historical context. What does Adventists’ practical application of her instructions tell us about the way in which they are interpreting her writings? And why do some say that her writings are no longer relevant? These are fascinating questions that should be addressed candidly and openly by Seventh-day Adventists who are committed to fulfilling the gospel commission of Jesus and take seriously the mandate that<br>

  Abstract: The beauty of a volume like this for someone like myself, whether collected essays or selected writings, is to see the struggle unfolding over a lifetime with fundamental issues of Christian faith and issues of the Older Testament, driven by the pressure of the biblical text.¹ Perhaps the younger me is best characterised by the reaction of the assembled students of the United Faculty of Theology to my selfdescription as a ‘simple Bible Christian’, a statement that was greeted with a wave of spontaneous laughter. Apparently students were not convinced; but I was sincere. I certainly held to the Bible<br>

  The Nature of Biblical Narrative from:

  Abstract: Something of a paradigm shift has been in the making for a while in biblical studies. A future shape has yet to jell. The old historical-critical analysis has not been generating new life for a long time.¹ Other approaches have not so far struck lasting root. The interaction of developmental (cf diachronic) reading and interpretational (cf synchronic) reading is under way, but far from any agreed integration. A resolution of tensions between critical and literary approaches is still to be achieved. The factors involved in any shift are complex; among them, the often competing needs of faith communities, university communities,<br>

  Abstract: The two most outrageous stories in the Bible have to be what Christians call the sacrifice of Isaac (in Jewish tradition: the binding of Isaac) and Jacob’s wrestling with God all night at the Jabbok. In a recent novel, a son asks his father, ‘Daddy, if God ordered it would you sacrifice me?’ The father replied, ‘No. For the first time in my life I would disobey God’. The son and his father were talking about historic time, this life, here and now. The son asked his question in historic time. Of course the father could only say, ‘I would<br>

  Abstract: How can we say God loves us? What does it mean to use that language? The fine tissue of the life of spirit needs constant attention and regular revising of its language to express what is sometimes so faintly felt, so easily swamped, and yet is at the core of human life. We need words that move us, words of wonder, words of wisdom. It can happen, though, that what sounds right at one moment may have implications that in the long term are not right. Love is one of those words that touches deeply. The need has been in<br>

  Abstract: At the turn of the twenty-first century, Richard Rorty put forward his vision for a new form of social hope, “the hope that life will eventually be freer, less cruel, more leisured, richer in goods and experiences, not just for our descendants but for everybody’s descendants.”¹ The first step toward this neopragmatic future requires a change in priorities in which “everybody thinks that it is human solidarity, rather than knowledge of something not merely human, that really matters.”² This utopian task of “replacing certainty with hope” requires establishing a different kind of solidarity based on increasing individual happiness rather than<br>

  TO CUT LIFE SHORT from:

  Abstract: The special law of the sixth commandment—in other words, its inability to be proposed as an absolute prohibition—finds a crucial touchstone in the absolute nature of its very object: death and its irreversibility. To kill is to mete out death. In the other commandments, life is not the issue, and the consequence of transgression is not irrecoverable. If I rob, I can restitute or repay. If I give false testimony, I can retract it. But for death—at least on the plane of earthly existence—there is no remedy. For whoever has a mortal body, to kill strikes<br>

In this chapter, I shall demonstrate that there was indeed—in France, at least—a co-variation between the rise, triumph, and decline of aesthetic modernism and the life cycle of French colonialism. The correlation in timing is not complicated to establish. But then, I wish to argue that the two are reciprocally potentializing. In other words, no French<br>

  Book Title: Encountering Morocco-Fieldwork and Cultural Understanding<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Dwyer Kevin<br>
  Abstract: Encountering Morocco introduces readers to life in this North African country through vivid accounts of fieldwork as personal experience and intellectual journey. We meet the contributors at diverse stages of their careers-from the unmarried researcher arriving for her first stint in the field to the seasoned fieldworker returning with spouse and children. They offer frank descriptions of what it means to take up residence in a place where one is regarded as an outsider, learn the language and local customs, and struggle to develop rapport. Moving reflections on friendship, kinship, and belief within the cross-cultural encounter reveal why study of Moroccan society has played such a seminal role in the development of cultural anthropology.<br>

  Book Title: Kierkegaard and Death-  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): BUBEN ADAM<br>
  Abstract: Few philosophers have devoted such sustained, almost obsessive attention to the topic of death as Søren Kierkegaard. Kierkegaard and Death brings together new work on Kierkegaard's multifaceted discussions of death and provides a thorough guide to the development, in various texts and contexts, of Kierkegaard's ideas concerning death. Essays by an international group of scholars take up essential topics such as dying to the world, living death, immortality, suicide, mortality and subjectivity, death and the meaning of life, remembrance of the dead, and the question of the afterlife. While bringing Kierkegaard's philosophy of death into focus, this volume connects Kierkegaard with important debates in contemporary philosophy.<br>

  1.  Knights and Knaves of the Living Dead: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gz6m3">Kierkegaard and Death</a><br>
  Author(s) Connell George<br>
  Abstract: Among the endlessly repeated motifs of the horror genre, none more reliably evokes a shudder than the idea of the undead, of humans doomed to wander between life and death. This response has a variety of deep psychological sources. Our anxiety in the face of our own mortality plays a part, as does a physiological revulsion to decaying bodies. Further, the sense of the living dead as ontologically other evokes in us a sense of numinous dread. Following Mary Douglas, the way such beings transgress the boundary separating life and death renders them both dangerous and impure.¹<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gz6m3">Kierkegaard and Death</a><br>
  Author(s) Podmore Simon D.<br>
  Abstract: Confessing in this journal entry from 1848 that, without dying willingly, death would have prevailed over him, Kierkegaard discloses how a life of suffering has prevented death from laying its claim to one who was already dead. Kierkegaard’s appropriation of the Latin aphorism further expresses an integral spiritual dialectic at the heart of Lutheran<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gz6m3">Kierkegaard and Death</a><br>
  Author(s) Duckles Ian<br>
  Abstract: In this chapter, I attempt to take seriously Derrida’s reading of Kierkegaard’s
                  Fear and TremblinginThe Gift of Death.¹ In particular, I focus on Derrida’s claim that all universalizing ethical systems involve an evasion of responsibility for one’s actions. As Derrida sees it, this has important connections with mortality, since (following Heidegger)² it is through developing the correct attitude toward my own mortality—and consequently my singularity as this particular individual—that I am able to lead an authentic life. In effect, I take Derrida to be suggesting that pursuing ethical considerations is an attempt to avoid confronting one’s<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gz6m3">Kierkegaard and Death</a><br>
  Author(s) Stokes Patrick<br>
  Abstract: Perhaps nothing in Kierkegaard’s writings has proven quite as polarizing as
                  Works of Love. The reception of this work has been characterized by perennial charges that it articulates an inhuman, acosmic, inward-looking vision of ethical life. These criticisms famously begin with Adorno, who claims that Kierkegaard’s concern to avoid “preferential” love in all forms leads to an “object-less” love in which the other is reduced to a mere “stumbling block.”¹ The result is an ethic whose “content is oppression: the oppression of the drive which is not to be fulfilled and the oppression of the mind which is not allowed<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gz6m3">Kierkegaard and Death</a><br>
  Author(s) Marks Tamara Monet<br>
  Abstract: Kierkegaard believed that he would experience a postmortem existence. Direct evidence for his belief may be found in his personal, pseudonymous, and signed writings. At the age of thirty-two, Kierkegaard wrote detailed instructions for the repair of his family’s burial site. Among his plans one finds lines from a hymn Brorson penned for his own tombstone. The content of the hymn suggests, among other things, that the afterlife puts an end to struggle in this life. The lines read:<br>

Up until 1971 the nation of Pakistan precariously consisted of two wings, West Pakistan and East Pakistan, soon to become Bangladesh. In October 1970, heavy floods, a cyclone, and then a tsunami battered the East wing, with enormous loss of life. In December the country was still in mourning.

  Abstract: Of all the great names in animation, Norman McLaren has, paradoxically, suffered most from a kind of critical neglect. Everyone acknowledges his genius, but few discuss it. Numerous books and articles chronicle his life and describe his works, usually stressing the inventiveness of his filmic but rarely do they analyse his aesthetic qualities and achievements.¹<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gz839">A Reader In Animation Studies</a><br>

  Abstract: Mikhail Bakhtin complained that the wit of Voltaire and the Enlightenment era lacked the full-bodied comedy of the Medieval market place. In
                  Rabela is and His World,Bakhtin celebrated the universal, ambivalent and grotesque ‘carnival comedy’ of the sixteenth century.¹ Enlightenment laughter is primarily mocking and satiric, subverting the folly of the hierarchy in its feasts of fools, asses and administrators. Medieval comedy, however, affirmed, renewed and revitalised the old, bringing forth new birth, life, hope and laughter. It simultaneously took apart and put together the Body of Humanity and the Christian Church. By means of deconstruction and then reconstruction,<br>

  TWO  The Ordinary Sublime from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gz98c">Stanley Cavell, Religion, and Continental Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: I have argued that Cavell’s ambiguous relation to religion should be understood against a wider cultural backdrop of modernism. If religion and thus theology have become problematic yet not impossible, then we must expect such possibility to show up within what Cavell terms the ordinary. However, the ordinary does not provide the location for experiences of incontestable divine revelations, nor does it unfailingly offer clear criteria by which we can assess such experiences. Nevertheless, the ordinary must be so inhabited as to provide glimpses, events, or perspectives from which religious orientation can gain a foothold in our form of life<br>

  FIVE  The Tragic Dimension of the Ordinary from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gz98c">Stanley Cavell, Religion, and Continental Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: Following the Augustinian tradition, original sin is something that we are responsible for and hence guilty of, yet in another sense it is a destiny that befalls us. At stake is hence a fine balance between necessity and freedom, between personal guilt and delivery to destructive structures. Accordingly, acknowledging sin takes a personal sense of the I, confessing or revealing itself as the originator of deeds and speech, while acknowledging that this I is indebted—for better and for worse—to the inheritance of and continuous participation in a form of life that bestows coherence to those deeds and utterances.<br>

  9  The “Biology” to Come? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gzcrk">Nietzsche and Phenomenology</a><br>
  Author(s) Bergo Bettina<br>
  Abstract: This essay addresses two problems whose outcome indicates the site where a dialogue between phenomenology and Nietzsche might begin. The first problem can be posed as a question: What is the “biology” to which Husserl refers in Appendix 23 of the
                     Crisis(published in 1936) and which is set forth as the “universal ontology”? The second problem concerns embodied consciousness and its life-world. If phenomenology was to serve as the foundation for all scientific endeavors, how then could biology be equated with ontology, and what relationship other than derivative could biology have to phenomenology?<br>

  9  The “Biology” to Come? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gzcrk">Nietzsche and Phenomenology</a><br>
  Author(s) Bergo Bettina<br>
  Abstract: This essay addresses two problems whose outcome indicates the site where a dialogue between phenomenology and Nietzsche might begin. The first problem can be posed as a question: What is the “biology” to which Husserl refers in Appendix 23 of the
                     Crisis(published in 1936) and which is set forth as the “universal ontology”? The second problem concerns embodied consciousness and its life-world. If phenomenology was to serve as the foundation for all scientific endeavors, how then could biology be equated with ontology, and what relationship other than derivative could biology have to phenomenology?<br>

  Book Title: Philosophy, Feminism, and Faith-  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): BOWER MARYA<br>
  Abstract: How can the seemingly separate lives of philosopher, feminist, and follower of a religious tradition come together in one person's life? How does religious commitment affect philosophy or feminism? How does feminism play out in religious or philosophical commitment? Wrestling with answers to these questions, women who balance philosophy, feminism, and faith write about their lives. The voices gathered here from several different traditions-Catholic, Protestant, Quaker, Jewish, and Muslim-represent diverse ethnicities, races, and ages. The challenging and poignant reflections in Philosophy, Feminism, and Faith show how critical thought can successfully mesh with religious faith and social responsibility.<br>

  Author(s) KAPLAN LAURA DUHAN<br>
  Abstract: A colleague invited me to write an essay about some of the difficulties I face in trying to reconcile my philosophy, my feminism, and my faith. After two botched attempts to outline such an essay, I came to realize that I had nothing to say on the topic because I have no difficulties reconciling philosophy, feminism, and faith. Instead, all three pursuits converge in my understanding of tradition. This understanding is not an intellectual achievement, but a way of life. It is difficult for me to rip this way of life far enough out of its context to articulate it<br>

  Abstract: I am an American Muslim immigrant. I come from an ancient corner of the world—the Middle East.

As years pass by in these United States, I find myself reading about Hagar, imagining her face, her hands, her life, her emotions.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gzg4q">The Year's Work at the Zombie Research Center</a><br>
  Author(s) SHAPIRO STEPHEN<br>
  Abstract: “Wildfire,” the fifth episode of AMC’s
                  The Walking Dead’s first season, shows a crisis many Americans are currently facing.¹ In the aftermath of a zombie attack, the human survivors must prevent their killed loved ones from returning as zombies. One woman, Carol, refuses to let the group’s men take responsibility for “decraniating” her prone life partner. “He’s my husband,” she says before splattering his gray matter onto the viewing lens. The scene cuts to another woman, Andrea, cradling her dead sister and waiting for the first sign of reanimation. Over a soundtrack of sentimentalized music, Andrea mournfully says, “Amy. Amy.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gzgqh">Material Feminisms</a><br>
  Author(s) Grosz Elizabeth<br>
  Abstract: There has traditionally been a strong resistance on the part of feminists to any recourse to the question of nature. Within feminist scholarship and politics, nature has been regarded primarily as a kind of obstacle against which we need to struggle, as that which remains inert, given, unchanging, and resistant to historical, social, and cultural transformations.¹ The suspicion with which biological accounts of human and social life are treated by feminists, especially feminists not trained in the biological sciences, is to some extent understandable. “Biology” not only designates the

  Abstract: In the first year and a half of Cassie’s life, her hair was basically not an issue because she didn’t have much. Then one day she came home from day care with a dozen tiny braids marking a complex and delicate pattern on her tiny head. I was, first of all, mystified. I had no idea she had enough hair to do anything like this. Where had all that hair come from? How had her teacher gathered it up like that? And how had she gotten her to sit still long enough to do it?<br>

  Abstract: In chapter 6 we saw that the cruciform self is not a punctual self. In this chapter I demonstrate the sense in which the cruciform self is a capable self, since capability is one of the central themes of philosophical anthropology. On Ricoeur’s definition, capability is a power or potentiality that the self is able to exercise—most basically, “the power to cause something to happen.”¹ So our question is this: What place do human agency and the power to act have in the life of faith?

It is necessary to make this argument given our interpretation of sin as incurvature, which might seem to reinforce the Romantic-idealist interpretation of the fall as a

  6  The Concreteness and Continuity of Faith from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gzjvj">A Philosophical Anthropology of the Cross</a><br>
  Abstract: In chapter 5 we saw how the self is constituted through the address of an external word, which gives the self its point of unity (
                     Einheitspunkt). But if the self is constituted in the event of being addressed, how does the self have continuity from moment to moment? Does this event have any concrete extension in the life of the self, or does this account lead in the direction of an actualistic or punctual (Pünktlich) self?<br>

  7  The Capable Human Being as a Penultimate Good from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gzjvj">A Philosophical Anthropology of the Cross</a><br>
  Abstract: In chapter 6 we saw that the cruciform self is not a punctual self. In this chapter I demonstrate the sense in which the cruciform self is a capable self, since capability is one of the central themes of philosophical anthropology. On Ricoeur’s definition, capability is a power or potentiality that the self is able to exercise—most basically, “the power to cause something to happen.”¹ So our question is this: What place do human agency and the power to act have in the life of faith? What does the word of the cross mean for our understanding of the<br>

  9  Reflexivity, Intentionality, and Self-Understanding from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gzjvj">A Philosophical Anthropology of the Cross</a><br>
  Abstract: In chapter 7 we saw how the category of the penultimate allows for a critical affirmation of human capability. This chapter employs a similar strategy regarding self-reflexivity and self-understanding, showing that the for-itself has a proper penultimate status in the life of faith and that the cruciform self is a self-interpreting animal. It is necessary to make this argument given our interpretation of sin as incurvature, which might seem to reinforce the Romantic-idealist interpretation of the fall as a
                  felix culpa, a condition for the possibility of self-consciousness. Moreover, Bonhoeffer’s claim that the intentionality of faith is anactus directus<br>

  Book Title: Material Ecocriticism-  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Oppermann Serpil<br>
  Abstract: Material Ecocriticism offers new ways to analyze language and reality, human and nonhuman life, mind and matter, without falling into well-worn paths of thinking. Bringing ecocriticism closer to the material turn, the contributions to this landmark volume focus on material forces and substances, the agency of things, processes, narratives and stories, and making meaning out of the world. This broad-ranging reflection on contemporary human experience and expression provokes new understandings of the planet to which we are intimately connected.<br>

  Abstract: A rock jumps. Every hiker has had the experience. The quiet woods or sweep of desert is empty and still when a snake that seemed a twig writhes, a skink that was bark scurries, leaves wriggle with insectile activity. This world coming to animal life reveals the elemental vibrancy already within green pine, arid sand, vagrant mist, and plodding hiker alike. When a toad that seemed a stone leaps into unexpected vivacity, its lively arc hints that rocks and toads share animacy, even if their movements unfold across vastly different temporalities. Just as the flitting hummingbird judges hiker and toad<br>

  Abstract: The conception of physical reality within the framework of ecological postmodern thought and the nature of the material world described by quantum theory have recently been given new life by the emergence of the new materialist paradigm. The radical revisions of our ideas about the description of physical entities, chemical and biological processes, and their ethical, political, and cultural implications represented in recent discourses of feminist science studies, posthumanism, and the environmental humanities have also occasioned considerable interest among ecocritics, leading to the emergence of material ecocriticism.

  Book Title: The Cruelest of All Mothers: Marie de l'Incarnation, Motherhood, and Christian Tradition-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Dunn Mary<br>
  Abstract: In 1631, Marie Guyart stepped over the threshold of the Ursuline convent in Tours, leaving behind her eleven-year-old son, Claude, against the wishes of her family and her own misgivings. Marie concluded, "God was dearer to me than all that. Leaving him therefore in His hands, I bid adieu to him joyfully." Claude organized a band of schoolboys to storm the convent, begging for his mother's return. Eight years later, Marie made her way to Quebec, where over the course of the next thirty-three years she opened the first school for Native American girls, translated catechisms into indigenous languages, and served some eighteen years as superior of the first Ursuline convent in the New World. She would also maintain, over this same period, an extensive and intimate correspondence with the son she had abandoned to serve God. The Cruelest of All Mothers is, fundamentally, an explanation of Marie de l'Incarnation's decision to abandon Claude for religious life. Complicating Marie's own explication of the abandonment as a sacrifice carried out in imitation of Christ and in submission to God's will, the book situates the event against the background of early modern French family life, the marginalization of motherhood in the Christian tradition, and seventeenth-century French Catholic spirituality. Deeply grounded in a set of rich primary sources, The Cruelest of All Mothers offers a rich and complex analysis of the abandonment.<br>

  Abstract: The Fourth Gospel is the most historical of all the Gospels. While it has been entitled “the spiritual Gospel,” its depth of spiritual insight does not in any way detract from its focus on the actual life and death of Jesus of Nazareth.¹ In fact, this Gospel proclaims that history is now the locus of the divine presence. In the flesh of Jesus, we have the eternal Word of God. For this reason, history is now radiant with the glory of God: “The Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the<br>

  The Overrealized Expulsion in the Gospel of John from:

  Abstract: When reading John 9, Martyn finds as blatantly anachronistic a key term in 9:22, ἀποσυνάγωγος (“from the synagogue”; also in 12:42 and 16:2a). Although in the narrative this term describes an event during Jesus’ earthly ministry, for Martyn (2003, 65) it is most certainly dealing with an event that could not have occurred until decades after Jesus’ life. Martyn is convinced that the first-century readers of the Fourth Gospel would have seen the “expulsion from the synagogue” term as an anachronistic insertion into the narrative. In many ways, the “expulsion from the synagogue” in 9:22 is the key to his<br>

  Book Title: Speak Thus-Christian Language in Church and World<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Hovey Craig R.<br>
  Abstract: In its various forms, speech is absolutely integral to the Christian mission. The gospel is a message, news that must be passed on if it is to be known by others. Nevertheless, the reality of God cannot be exhausted by Christian knowledge and Christian knowledge cannot be exhausted by our words. All the while, the philosophy of modernity has left Christianity an impoverished inheritance within which to think these things. In Speak Thus, Craig Hovey explores the possibilities and limits of Christian speaking. At times ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical, these essays go to the heart of what it means to be the church today. In practice, the Christian life often has a linguistic shape that surprisingly implicates and reveals the commitments of people like those who care for the sick or those who respond as peacemakers in the face of violence. Because learning to speak one way as opposed to another is a skill that must be learned, Christian speakers are also guides who bear witness to the importance of churches for passing on a felicity with Christian ways of speaking. Through constructive engagements with interlocutors like Ludwig Wittgenstein, George Lindbeck, Jeffrey Stout, Stanley Hauerwas, John Howard Yoder, Thomas Aquinas, and the theology of Radical Orthodoxy, Hovey offers a challenging vision of the church'able to speak with a confidence that only comes from a deep attentiveness to its own limitations while able to speak prophetically in a world weary of words.<br>

  CHAPTER 4  Metaphors We Die By from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16wdm5z">Speak Thus</a><br>
  Abstract: Caring for the ill is a great moral task that brings into sharp relief our convictions about life and death. Not only does such care place the caregiver in unavoidable proximity to profound questions, but also the acts of care themselves reveal the nature of deeply held assumptions. Even the language that forms our descriptions of illness indicates some level of how we conceive of illness; our descriptions of illness also indicate how we understand the significance of life when it is in good health. In short, the words used for illness carry strong interpretive and evaluative power.<br>

  Book Title: Keeping the Feast-Metaphors of Sacrifice in 1 Corinthians and Philippians<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Patterson Jane Lancaster<br>
  Abstract: Patterson uses cognitive metaphor theory to trace the apostle Paul's use of metaphors from the Jewish sacrificial system in his moral counsels to the Philippians and the Corinthians. In these letters, Paul moves from the known (the practice of sacrifice) to the unknown (how to live in accord with the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ). Patterson illustrates that the significant sacrificial metaphors in 1 Corinthians and Philippians are not derived from Jewish sacrifices of atonement, but rather from the Passover and sacrifices of thanksgiving. Attention to these metaphors demonstrates that imagery drawn from these sacrifices shapes the overall moral counsel of the letters, reveals more varied and nuanced interpretations of sacrificial references in Paul's letters, and sheds light on Paul's continuity with Jewish cultic practice.<br>

A research report from Gartner also foresees that the global gaming industry will even exceed USD $74 billion in 2011 and possibly reach USD $112 billion by 2015 (McCall and van der Meulen 2011).<br>

  Book Title: Mind in Architecture-Neuroscience, Embodiment, and the Future of Design<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Pallasmaa Juhani<br>
  Abstract: Although we spend more than ninety percent of our lives inside buildings, we understand very little about how the built environment affects our behavior, thoughts, emotions, and well-being. We are biological beings whose senses and neural systems have developed over millions of years; it stands to reason that research in the life sciences, particularly neuroscience, can offer compelling insights into the ways our buildings shape our interactions with the world. This expanded understanding can help architects design buildings that support both mind and body. In
      Mind in Architecture, leading thinkers from architecture and other disciplines, including neuroscience, cognitive science, psychiatry, and philosophy, explore what architecture and neuroscience can learn from each other. They offer historical context, examine the implications for current architectural practice and education, and imagine a neuroscientifically informed architecture of the future. Architecture is late in discovering the richness of neuroscientific research. As scientists were finding evidence for the bodily basis of mind and meaning, architecture was caught up in convoluted cerebral games that denied emotional and bodily reality altogether. This volume maps the extraordinary opportunity that engagement with cutting-edge neuroscience offers present-day architects.ContributorsThomas D. Albright, Michael Arbib, John Paul Eberhard, Melissa Farling, Vittorio Gallese, Alessandro Gattara, Mark L. Johnson, Harry Francis Mallgrave, Iain McGilchrist, Juhani Pallasmaa, Alberto Pérez-Gómez, Sarah Robinson<br>

  Abstract: Certainly, it is a particularly pressing issue in our Latin American historical moment and context, when in many countries, after secular independence, domination and oppression, sharpened by the struggle for survival, attempts to dignify life through reducing poverty and social inequality are tested.

  Book Title: Divination’s Grasp-African Encounters with the Almost Said<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Werbner Richard<br>
  Abstract: Richard Werbner takes readers on a journey though contemporary charismatic wisdom divination in southern Africa. Beginning with the silent language of the divinatory lots, Werbner deciphers the everyday, metaphorical, and poetic language that is used to reveal their meaning. Through Werbner's skillful interpretations of the language of divination, a picture of Tswapong moral imagination is revealed. Concerns about dignity and personal illumination, witchcraft, pollution, the anger of dead ancestors, as well as the nature of life, truth, cosmic harmony, being, and becoming emerge in this charged African setting.<br>

  Author(s) DEVISCH RENÉ<br>
  Abstract: Intercorporeality and the ethic of desire and evildoing, stripped of their Western modernist thought patterns and view of the person, are among the foci of anthropological and psychoanalytical efforts¹ that I have been undertaking for the last decade.² These were led by the following research questions: How may desire, which unknowingly takes hold of interrelated subjects, make someone either compassionate or madly envious and even maleficent? How much does desire inhabit intercorporeality and inspire close family members to either intensely share life and a communal mode of inhabiting the life world or deflate and undermine the physical and communal life<br>

  Author(s) CIEKAWY DIANE<br>
  Abstract: In discussions about spirit aggression and human agents of harm, Mijikenda,¹ whose lifeworld is centered in the coastal hinterland of Kenya, assert particular views about the importance of moral action. Their claims are imbedded in a complex of thought and practice that has been described by various works on Mijikenda religion, most notably by David Parkin in

  Author(s) O’LEARY PAUL<br>
  Abstract: Mass spectator sport is a prominent feature of modern social and cultural life. Since the late nineteenth century it has provided a mechanism for the creation of powerful and enduring group identities, focussed on neighbourhood and municipality, region and nation, empire and race. Equally importantly, sport has been a means of socializing individuals into what it means to be men and women in a particular society at a particular juncture in history. This potent conjunction of gender, nationality and race makes a study of the relationship between ethnic minorities and sport a particularly rewarding one, because the formation of group<br>

  Author(s) WILLIAMS CHARLOTTE<br>
  Abstract: The link between rural Wales and notions of authentic Welshness has been a long-standing theme in both the academic literature and in popular representations. The Welsh countryside and its imagined characteristics hold a very privileged place in dominant constructions of national identity. Myths of a peaceable and tolerant nation, deeply embedded in the national imaginary are rooted in an idealized Welsh rural community life that summons the trope of the gwerin, a particular form of localized communitarianism to express the values of egalitarianism, classlessness and internationalism. Myths are of course important to nation building but they also function as a<br>

  Abstract: The paradox of silence in literature has forever intrigued writers and philosophers. Among the many different types of silence, Beckett refers to the silence of what is being invoked indirectly, but not said explicitly, that is, the silence between phrases that we can hear in the intervals of a statement. This is a deeply literary silence not only because poetic language is generated by modes of indirection but also because, almost paradoxically, it is often this silence in the interstices of language that breathes life into literature, endowing it with the ability to engage readers with the limits of what<br>

The unorthodoxy of Wittgenstein emerges as much in his life as in his thought. For the reader unfamiliar with him, his writing<br>

  CHAPTER SIX  Political Subjectification, Mestizaje, and Globalization: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt183gxvs">Mestizaje and Globalization</a><br>
  Author(s) BARCHI FABRIZIO ARENAS<br>
  Abstract: Mestizajeis a complex and nuanced ideology. Of the notions that the social sciences treat, mestizaje is perhaps one of the more opaque—and loaded. The notion itself encompasses other ideas such as “race,” “culture,” “identity,” and “ethnicity” in fabricating its multiple applications in everyday social, political, and academic settings. These applications overlap each other, producing successive interpretations of what it may be that is being mixed in the mestizaje. These overlapping applications of mestizaje in everyday life all seem to be interwoven with the same thread: the different ways of dealing with diversity.<br>

  Book Title: Religion Without Redemption-Social Contradictions and Awakened Dreams in Latin America<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Löwy Michael<br>
  Abstract: The world’s eyes are on Latin America as a place of radical political inspiration and as an alternative to the neoliberal model. Each country in the region deals differently in its method of government, yet there are common cultural themes that tie the continent’s trajectory together. Religion without Redemption looks at the sociology of religion, political philosophy and the history of ideas of the continent, in an attempt to show how Western understanding fails to come close to a correct analysis of how and why political and economic characteristics work as they do. Luis Martínez Andrade focuses on how the centrality of religion for the people of Latin America has influenced how they interact with the changes in the modern economic system. Capitalism, for example, has taken on religious characteristics: it has sacred places of worship (the shopping mall) as well as its own prophets. Martínez Andrade discusses how this form of ‘cultural religion’ accompanies many aspects of life in a contradictory manner: not only does it fulfil the role of legitimating oppression, it also can be a powerful source of rebellion, unveiling thus a subversive side to the status quo. Religion Without Redemption advances the ideas of liberation theory into the 21st century, and challenges the provincialism to which many Latin American thinkers are usually consigned.<br>

  Prologue from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt183gzrq">Religion Without Redemption</a><br>
  Abstract: The essays that the reader now holds in her/his hands have been written at different latitudes but all hold the same origin. On the one hand, they were born out of rage and, on the other, out of hope. Rage due to the dire situation with which most of humanity is confronted and the terrible level of exploitation that brings both human life and the entire planet to the edge of destruction. This should not be interpreted as some naïve irritation, commonly found among those ‘warm souls’ who, when watching children die of hunger, cry for the suffering of the<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt183gzrq">Religion Without Redemption</a><br>
  Abstract: The sixteenth century shaped not only the identity of what would later become Latin America but also laid the basis for the emergence of the capitalist world-system (Wallerstein, 1999), the emergence of the coloniality of power (Quijano, 2000) and the advent of modernity (Dussel, 1994). These events profoundly influenced the endogenous and exogenous dynamics of different societies and human groups. In the late fifteenth century, and at the dawn of the sixteenth century, such transcendental phenomena were generated in everyday life around the world (

Uncertainty, or ambivalence, became a standard feature (some would say an affectation) of intellectual life, certainly in the humanities and social sciences; although trends representing a more positivist view, seeking less equivocal answers to the perennial questions of anthropology, were also on the rise.

  Book Title: Small Places, Large Issues-An Introduction to Social and Cultural Anthropology (Fourth Edition)<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Eriksen Thomas Hylland<br>
  Abstract: This concise introduction to social and cultural anthropology has become a modern classic, revealing the rich global variation in social life and culture. The text provides a clear overview of anthropology, focusing on central topics such as kinship, ethnicity, ritual and political systems, offering a wealth of examples that demonstrate the enormous scope of anthropology and the importance of a comparative perspective. Unlike other texts on the subject, Small Places, Large Issues incorporates the anthropology of complex modern societies. Using reviews of key monographs to illustrate his argument, Eriksen's lucid and accessible text remains an established introductory text in anthropology. This new, fourth edition is updated throughout and increases the emphasis on the interdependence of human worlds. There is a new discussion of the new influence cultural studies and natural science on anthropology. Effortless bridging the perceived gap between "classic" and "contemporary" anthropology, Small Places, Large Issues is as essential to anthropology undergraduates as ever.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt183p184">Small Places, Large Issues</a><br>
  Abstract: The idea that there is an interrelationship between ecological conditions and ways of life can be traced back to the ancient Greeks, and it was also prevalent in Enlightenment thought in the mid eighteenth century (for instance in Montesquieu and in the Marquis de Sade’s non-pornographic writings). Montesquieu, like many others, held that the main cause of Europe’s technological and scientific advances was the harsh climate, which required the inhabitants to be inventive and sharp-witted to survive. Two centuries later, the human geographer Ellsworth Huntington (1945) argued for climatic determinism in an original study where he shows, among other things,<br>

For officers, the alarm bell signalled an emergency where life itself could be at stake. When it rang, the establishment appeared to freeze for a second before bursting into action.

  Abstract: Anthropology’s World, as in the title of this book, can mean at least two things. On the one hand it is anthropology as a social world in itself—the community of a discipline, with its internal social relationships, its ideas and practices. On the other hand, anthropology’s world is the wider outside world to which the discipline must relate in various ways. For anthropology, which more than any other discipline may have a constant ambition to be global in its scope, this involves humanity everywhere, and the attempt to understand its variety of ways of life and thought and its<br>

  Abstract: Psycho-social studies is an emerging tradition that very much focuses on emotion and affect to illuminate some of the core issues in the social sciences. Issues such as identity construction, dilemmas in public service sectors and the experience of rapid social change. It recognises that the split between individual and society, sociology and psychology is now unhelpful if we are to understand social and psychological phenomena. It therefore seeks to research beneath the surface using both psychoanalytic and sociological ideas using innovative new methodologies including the use of free association, biographical life history interviews and the development of psychoanalytic fieldwork.<br>

  Book Title: Fredrik Barth-An Intellectual Biography<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Garsten Christina<br>
  Abstract: Fredrik Barth is one of the towering figures of twentieth-century anthropology. This intellectual history traces the development of Barth’s ideas and explores the substance of his contributions. In an accessible style, Thomas Eriksen’s biographical study reveals the magic of ethnography to professional anthropologists and non-practitioners alike. Exploring his six decade career, it follows Barth from early ecological studies in Pakistan, to political studies in Iran, to groundbreaking fieldwork in Norway, New Guinea, Bali and Bhutan. Eriksen argues that Barth's voracious appetite for fieldwork holds the key to understanding his remarkable intellectual development and the insights it produced. The book raises many of the same questions that emerge from Barth's own work - of unity and diversity, of culture and relativism, of art and science. Thomas Eriksen is himself a major contributor to the study of anthropology, as well as a distinguished educator, and is therefore ideally placed to introduce the life and work of Fredrik Barth. This will surely be the definitive book on its subject for many years to come.<br>

  Abstract: When Barth arrived in Bergen, its fifteen-year-old university was located on a low hill near the city centre. Norwegian society, with its rural history and modern national identity associated with nature and rural life, has serious difficulties in handling urbanity – with Bergen a main exception. The main campus in Trondheim is located in an open field about 10 kilometres from the city, the University of Tromsø is closer to the airport than to the city, and in Oslo most of the departments are at Blindern, surrounded by apple trees and middle-class suburban bliss.

  Abstract: Bali was not an obvious next stop in Barth’s life as an ethnographer. While he would have liked to go to Vanuatu, Bali had been Wikan’s preference. One reason for Barth’s initial doubt was the fact that Bali had been studied by good anthropologists previously. Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson had been there in the 1940s, Clifford Geertz in the 1960s. The British anthropologist Mark Hobart was about to devote a lifetime of study to Bali. And there were others. Barth sensed that others had already been there and taken the prime cuts.<br>

  Book Title: Mexico in Verse-A History of Music, Rhyme, and Power<br>
  Publisher: University of Arizona Press<br>
  Author(s): BEEZLEY WILLIAM H.<br>
  Abstract: The history of Mexico is spoken in the voice of ordinary people. In rhymed verse and mariachi song, in letters of romance and whispered words in the cantina, the heart and soul of a nation is revealed in all its intimacy and authenticity.
      Mexico in Verse, edited by Stephen Neufeld and Michael Matthews, examines Mexican history through its poetry and music, the spoken and the written word.Focusing on modern Mexico, from 1840 to the 1980s, this volume examines the cultural venues in which people articulated their understanding of the social, political, and economic change they witnessed taking place during times of tremendous upheaval, such as the Mexican-American War, the Porfiriato, and the Mexican Revolution. The words of diverse peoples-people of the street, of the field, of the cantinas-reveal the development of the modern nation. Neufeld and Matthews have chosen sources so far unexplored by Mexicanist scholars in order to investigate the ways that individuals interpreted-whether resisting or reinforcing-official narratives about formative historical moments.The contributors offer new research that reveals how different social groups interpreted and understood the Mexican experience. The collected essays cover a wide range of topics: military life, railroad accidents, religious upheaval, children's literature, alcohol consumption, and the 1985 earthquake. Each chapter provides a translated song or poem that encourages readers to participate in the interpretive practice of historical research and cultural scholarship. In this regard,Mexico in Verseserves both as a volume of collected essays and as a classroom-ready primary document reader.<br>

  Author(s) Beezley William H.<br>
  Abstract: Blaring sounds have accompanied life in Mexico since the Spanish arrived in 1521. The clamor of church bells, merchant squares, military drums, and encouraging shouts of mule drivers and coachmen have become increasingly shrill in later centuries with political and advertising loudspeakers mounted on VWs, screaming radios, and deafening traffic jams, with drivers who understand the green light as “Honk your horn!” This teeth-clenching stridency has captured the attention of residents and visitors, and been described by authors, journalists, and foreign travelers who emphasize dissonance as symptomatic of the multiethnic society and crushing traffic.<br>

  Author(s) Neufeld Stephen<br>
  Abstract: The patio of the barracks rang with amateur song most ordinary nights in Mexico’s late nineteenth century. Improvised and regimental instruments accompanied the enthusiastic men and women of the army as they entertained themselves performing corridos (folk songs) about life, love, and war. Meanwhile, in small chambers some three stories above, young officers set pen to paper creating verse and poetry as an exercise in cultivation and culture. Quiet reflections of their own were nonetheless interrupted or perhaps inspired by the boisterous tunes that floated up from below. The unique mixtures of these peoples, and their verses, sheds light on<br>

  Abstract: The recent resurgence of interest in cosmopolitanism has been characterized by a proliferation of overlapping definitions of this concept. Thus, while concluding that cosmopolitanism is still an imprecise concept that refers to a great variety of ‘often unfinished projects’, Ulf Hannerz nonetheless notes that it ‘has to do with a sense of the world as one’ (2007: 83–84). Pnina Werbner similarly invokes the Greek roots of the term as a ‘citizen of the world’ to argue that ‘at its most basic, cosmopolitanism is about reaching out across cultural differences through dialogue, aesthetic enjoyment, and respect; of living together with<br>

  Abstract: The human condition, according to Georg Simmel (1971), could be truly apprehended only by taking account of a certain ‘dialectical circuitry’ which underlay experience and gave human life a sense of passage and progress. The characteristic human experience concerned ‘co-present dualisms’: public and private, rule and practice, antagonism and solidarity, freedom and constraint, rebelliousness and compliance, creativeness and structure. Here were paired phenomena one element of which presupposed the second element which yet, in turn, presupposed the first; one element influenced the second element which yet, in turn, influenced the first.

  Abstract: In his obituary of Ernest Gellner (1925–1996), Tom Nairn (1996) suggests that Gellner’s first academic appointment, a Demonstratorship in Moral Philosophy at Edinburgh University between 1947 and 1949, may have had a formative influence upon him. Not only did Gellner become aware of how a geographical periphery could be a centre of civilization (
                  polisvis-à-viscosmos) but also how the Scottish Enlightenment idea of a civil society – of ‘society’ as distinct from ‘culture’ – could be rehabilitated so as to illuminate contemporary conditions of political liberty.

  Abstract: “The Nation,” says Jacques Maritain, “is one of the most important, perhaps the most complex and complete community engendered by civilized life.”² For certain purposes a modern nation, this lofty example of human development, can usefully be considered as one single entity. But often national activities can best be understood if some of the constituent elements of the nation are examined first. This is particularly true in the case of France, where the fabric of historical evolution is rich with the multicolored threads of divergent groups and ideologies.<br>

  Abstract: Outside of a narrow range of dogma, Catholics disagree among themselves on practically everything relating to social and temporal life. Yet there are certain social principles which have very widespread acceptance among the vast majority of Catholics in France. Usually most members of the Hierarchy endorse these principles, though they are not considered as Church dogma. In fact, they have become so generally identified with Catholicism that Catholics with different views must usually explain their reasons for going against the crowd.<br>

  Abstract: In an essay on Oxford Street, the longtime center of London’s gaudy, cut-price shopping district, Virginia Woolf casually remarks that “the charm of modern London is that it is not built to last; it is built to pass.” Woolf surprisingly chooses Oxford Street, rather than one of London’s innumerable historic sites, as an emblem of the capital precisely because it foregrounds the transitory qualities of modern urban life. London’s historic houses and monuments, bestowed on the city by aristocratic patrons, “required the illusion of permanence.” By contrast, Woolf delights in the ephemerality of the city’s tacky, cacophonous, ostentatious retail industry<br>

The extreme emotions of a romantic adolescence, the practical jokes of a young poet and, later, an extravagant self-indulgence, whether in the consumption of cigarettes or in the socially less acceptable tastes of the libertine, all of these excesses in Louӱs’s life and character are reflected in his writing, both in the critically acclaimed published canon and in the erotic works<br>

There has been a clear move from the study of working-class culture to the aesthetics of everyday life. While Birmingham certainly flirted with abstract structural Marxism, their interests lay more in the direction of the concrete, since they, unlike many Marxist sociologists, were trying to gain a purchase on reality in the street, so to speak – although one may have reservations about the nature of their ethnography, which, except for some of the research reports, was explicitly focused<br>

Like others who had served during the war, he had to make the complex and problematic adjustment to civilian life, which included a further reassessment of the war and his role therein. The war had undoubtedly provided him with a focus and sense of purpose, notwithstanding his changing relationship with and responses to the conflict, and his wartime writings had added to the reputation as a realist writer that he had gained following the publication of<br>

  Book Title: Leaving the North-Migration and Memory, Northern Ireland 1921–2011<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): Trew Johanne Devlin<br>
  Abstract: Leaving the North is the first book that provides a comprehensive survey of Northern Ireland migration since 1921. Based largely on the personal memories of emigrants who left Northern Ireland from the 1920s to the 2000s, approximately half of whom eventually returned, the book traces their multigenerational experiences of leaving Northern Ireland and adapting to life abroad, with some later returning to a society still mired in conflict. Contextualised by a review of the statistical and policy record, the emigrants’ stories reveal that contrary to its well-worn image as an inward-looking place – 'such narrow ground' – Northern Ireland has a rather dynamic migration history, demonstrating that its people have long been looking outward as well as inward, well connected with the wider world. But how many departed and where did they go? And what of the Northern Ireland Diaspora? How has the view of the ‘troubled’ homeland from abroad, especially among expatriates, contributed to progress along the road to peace? In addressing these questions, the book treats the relationship between migration, sectarianism and conflict, immigration and racism, repatriation and the Peace Process, with particular attention to the experience of Northern Ireland migrants in the two principal receiving societies – Britain and Canada. With the emigration of young people once again on the increase due to the economic downturn, it is perhaps timely to learn from the experiences of the people who have been ‘leaving the North’ over many decades; not only to acknowledge their departure but in the hope that we might better understand the challenges and opportunities that migration and Diaspora can present.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt18mbcf8">Leaving the North</a><br>
  Abstract: ‘Whose diaspora, whose migration, whose identity?’ (Mac Einrí and Lambkin, 2002) remain uncomfortable questions in post-partition Ireland. For although the concept of diaspora has proliferated in academic discourses of migration and identity since the 1990s, most often its application in the Irish context as a ‘victim’ diaspora (Cohen, 1997) has referred principally to the large number of famine emigrants, mostly Catholics and successive chain migrations of that group, primarily to the United States from 1845 to 1870.² The migration of Protestants from Ireland has tended to be set apart in an often partisan and somewhat marginalised literature on the Scotch-Irish<br>

  Abstract: Marie, a woman in her late sixties, grew up in the prosperous south Dublin suburb of Blackrock. Her mother, Catherine, born into a Fermanagh farming family that worshiped in a Plymouth Brethren congregation, had decided at the age of eighteen after a life-threatening experience to convert to Catholicism. As a result, Catherine was expelled from the family home in Fermanagh forbidden ever to return, so she travelled to Dublin where she made her conversion official and subsequently married a man from a middle-class Catholic family. Marie was born the following year but when only two years old, her mother Catherine<br>

  Book Title: The Trouble with Community-Anthropological Reflections on Movement, Identity and Collectivity<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Mitchell Jon P.<br>
  Abstract: 'Community' is one of social science's longest-standing concepts. The assumption, of much social science, has been that it is in communities -- and to communities -- that human individuals, as social and cultural beings, belong. Communities are said to embody that interactive environment from which individuals' identities and senses of self derive, and in which they continue to dwell. The trouble with 'community' is that this is not necessarily so; the personal social networks of individuals' actual experience crosscut collective categories, situations and institutions. Communities can prove unviable or imprisoning; the reality of community life and identity can often be very different from the ideology and the ideal. In this provocative new book, anthropologists Vered Amit and Nigel Rapport draw on their various ethnographic experiences to reappraise the concept and the reality of 'community', in the light of globalization, religious fundamentalism, identity politics, and renascent localisms. How might anthropology better apprehend social identities which are intrinsically plural, transgressive and ironic? What has anthropology to say about the way in which civil society might hope to accommodate the on-going construction and the rightful expression of such migrant identities? Nigel Rapport and Vered Amit give their own answers to these questions before entering into dialogue to assess each other's positions. Nigel Rapport is Professor of Anthropological and Philosophical Studies at the University of St. Andrews. He is author of Transcendent Individual (1997). Vered Amit is an Associate Professor at Concordia University in Montreal. She is the editor of Realizing Community (2002).<br>

This shift in the ‘social field’ as a whole, epitomised by the rise of the ‘progressive fractions’ of France’s bourgeoisie, had also manifested itself in a series of homologous shifts in a range of other fields or sub-fields. Thus, the rise of the ‘new bourgeoisie’ and their allies, the ‘new petty bourgeoisie’, was mirrored in the political field in the rise of ‘reconverted conservatism’ as the new dominant ideology, in the educational<br>

  Abstract: Tinkerers or pundits, visionaries or eccentrics, oddballs sometimes make their own archives. Surprisingly, the archives of some of history’s most anomalous figures are rarely themselves anomalous but instead come to appear exemplary because their organizing figures have emerged in some way from the pack. Oddball personae collect followings; their followers, in turn, are often the ones left in charge of collecting the oddballs’ life’s work, their leavings. The Kinsey archives, no less than the papers of the Marquis de Sade or the drawings of Adolf Wölfli, may now be managed by professional librarians, but they were once gathered and conserved<br>

Comparing “the vampire squid from hell” andHomo sapiens sapiens,Flusser proposes a fantastic convergence that links the odd existence of a tentacled life-form, complexly equipped for probing the deep ocean, to the inhuman consequences of our emerging system of new media. Humans increasingly approximate the strategies of invertebrate life, he writes: “As our interest in objects began to wane, we created media that have enabled us to rape human brains, forcing them to store immaterial information.

  Abstract: The texts by Benjamin, Nancy, Serres, Debray, and Peters are all extremely different. It may seem peculiar to invoke these authors as ‘introductions’ to the theme of mediality when only the last one actually discusses concrete media, yet this is quite deliberate. I want to debate the question of ‘What is a medium?’ from the very beginning in the context of mediality. ‘Mediality’ does not refer to media that are distinct from each other, like sound, text, and image, but rather its aim is to describe an elementary dimension of human life and culture.¹<br>

Our basic assumption is that this is one process, one natural hiMstory—nature’s epic. We can speak of it as a drama in several acts<br>

                  petite maisonis an exemplary site of erotic affect. In this novelette, an aristocrat wagers with a young, beautiful woman that his little house can convince her to fall in love with him.¹ Not merely fictional licence, this little house was based on contemporary petites maisons where love affairs and libertinage were conducted. Gaillard de la Boissière’s pavilion (1751), designed by Antoine-Mathieu Le Carpentier and considered by Jacques-François Blondel to be one of the best architectural examples of its kind, was the real-life inspiration for Bastide’s setting.² Although<br>

  Author(s) Pérez-Gómez Alberto<br>
  Abstract: THE ARCHITECT ANTONIO DI PIERO AVERLINO (ca 1400–1469 ) characterized his life’s work rhetorically by adopting the pseudonym Il Filarete, coupling the Greek words
                  philiaandaretéto refer to himself as a lover of virtue. In the mid-fifteenth century he became the first “modern” to design an ideal city in its totality, founded from scratch in a natural site without history. This ideal city, named Sforzinda after his patron Francesco Sforza, is the central topic of hisTrattato di architettura.¹ Although the operation that Filarete describes has been interpreted generally as a precursor of rational planning, it is<br>

  Book Title: Lex Crucis-Soteriology and the Stages of Meaning<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress, Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Loewe William P.<br>
  Abstract: What is the true story of God and humankind, and how does that story become a saving story? These are pivotal questions that constitute the narratives Christians tell about themselves, their values, and how the Christian life is to be lived. In shaping those stories into a coherent, intelligible framework that provides comprehensive meaning, soteriology—the doctrine of redemption—developed as a keystone to Christian consciousness. This study investigates that development of the soteriological tradition. Employing Bernard Lonergan’s notion of the stages of meaning as a hermeneutic, the volume traces the origins of soteriology in the early Christian tradition represented by Irenaeus to its establishment as a systematic theory in Anselm, Aquinas, and subsequent developments in the Protestant tradition of Luther and Schleiermacher. The author concludes with a constructive exploration of Lonergan’s own work on the question of soteriology that overcomes the modernist distortions that hinder Schleiermacher’s account and offers an articulation of the dynamics of Christian conversion that opens onto the social, cultural, and political mediations of redemption necessary for the contemporary age.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt19qgg2f">Ways of the Word</a><br>
  Author(s) Powery Luke A.<br>
  Abstract: Preaching is risky business. It is risky because, frankly, its divine aims are impossible to achieve, humanly speaking. There is no set of rules any of us can follow, no book we can read (this one included), that guarantees that when you step up to a pulpit and open your mouth, the words that reach listeners will be a word that is God’s own. We can speak with consummate rhetorical skill of things theological, but only God’s animating Spirit makes our preaching a life-transforming, world-changing message.<br>

  Author(s) Powery Luke A.<br>
  Abstract: It may not always be obvious to human eyes, but to the One who sees the heart as an altar, it is clear that what is inside preachers is just as important as what comes outside of preachers through words and actions. In the long view of life, it may be possible to discover that an altered life is an altar-ed life, though in the micro-moments of the everyday this may be hard to discern. Even more, when it comes to preaching, we may not be so sure what impact the spiritual life truly has on our preaching and what<br>

  Book Title: Engaging Bonhoeffer-The Impact and Influence of Bonhoeffer's Life and Thought<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortres<br>
  Author(s): ZIEGLER PHILIP G.<br>
  Abstract: Engaging Bonhoeffer documents the extraordinary impact of Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s life and writing on later thought. Despite his lasting legacy, little substantial scholarship has been conducted in this area. In this magisterial collection, leading international scholars fill this striking gap and critically demonstrate the ways in which Bonhoeffer has been one of the most inspirational writers of the twentieth century. In addition to shedding light on the different trajectories that Bonhoeffer’s work may forge, Engaging Bonhoeffer offers a critical window through which to view the ideas of many leading theological voices.<br>

  Abstract: What high praise for a German male theologian by a German female theologian whom others praise in quite similar terms! But what of Bonhoeffer’s life and work did she have in mind when she penned those words? As this this essay will show, Dorothee Soelle engaged with a wide range of Bonhoeffer’s thought and, as with many other liberational theologians, found particular inspiration in his prison theology.² This engagement was never at the expense of her own original and often provocative thoughts, or her critical reflections on Bonhoeffer’s work. However, in Bonhoeffer Soelle found a kindred spirit whose critique of<br>

  Author(s) Schliesser Christine<br>
  Abstract: “My attitude towards life or what is nowadays called spirituality.” This was Jürgen Moltmann’s answer when asked what areas of his own theology he felt were most prominently impacted by Dietrich Bonhoeffer.¹ As the interview continued, Moltmann offered Bonhoeffer the highest of praise, particularly
                  Letters and Papers from Prison, which he called an “eye-opener”² in its ideas of this-worldliness, the polyphony of life, and thecantus firmus. What is strikingly clear, in both has been a steady companion on Moltmann’s theological path.³ Not a companion that he would always agree with. Far from that. But one that he has enjoyed<br>

  Author(s) Ziegler Philip G.<br>
  Abstract: Bonhoeffer lived out much of his theological existence in eastern Germany. He was a man of wide international and ecumenical vision. Yet, between his birth in Breslau (now Wroclaw, Poland) in 1906 and his terminal imprisonment in Berlin in 1943–45, the better part of Bonheoffer’s life and work had its centre of gravity in the historic Prussian city of Berlin and the eastern German provinces of Silesia, Brandenburg, and Pomerania. It was at the behest of the Old Prussian Union Council of Brethren that he led the illegal Confessing Church seminary at Zingst/Finkenwalde and subsequent collective pastorates in “the<br>

  Book Title: Quiet Powers of the Possible: Interviews in Contemporary French Phenomenology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): HACKETT W. CHRIS<br>
  Abstract: Quiet Powers of the Possible offers an excellent introduction to contemporary French phenomenology through a series of interviews with its most prominent figures. Guided by rigorous questions that push into the most important aspects of the latest phenomenological research, the book gives readers a comprehensive sense of each thinker's intellectual history, motivations, and philosophical commitments. The book introduces readers to debates that have not previously been accessible to the English-speaking world, such as the growing interest in the phenomenological concept of life in its affective and even vital dimensions, the emerging dialogue with the analytic philosophy of mind and language, and reassessments of the so-called theological turn. The diversity of approaches collected here has its origin in a deeper debate about the conceptual and historical foundations of phenomenology itself. In this way the book offers the most accessible and wide-ranging introduction to French phenomenology to have appeared in the English-speaking world to date.<br>

  Book Title: Quiet Powers of the Possible: Interviews in Contemporary French Phenomenology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): HACKETT W. CHRIS<br>
  Abstract: Quiet Powers of the Possible offers an excellent introduction to contemporary French phenomenology through a series of interviews with its most prominent figures. Guided by rigorous questions that push into the most important aspects of the latest phenomenological research, the book gives readers a comprehensive sense of each thinker's intellectual history, motivations, and philosophical commitments. The book introduces readers to debates that have not previously been accessible to the English-speaking world, such as the growing interest in the phenomenological concept of life in its affective and even vital dimensions, the emerging dialogue with the analytic philosophy of mind and language, and reassessments of the so-called theological turn. The diversity of approaches collected here has its origin in a deeper debate about the conceptual and historical foundations of phenomenology itself. In this way the book offers the most accessible and wide-ranging introduction to French phenomenology to have appeared in the English-speaking world to date.<br>

  Author(s) Pihlström Sami<br>
  Abstract: This chapter will examine the relation between religion and morality from a pragmatist point of view, focusing on the fundamental importance of a certain kind of attitude toward the reality of evil and suffering based on Jamesian pragmatism. My discussion differs from many other treatments of pragmatist philosophy of religion and moral philosophy due to what might be called its “via negativa” methodology. I am not trying to positively characterize, or to interpret James’s characterizations of, such notions as the “good life,” the “goods,” or “fruits” of religious life and religious experiences—even though I do regard (Jamesian) pragmatism as<br>

  Author(s) Schlette Magnus<br>
  Abstract: In his grand narration about the rise of the secular age, Charles Taylor called the optionalization of an exclusively innerworldly orientation toward life “the great invention of the West.” This historical innovation, according to Taylor, is the concept of “an immanent order in Nature, whose working could be systematically understood and explained on its own terms, leaving open the question whether this whole order had a deeper significance, and whether, if it did, we should infer a transcendent Creator beyond it. This notion of the ‘immanent’ involved denying—or at least isolating and problematizing—any form of interpenetration between the<br>

  THEORY OF RELIGION IN A PRAGMATIC PHILOSOPHICAL THEOLOGY from:

  Author(s) Neville Robert Cummings<br>
  Abstract: I write here not as a scholar of pragmatism but as a pragmatic philosophical theologian with a theory of religion. The first step in the pragmatic theory is to propose a definition of religion intended as a hypothesis for organizing the inquiry. The hypothesis is that
                  religion is human engagement of ultimacy expressed in cognitive articulations, existential responses to ultimacy that give ultimate definition to the individual, and patterns of life and ritual in the face of ultimacy.¹ Obvious topics of the inquiry into religion will have to include: (1) ultimacy or ultimate reality in the several senses included in<br>

  Abstract: By the middle of the nineteenth century, the Catholic Church faced serious challenges from competing ideologies, including Protestantism, liberalism, Marxism, and anarchism. These new ideas and actors posed a real threat to the Catholic Church’s privileges and moral influence in Latin America. Throughout the region, these challenges often took the form of debates over freedom of religion, the role of religion in state educational systems, civil marriage, and secular cemeteries. They were exacerbated by the proliferation of secular, and sometimes even overtly anti-Catholic, political parties. As an institution, the church had to revise its previous strategy of either condemning or<br>

  Abstract: If anxiety is an aspect of human experience that testifies to a darkness we sense threatening to envelop us—just over the horizon, perhaps, or crouching under the bed (biding its time), the worst moments are those when one’s inchoate (one hopes, sometimes in vain, irrational) fears become real, are concretized in external experience. At these junctures, the most profound manifestation of human darkness is evidenced in the horror that touches on human life, even on the happiest lives, to some degree, and that at its worst would seem to destroy all possibility of hope.

  Book Title: Radical Theology-An Essay on Faith and Theology in the Twenty-First Century<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Dalferth Ingolf U.<br>
  Abstract: Ingolf U. Dalferth develops a “radical theology" that unfolds the orienting strength of faith for human life from the event of God’s presence to every present. In a concise and clear manner, Dalferth outlines the theological and philosophical approaches to hermeneutics in the modern era, in order to promote a convincing and defensible theology for the twenty-first century, critically carrying on Martin Heidegger and Rudolf Bultmann, without forgetting Karl Barth. The result of his reconstruction is a “radical theology" that neither glorifies premodern theology in an antimodern attitude nor seeks a mystical deepening of the secular, but argues for a radical change in theological perspective of the possible. In doing so, theology unfolds “limit concepts" that restrict the claims of science and philosophy critically, and develops “ideas of orientation" that illumine the ways in which human life is understood and lived in radically new ways in faith. From here, Dalferth unfolds the reality of revelation and the Christian sense of an unconditional hope that fundamentally transcends all beliefs based on mundane realities and orients the world on something beyond its own temporal horizon—its loving Creator.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1b3t751">Exodus and Resurrection</a><br>
  Abstract: The one God of Israel who speaks and acts through Word and Spirit is intimately identified by and with Israel’s life. Can Israel’s Scripture accommodate the gospel so that it is seen that this same God, the God of Israel, speaks by Word and Spirit in and through Jesus Christ? The doctrine of the Trinity is the church’s emphatic answer to this question. In contrast to some assumptions, Jenson insists that the church’s Trinitarianism does not in fact depart from Israel’s interpretation of God.² This is to be observed in the shape of the early Christian mission where primal Trinitarianism<br>

  Book Title: Into the Far Country-Karl Barth and the Modern Subject<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Long D. Stephen<br>
  Abstract: Into the Far Country is an investigation of Karl Barth’s response to modernity as seen through the prism of the subject under judgment. By suggesting that Barth offers a form of theological resistance to the Enlightenment’s construal of human subjectivity as “absolute," this piece offers a way of talking about the formation of human persons as the process of being kenotically laid bare before the cross and resurrection of Christ. It does so by reevaluating the relationship between Barth and modernity, making the case that Barth understands Protestantism to have become the agent of its own demise by capitulating to modernity’s insistence on the axiomatic priority of the isolated Cartesian ego. Conversations are hosted with figures including Fyodor Dostoevsky, Rowan Williams, Gillian Rose and Donald MacKinnon in the service of elucidating an account of the human person liberated from captivity to what Barth names “self-judgment," and freed for creative participation in the super-abundant source of life that is the prayerful movement from the Son to the Father in the Spirit. Therefore, an account of Barth’s theology is offered that is deeply concerned with the triune God’s revelatory presence as that which drives the community into the crucible of difficulty that is the life of kenotic dispossession.<br>

  Abstract: Father Zosima’s discourses, following in the wake of Ivan Karamazov’s tirade against the apparent impotence of Christ, detail a life lived out of a particular set of convictions about the world and its ground. Zosima, approaching immanent death, sits with his most faithful friends and declares he wishes to “pour out his soul” to them once more.¹ His discourses, in the first instance, narrate various encounters, only after which we are privy to talks and homilies reflecting on the shape of human life.

  Abstract: Judgment involves us in all manner of districts of human life and discourse; aesthetic, social, moral, and political judgments all vary in one way or another in shape and consequence. As a political matter the question of judgment inevitably binds us up in the exchange of speech, and therefore the generation of shared meaning.¹ Judgment is executed in speech relations. To execute a judgment, therefore, is to determine in relation why any existing state of affairs is, or is not, conducive to human flourishing. Accordingly, to have the capacity to exercise one’s judgment is to be a social creature. To<br>

  4  Resurrection, Life in Divine Plenitude: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1b3t7jq">Into the Far Country</a><br>
  Abstract: At the heart of modernity lies a diremption between the rational and the historical, the universal and the particular. Reason confidently calls into doubt the historical enterprise, and so the possibility of a historical ground for truth. The unavailability of the historical, near or far, to the rational subject calls into radical doubt narrative forms that give shape to human life. So it is that G. E. Lessing can axiomatically declare that, “
                  contingent truths of history can never become the proof of necessary truths of reason.”¹ The historical cannot form a point of departure, for the historical remains in flux,<br>

  Book Title: Theology in the Flesh-How Embodiment and Culture Shape the Way We Think about Truth, Morality, and God<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Sanders John<br>
  Abstract: Metaphors and other mental tools are used to reason (not just speak) about God, salvation, truth, and morality. Figurative language structures our theological and moral reasoning in powerful ways. This book uses an approach known as cognitive linguistics to explore the incredibly rich ways our conceptual tools, derived from embodied life and culture, shape the way we understand Christian teachings and practices. The cognitive revolution has generated amazing insights into how human minds make sense of the world. This book applies these insights to the ways Christians think about topics such as God, justice, sin, and salvation. It shows that Christians often share a set of very general ideas but disagree on what the Bible means or the moral stances we should take. It explains why Christians often develop a number of appropriate but sometimes incompatible ways to understand the Bible and various doctrines. It assists Christians in understanding those with whom they disagree. Hopefully, simply better understanding how and why people think the way they do will foster better dialogue and greater humility.<br>

  Abstract: In a letter to F.

And considering the fact that in the past few centuries the Persian literary tradition has had many chances to experience this “best subject,” it is reasonable to expect that many great works of Persian war literature have been<br>

  Abstract: While religious and theological questions have seen a renewed interest within critical theory, metaphysics still remains under suspicion when it is not, as is so often the case in contemporary critical theory, considered a matter of little consequence. Similarly, Walter Benjamin’s drawing upon theological tropes as the conceptual framework for theorizing history and life is no longer met with criticism but rather is widely embraced and harnessed as a theoretical resource for political and ethical thought. However, as obvious as it is that Benjamin’s work is shot through with theological tropes and concepts, it proves more difficult to reflect systematically<br>

  Abstract: Fidelity certainly does not rank among the central themes of Walter Benjamin’s work.¹ Likewise, it has garnered little attention in critical reception of his work so far—one will mostly look in vain for the term in the indexes of scholarly works on Benjamin.² The word nevertheless occupies a crucial position in Benjamin’s conception of life. It appears to have played an indispensable role in the elaboration of a fundamental facet of Benjamin’s thought: the double determination of human life as both creaturely (or natural) and supernatural, and thus of a concept of life derived from its relationship to these<br>

  Book Title: The Adventures of Jonathan Dennis-Bicultural Film Archiving Practice in Aotearoa New Zealand<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kelly Emma Jean<br>
  Abstract: Jonathan Dennis (1953-2002), was the creative and talented founding director of the New Zealand Film Archive. As a Pakeha (non-Maori/indigenous New Zealander) with a strong sense of social justice, Dennis became a conduit for tension and debate over the preservation and presentation of indigenous and non-indigenous film archival materials from the time the Archive opened in 1981. His work resulted in a film archive and curatorship practice which differed significantly from that of the North American and European archives he originally sought to emulate. He supported a philosophical shift in archival practice by engaging indigenous peoples in developing creative and innovative exhibitions from the 1980s until his death, recognizing that much of the expertise required to work with archival materials rested with the communities outside archival walls. This book presents new interviews gathered by the author, as well as an examination of existing interviews, films and broadcasts about and with Jonathan Dennis, to consider the narrative of a life and work in relation to film archiving.<br>

  Book Title: Narration, Identity, and Historical Consciousness-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Straub Jürgen<br>
  Abstract: A generally acknowledged characteristic of modern life, namely the temporalization of experience, inextricable from our intensified experience of contingency and difference, has until now remained largely outside psychology's purview. Wherever questions about the development, structure, and function of the concept of time have been posed - for example by Piaget and other founders of genetic structuralism - they have been concerned predominantly with concepts of "physical", chronometrical time, and related concepts (e.g., "velocity"). All the contributions to the present volume attempt to close this gap. A larger number are especially interested in the narration of stories. Overviews of the relevant literature, as well as empirical case studies, appear alongside theoretical and methodological reflections. Most contributions refer to specifically historical phenomena and meaning-constructions. Some touch on the subjects of biographical memory and biographical constructions of reality. Of all the various affinities between the contributions collected here, the most important is their consistent attention to issues of the constitution and representation of temporal experience.<br>

  Book Title: Narration, Identity, and Historical Consciousness-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Straub Jürgen<br>
  Abstract: A generally acknowledged characteristic of modern life, namely the temporalization of experience, inextricable from our intensified experience of contingency and difference, has until now remained largely outside psychology's purview. Wherever questions about the development, structure, and function of the concept of time have been posed - for example by Piaget and other founders of genetic structuralism - they have been concerned predominantly with concepts of "physical", chronometrical time, and related concepts (e.g., "velocity"). All the contributions to the present volume attempt to close this gap. A larger number are especially interested in the narration of stories. Overviews of the relevant literature, as well as empirical case studies, appear alongside theoretical and methodological reflections. Most contributions refer to specifically historical phenomena and meaning-constructions. Some touch on the subjects of biographical memory and biographical constructions of reality. Of all the various affinities between the contributions collected here, the most important is their consistent attention to issues of the constitution and representation of temporal experience.<br>

  Chapter 11  Dangerous Liaison from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1btbwzh">Sartre Against Stalinism</a><br>
  Abstract: Sartre’s four-year romance with the PCF between 1952 and 1956 was not the most creditable period of his life, and it was certainly the one that provided most ammunition to his anti-Communist critics. A great many of the criticisms that have been made of Sartre’s political conduct during this period are fully justified. Yet his position was complex and contradictory; to appreciate it fully it is necessary to place it in context. Sartre’s political evolution in the 1950s is often presented as though it were simply a dialogue between two protagonists – Sartre and the Stalinist PCF. That dialogue did<br>

  Abstract: The events of 1968, often ignorantly dismissed as no more than a year of ‘student revolt’, undermined the political certainties that had endured since 1945. In Vietnam, the world’s strongest power was proved vulnerable in face of a national liberation struggle. The Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia marked a definitive end to Moscow’s hegemony over the world’s Communist Parties. In France a general strike of over nine million workers, the biggest general strike in human history, showed that the power of the working class could not be ignored; an anti-Stalinist left that had been confined to the margins of political life<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1btbz84">French Intellectuals Against the Left</a><br>
  Abstract: In the latter half of the 1970s a critique of left-wing totalitarianism took French intellectual life by storm. In books and pamphlets, in the press and on television, antitotalitarian intellectuals loudly and dramatically denounced Marxist and revolutionary politics as fatally affiliated with totalitarianism. Originating within the intellectual Left and facing minimal opposition from it, antitotalitarianism rapidly marginalized Marxist thought and undermined the legitimacy of the French revolutionary tradition, paving the way for the postmodern, liberal, and moderate republican political alternatives of the 1980s and 1990s. Antitotalitarianism also radically altered the political judgments and

  Epilogue and Conclusion from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1btbz84">French Intellectuals Against the Left</a><br>
  Abstract: Between 1977, the year of the new philosophers, and the Left’s coming to power in 1981 the critique of totalitarianism made further progress in French intellectual life, recasting intellectual politics and the lines of demarcation between the different currents within it. For one, the critique of
                  tiers-mondisme, which had emerged in 1976 and 1977, took off in 1978 and 1979. Critiques of revolutionarytiers-mondisme, such as Gérard Chaliand’sMythes révolutionnaires du tiers monde(1976) and theDeuxième retour de Chine(1977) of Claudie Broyelle, Jacques Broyelle, and Evelyne Tschirhart, were followed by the mea culpas of Jean Lacouture (Survive le<br>

  Chapter 4  Sorcery, Modernity and the Constitutive Imaginary: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1btbzsw">Beyond Rationalism</a><br>
  Author(s) Kapferer Bruce<br>
  Abstract: The cosmologies implicated in sorcery practice are human-centric. Within them, human beings are at the heart of processes that are integral in the formation of their psychical, social and political universes. Sorcery fetishises human agency, often one which it magically enhances, as the key mediating factor affecting the course or direction of human life-chances. The fabulous character of so much sorcery practice, its transgressive and unbounded dimensions, a rich symbolism that appears to press towards and beyond the limits of the human imagination, is surely connected to the overpowering and totalising impetus that sorcery recognises in human agency and capacities.<br>

  Book Title: Identity and Networks-Gender and Ethnicity in a Cross-Cultural Context<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Webber Jonathan<br>
  Abstract: Contrary to the negative assessments of the social order that have become prevalent in the media since 9/11, this wide-ranging collection of essays, mostly by social anthropologists, focuses instead on the enormous social creativity being invested as collective identities are reconfigured. Using fieldwork findings drawn from Africa, Asia, and Europe, special emphasis is placed on the reformulation of ethnic and gender relationships and identities in the cultural, social, political, and religious realms of public life. Under what circumstances does trust arise, paving the way for friendship, collegiality, knowledge creation, national unity, or emergence of leadership? How is social life constructed as a collective endeavour? Does the means towards sociability become its end? And what can be said about the agency and collegiality of women? The inspiration for examining these conundrums is the work and persona of Shirley Ardener, to whom the volume is dedicated.<br>

  Abstract: Melanin is in the news these days. There’s a pseudoscientific idea floating around that says that if you have lots of melanin—the pigment that colors your skin and hair and the irises of your eyes—you will be smart and exquisitely attuned to life’s rhythms and have a warm, outgoing personality. In short, you will be nicer and more talented than people with less melanin—that is, white people.<br>

  Author(s) STEFANCIC JEAN<br>
  Abstract: Several museums have featured displays of racial memorabilia from the past.¹ Each of these collections depicts a shocking parade of Sambos, mammies, coons, uncles—bestial or happy-go-lucky, watermelon-eating African-Americans. They show advertising logos and household commodities in the shape of blacks with grotesquely exaggerated facial features. They include minstrel shows and film clips depicting blacks as so incompetent, shuffling, and dim-witted that it is hard to see how they survived to adulthood. Other images depict primitive, terrifying, larger-than-life black men in threatening garb and postures, often with apparent designs on white women.<br>

  Abstract: The GI Bill of Rights, as the 1944 Serviceman’s Readjustment Act was known, was arguably the most massive affirmative action program in U.S. history. It was created to develop needed labor-force skills, and to provide those who had them with a life-style that reflected their value to the economy. The GI benefits ultimately extended to sixteen million GIs (veterans of the Korean War as well) included priority in jobs—that is, preferential hiring, but no one objected to it then—financial support during the job search; small loans for starting up businesses; and, most important, low-interest home loans and educational<br>

  Author(s) ANSLEY FRANCES LEE<br>
  Abstract: The “class model” of white supremacy portrays it as a means to justify and enhance class dominance and thus to strengthen existing relations of economic power. This function gives racism its central status in American political life and assures its survival. This is the source of racism’s strength and resilience. The class model addresses how, in a white supremacist system, the poor people of all races come out on the short end while the people of the dominant classes appear to extract extraordinary benefits.<br>

  Abstract: In 1980, Joseph Loguidice, an elderly Italian-American from Chicago, sat down to give his life story to an interviewer. His first and most vivid childhood recollection was of a race riot that had occurred on the city’s near north side. Wagons full of policemen with “peculiar hats” streamed into his neighborhood. But the “one thing that stood out in my mind,” Loguidice remembered after six decades, was “a man running down the middle of the street hollering …’I’m White, I’m White!’” After first taking him for an African-American, Loguidice soon realized that the man was a white coal handler covered<br>

  Abstract: In 1954, at the age of ten, Greg Williams took an unforgettable journey to Muncie, Indiana. Until that time, Greg and his younger brother Mike had lived in Virginia as white children. Their mother was white, and their father (then called Tony, later Buster) told everyone that he was Italian. But when the marriage broke up and Tony’s financial ventures failed, he pushed Greg’s life over the color line. He moved the boys to the black section of Muncie, where he had been raised. “In Virginia you were white boys,” he told Greg and Mike. “In Indiana you’re going to<br>

  Author(s) POLESKY JOELLE E.<br>
  Abstract: Copious news coverage of Ruby Ridge,¹ Waco,² and the Oklahoma City bombing³ has prompted a growing concern with the proliferation of paramilitary organizations and paramilitary activity.⁴ The public’s anxiety is fueled by the belief that private militia pose a threat to society. Private militia are commonly misunderstood and mischaracterized as organizations comprised solely of right-wing militants adhering to Aryan, racist ideology. Although many militia members subscribe to these views, allegiance to the far right is not a prerequisite to membership in a private militia.⁵ Instead, ardent belief in the need to protect individual rights from encroachment by the federal government<br>

  Abstract: Racial identity is not a central life experience for most white people, because it does not have to be.¹ Like members of any socially dominant group, white people have the option to set aside consciousness of the characteristic that defines the dominant class—in this case, race. Thus whiteness is experienced as racelessness, and personal identity is conceived in a race-neutral manner. However, race plays quite a different role in the lives of people of color in this society. It is, again as a consequence of existing social structures that define and give meaning to racial identity, a central facet<br>

  Abstract: Paul Ricoeur's entire philosophical project narrates a passion for the possibleexpressed in the hope that in spite of death, closure, and sedimentation, life is opened by superabundance, by how the world gives us much more than is possible. Ricoeur's philosophical anthropology is a phenomenology of human capacity, which gives onto the groundless ground of human being, namely, God. Thus the story of the capable man, beginning with original goodness held captive by a servile will and ending with the possibility of liberation and regeneration of the heart, underpins his passion for the more than possible. The essays in this volume trace the fluid movement between phenomenological and religious descriptions of the capable self that emerges across Ricoeur's oeuvre and establish points of connection for future developments that might draw inspiration from this body of thought.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c5chgx">A Passion for the Possible: Thinking with Paul Ricoeur</a><br>
  Author(s) VENEMA HENRY ISAAC<br>
  Abstract: One of the abiding features of Paul Ricoeur’s long and productive career has been his “double allegiance” to philosophical and religious thought. Ricoeur tells us that he has “always moved back and forth between . . . a Biblical pole and a rational and critical pole, a duality that, finally, has lasted through my entire life . . . a continuous negotiation with a wellestablished bi-polarity . . . [a] sort of controlled schizophrenia . . . a double allegiance to which, ultimately I remained faithful.”¹ This duality is paramount for Ricoeur and constitutes a relation of mutual distance and<br>

  Abstract: The last book that Paul Ricoeur published in his life bears the beautiful title
                     The Course of Recognition.¹ I do not know whether it has already been translated into German, or if it has been, under what title. In my view, the translation that would best do justice to the work of thought to which Ricoeur invites his readers would beUnterwegs zum Anerkennen.<br>

  Book Title: A Passion for the Possible: Thinking with Paul Ricoeur-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): VENEMA HENRY ISAAC<br>
  Abstract: Paul Ricoeur's entire philosophical project narrates a passion for the possibleexpressed in the hope that in spite of death, closure, and sedimentation, life is opened by superabundance, by how the world gives us much more than is possible. Ricoeur's philosophical anthropology is a phenomenology of human capacity, which gives onto the groundless ground of human being, namely, God. Thus the story of the capable man, beginning with original goodness held captive by a servile will and ending with the possibility of liberation and regeneration of the heart, underpins his passion for the more than possible. The essays in this volume trace the fluid movement between phenomenological and religious descriptions of the capable self that emerges across Ricoeur's oeuvre and establish points of connection for future developments that might draw inspiration from this body of thought.<br>

Thus the story of the capable man, beginning with original goodness held captive by a servile will and ending with the possibility of liberation and regeneration of the heart, underpins his passion for the more than possible. The essays in this volume trace the fluid movement between phenomenological and religious descriptions of the capable self that emerges across Ricoeur's oeuvre and establish points of connection for future developments that might draw inspiration from this body of thought.<br>

  Author(s) VENEMA HENRY ISAAC<br>
  Abstract: One of the abiding features of Paul Ricoeur’s long and productive career has been his “double allegiance” to philosophical and religious thought. Ricoeur tells us that he has “always moved back and forth between . . . a Biblical pole and a rational and critical pole, a duality that, finally, has lasted through my entire life . . . a continuous negotiation with a wellestablished bi-polarity . . . [a] sort of controlled schizophrenia . . . a double allegiance to which, ultimately I remained faithful.”¹ This duality is paramount for Ricoeur and constitutes a relation of mutual distance and<br>

  Book Title: Religion: Beyond a Concept-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): de VRIES HENT<br>
  Abstract: What do we talk about when we talk about religion? Is it an array of empirical facts about historical human civilizations? Or is religion what is in essence unpredictable-perhaps the very emergence of the new? In what ways are the legacies of religion-its powers, words, things, and gestures-reconfiguring themselves as the elementary forms of life in the twenty-first century?Given the Latin roots of the word religion and its historical Christian uses, what sense, if any, does it make to talk about religionin other traditions? Where might we look for common elements that would enable us to do so? Has religion as an overarching concept lost all its currency, or does it ineluctably return-sometimes in unexpected ways-the moment we attempt to do without it? This book explores the difficulties and double binds that arise when we ask What is religion? Offering a marvelously rich and diverse array of perspectives, it begins the task of rethinking religionand religious studiesin a contemporary world. Opening essays on the question What is religion?are followed by clusters exploring the relationships among religion, theology, and philosophy and the links between religion, politics, and law. Pedagogy is the focus of the following section. Religion is then examined in particular contexts, from classical times to the present Pentacostal revival, leading into an especially rich set of essays on religion, materiality, and mediatization. The final section grapples with the ever-changing forms that religionis taking, such as spirituality movements and responses to the ecological crisis.Featuring the work of leading scholars from a wide array of disciplines, traditions, and cultures, Religion: Beyond a Concept will help set the agenda for religious studies for years to come. It is the first of five volumes in a collection entitled The Future of the Religious Past, the fruit of a major international research initiative funded by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research.<br>

  Book Title: Death's Following: Mediocrity, Dirtiness, Adulthood, Literature-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): LIMON JOHN<br>
  Abstract: Almost all twentieth-century philosophy stresses the immanence of death in human life-as drive (Freud), as the context of Being (Heidegger), as the essence of our defining ethics (Levinas), or as language (de Man, Blanchot). In Death's Following, John Limon makes use of literary analysis (of Sebald, Bernhard, and Stoppard), cultural analysis, and autobiography to argue that death is best conceived as always transcendentally beyond ourselves, neither immanent nor imminent. Adapting Kierkegaard's variations on the theme of Abraham's near-sacrifice of Isaac while refocusing the emphasis onto Isaac, Limon argues that death should be imagined as if hiding at the end of an inexplicable journey to Moriah. The point is not to evade or ignore death but to conceive it more truly, repulsively, and pervasively in its camouflage: for example, in jokes, in logical puzzles, in bowdlerized folk songs. The first of Limon's two key concepts is adulthood: the prolonged anti-ritual for experiencing the full distance on the look of death. His second is dirtiness, as theorized in a Jewish joke, a logical exemplum, and T. S. Eliot's "Ash Wednesday": In each case, unseen dirt on foreheads suggests the invisibility of inferred death. Not recognizing death immediately or admitting its immanence and imminence is for Heidegger the defining characteristic of the "they," humanity in its inauthentic social escapism. But Limon vouches throughout for the mediocrity of the "they" in its dirty and ludicrous adulthood. Mediocrity is the privileged position for previewing death, in Limon's opinion: practice for being forgotten. In refusing the call of twentieth-century philosophy to face death courageously, Limon urges the ethical and aesthetic value of mediocre anti-heroism.<br>

  Abstract: On February 29, 1960, when I was exactly, by way of a rare half-birthday, eight-and-a-half, my father, Gerald Limon, was finally killed by an aneurysm, not yet thirty-nine. He had fainted in his car outside his factory, had improved daily for about a week, and died. Family policy, pretty strictly adhered to, was never to discuss him, either his life or death, again. Some time after his death, maybe a month or two, my mother asked me if I had any questions about it. None came to mind. She thought perhaps I had worried that I might die in the<br>

  Book Title: Irony on Occasion: From Schlegel and Kierkegaard to Derrida and de Man-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Newmark Kevin<br>
  Abstract: What is it about irony--as an object of serious philosophical reflection and a literary technique of considerable elasticity--that makes it an occasion for endless critical debate? This book responds to this question by focusing on several key moments in German Romanticism and its afterlife in twentieth-century French thought and writing. It includes chapters on Friedrich Schlegel, Soren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, Thomas Mann, Jean Paulhan, Maurice Blanchot, Jacques Derrida, and Paul de Man. A coda traces the way unresolved tensions inherited from Romanticism resurface in a novelist like J. M. Coetzee. But this book is neither a historical nor a thematic study of irony. To the degree that irony initiates a deflection of meaning, it also entails a divergence from historical and thematic models of understanding. The book therefore aims to respect irony's digressive force by allowing it to emerge from questions that sometimes have little or nothing to do with the ostensible topic of irony. For if irony is the possibility that whatever is being said does not coincide fully with whatever is being meant, then there is no guarantee that the most legitimate approach to the problem would proceed directly to those places where "irony" is named, described, or presumed to reside. Rather than providing a history of irony, then, this book examines particular occasions of ironic disruption. It thus offers an alternative model for conceiving of historical occurrences and their potential for acquiring meaning.<br>

The task of carnal hermeneutics, as described by Richard Kearney, is to read between text and body, to think with multiple senses about the meaning of (embodied) life. How might carnal hermeneutics, as it draws on multiple senses, participate in the work of refiguring traumatic wounds? The essays in this volume note the privileging of the visual as the dominant sense in Western philosophy. The study of trauma, largely a Western enterprise, is often referred to through the image<br>

  Book Title: Words of Life: New Theological Turns in French Phenomenology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Words of Life is the sequel and companion to Phenomenology and the Theological Turn,edited by Dominique Janicaud, Jean-Francois Courtine, Jean-Louis Chrtien, Michel Henry, Jean-Luc Marion, and Paul Ricoeur. In that volume, Janicaud accuses Levinas, Henry, Marion, and Chrtien of veeringfrom phenomenological neutrality to a theologically inflected phenomenology. By contrast, the contributors to this collection interrogate whether phenomenology's proper starting point is agnostic or atheistic. Many hold the view that phenomenology after the theological turn may very well be true both to itself and to the phenomenological things themselves.In one way or another, all of these essays contend with the limits and expectations of phenomenology. As such, they are all concerned with what counts as properphenomenology and even the very structure of phenomenology. None of them, however, is limited to such questions. Indeed, the rich tapestry that they weave tells us much about human experience. Themes such as faith, hope, love, grace, the gift, the sacraments, the words of Christ, suffering, joy, life, the call, touch, listening, wounding, and humility are woven throughout the various meditations in this volume. The contributors use striking examples to illuminate the structure and limits of phenomenology and, in turn, phenomenology serves to clarify those very examples. Thus practice clarifies theory and theory clarifies practice, resulting in new theological turns and new life for phenomenology. The volume showcases the work of both senior and junior scholars, including Jean-Luc Marion, Jean-Yves Lacoste, Kevin Hart, Anthony J. Steinbock, Jeffrey Bloechl, Jeffrey L. Kosky, Clayton Crockett, Brian Treanor, and Christina Gschwandtner-as well as the editors themselves.<br>

  Book Title: Ascent into Heaven in Luke-Acts-New Explorations of Luke's Narrative Hinge<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Pao David W.<br>
  Abstract: In comparison with other aspects of Jesus’ life and ministry, his ascent into heaven has often been overlooked within the history of the church. However, considering its placement at the end of the Gospel and the beginning of Acts—the only narrative depictions of the event in the New Testament—the importance of Jesus’ ascent into heaven is undeniable for Luke’s two-volume work. While select studies have focused on particular aspects of these accounts for Luke’s story, the importance of the ascension calls for renewed attention to the narratological and theological significance of these accounts within their historical and literary contexts. In this volume, leading scholars discuss the ascension narratives within the ancient contexts of biblical, Second Temple Jewish, and Greco-Roman literature; the literary contours of Luke-Acts; and questions of historical and theological significance in the wider milieu of New Testament theology and early Christian historiography. The volume sets out new positions and directions for the next generations of interpreters regarding one of the most important and unique elements of the Lukan writings.<br>

  Book Title: On the Anarchy of Poetry and Philosophy-A Guide for the Unruly<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRUNS GERALD L.<br>
  Abstract: Marcel Duchamp once asked whether it is possible to make something that is not a work of art. This question returns over and over in modernist culture, where there are no longer any authoritative criteria for what can be identified (or excluded) as a work of art. As William Carlos Williams says, A poem can be made of anything,even newspaper clippings.At this point, art turns into philosophy, all art is now conceptual art, and the manifesto becomes the distinctive genre of modernism. This book takes seriously this transformation of art into philosophy, focusing upon the systematic interest that so many European philosophers take in modernism. Among the philosophers Gerald Bruns discusses are Theodor W. Adorno, Maurice Blanchot, Arthur Danto, Stanley Cavell, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Franois Lyotard, Jean-Luc Nancy, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, and Emmanuel Levinas.As Bruns demonstrates, the difficulty of much modern and contemporary poetry can be summarized in the idea that a poem is made of words, not of any of the things that we use words to produce: meanings, concepts, propositions, narratives, or expressions of feeling. Many modernist poets have argued that in poetry language is no longer a form of mediation but a reality to be explored and experienced in its own right. But what sort of experience, philosophically, might this be? The problem of the materiality or hermetic character of poetic language inevitably leads to questions of how philosophy itself is to be written and what sort of communitydefines the work of art-or, for that matter, the work of philosophy.In this provocative study, Bruns answers that the culture of modernism is a kind of anarchist community, where the work of art is apt to be as much an event or experience-or, indeed, an alternative form of life-as a formal object. In modern writing, philosophy and poetry fold into one another. In this book, Bruns helps us to see how.<br>

  4  Poetic Communities from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c84gmm">On the Anarchy of Poetry and Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: Ecstasy. Scholarly tradition pictures Hesiod, like Homer before him, as a great pedagogue.¹ The poet is in charge of a vast encyclopedia concerning gods and heroes (and also, in Hesiod’s particular case, everyday life). But from Hesiod we also learn that poetry itself is not a kind of learning but a species of ecstasy. No one studies to be a poet. No one asks to be such a thing. One is, for no reason, summoned out of one’s house and exposed to a kind of transcendence. Exactly what kind of transcendence is not always clear. One can imagine preferring the<br>

  Book Title: Memory-Histories, Theories, Debates<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SCHWARZ BILL<br>
  Abstract: Memory has never been closer to us, yet never more difficult to understand. In the more than thirty specially commissioned essays that make up this book, leading scholars survey the histories, the theories, and the faultlines that compose the field of memory research.The volume reconstructs the work of the great philosophical and literary figures of the last two centuries who recast the concept of memory and brought it into the forefront of the modernist and postmodernist imagination-among them, Bergson, Halbwachs, Freud, Proust, Benjamin, Adorno, Derrida, and Deleuze. Drawing on recent advances in the sciences and in the humanities, the contributors address thequestion of how memory works, highlighting transactions between the interiority of subjective memory and the larger fields of public or collective memory.The public, political life of memory is an increasingly urgent issue in the societies we now inhabit, while the category of memory itself seems to become ever more capacious.Asking how we might think about the politics of memory, the closing chapters explore anumber of defining instances in which the troubled phenomenon of memory has entered and reshaped our very conception of what makes and drives the domain of politics. These include issues of slavery, the Soviet experience, the Holocaust, feminism and recovered memory, and memory in post-apartheid South Africa.<br>

  Author(s) Schwarz Bill<br>
  Abstract: The idea of memory runs through contemporary public life at high voltage, generating polemic and passionate debate in the media, in the spheres of politics and in the academy. Yet although the contemporary “presentness” of memory is evident, how this is to be understood remains a matter of dispute. It is not clear what meanings attach themselves to the generic conception of memory itself; and while in the academy there is a common belief that memory is “everywhere,”¹ what this means remains an open matter.

  Abstract: The relation between home and food is an essential one. Its ideological power is constantly exhibited in various items of everyday life such as the status of the “homemade” on the food market. That a quiche, for example, is labeled “homemade” at one’s local delicatessen distinguishes it from the mass-produced. It makes it ooze that specifically homely goodness: intimations of sound nutrition, careful choice of ingredients, and careful labor (of love). That is, it becomes a bit of “mother’s cooking”—which, at an important level, is, of course, a continuation of breast-feeding, the most homely of the homely yearnings and<br>

  Book Title: Provocations to Reading: J. Hillis Miller and the Democracy to Come-J. Hillis Miller and the Democracy to Come<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kujundžić Dragan<br>
  Abstract: This book is a marker of the state of theorytoday. Its rich array of wideranging essays explores the dimensions and implications of the work of J. Hillis Miller, one of the most eminent literary scholars in America. For nearly half a century, Miller has been known for his close and imaginative engagement with the implications of European philosophical thought and for his passionate advocacy of close reading.Building on this intellectual legacy, the contributors instantiate and extend the practice and ethics of sustained close reading that is Miller's hallmark. The book culminates in a moving piece by Jacques Derrida, Miller's close friend of forty years, who engages Miller's readings of Gerard Manley Hopkins in a historic encounter between French philosophy and American reading practices.A provocation to reading for new generations of students and teachers, these essays offer important resources for grasping the question of language in historical perspective and in contemporary life-a task essential for any democratic future. Barbara Cohen is Director of HumaniTech at the University of California, Irvine. She is co-editor of Material Events: Paul de Man and the Afterlife of Theory.

  Abstract: Judaism, so the common myth runs, is the Abrahamic¹ religion devoid of an afterlife. Where first Christianity and then Islam are quite explicit regarding the determination of the life hereafter by the quality of the life lived in this world, picturesque almost to the degree of luridness in representing the conditions, qualities, and experience of Heaven and Hell (and Purgatory, where applicable), Judaism hedges its bets and is far more reticent in the sphere of eschatology.² The liturgy of the Days of Awe, the New Year’s festivals that stage the collective public acknowledgment of mortal human vices, breeches in morality,<br>

  Author(s): Yerushalmi Yosef Hayim<br>
  Abstract: Moses and Monotheism, Freud's last major book and the only one specifically devoted to a Jewish theme, has proved to be one of the most controversial and enigmatic works in the Freudian canon. Among other things, Freud claims in the book that Moses was an Egyptian, that he derived the notion of monotheism from Egyptian concepts, and that after he introduced monotheism to the Jews he was killed by them. Since these historical and ethnographic assumptions have been generally rejected by biblical scholars, anthropologists, and historians of religion, the book has increasingly been approached psychoanalytically, as a psychological document of Freud's inner life-of his allegedly unresolved Oedipal complex and ambivalence over his Jewish identity.<br>

  Book Title: Archaeology and Memory-  Publisher: Oxbow Books<br>
  Author(s): Borić Dušan<br>
  Abstract: Memory can be both a horrifying trauma and an empowering resource. From the Ancient Greeks to Nietzsche and Derrida, the dilemma about the relationship between history and memory has filled many pages, with one important question singled out: is the writing of history to memory a remedy or a poison? Recently, a growing interest in and preoccupation with the issue of memory, remembering and forgetting has resulted in a proliferation of published works, in various disciplines, that have memory as their focus. This trend, to which the present volume contributes, has started to occupy the dominant discourses of disciplines such as sociology, philosophy, history, anthropology and archaeology, and has also disseminated into the wider public discourse of society and culture today. Such a condition may perhaps echo the phenomenon of a melancholic experience at the turn of the millennium. Archaeology and Memory seeks to examine the diversity of mnemonic systems and their significance in different past contexts as well as the epistemological and ontological importance of archaeological practice and narratives in constituting the human historical condition. The twelve substantial contributions in this volume cover a diverse set of regional examples and focus on a range of prehistoric and classical case studies in Eurasian regional contexts as well as on the predicaments of memory in examples of the archaeologies of 'contemporary past'. From the Mesolithic and Neolithic burial chambers to the trenches of World War I and the role of materiality in international criminal courts, a number of contributors examine how people in the past have thought about their own pasts, while others reflect on our own present-day sensibilities in dealing with the material testimonies of recent history. Both kinds of papers offer wider theoretical reflections on materiality, archaeological methodologies and the ethical responsibilities of archaeological narration about the past.<br>

The twelve substantial contributions in this volume cover a diverse set of regional examples and focus on a range of prehistoric and classical case studies in Eurasian regional contexts as well as on the predicaments of memory in examples of the archaeologies of 'contemporary past'. From the Mesolithic and Neolithic burial chambers to the trenches of World War I and the role of materiality in international criminal courts, a number of contributors examine how people in the past have thought about their own pasts, while others reflect on our own present-day sensibilities in dealing with the material testimonies of recent history. Both kinds of papers offer wider theoretical reflections on materiality, archaeological methodologies and the ethical responsibilities of archaeological narration about the past.<br>

  [Part 5 Introduction] from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cfr8z1">Land and People</a><br>
  Abstract: All aspects of archaeology, including environmental archaeology and subdisciplines within it, are ultimately about people in the past. Archaeology has been good at studying the material world that humans have produced and the items they have made, but less good at attempting to understand the people themselves. Attempts to get into the minds of people long gone or to attempt in some small way to engage with their feelings and life styles have often been considered unscientific and unhelpful. Yet humans are a part of the natural world, and they modify it and act as communities within in. Their actions<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter we will lay down our anthropological foundation, which will shape our analysis of mental illness as a human phenomenon. Throughout history man has been an enigma, and a paradox, not only in the pages of Scripture, but also to himself and his fellow human beings. Although there have been many studies on every detail of a human’s life concerning his social, psychological, economical, political, physiological, and cultural status in life, one seemingly trivial question that has puzzled philosophers, scientists, and laymen alike, driving the fundamental answer to all aforementioned categories, is

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cg4ks4">Facing the Fiend</a><br>
  Abstract: Carl Gustav Jung was witness to another shadow that came over Europe during his lifetime: Adolf Hitler. In his essay
                  Wotan(1936), Jung described Germany as “infected by one man who is obviously possessed” in addition to “rolling towards perdition.”² Jung’s analysis of Hitler, however, is just one of many attempts to understand the most notorious satanic figure of twentieth-century history. In hisAnatomy of Human Destructiveness, philosopher and psychoanalysist Erich Fromm diagnosed Adolf Hitler as a clinical case of necrophilia.³ Fromm analyzes Hitler’s childhood, his main source being the biography by B. F. Smith (1967), to which author Norman<br>

  Author(s) Hickman Louise<br>
  Abstract: Universalism was a doctrine not widely espoused in seventeenth-century England. That hell is eternal was orthodox belief¹ and any suggestion to the contrary was viewed with grave suspicion as a “detestable and damnable” doctrine of the Arminians;² an opinion believed to give rise to ethical anarchy and antinomianism. If hell is finite, what sort of deterrent is it against misbehaving in this life? What use is Christ’s death if God can cancel the debt of human sin by will alone? Despite general denigration, however, arguments that God’s salvation has universal scope gradually gathered momentum throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.<br>

  Abstract: John Hick is probably best known for his work on the relationship between Christianity and the other world religions. He is a philosopher of religion who, over the course of a lifetime spent in academia, has constantly revised and developed his beliefs. Hick has ended up, theologically speaking, a very long way from where he started off. As a young man, he had a conversion experience which he described as an increasing awareness of the presence of God.¹ This was the beginning of a long spiritual journey which quickly moved from the “conservative evangelical” world to more liberal expressions of<br>

  Abstract: How challenging is this venture? First, if our interest is in the last few years of a life lived two thousand years ago, of which we have multiple records (with challenging parallels), any one of which can be read in one to four hours; second, if they may be based upon numerous different ancient calendars in the target multicultural world each with different cultural points of interest and different annual calendar systems, both lunar and solar; and third, if our goal is to develop a chronology of that life with this diverse information, then many may conclude that it is<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cg4mm1">An Introduction to the New Testament</a><br>
  Abstract: We began in the previous chapter with the task of recovering a chronology of the life of Jesus with its challenges of minimal external points of reference, multiple calendrical systems within which to insert data, multicultural varieties of fixing days or holy days or years within an annual calendar, and the like. Knowing as much as possible about Jesus and his world certainly makes the venture worthwhile, but the writers of the early “biographies” of Jesus seemed little concerned about certain time issues and quite unsuspecting of the obsessions that we as their eighteenththrough twenty-first-century readers would entertain.<br>

  11  The Message of Jesus from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cg4mm1">An Introduction to the New Testament</a><br>
  Abstract: Judging from the Apostles’ Creed, which jumps from the birth of Jesus to his death (Lat.
                  Natus ex Maria virgine; passus sub Pontio Pilato), the details of neither Jesus’s life nor his teaching carried much creedal significance. But if one important function of such a creed was for baptismal instruction and for profession at baptism when the convert renounced the devil and his works, and if part of Jesus’s life was in fact a battle with evil (victory’s being a fait accompli through his death and resurrection), then perhaps in the loosest terms one can see Jesus’s life suggested between<br>

  Abstract: The problems of Pauline chronology are similar to those in the study of Jesus. Evidence is sparse and scattered, and the sources are often dominated by literary and religious purposes. Factors that are distinctive for a chronology of Paul are that (a) we have the apostle’s own words about certain events in his life; (b) references to Paul’s life in Acts sometimes coincide with statements in Paul’s letters; and (c) an ancient inscription confirms the Lukan account of Paul’s appearance before Gallio (Acts 18:12–17).<br>

  Abstract: What can be learned about the origins and development of Christianity from the NT and other relevant documents? Along with its presentation of the life and work of Jesus Christ, the NT also includes useful data for reconstructing the beginnings of Christianity. Who were the earliest followers of Jesus? What did it mean to follow Jesus the Messiah in the first century? How can the NT and related writings help us to understand these questions? In this chapter, we will attempt to respond to these and other queries.<br>

  Abstract: In 1935, the musical “Porgy and Bess” made headlines because it was the first all African American cast to take to Broadway stages. Written by George and Ira Gershwin, it pushed American publics to see African American life. It was, to be sure, stereotypical in a lot of ways. When “Sportin’ Life,” a drug dealer, questions devotion of churchgoing listeners, he sings, “De things dat yo’ liable to read in de Bible, it ain’t necessarily so.” His words are heretical and scandalous.

  Book Title: Restorative Christ-  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Broughton Geoff<br>
  Abstract: The conviction that Jesus is the restorative Christ demands a commitment to the justice he articulated. The justice of the restorative Christ is justice with reconciliation, justice with repentance, justice with repair, and justice without retaliation. The Gospel of Luke and the book of Acts portray the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ through the radical concept of "enemy-love." In conversation with Dietrich Bonhoeffer (Jesus-for-others), John Howard Yoder (a nonviolent Jesus), Miroslav Volf (an embracing Jesus), and Chris Marshall (a compassionate Jesus), Broughton demonstrates what the restorative Christ means for us today. Following the restorative Christ faithfully involves imaginative disciplines (seeing, remembering, and desiring), conversational disciplines (naming, questioning, and forgiving), and embodied disciplines (absorbing, repairing, and embracing).<br>

The idea emerges from the restorative justice movement and the repair required in the aftermath of genocide in Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Bosnia, Cambodia, Liberia, and Uganda. Repair is partly symbolic because nothing—this side of heaven—can mend the atrocities witnessed in such countries during our own lifetime. Mass murder has become the weapon of choice for some regimes. Repair, however, must be pursued. It will be unusually costly.<br>

  Abstract: The

Doubtless Benedict, who prepared “this little rule … for beginners” (RB73.8b),¹ would have eschewed being regarded the center of anything. God, however, has always displayed a knack for elevating the humble (Ps 149:4; Luke 1:52).

  Book Title: Returning to Reality-Christian Platonism for our Times<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Tyson Paul<br>
  Abstract: Could it be that we have lost touch with some basic human realities in our day of high-tech efficiency, frenetic competition, and ceaseless consumption? Have we turned from the moral, the spiritual, and even the physical realities that make our lives meaningful? These are metaphysical questions -questions about the nature of reality- but they are not abstract questions. These are very down to earth questions that concern power and the collective frameworks of belief and action governing our daily lives. This book is an introduction to the history, theory, and application of Christian metaphysics. Yet this book is not just an introduction, it is also a passionately argued call for a profound change in the contemporary Christian mind. Paul Tyson argues that as Western culture’s Christian Platonist understanding of reality was replaced by modern pragmatic realism, we turned not just from one outlook on reality to another, but away from reality itself. This book seeks to show that if we can recover this ancient Christian outlook on reality, reframed for our day, then we will be able to recover a way of life that is in harmony with human and divine truth.<br>

An image of optimal health is at work when we name something “neurotic,” “sick,” or “pathological.” We cannot speak of a deficit, a fault, or a sense of brokenness without an image of human health.

  Abstract: Students in seminary are taught how to “think theologically.” More is required than just a pious spirit. Clergy need a theological template, a set of perspective-giving tools by which the activities of human life (once symbolized by the newspaper) can be understood from various theological viewpoints (once symbolized by the Bible). In ongoing parish work, pastors typically need to refer to the theological template. They have to consciously apply it rather than having so thoroughly internalized the template that they automatically “think theologically.”<br>

  Book Title: Why Resurrection?-An Introduction to the Belief in the Afterlife in Judaism and Christianity<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Blanco Carlos<br>
  Abstract: Few questions exert such a great fascination on human conscience as those related to the meaning of life, history, and death. The belief in the resurrection of the dead constitutes an answer to a real challenge: What is the meaning of life and history in the midst of a world in which evil, injustice, and ultimately death exist? Resurrection is an instrument serving a broader, more encompassing reality: the Kingdom of God. Such a utopian Kingdom gathers the final response to the problem of theodicy and to the enigma of history. <CR><CR> This book seeks to understand the idea of resurrection not only as a theological but also as a philosophical category (as expression of the collective aspirations of humanity), combining historical, theological, and philosophical analyses in dialogue with some of the principal streams of contemporary Western thought.<br>

  Abstract: The belief in the persistence of life after death is not a goal in itself. People who believe in immortality of the soul and in resurrection of the dead do not do so just to state that personal identity will endure. They do so in order to state that the personal identity will endure in a different world, in a different kind of life. The belief in life beyond death is therefore meant to affirm that there is a new world waiting for us, and that life on Earth is not the definitive, final reality.<br>

Indeed, the dominant modern picture of human rationality, and by extension of human life, has been deracinate and discarnate—without roots in tradition or in the human body. I will argue that tradition and the body are—and should be acknowledged as—thoroughly interconnected. And I will attempt to reclaim the cruciality of tradition<br>

  Abstract: Tradition Having argued for the body within tradition, I now argue for tradition as body. The metaphorical phrase, “the body of a tradition,” is well-known. Indeed, as such a conventional and familiar a metaphor, its metaphorical power has long been lost in ordinary usage. I suspect though that the original inventor(s) of the phrase intuited some vital truth about the nature of tradition.

  Book Title: Drinking from the Wells of New Creation-The Holy Spirit and the Imagination in Reconciliation<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Dearborn Kerry<br>
  Abstract: The Holy Spirit, as God’s abiding presence to draw people to Christ, can cleanse wounds and bring love and hope into our hearts. Kerry Dearborn’s insightful focus on the Holy Spirit transforming our moral imagination and putting us on the path of reconciliation with Jesus Christ is both profound and encouraging. Biblical analysis, historical surveys and references to acclaimed theological authors support Dearborn’s nuanced yet practical application of imagination as a tool for awakening, recovery, and dissolving intellectual or psychological barriers that isolate us from God. She considers effectively how imagination can be connected to reality, and is able to delve deep into this vein of thought with startling clarity. Drinking from the Wells of New Creation provides spiritual guidance for dealing with oppression in society; an issue that affects people both within and outside the Christian faith. The acknowledgement of reconciliation as a creative process provides a fresh outlook and will excite those delving into both theological and psychological studies, as well as those seeking to understand God’s unification of life, regardless of tribe, tongue and nation.<br>

  Abstract: In
                  Phantastes, which C. S. Lewis credits with baptizing his imagination, George MacDonald tells the story of Anodos, who has just come of age and is about to receive his inheritance.² The framework with which Anodos approaches life is one of confident mastery, self-referent pragmatism, and enough curiosity to make him wonder if there is more to life than what he has experienced. Clearly a person of strong self-esteem, Anodos expresses his sense of mastery by placing things in convenient categories. When he first meets his fairy grandmother who appears to him in “tiny woman-form” wearing a Grecian dress, he<br>

  2  Who Is the Holy Spirit and Does the Spirit Effect Reconciliation? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf0kv">Drinking from the Wells of New Creation</a><br>
  Abstract: Who is the One who now fills and transforms Jesus’ disciples for participation in the ministry of reconciliation? The following pages will highlight three prominent characteristics of the and the specific implications for each of these characteristics in the of reconciliation. Though many more qualities could be explored, for purpose of this book the focus will be on God’s Spirit as 1) universal; 2) and personal; and 3) the breath and source of life. In light of these Torrance, characteristics of the Spirit the following questions will be addressed: What does it mean to honor the Holy Spirit as God<br>

  Abstract: The nature of the Holy Spirit as universal, creative, and the source of life means there are many resources the Spirit offers to deal with painful realities and to bring to fulfillment God’s gift of reconciliation. Numerous gifts and fruit of the Holy Spirit, which are particular resources for the ministry of reconciliation, draw on the specific vehicle of the imagination for their expression. Though not an exhaustive list, three areas in particular will be explored as gifts crucial to the healing of relationships, all of which rely heavily on wise imagination: re-creation, hope, and love.

  4  The Holy Spirit’s Work of Reconciliation through the Imagination from:

  Abstract: What empowers people to live out lives of re-creation, hope, and love that correspond with the truth they affirm and the Holy Spirit that indwells them? What transforms approaches to reconciliation from being empty verbal niceties or guilt-assuaging “quick fixes” to dynamic expressions of the gospel? What is it that makes people empathetic, caring, compassionate, forgiving, and ultimately loving toward those who are “other”? This book has affirmed the reality that through the Holy Spirit, God’s love has flooded our hearts, uniting us with God and empowering us to participate in the reconciliation established by God through Christ’s life, death,<br>

  7  Signposts and Oases of the New Creation from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf0kv">Drinking from the Wells of New Creation</a><br>
  Abstract: The central thesis of this book is that the Holy Spirit is God’s abiding presence to draw all people to the renewing waters of Christ’s recreating and reconciling work and life. Because of the Spirit’s universal, life-giving, and particularized presence, these waters are available even in the most turbulent and seemingly desolate places. Furthermore, I have proposed that the channels in which these waters often flow most freely, at least initially, are those of the imagination. It is through the imagination that God’s Spirit carries creativity, hope, and love into our hearts when there may be rational and psychological objections<br>

  Book Title: The Gift of the Other-Levinas, Derrida, and a Theology of Hospitality<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Bouma-Prediger Steven<br>
  Abstract: We live in an age of global capitalism and terror. In a climate of consumption and fear the unknown Other is regarded as a threat to our safety, a client to assist, or a competitor to be overcome in the struggle for scarce resources. And yet, the Christian Scriptures explicitly summon us to welcome strangers, to care for the widow and the orphan, and to build relationships with those distant from us. But how, in this world of hostility and commodification, do we practice hospitality? In The Gift of the Other, Andrew Shepherd engages deeply with the influential thought of French thinkers Emmanuel Levinas and Jacques Derrida, and argues that a true vision of hospitality is ultimately found not in postmodern philosophies but in the Christian narrative. The book offers a compelling Trinitarian account of the God of hospitality—a God of communion who “makes room" for otherness, who overcomes the hostility of the world though Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection, and who through the work of the Spirit is forming a new community: the Church—a people of welcome.<br>

  Abstract: Born in Lithuania in 1906, where he received a traditional Jewish education, Emmanuel Levinas began his philosophical studies at the University of Strasbourg in 1923. It was in Strasbourg that Levinas also met and began a lifelong friendship with Maurice Blanchot. In 1928, Levinas moved to Freiburg University to continue his studies in the emerging field of phenomenology being pioneered by Edmund Husserl. Here at Freibrug, Levinas also met and sat under the teaching of Martin Heidegger, whose work

  Book Title: Life in the Spirit-A Post-Constantinian and Trinitarian Account of the Christian Life<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): snavely Andréa D.<br>
  Abstract: Christians are united in saying that the Christian life is a life in the Spirit. But the unity breaks down when explaining how the Christian life is a life in the Spirit. Life in the Spirit is the first book to engage the post-Constantinian critique of the church with the field of Spirit Christology. Building upon the work of post-Constantinians John Howard Yoder and Stanley Hauerwas and upon the Trinitarian Spirit-Christology of Leopoldo Sánchez, this account provides a framework for seeing one’s Christian life as one transformed by the Spirit. Snavely rejects the characterisation of life in the Spirit as bringing sinners to faith, and instead proposes that as Jesus lived as the Son of the Father in the Spirit, the Spirit also makes other sons of the father in the image of Jesus. This Trinitarian interpretation shows the Christian life as being one of total trust in God with one’s own life, and after death living in Jesus’ resurrected life in the Spirit. Snavely’s account calls for a reimagining of the church and the Christian life in terms of ecclesial structure, Christian discipleship and the Christian view of marriage. Life in the Spirit will not only help Christians to have a better understanding of the place of vocation in the world as witnesses to the lordship of Jesus Christ, but it will also promote unity in the body of Christ based on the actual unity that all his adopted sons and daughters already have by belonging to Jesus Christ’s life in the Spirit.<br>

  Abstract: Christians are united when saying
                  thatthe Christian life is a life in the Spirit. But the unity breaks down when explaininghowthe Christian life is a life in the Spirit. A stereotype of one extreme comes from my own Lutheran tradition. It can leave the impression that the Spirit’s work in the Christian life consists entirely in bringing sinners to faith, doing nothing to transform believers and bring them to new life. This can happen when Lutherans explain good works by quoting Isaiah—“as filthy rags”—and when they regard the righteousness God conveys in justification as a<br>

  1  The Christian Life as Life in the Spirit from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf0pd">Life in the Spirit</a><br>
  Abstract: This work will give an account of the Christian life as life in the Spirit. This should be obvious enough from the new testament witness and especially Paul’s description of the Christian life as the Spirit’s work of making people into the image of Jesus Christ. However, we should not take it for granted that we have and in fact live by such an account for two reasons. The first reason is that the kind of life Jesus lived is not taken seriously for what it means for a Christian to live a life in the Spirit, or even for<br>

  2  A Spirit-Christology That Works for the Christian Life from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf0pd">Life in the Spirit</a><br>
  Abstract: In this chapter I intend to lay the theological groundwork for an account of Spirit-Christology to be given in the following chapters that explains the Christian life as life in the Spirit based on the constitutive events in Jesus’ life and death, showing that the Christian life is not only life in the Spirit but that such life in the Spirit is also a cruciform life. to do so, I will examine other Spirit-Christologies and Pneumatologies to see whether they contribute to the kind of Spirit-Christology given here that begins with Jesus’ life and death as the basis for showing<br>

  Abstract: The criteria previously discussed will now be used to establish Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection as constitutive for not only what it meant for him to live in the Spirit as the unique Son of God but what his life in the Spirit means for Christians to live in the Spirit as adopted sons of God. These criteria will be used here in the following progression to arrive at a trinitarian Spirit-Christology: first, it must derive strictly from the narrative of Jesus’ life described in the gospel accounts; second, it must locate constitutive events in the narrative that speak directly<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf0pd">Life in the Spirit</a><br>
  Abstract: The basic difficulty in giving the kind of account presented here is the fact that much theological reflection on the Christian life discounts the life of Christ as determinative for the Christian life. As I discussed earlier, yoder took up this problem especially in
                  The Politics of Jesus, in which he argued that the Incarnation implied that Christ’s life must inform the life of the Christian. But yoder’s account does not adequately attend to the question ofhow one is made a discipleof Jesus, what Adolf Köberle called the “energy” question,¹ because he does not adequately account for the<br>

  Abstract: Now that we have seen how the Spirit transforms a person by the proclamation of the gospel of Jesus Christ into adopted sons of God, we are at a place where we can define the shape and direction of the Christian life. Since life in the Spirit is having been transformed by the Spirit into Christ’s life in the Spirit, whose own life was cruciform, Christ’s cruciform life is the shape and direction of the Christian life as well. This brings us to our final question asked here in chapter 5, “What does the Christian life look like today for<br>

  Abstract: Anthropomorphic language has provided a conundrum for exegetes and theologians for millennia. Attempting to use human language to describe the divine presents ontological and epistemological problems that push our speech to the breaking point. In this new work, Howell shows that instances of divine action should not automatically be reduced simply to theological categories such as omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence, immutability, etc., nor to criteria such as personhood, life, and approachability. Rather, he introduced readers to two unique approaches to “anthropomorphic expressions".<br>

  Abstract: An engagement with the themes of the hermeneutical self and the ethical difference is undertaken in a comparative religious framework. In the aftermath of colonialism it implies an attempt to overcome the Western tradition of individual consciousness from Descartes to Husserl. In this tradition the thinking subject (knowledge of the self) takes on an ever-increasing importance in the theory of knowledge. In this philosophical development, the thinking subject has been prioritized, while sidestepping human life embedded within socio-historical locations and ethical practices. To improve on this shortcoming, I undertake a comparative religious-ethical study concerning interpretation and ethical self in dialogue<br>

                     Life of Schleiermacher. Dilthey began to see in hermeneutics the foundation for theGeisteswissenschaften(human studies, or human sciences, or the social and human sciences), which means the humanities and social sciences aiming at interpreting expressions of human inner life.

  Abstract: Dilthey in his later years came to appreciate Husserl’s (1859–1938) teachings, which avoid psychological reasoning and articulate the importance of the idea of evidence and a methodological procedure in cognitive analyses. Husserl’s
                  Logical Investigations, published in two volumes in 1900 /1901, created phenomenology, including a new insight into hermeneutical theory. Husserl takes issue with Dilthey’s notion of worldview associated with historicism, because he believes that Dilthey depends on knowledge of historical relativity, causing the absolute validity of any particular life-interpretation, religion, or philosophy to disappear.

  Abstract: It is a commonplace that today we live globally—and often locally as well—in a multicultural society where different cultures coexist, oscillating between cooperation and competition. These multicultural settings are the result of various factors, from the migration movements of large groups of people caused by economic necessity, war, oppression, displacement, and the search for better opportunities for shaping one’s life. If one wanted to write a diachronic history of the genesis of most multicultural societies, one would come across the most grievous aspects of modern history, racism, nationalism, ethnic strife, exploitation, and religious oppression, leading to the banishment<br>

  Author(s) JACKELÉN ANTJE<br>
  Abstract: There are a number of obstacles for a consistent presentation of the doctrine of atonement today. How can the suffering and self-sacrifice of the One be salvific in our global context? Does the atoning activity of God in Christ presuppose total passivity on the human side? Is not atonement terminology remote from the realities of human life in contemporary Western societies? In this chapter I argue that post-Einsteinian notions of time may contribute to theological attempts to cope with some of these obstacles. Albert Einstein’s theories of relativity mean that the previous Newtonian concept of time is inadequate. A reception<br>

During the long years of their separation, he made no effort to retrieve her from Saul’s sphere but found time to meet with Jonathan more than once.

  Abstract: For the first time in the Bible, blood is mentioned, as well as its virtue of epitomizing life that belongs to God (4:10; see 9:4–6). Let us start with a philological note: although the singular “blood” (
                  dam) may only at times refer to blood shed by violence (see Num 35:33), the pluraldamim, as we have it here in Gen 4: 10, is more specifically blood spilled or blood-guilt (see Num 35:27; Exod 22:1). The expression “man of blood” (‘iš damim) designates a murderer (see 2 Sam 16:7, 8; Ps 5:7) and “city of blood” (‘iš damim) designates a<br>

  Book Title: The Philokalia and the Inner Life-On Passions and Prayer<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Cook Christopher C.H.<br>
  Abstract: The Philokalia was published in Venice in 1782. It is an anthology of patristic writings from the Eastern Church, spanning the 4th to the 15th Centuries, which has been the subsequent focus of a significant revival in Orthodox spirituality. It presents an understanding of psychopathology and mental life which is significantly different to that usually encountered in western Christianity. It also presents accounts of both mental well-being and the pathologies of the mind or soul that are radically different to contemporary secular accounts and yet also find remarkable points of similarity with contemporary psychotherapeutic approaches, such as cognitive therapy. The book provides an introduction to the history of the Philokalia and the philosophical, anthropological and theological influences that contributed to its information. It presents a critical account of the pathologies of the soul, the remedies for these pathologies, and the therapeutic goals as portrayed by the authors of the Philokalia. It then offers a critical engagement of this material with a contemporary understanding of psychotherapy. Finally, it raises important questions about the relationship between thoughts and prayer.<br>

This new work presents a variety of responses to tragedy and a world out of joint are explored. These responses arise from Scripture, from within the liturgy of the church, and from beyond the church; in contemporary life (the racially conflicted land of Aotearoa- New Zealand, secular music concerts and cyber-space). The book thus reflects upon theological and pastoral handling of such experience, as it bridges these different worlds. It brings together in conversation specialists from different fields of academy and church to provide a resource for integrating faith and scholarship in dark places.<br>

This collection of essays explores the biblical foundations and the contemporary resonances of lament literature. The editors of this book and many of its contributors have strong connections with Aotearoa, New Zealand. It is fitting, therefore, that the book begins with a lament liturgy responding to the recent Christchurch earthquake (22 February 2011). It ends with a piece considering the “Holy Land” through the eyes of the Shulamith of the Song of Songs. Between these framing laments, a variety of responses to tragedy and a world out<br>

In terms of genre the narrative is an ancient form of biography¹ and the one undeniable feature of the narrative is that it follows a chronological sequence of Jesus’ life: birth, baptism, ministry in Galilee, the journey to Jerusalem, death, and resurrection. Like all stories, the structure, which arranges the individual parts so that the story is brought to a satisfying conclusion, has a beginning (Matthew 1–2, the prologue), middle (Matthew 3–25, the central section), and an end (Matthew 26–28, the passion and resurrection).²<br>

  Book Title: God's Wounds-Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of the Divine Suffering, Volume 2. Evil and Divine Suffering<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Pool Jeff B.<br>
  Abstract: This book constitutes the second volume of a three-volume study of Christian testimonies to divine suffering: God's Wounds: Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of Divine Suffering, vol. 2, Evil and Divine Suffering. The larger study focuses its inquiry into the testimonies to divine suffering themselves, seeking to allow the voices that attest to divine suffering to speak freely, then to discover and elucidate the internal logic or rationality of this family of testimonies, rather than defending these attestations against the dominant claims of classical Christian theism that have historically sought to eliminate such language altogether from Christian discourse about the nature and life of God. This second volume of studies proceeds on the basis of the presuppositions of this symbol, those implicit attestations that provide the conditions of possibility for divine suffering-that which constitutes divine vulnerability with respect to creation-as identified and examined in the first volume of this project: an understanding of God through the primary metaphor of love (God is love); and an understanding of the human as created in the image of God, with a life (though finite) analogous to the divine life-the imago Dei as love. The second volume then investigates the first two divine wounds or modes of divine suffering to which the larger family of testimonies to divine suffering normally attest: (1) divine grief, suffering because of betrayal by the beloved human or human sin; and (2) divine self-sacrifice, suffering for the beloved human in its bondage to sin or misery, to establish the possibility of redemption and reconciliation. Each divine wound, thus, constitutes a response to a creaturely occasion. The suffering in each divine wound also occurs in two stages: a passive stage and an active stage. In divine grief, God suffers because of human sin, betrayal of the divine lover by the beloved human: divine sorrow as the passive stage of divine grief; and divine anguish as the active stage of divine grief. In divine self-sacrifice, God suffers in response to the misery or bondage of the beloved human's infidelity: divine travail (focused on the divine incarnation in Jesus of Nazareth) as the active stage of divine self-sacrifice; and divine agony (focused on divine suffering in the crucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth) as the passive stage of divine self-sacrifice.<br>

  Introduction to Division One: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf8fn">God's Wounds</a><br>
  Abstract: God’s creation of humans in the divine image established the conditions of possibility for the occasion of the first divine wound. I have shown previously that the Christian symbol of divine suffering construes human being or life in the image of God as love. Furthermore, as being-inact (
                  ens actu), theimago Deiactualizes itself asimitatio Dei. The human never loses or annihilates theimago Dei, but certainly can distort and pervert itself as such.¹ Thus, humans always actualize their being or life as love in an imitation of God either authentically or inauthentically. As Augustine said to God in<br>

  1  Human Cupiditas: from:

  Abstract: Human life as
                  cupiditas, human sin as the occasion for the first divine wound or divine grief, exhibits several formal characteristics. By no means do I pretend, with my identification of these formal characteristics, exhaustively to analyze this occasion for divine suffering. I only examine here the broad contours of the factors that structure the beloved human’s infidelity, those structural characteristics of human sin that figure most prominently as features of the occasion for the first divine wound. Most generally, according to the Christian symbol of divine suffering, the creaturely occasion for the first divine wound exhibits six formal characteristics:<br>

  2  Human Cupiditas: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf8fn">God's Wounds</a><br>
  Abstract: Human life as
                  cupiditas, or human sin as the creaturely occasion for divine grief, also exhibits several material characteristics.

  Book Title: God's Wounds-Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of the Divine Suffering, Volume 2. Evil and Divine Suffering<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Pool Jeff B.<br>
  Abstract: This book constitutes the second volume of a three-volume study of Christian testimonies to divine suffering: God's Wounds: Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of Divine Suffering, vol. 2, Evil and Divine Suffering. The larger study focuses its inquiry into the testimonies to divine suffering themselves, seeking to allow the voices that attest to divine suffering to speak freely, then to discover and elucidate the internal logic or rationality of this family of testimonies, rather than defending these attestations against the dominant claims of classical Christian theism that have historically sought to eliminate such language altogether from Christian discourse about the nature and life of God. This second volume of studies proceeds on the basis of the presuppositions of this symbol, those implicit attestations that provide the conditions of possibility for divine suffering-that which constitutes divine vulnerability with respect to creation-as identified and examined in the first volume of this project: an understanding of God through the primary metaphor of love (God is love); and an understanding of the human as created in the image of God, with a life (though finite) analogous to the divine life-the imago Dei as love. The second volume then investigates the first two divine wounds or modes of divine suffering to which the larger family of testimonies to divine suffering normally attest: (1) divine grief, suffering because of betrayal by the beloved human or human sin; and (2) divine self-sacrifice, suffering for the beloved human in its bondage to sin or misery, to establish the possibility of redemption and reconciliation. Each divine wound, thus, constitutes a response to a creaturely occasion. The suffering in each divine wound also occurs in two stages: a passive stage and an active stage. In divine grief, God suffers because of human sin, betrayal of the divine lover by the beloved human: divine sorrow as the passive stage of divine grief; and divine anguish as the active stage of divine grief. In divine self-sacrifice, God suffers in response to the misery or bondage of the beloved human's infidelity: divine travail (focused on the divine incarnation in Jesus of Nazareth) as the active stage of divine self-sacrifice; and divine agony (focused on divine suffering in the crucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth) as the passive stage of divine self-sacrifice.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf8fn">God's Wounds</a><br>
  Abstract: In divine travail, the operations and interactions of the three dimensions of divine
                  caritasproduce divine travail’s material character, but involve even greater complexity than in the two stages of the previous divine wound, principally due to the self-externalization or self-concentration of the divine presence within the creation, through God’s becoming-human as Jesus of Nazareth. Strictly speaking, then, I should examine divine travail by combining analyses that followboththe pattern of my analyses of human life as love in terms ofcaritasandcupiditas andthe pattern of my previous analyses of divine life as love.¹ While aspects of<br>

  11  Divine Agony: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf8fn">God's Wounds</a><br>
  Abstract: I initiate this analysis of divine agony, as I have in each interpretation of the previous stages in divine suffering, with an exposition of the formal character of divine agony. Furthermore, once again, I submit the same four principal questions to this stage in the Christian symbol of divine suffering, the answers to which yield the formal character or structure of divine agony. (1) What is the relationship between divine vulnerability and this more passive stage of divine self-sacrifice? (2) To which operation or role in the divine life does the symbol of divine agony refer? (3) Toward which subjects<br>

  12  Divine Agony: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf8fn">God's Wounds</a><br>
  Abstract: As the second stage of divine self-sacrifice, the material character of divine agony closely resembles the material character of divine travail. God has lost the equilibrium between the agapic and erotic dimensions of divine love in divine travail, however, as divine travail progressed into divine agony. Although God’s erotic
                  caritascontinues to motivate divine agapiccaritastoward the divine philial goal, during the human’s victimization of the divine lover, the human disequilibrates the operations between these two dimensions of love in divine life. Consequently, the agapic dimension of divine love, with its predominantly self-sacrifi-cial character, assumes the leading role in<br>

  2  The Uniqueness of Luther’s Life and Theology from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf98j">Martin Luther and Buddhism</a><br>
  Abstract: The theology of Martin Luther cannot be fully understood without considering his spiritual and social biography, at the heart of which lies his struggle for and discovery of God’s justification for all. As all the theological structures and ideas of Luther are inspired and extended by his teaching on justification, so his doctrine of justification becomes the driving force of his whole life-struggle and the larger program of the reformation. Martin Luther (1483–1546) is thought to have been born on November 10, 1483, in a middle-class house in Eisleben, and named after the saint of the day, Martin of<br>

  2  Contextual Methods within the Theological Processes of Christian Churches from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf9rs">Contextual Theology</a><br>
  Abstract: Missiologists, such as Lamin Sanneh and Andrew Walls, have made it clear that the migratory nature of Christianity is evident today in a dramatic way. We are facing a new Christianity centered geographically, socially, culturally, economically, and politically in environments unfamiliar to the West, such that our theological work is called upon to think creatively in terms of the ideas and cultural life, the beliefs and practices of the churches of the new center.¹ The reality of a new Christianity in the offing is the stimulus for a commitment to an ecumenical and ecclesial theology and praxis of mission.

  5  Sources and Processes: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf9rs">Contextual Theology</a><br>
  Abstract: An argument of this book is that the proper theological use of contextual methods is healthy and promotes and enriches the life of faith among Christians around the globe. As the theological process is enriched by contextual methods, the community is enriched and empowered to greater service of God in Christ. This is a claim that needs to be illustrated and defended. In this chapter, I will attempt to examine this thesis.<br>

  II. Concrete Singularity from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf9tt">Gift and the Unity of Being</a><br>
  Abstract: The engagement of the whole of ourselves with the whole of reality, and with the center of both, who is God, calls us to recognize the positivity of all that is. With all its dramatic tensions, originary experience reveals that being itself is good
                  quagiven, that it is good to exist with others, and that the task for life is given with our destiny. It also reveals how every concrete singular is thus bound together in a complex, manifold unity in which each is fully itself.¹ The preceding chapter’s anthropological reflection now opens up into a path to see<br>

  IV.  The Son’s Gift of Self from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf9tt">Gift and the Unity of Being</a><br>
  Abstract: The mystery of the unity of being finds its archetypal expression in the eventful form of Jesus Christ. His person renders in flesh and in history the nature of the one God as an ineffable communion of love that radically responds to man’s rejection. Translating his divine filiation into human existence, Christ’s gift of himself to the utmost redeems humankind; that is, he corrects man’s distorted perception of himself, God, and the world and offers to man the possibility of sharing divine life.¹ Thus, the Logos’s kenotic descent, lived out as a constant, loving obedience to the Father in the<br>

                     Ecclesiastical History of the English People. Regardless of how subsequent generations have remembered him, Bede actually thought his primary task was to comment on the sacred page.

  3  Bonhoeffer’s Theology and Economic Humanism: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgfb5g">Being Human, Becoming Human</a><br>
  Author(s) Frick Peter<br>
  Abstract: The aim of this essay is to examine Bonhoeffer’s theology vis-à-vis economics. Admittedly, at first glance, this may appear as a rather farfetched idea, since Bonhoeffer was neither trained nor known as an economist and has left us no systematic treatment of his thought on that subject. Yet, there is the curious fact that Bonhoeffer’s entire adult life unfolded within an inexorable economic downward spiral. The height of that spiral was for Bonhoeffer in all probability the granting of his doctoral degree in theology in 1927. The bourgeois élan of the Bonhoeffer family, embedded as it was in intellectual elitism<br>

  9  Con-Formation with Jesus Christ: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgfb5g">Being Human, Becoming Human</a><br>
  Author(s) Dahill Lisa E.<br>
  Abstract: What do we learn from Dietrich Bonhoeffer about being and becoming human? That question animating this volume of essays pushes deep into Christian anthropology, ecclesiology, social analysis, and Christology—that is to say, it invites us into the territory of the
                  body. To assert that the questions at the heart of Bonhoeffer’s thinking and witness are inherently matters of reflective Christianembodimentin the world may seem so clear as not to warrant comment; obviously humans are constituted as bodies, and anything we might say about our humanity and life together in the world must take account of that fact.<br>

  Foreword from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgfbg4">Making Memory</a><br>
  Author(s) Jasper David<br>
  Abstract: The twentieth century is now but a memory, existing in the minds, souls, and seared flesh of those who survived it and we who write and read the words that become our past. Theology—whether Jewish or Christian—is embedded in the past and the command to remember, or to forget. But remembering or forgetting are both unstable and unreliable. We remember and we forget but in part, as individuals and as communities. We remember things that we would prefer to forget, or seek to blot out those things which make life intolerable or are an offense. Alana Vincent’s book<br>

  TWO  Antigone and Athenian War-dead: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgfbg4">Making Memory</a><br>
  Abstract: Biblical texts are not the only ancient texts with a significant interpretative afterlife. Western culture has also had a lengthy relationship of rereading with the literature of ancient Greece and Rome—this is the origin of the “Western philosophical tradition,” which I contrasted with the Jewish tradition of biblical interpretation in chapter one. In this chapter, I will turn to a brief examination of Sophocles’
                  Antigoneand its history of interpretation as a window into the way that discourse over mourning and ownership of the dead has developed. This discussion will provide a framework for the readings of Canadian material<br>

  Abstract: Montgomery’s¹ fiction provides a useful window into the way that practices and understandings of death, mourning, and commemoration shifted from before the First World War to the period immediately following the war. However, the view from that window is necessarily limited: it the perspective of one woman, close to the events about which she writes. However influential

  Book Title: God's Wounds-Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of Divine Suffering, Volume 1. Divine Vulnerability and Creation<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Pool Jeff B.<br>
  Abstract: This book constitutes the first volume of a three-volume study of Christian testimonies to divine suffering: God's Wounds: Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of Divine Suffering, Divine Vulnerability and Creation. This study first develops an approach to interpreting the contested claims about the suffering of God. Thus, the larger study focuses its inquiry into the testimonies to divine suffering themselves, seeking to allow the voices that attest to divine suffering to speak freely, to discover and elucidate the internal logic or rationality of this family of testimonies, rather than defending these attestations against the dominant claims of classical Christian theism that have historically sought to eliminate such language altogether from Christian discourse about the nature and life of God. Through this approach, this volume of studies into the Christian symbol of divine suffering then investigates the two major presuppositions that the larger family of testimonies to divine suffering normally hold: an understanding of God through the primary metaphor of love (God is love); and an understanding of the human as created in the image of God, with a life (though finite) analogous to the divine life - the imago Dei as love. When fully elaborated, these presuppositions reveal the conditions of possibility for divine suffering and divine vulnerability with respect to creation.<br>

                  God has created human life or being, through the actualization of the divine being as love in God’s self-limiting creative activity, in the image of God with the being or life of love. Working on the basis of the abstraction of being or life from its actualization, this chapter will identify and analyze the formal and material structures of the human as the image of God,<br>

  Book Title: God's Wounds-Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of Divine Suffering, Volume 1. Divine Vulnerability and Creation<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Pool Jeff B.<br>
  Abstract: This book constitutes the first volume of a three-volume study of Christian testimonies to divine suffering: God's Wounds: Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of Divine Suffering, Divine Vulnerability and Creation. This study first develops an approach to interpreting the contested claims about the suffering of God. Thus, the larger study focuses its inquiry into the testimonies to divine suffering themselves, seeking to allow the voices that attest to divine suffering to speak freely, to discover and elucidate the internal logic or rationality of this family of testimonies, rather than defending these attestations against the dominant claims of classical Christian theism that have historically sought to eliminate such language altogether from Christian discourse about the nature and life of God. Through this approach, this volume of studies into the Christian symbol of divine suffering then investigates the two major presuppositions that the larger family of testimonies to divine suffering normally hold: an understanding of God through the primary metaphor of love (God is love); and an understanding of the human as created in the image of God, with a life (though finite) analogous to the divine life - the imago Dei as love. When fully elaborated, these presuppositions reveal the conditions of possibility for divine suffering and divine vulnerability with respect to creation.<br>

  Abstract: This chapter constitutes the first stage in my analyses of the first presupposition of the Christian symbol of divine suffering. I repeat my formulation of this presupposition:
                  The God whose life is love limits the divine self in God’s creative activity; or, as the creator who is love, God limits the divine self as God creates. This first stage of my analysis works on the basis of an abstraction of divine life or being from divine activity, in order to clarify the characteristic ways in which this symbol envisions the actualization of divine love in divine creative activity.

  Abstract: Since the days of Marx, the shift to monopoly capitalism in the phase of imperialism has made Marx’s theory questionable and even obsolete. The unemployed army as capitalism’s gravediggers turned into labor aristocrats. Not competition in industrial capitalism, but monopoly played a decisive role in changed economic life. Bank capital has merged with industrial capital and this merger created finance capital. The export of capital became greatly important. Through international monopoly the territorial division of unoccupied parts of the world was established among the major capitalist powers and their satellites.¹<br>

During the flood in Manitoba, volunteers from all across Canada came to the aid of inundated Manitobans. Hurricane Katrina (2005) marshalled help from all over the world. When a young Saskatchewan farmer died from cancer, his relatives and neighbours organized themselves to take off his harvest.

  Abstract: Spiritual care is rapidly replacing pastoral care in institutional settings. While the assumptions of spiritual counselling may be a better fit for hospitals, nursing homes, and counselling centres, the pastoral paradigm remains the better fit for congregational care. This chapter argues that the pastoral paradigm provides a productive framework for addressing developments in the field of pastoral care and congregational ministry. The chapter correlates the psychotherapy outcome research of the common factors model with features of the pastoral paradigm to identify the ways in which the pastoral paradigm leverages the relational and communal dimensions of congregational life.

  Abstract: The past few years have seen a remarkable revival of interest in comprehensive normative theories of constitutional law. These grand theories, as I will call them, attempt to provide justifications for the exercise of the power of judicial review in a democracy, that is, the power that courts whose judges are appointed for life have which allows them to displace decisions made by representatives of the people. Current interest in grand theory is striking for two reasons. First, despite the existence of competing grand theories, each one is in its essentials a revived and purified version of an earlier grand<br>

  Book Title: Is There a Canadian Philosophy?-Reflections on the Canadian Identity<br>
  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>
  Author(s): HARRIS INGRID<br>
  Abstract: Is There a Canadian Philosophy?addresses the themes of community, culture, national identity, and universal human rights, taking the Canadian example as its focus. The authors argue that nations compelled to cope with increasing demands for group recognition may do so in a broadly liberal spirit and without succumbing to the dangers associated with an illiberal, adversarial multiculturalism. They identify and describe a Canadian civic philosophy and attempt to show how thismodus operandiof Canadian public life is capable of reconciling questions of collective identity and recognition with a commitment to individual rights and related principles of liberal democracy. They further argue that this philosophy can serve as a model for nations around the world faced with internal complexities and growing demands for recognition from populations more diverse than at any previous time in their histories.<br>

  Abstract: Arguably one of the most difficult tasks of philosophy is to grasp where we are today. While undoubtedly this has something to do with the usual biases of the day, in that philosophers are as surely bound by mundane prejudices as everyone else, it also seems to derive from a factor peculiar to philosophy. It is no accident that philosophers have long dealt with the question of the good life. Philosophers have always wanted to leave the cave. Whether or not one fashions the departure in grand metaphysical terms, one can maintain, with fairly adequate justification, that a defining characteristic<br>

That is, are there natural and inalienable rights which any human being anywhere, anytime, can appropriately lay claim to no matter what his situation in life and no matter in what society he finds himself? Bentham tells us that “Natural rights is simple nonsense: natural and imprescriptable rights rhetorical nonsense — nonsense upon stilts.” But in our time some able and analytically oriented moral philosophers have again defended, albeit not without modifications, this ancient notion.<br>

  Abstract: The passion narrative—recounting the last days of Jesus’s life—has the greatest continuity and overlap between the four canonical Gospels, including the Gospel of John. In fact, nearly half of John’s close parallels with Mark and the other Synoptics can be found in John 18–19, tracing the events from the arrest of Jesus to his burial. When the larger outline of parallels between John and the three Synoptic Gospels regarding the last days of Jesus is listed, the particulars are impressive. Therefore, the passion narratives of the Gospels serve as a fitting place to begin when investigating glimpses<br>

  Jesus and Pilate: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cx3vmb">John, Jesus, and History, Volume 3</a><br>
  Author(s) Carter Warren<br>
  Abstract: Might explicit attention to John’s presentation of the scene between Pilate and Jesus contain some historical data of significance for understanding the historical Jesus’s death and life’s work and for answering questions about why jesus was killed by crucifixion (see fredriksen 2007 and powell 2007a)?<br>

  Author(s) North Wendy E. S.<br>
  Abstract: We may never know who the Fourth Evangelist was, but there is no mistaking the distinctiveness of his contribution to the New Testament witness to the life of Jesus of Nazareth. From the slow-moving, authoritarian Greek style, the cosmic scale of the setting, and the theological self-awareness of the central character, to the layering of irony, the often blistering polemic, and the ever-present parentheses to guide his readers, we know him well enough, do we not? In other words, we are aware that what dominates this account from beginning to end is the powerful and creative mind of its author.<br>

  The Passion of Jesus and the Gospel of John: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cx3vmb">John, Jesus, and History, Volume 3</a><br>
  Author(s) Thatcher Tom<br>
  Abstract: The Fourth Gospel’s account of the final events of Jesus’s life, including the causes and circumstances of his death, offers both special promise and special problems as a source for reconstructing his career. The Johannine passion narrative is
                  promisingsimply because this material enjoys substantial parallels with other canonical and early noncanonical Christian documents. Unlike most of the Johannine signs and sayings, the causes and events of Jesus’s trials and death are recorded, or at least alluded to, in all three synoptic Gospels, the Johannine and Pauline Epistles, a variety of noncanonical Christian texts (most significantly the Gospel of Peter),<br>

  Author(s) Ling Tim<br>
  Abstract: In November 2009, somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean on a flight to Dallas International Airport, I found myself having a conversation with a fellow passenger. She was returning home from Northern Sudan, where she had been working for an aid organization. She told me about the profound restrictions on the freedom of women to participate in any form of public life that for her characterized life in Sudan. She also, without noting the irony, told me about her work, which involved leading project teams and advocacy, including liaising with local political leaders. Her experience was both real and exceptional. We<br>

  Johannine Dominical Sayings as Metatexts of Synoptic Sayings of Jesus: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cx3vmb">John, Jesus, and History, Volume 3</a><br>
  Author(s) Theobald Michael<br>
  Abstract: There’s no denying that the Johannine Jesus speaks entirely differently from the Synoptic Jesus. Whereas the latter proclaims the kingdom
                  of God, the former continuously speaks ofhimself : “Iam the bread of life” (John 6:35); “Ihave come that you might have life” (John 10:10); “Ihave come from the Father into the world,Iwill leave the world again and go to the Father” (John 16:27).¹ This persistent, penetrating “I” seems to have little to do with the simple statements about God by the Synoptic Jesus, which scholars have taken to be more likely to be historical.<br>

  Observations on God’s Agent and Agency in John 5–9: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cx3vmb">John, Jesus, and History, Volume 3</a><br>
  Author(s) Borgen Peder<br>
  Abstract: The Gospel of John is the product of expository activity. The most important components are the life of Jesus and the scriptures, transmitted as traditions and subject to applications and other forms of interpretation. The expository activity followed certain methods. Thus a dynamic process was at work, so that the metaphor of “biology” seems more adequate than the metaphor of “anatomy” (Culpepper 1983) as a descriptor for the Fourth Gospel’s character and structure.<br>

  Author(s) Reynolds Benjamin E.<br>
  Abstract: What does the Johannine Son of Man have to do with the historical Jesus? In modern critical scholarship, the answer is: Absolutely nothing. The sentiment of the majority of scholars can still be summed up in the statement of Ernst Käsemann (1964, 32): “We must admit that nowhere in the New Testament is the life story of Jesus so emptied of all real content as it already is here [in the Gospel of John], where it seems to be almost a projection of the present back into the past.” Normally, when John’s Gospel is allowed at all as a source<br>

  Contributions of This Volume and the De-Johannification of Jesus from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cx3vmb">John, Jesus, and History, Volume 3</a><br>
  Author(s) Anderson Paul N.<br>
  Abstract: As the essays in this volume demonstrate, the evidentiary basis for excluding the Gospel of John from the historical quest for Jesus is extensively flawed, critically. Many dozens, perhaps hundreds, of instances in which the Fourth Gospel arguably contributes to a fuller understanding of the life and ministry of the prophetic figure from Nazareth require renewed consideration if the fuller database of historical information about Jesus is to be consulted. The question, of course, is how to do so. While it might be safer and less likely to err to exclude John from the quest, such a conservatively reductionistic approach<br>

  Author(s) O’CALLAGHAN JOHN P.<br>
  Abstract: A volume on the importance of philosophy for faith and theology is certainly a legacy of my teacher and friend Ralph McInerny. I hope that I can do honor to him, not just as a friend or teacher, but as a colleague precisely on a topic of such great moment in McInerny’s thought, the role of philosophy in the life of faith. One of his last books,
                  Praeambula Fidei, was a spirited defense of philosophy and the good it achieves in the life of faith, and thus for theology as reasoned reflection upon God’s revelation, what Aquinas called “sacra doctrina.”<br>

  CHAPTER THREE  Theology and the Metaphysics of Creation from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1d2dp79">Theology Needs Philosophy</a><br>
  Author(s) DEWAN LAWRENCE<br>
  Abstract: This book has for its general theme: the need of philosophy in theology.¹ My article invokes the legacy of a recently deceased colleague and friend, Ralph McInerny, one of whose last books was, in his own words, “a defense of a robust understanding of the teaching of St. Thomas Aquinas and of the Magisterium on
                     Praeambula Fidei.”² By the “praeambula fidei” he means those truths concerning God, and first of all the truth of his very existence, which can be demonstrated by philosophy, and which are essential for the life of supernatural faith.<br>

  Abstract: We have developed a sacramental model of nature’s relation to grace. As grace’s “own other,” nature incarnates grace in order for grace to realize its saving purpose. Because the redemption presupposes the created order for its own subsistence, nature cannot be conceived without its graced finalization. Grace, as we have seen, calls nature into being precisely so that grace can charge nature with its life. Drawing out the implications of this model, chapters 5 and 6 will now explore the following issue: if nature is never pure, but always obtains with grace as a unity-in-difference, then those data that belong<br>

  Abstract: Important as it was in the life of the parish, institutional Catholicism did not hold uncontested sway over the spiritual terrain of St-Joseph. A popular metaphysical world that constituted a significant sector of the mental universe of the habitants existed beside it, presenting both an alternative to and a reinforcement of the Church’s own teachings. Peter Moogk has observed that there is a fundamental difficulty for anyone today who tries to comprehend the mental and moral landscape of New France, one that was very much alive in nineteenth-century rural Québec.

Studying the forms and meanings of this sociability enables us to understand how the habitants implicitly asserted some of the important secular values of their traditional way of life in the face of explicit and repeated clerical disapproval.

  Abstract: As has been amply observed, the current proliferation of narratologies did not exactly increase disciplinary consensus on terms and procedures. Concepts that involve ethos attribution, such as those of the implied author or the (un)reliability of narrators, play a central role in rhetorical, ethical, and other forms of critically engaged narratologies, yet there is not much agreement about even these core concepts.

In the introduction we have already considered (and dismissed) the idea that media appear in the contemporary novel simply as part of the “furniture” of everyday life. It is an inadequate explanation, but it does touch on a truth that we will explore in this chapter: the novel seems to use other media as a tool for storytelling in a pragmatic way that is independent of whatever<br>

As I noted in chapter 3, writing, and thus the novel, is especially good at representing the absent, the potential, or the unrealized. By focusing on the absent, writers are able to discuss the community in which the story circulates. More broadly, contemporary media novels point to those elements of the story that are<br>

  Abstract: Herta Müller: Politics and Aestheticsexplores Müller's writings from different literary, cultural, and historical perspectives. Part 1 features Müller's Nobel lecture, five new collage poems, and an interview with Ernest Wichner, a German-Romanian author who has traveled with her and sheds light on her writing. Parts 2 and 3, featuring essays by scholars from across Europe and the United States, address the political and poetical aspects of Müller's texts. Contributors discuss life under the Romanian Communist dictatorship while also stressing key elements of Müller's poetics, which promises both self-conscious formal experimentation and political intervention.<br>

Müller is without question a political author whose writing describes and indicts the mechanisms of surveillance and oppression and their effects on people. Harassment and surveillance by the authorities and secret police of the Romanian dictatorship frequently mark the day-to-day life of her protagonists.

Our motivation for this chapter grew out of our work together and conversations about the first author’s own (non-Pueblo) experiences at ancient sites compared to how the second author perceives the role of the past in his own life and more broadly in Hopi society.

  Abstract: During the eighty years between the American Revolution and the Civil War, slavery was indispensable to the economic development of the United States.

A scholarly revolution over the past two decades, which brought mainstream historical accounts into line with long-standing positions in Africana and Black Studies, has recognized slavery as the foundational American institution, organizing the nation’s politics, legal structures, and cultural practices with remarkable power to determine the life chances of those moving through society as black or white.

  Abstract: “Like people and schools of criticism, ideas and theories travel—from person to person, from situation to situation, from one period to another. Cultural and intellectual life are usually nourished and often sustained by this circulation of ideas, and whether it takes the form of acknowledged or unconscious influence, creative borrowing, or wholesale appropriation, the movement of ideas and theories from one place to another is both a fact of life and a usefully enabling condition of intellectual activity.” Edward Said’s words suggest how ideas and theories travel or are borrowed and used in different places for different purposes: “For<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1dgn4wh">The Rhizomatic West</a><br>
  Abstract: As I discussed in the previous chapter, Sergio Leone’s films were seen by some as the death knell of the Western and by others as its regenerative force, breathing new life into a tired, mythic formula and seeing the genre as the site for cultural critique and counterhegemonic practice. The established generic grid of the Western proved elastic and porous enough for new filmmakers looking to utilize its broad expectations and codes for different purposes, building on the promising works of directors such as Nicholas Ray, Sam Peckinpah, and Robert Altman. Often these innovations came from outside the Hollywood mainstream,<br>

  Book Title: Public Memory in Early China-  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Brashier K. E.<br>
  Abstract: In early imperial China, the dead were remembered by stereotyping them, by relating them to the existing public memory and not by vaunting what made each person individually distinct and extraordinary in his or her lifetime. Their posthumous names were chosen from a limited predetermined pool; their descriptors were derived from set phrases in the classical tradition; and their identities were explicitly categorized as being like this cultural hero or that sage official in antiquity. In other words, postmortem remembrance was a process of pouring new ancestors into prefabricated molds or stamping them with rigid cookie cutters. Public Memory in Early China is an examination of this pouring and stamping process. After surveying ways in which learning in the early imperial period relied upon memorization and recitation, K. E. Brashier treats three definitive parameters of identity—name, age, and kinship—as ways of negotiating a person’s relative position within the collective consciousness. He then examines both the tangible and intangible media responsible for keeping that defined identity welded into the infrastructure of Han public memory.<br>

  Book Title: Lydia Ginzburg's Prose-Reality in Search of Literature<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Van Buskirk Emily<br>
  Abstract: Based on a decade's work in Ginzburg's archives, the book discusses previously unknown manuscripts and uncovers a wealth of new information about the author's life, focusing on Ginzburg's quest for a new kind of writing adequate to her times. She writes of universal experiences-frustrated love, professional failures, remorse, aging-and explores the modern fragmentation of identity in the context of war, terror, and an oppressive state. Searching for a new concept of the self, and deeming the psychological novel (a beloved academic specialty) inadequate to express this concept, Ginzburg turned to fragmentary narratives that blur the lines between history, autobiography, and fiction.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1dr36q1">Lydia Ginzburg's Prose</a><br>
  Abstract: For seven decades, Lydia Ginzburg (1902–90) wrote about the reality of daily life and historical change in Soviet Russia. In fragmentary notes and narratives, she exercised what she saw as the unique possibilities of “in-between” genres (human documents, memoirs, essays, autobiographies) to bring representations of new realms of life and thought into literature. She recorded, with an unmatched degree of insight and lucidity, how her contemporaries shaped their personalities and self-images in response to the Soviet experience. Yet in the English-speaking world, she is still known primarily as a literary scholar (author of the book

  Abstract: In her book
                  On Psychological Prose, first published in 1971, Ginzburg articulates the realm in which life and literature dynamically interact as we model our personalities: in daily life, people understand themselves and others through “creative constructs,” carrying out the aesthetic work of “selection, correlation, and symbolic interpretation of psychic elements.” The processes through which we compose and project our self-images resemble the creative acts authors perform when designing literary characters or lyric personae. Not only are these processes similar, they are symbiotic, since a personality “shapes itself, both internally and externally, by means of images, many of which have<br>

  CONCLUSION: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1dr36q1">Lydia Ginzburg's Prose</a><br>
  Abstract: Lydia Ginzburg is a writer whose techniques of analysis and ethical evaluation aim to overcome the catastrophic predicament of the “post-individualist self.” This person is fragmented but anti-Romantic, and lacking moral absolutes; he is “immanent,” meaning that he can experience life’s value only empirically, in and through himself. He is crushed and tested by the external circumstances of war and terror, and has no grounds on which to base a hope for a revolutionary transformation that could bring about a more just society. As Ginzburg wrote during the Leningrad Blockade—and just a few years after Stalin’s purges: “when you<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1dr37p0">Forms of Life</a><br>
  Abstract: Every realistic novel gives us innumerable details: how people look, what they wear, where they live. We generally accept these details as what Henry James called “solidity of specification.”¹ They give us the air of reality, the illusion of life, without which the novel can hardly survive. Yet clearly there can be no end to such specification if we allow it full range. At what point do we set limits and by what means? Can there be pure irrelevance? And, if not, what degrees of irrelevance can we admit?<br>

  Abstract: “The notion that peasants are joyous, that the typical moment to represent a man in a smock-frock is when he is cracking a joke and showing a row of sound teeth, that cottage matrons are usually buxom, and village children necessarily rosy and merry, are prejudices difficult to dislodge from the artistic mind, which looks for its subjects into literature instead of life.” George Eliot evokes, as one alternative, the “slow gaze, in which no sense of beauty beams, no humour twinkles—the slow utterance, and the heavy slouching walk.” She scorns sentimental idealization. “The selfish instincts are not subdued<br>

  Abstract: It is difficult to account for the remarkable sense of depth as well as breadth we feel in reading Tolstoy. Sir Isaiah Berlin, in describing that sense, has come closer than anyone else to explaining it. Tolstoy’s heroes achieve a kind of serenity through coming to accept “the permanent relationships of things and the universal texture of human life.” Through them we become aware of an order underlying and perhaps girding the world of our experience. It is an order which “ ‘contains’ and determines the structure of experience, the framework on which it—that is, we and all we<br>

  Book Title: In a Different Place-Pilgrimage, Gender, and Politics at a Greek Island Shrine<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Dubisch Jill<br>
  Abstract: In a Different Placeoffers a richly textured account of a modern pilgrimage, combining ethnographic detail, theory, and personal reflection. Visited by thousands of pilgrims yearly, the Church of the Madonna of the Annunciation on the Aegean island of Tinos is a site where different interests--sacred and secular, local and national, personal and official--all come together. Exploring the shrine and its surrounding town, Jill Dubisch shares her insights into the intersection of social, religious, and political life in Greece. Along the way she develops the idea of pilgrimage-journeying away from home in search of the miraculous--as a metaphor for anthropological fieldwork. This highly readable work offers us the opportunity to share one anthropologist's personal and professional journey and to see in a "different place" the inadequacy of such conventional anthropological categories as theory versus data, rationality versus emotion, and the observer versus the observed.<br>

  Abstract: My own “vow” reflects a particularly complex, long-term, and even intimate relationship with a certain set of religious practices. As I look back on my earlier fieldwork, I realize that religion was part of my experience of Greek life almost from my first days in the village. This is illustrated by an entry in my journal on August 4, 1969, about two weeks after my husband and I had settled in Falatados. I spent part of this day with some village women, accompanying them to their garden in the countryside. It was a frustrating experience for me as I struggled<br>

The Anastenaria has been a powerful symbol for the shared identity of the Kostilides ever since their arrival as refugees in Greek Macedonia. It epitomizes all that it means to be a Kostilis in a society that is experiencing the homogenizing effects of mass media, a national educational system, and rapid modernization and urbanization.

  Book Title: Taking Hold of the Real-Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the Profound Worldliness of Christianity<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Harvey Barry<br>
  Abstract: Dietrich Bonhoeffer writes in one of his last prison letters that he had “come to know and understand more and more the profound this-worldliness of Christianity." In Taking Hold of the Real, Barry Harvey engages in constructive conversation with Bonhoeffer, contending that the “shallow and banal this-worldliness" of modern society is ordered to a significant degree around the social technologies of religion, culture, and race. These mechanisms displace human beings from their traditional connections with particular locales, and relocate them in their “proper places" as determined by the nation-state and capitalist markets. Christians are called to participate in the profound this-worldliness that breaks into the world in the apocalyptic action of Jesus Christ, a form of life that requires discipline and an understanding of death and resurrection. The church is a sacrament of this new humanity, performing for all to hear the polyphony of life that was prefigured in the Old Testament and now is realised in Christ. Unable to find a faithful form of this-worldliness in wartime Germany, Bonhoeffer joined the conspiracy against Hitler, a decision aptly contrasted with a small French church that, prepared by its life together over many generations, saved thousands of Jewish lives.<br>

  Abstract: Long before the age of the megalopolis, movement has defined cities. As complex constellations of people, objects and signs, cities are spaces where social, political and historical relations undergo constant negotiation and where the realities and representations of urban life are in persistent and dynamic states of becoming. This is to say that each person’s experience of the city organizes an intricately shifting site for the production and exchange of meaning. Simply walking through the streets – choosing a particular path to follow, avoiding certain others – involves many acts of interpretation and mediation, ways of practising urban space that<br>

  Abstract: Recognizing the inexhaustible quality of the urban flow of goods, capital and people that inform metropolitan life and in order to approach a means of interpreting urban travel writing, it is helpful to engage with a number of influential theoretical approaches for understanding cities. This chapter explores theories of the city along two main axes: first, as a material condition of the planning perspective, which is to say an urban environment concerned with function and place-making; and, second, as a narrative space, a space of practice where meanings are performed by subjects in places across space and time.

  Abstract: While the Virginian Lucian Minor could praise “Yankee hospitality” during the early years of the sectional crisis in the 1830s, by the 1850s sectional tensions had caused regional prejudices, stereotypes, and suspicions to harden to such an extent that such praise would have seemed impossible. The language of “southern hospitality” emerged in the 1830s amid the growing sectional crisis that began to consume American culture, and it would only proliferate as the crisis intensified in the decades leading up to the Civil War.

  Abstract: Writing against the backdrop of the civil rights movement in the 1960s, the historian and activist Howard Zinn offered the following assessment of what he described as the South’s pervasive xenophobia, linking it to southern hospitality: “It is one of the curious paradoxes of Southern life that suspicion of strangers, of outsiders, goes along with what is called ‘Southern hospitality.’ The answer to the paradox is that there is a line of demarcation which separates the accepted person from the unaccepted.

  Abstract: James Weldon Johnson, who thought of
                  The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Manas a living, moving work— a “biography of the race”—no doubt would have had much to add to his novel as he viewed more than a century of African American experiences following its publication. The novel has proven prescient in the way it anticipated the ongoing story of African American life. This story, still unfolding in the twenty-first century, is central to everything the United States as a nation stands for.

  Book Title: Transcendence and the Concrete-Selected Writings<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Moore Ian Alexander<br>
  Abstract: Jean Wahl (1888GÇô1974), once considered by the likes of Georges Bataille, Gilles Deleuze, Emmanuel Levinas, and Gabriel Marcel to be among the greatest French philosophers, has today nearly been forgotten outside France. Yet his influence on French philosophical thought can hardly be overestimated. Levinas wrote that GÇ£during over a half century of teaching and research, [Wahl] was the life force of the academic, extra-academic, and even, to a degree anti-academic philosophy necessary to a great culture.GÇ¥ And Deleuze, for his part, commented that GÇ£Apart from Sartre, who remained caught none the less in the trap of the verb to be, the most important philosopher in France was Jean Wahl.GÇ¥_x000D_ Besides engaging with the likes of Bataille, Bergson, Deleuze, Derrida, Levinas, Maritain, and Sartre, Wahl also played a significant role, in some cases almost singlehandedly, in introducing French philosophy to movements like existentialism, and American pragmatism and literature, and thinkers like Hegel, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Jaspers, and Heidegger. Yet Wahl was also an original philosopher and poet in his own right. This volume of selections from WahlGÇÖs philosophical writings makes a selection of his most important work available to the English-speaking philosophical community for the first time._x000D_ Jean Wahl was Professor of Philosophy at the Sorbonne from 1936 to 1967, save during World War II, which he spent in the United States, having escaped from the Drancy internment camp. His books to appear in English include The Pluralist Philosophies of England and America (Open Court, 1925), The Philosopher's Way (Oxford UP, 1948), A Short History of Existentialism (Philosophical Library, 1949), and Philosophies of Existence (Schocken, 1969).<br>

  Abstract: The Gift of Love builds upon recent scholarship and reads Augustine’s De Trinitate as a rational study of the limits of theological language and the possibility of knowing the Trinity because of those limits. Marion’s description of the gift of love offers to Augustine’s theology a phenomenological texture by which the trinitarian love given might be made incarnate in one’s life.

  Author(s) Fox Sherry C.<br>
  Abstract: Mimesisis the imitation of nature and life in art or literature. According to Plato, all art is mimetic of life and therefore a reflection of reality. This theory has spawned an entire philosophy and study of art and the nature of reality and identity (i.e.Potolsky 2006, Halliwell 2009 — for a prehistoric example see Borić 2007). If art does indeed reflect reality, then this could present a window into the past, representing either ideal images for a particular period or specific individuals.

  Author(s) Kouka Ourania<br>
  Abstract: Following the aforementioned definition, which corresponds also to theoretical approaches of embodiment and its perception (Merleau-Ponty 1964, 159–90; Lesure 2005), it is argued that the built environment demonstrates from prehistoric times an anthropogenic system of closed and open spaces for hosting every-day life, economic, social and symbolic activities. It represents, therefore, an agent through which the needs, abilities and habits of humans are embodied, but also the field for economic and social interaction. Moreover, built environment — domestic, funeral, and sacred — displays the existential ground of culture that allows the identification of its cognitive creator and owner.<br>

  Abstract: In an early paper on embodiment, Lynn Meskell (1996) ended her argument wondering whether
                  the bodywill eventually remain a central analytic subject in archaeology or will dissolve into yet another intellectual fad. True, archaeology has come rather late in this field, which had already dominated the social sciences, anthropology, and feminist studies (Csordas 1994a){Csordas, 1994 #8978}{Csordas, 1994 #9578}{Csordas, 1994 #9578}. Almost two decades later, the proliferation of the relevant archaeological literature shows beyond doubt that the concept is now well-established and directs, one way or another, much of the ongoing archaeological analysis.

  Abstract: Jacques Lacan (2001, 341) has famously declared that “it is not enough to decide on the basis of its effect—Death. it still remains to be decided which death, that which is brought by life or that which brings life.” Of course, for Lacan, whose psychoanalysis has much to do with one’s relations to death and the dead (Luepnitz 2003, 232), there is a difference between biological and psychic death and hence between mortality and vitality. Nevertheless, his statement does highlight, in a delightfully ironic way, how talk about death can—or should—be both specific and ambiguous at the<br>

  Abstract: It would be difficult to overstate the impact of technologies of mechanical reproduction on the visual culture of Weimar Germany, as a flood of images from photography and film upended conventional models of cultural literacy following the media boom of the early 1920s. Within this context film has attracted far greater attention than photography because of its explosive potential as a mimetic medium that can convey a sense of unfolding time and engender fresh modes of collective reception. Yet the photographic image was an even more ubiquitous and flexible instrument of visual dissemination because of the unprecedented proliferation of newspapers<br>

The chair of the Dialect Society’s New Words Committee was quick to acknowledge that “occupy” was, in fact, “a very old word,” but noted that “over the course of just a few months it took on another life and moved in new and unexpected directions.”³ When a column on this topic appeared in

  Chapter 1  ALL ALONG THE WATERSHED: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gxp8kc">Sixties Radicalism and Social Movement Activism</a><br>
  Author(s) Jones Bryn<br>
  Abstract: There is an influential historical consensus that 1960s radicalism in Britain had no significant or lasting impact on the social and political order. In this view, the longer-term effects of the ideas and movements, often associated with the climactic year of 1968, have been confined to popular culture, life-styles and inter-personal relations. It is said that political institutions remained unperturbed and almost unaffected by the intellectual and ideological ferment occurring in the arts, media, universities, street politics and youth cultures. From this historical-empiricist perspective the significance of ’68 in Britain was apolitical and confined to the personal and cultural sphere<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gxp8kc">Sixties Radicalism and Social Movement Activism</a><br>
  Author(s) Harding Eloise<br>
  Abstract: The above quotation to some extent encapsulates the Situationists’ perspective on revolutionary theory. Put simply, the Situationists did not believe in either waiting for a revolution or deferring the living of life until after this possibly hypothetical point. The claim that ‘everybody wants to breathe’ describes the existence of a human spirit which can be truly revolutionary when brought to the surface. ‘Nobody can breathe’ depicts the ‘spectacular’ world in which we live, mired in the illusion of mainstream society<br>

  Author(s) McKechnie Rosemary<br>
  Abstract: Where have the revolutions gone? What happens with the passion of the day once movements are no longer publicly visible – what does it transform into? And what are the lessons learned? Our concern in this chapter is to critically examine the idealism of political movements following the moment of 1968, by listening to the voices of adults who have been engaged in a range of activist projects over their lifetime. Our discussion is founded on in-depth life story interviews with adults in the UK, however to contextualize and analyse this material we draw on theories about new social movements<br>

  Conclusion from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gxp8kc">Sixties Radicalism and Social Movement Activism</a><br>
  Author(s) O’Donnell Mike<br>
  Abstract: This book began by contrasting polarised interpretations of the longer term impact of sixties radicalism. One cluster sees cultural, social and political rebellion as ephemeral, politically inconsequential or absorbed into the mainstream. Others see legacies and practices from sixties radicalism as established and still influential in contemporary radical protest. This divergence is illustrated by the views of two Americans: Noam Chomsky (2009) and Gerard DeGroot (2008). On the BBC world news programme
                  Hardtalk(November 3 2009) Chomsky consistently attributed what he sees as an increase in freedom of expression in American public life to the long-term impact of the radical<br>

  Abstract: A great writer and an outstanding moral figure of the twentieth century was responsible for the next text we are to analyse:
                  Caligulaby Albert Camus. Hannah Arendt, writing to her husband from Paris, described him as ‘the best man in France’. Yet in his lifetime the novelist, a nobel laureate, beloved of thousands of readers, remained, as is well known, at times isolated and unheeded in a period of ideological conflicts, of opposed blocs and themaîtres à penserof the century. Today, however, a revaluation is rightly under way. His moral authority, lucidity, courage and intellectual substance are<br>

  Abstract: Compassion is a key theme and foundation of life in paths of Buddha. it means to share in the suffering and joy of others. According to the Dalai Lama, this is the foundation of Buddhism, especially tibetan Buddhism. Compassion heals and makes new ways of human development and social transformations possible. But compassion needs to be accompanied by confrontation: the courage to confront those parts of self and society which do not help us to blossom and realize our potential. In my recent visit to China and tibet (July– August 2009) I saw images of Buddha as well as the<br>

  Chapter Twelve  RETHINKING THE POLITICS AND ETHICS OF CONSUMPTION: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gxpb96">Knowledge and Human Liberation</a><br>
  Abstract: Consumption provides us with many important challenges now. The contemporary facts of consumption urge us to rethink the ethics and politics of it.² Concern with political consumerism tends to argue how appropriate consumption linked to life-style politics can have a politically significant critical function. But there are two related problems with such a contemporary approach to consumption. First, it is concerned with consumption without relating it to production, and second, the politics of consumption in the practice of political consumerism is not accompanied by a project of ethics. The present chapter seeks to rethink the politics and ethics of consumption<br>

  Abstract: A transformative sociology? A transformative and transforming “knowledge” of social life? These phrases are signature notions of Ananta Kumar Giri. In a string of earlier publications, he has provided sketches adumbrating these notions. Now, in the present volume, he finally has enlisted all his rich intellectual resources in order to flesh out the meaning of an active kind of “knowledge” capable of promoting human “liberation” or emancipation. As one should note, liberation for Giri does not just denote deliverance from oppressive social and political structures, but also the overcoming of inner compulsions and addictions standing in the way of genuine<br>

  Abstract: Light figures being; darkness, death. Bridging mathematical science, semantics, rhetoric, grammar, and major poems, Judith H. Anderson seeks to negotiate writings from multiple disciplines in the shared terms of poiesis and figuration rather than as cultural opposites. Analogy, a type of metaphor, has always been the connector of the known to the unknown, the sensible to the infinite. Anderson’s study moves from the figuration of light and death to the history of analogy and its pertinence to light in physics and metaphysics, from Kepler to Donne, Spenser, and Milton. Topics proliferate: creativity, optics, the relation of literature to science, the methodology of thought and argument, and the processes of narrative, discovery, and interpretation.<br>

  Book Title: Metaphor, Morality, and the Spirit in Romans 8-1–17<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Robinson William E. W.<br>
  Abstract: In this innovative book, William E. W. Robinson takes the reader on a journey through Romans 8:1-17 using Conceptual Metaphor Theory and Conceptual Integration Theory. Robinson delineates the underlying cognitive metaphors, their structure, their function, what they mean, and how Paul's audiences then and now are able to comprehend their meaning. He examines each metaphor in the light of relevant aspects of the Greco-Roman world and Paul's Jewish background. Robinson contends that Paul portrays the Spirit as the principal agent in the religious-ethical life of believers. At the same time, his analysis demonstrates that the conceptual metaphors in Romans 8:1-17 convey the integral role of believers in ethical conduct. In the process, he addresses thorny theological issues such as whether Spirit and flesh signal an internal battle within believers or two conflicting ways of life. Finally, Robinson shows how this study is relevant to related Pauline passages and challenges scholars to incorporate these methods into their own investigation of biblical texts.<br>

  Book Title: The Resounding Soul-Reflections on the Metaphysics and Vivacity of the Human Person<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Kimbriel Samuel<br>
  Abstract: It is surely not coincidental that the term “soul" should mean not only the centre of a creature’s life and consciousness, but also a thing or action characterized by intense vivacity (“that bike’s got soul!"). It also seems far from coincidental that the same contemporary academic discussions that have largely cast aside the language of “soul" in their quest to define the character of human mental life should themselves be so – how to say it? – bloodless, so lacking in soul. This volume arises from the opposite premise, namely that the task of understanding human nature is bound up with and in important respects dependent upon the more critical task of learning to be fully human, of learning to have soul. The papers collected here are derived from a conference in Oxford sponsored by the Centre of Theology and Philosophy and together explore the often surprising landscape that emerges when human consciousness is approached from this angle. Drawing upon literary, philosophical, theological, historical, and musical modes of analysis, the essays of this volume vividly remind the reader of the power of the ancient language of soul over against contemporary impulses to reduce, fragment, and overly determine human selfhood.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1hd17z7">The Resounding Soul</a><br>
  Author(s) Piazza Anna<br>
  Abstract: One of the most fecund themes of Paul Ludwig Landsberg’s anthropology, which stands out for a presentation of man’s potential “self-comprehension” on the basis of a lived “inner-experience,” is his reflection concerning death and the confrontation with the human conscience of death, which threatens the sense of life and the search for an overcoming of transitoriness. It was in
                  Espritwhere Landsberg published, in 1935, the two essays related to this topic,Die Erfahrung des TodesandDas moralische Problem des Selbstmorder. In particular, we would like to analyze the former, and compare it with the positions of two other<br>

  Abstract: This chapter will consider Bernard Stiegler’s political ideal, the new

  Abstract: Dresden, the winter of 1828–29. In the final months of a life not wanting in notoriety, Friedrich Schlegel (born 1772) delivers a set of curious lectures “concerning in particular the philosophy of language and words.”¹ They are the third part of a trilogy, collectively christened the Philosophy of Life

  Abstract: The most appropriate type of relation that should exist between the individual and society has been an intractable problem for social and political philosophy. The problem arises because we believe, on one hand, that the individual human being has autonomy, freedom, and dignity—values that are considered most worthwhile and ought therefore to be respected by the society; we believe, on the other hand, that the individual not only is a natural member of the human society but needs society and all that it makes available for the realization of the individual’s potential, and for living a life that is<br>

  Author(s) HENRY PAGET<br>
  Abstract: There are idealist views of philosophy that see it as an affirmation of the autonomy of a thinking subject. As the primary instrument of this absolute subject, philosophy shares in its autonomy and therefore is a discipline that rises above the determinations of history and everyday life. The distinguishing characteristics of Afro-Caribbean philosophy do not support this view. Here we find a tradition of philosophy so indelibly marked by the forces of an imperial history, and by its intertextual relations with neighboring discourses, that it is necessary to begin with a general characterization of philosophy that is more appropriate to<br>

  Abstract: The sensibilities of the Black American intellectual concerning race have historically been cemented to their ascendency within empire. how one writes about race, offering hope for change in opposition to the totality of racism, and communicates an aspiration for the possibilities made available by American ideals like freedom, justice, and equality has separated the radical from the progressive.

With the proliferation of time-lapse satellite images showing the shrinking polar ice cap, documentary PHOTOGRAPHY and film following the pace of glacial melt, and the prominence of the Northwest Passage as a maritime transportation corridor, the Arctic has a recurring cultural visuality and instrumentality all its own and utterly of the present.

One shape that such a collective truth takes is “community.” As it has underwritten new arrangements of global capitalist ACCUMULATION over the last century, oil has offered up community by reconstituting the possible forms and imaginaries of collective social life. Petroleum products have promised public and private spaces of leisure, freedom, and urbanized modernity; oil value chains have produced transnational and cosmopolitan NET WORKS of IDENTITY ; flows of oil have invited us into affective spectacles of consumption; and oil has extended and/or compressed the time-space experiences<br>

This dialectic of protracted ruination and fatal promise crystallizes the ethos of our time. If the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth-century moment that inaugurated the age of oil was also, at least in some places, a time of modernist hope for human liberation against the specter of annihilation, the present appears more obviously marked by proliferating decay, desperate walling-in from inequality, political discourse utterly disengaged from arts of survival, and painful archiving of<br>

Poetry is “a sword of lightning,” a revolutionary force “which consumes the scabbard that would contain it,” while a fascination with “electricity and galvanism” leads Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein to his “utter and terrible destruction” (2002 [1818], 43).

From its beginnings Judaism regarded itself as the religion of a chosen people that drew lines of separation between itself and others (especially in the matter of purity) while also welcoming the stranger. Christianity and Islam acted similarly.

  Book Title: Children of God in the World-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): O’Callaghan Paul<br>
  Abstract: Children of God in the World is a textbook of theological anthropology structured in four parts. The first attempts to clarify the relationship between theology, philosophy and science in their respective approaches to anthropology, and establishes the fundamental principle of the text, stated in Vatican II's Gaudium et spes, n. 22, "Christ manifests man to man." The second part provides a historical overview of the doctrine of grace: in Scripture (especially the teaching of the book of Genesis on humans 'made in the image of God', as well as Paul and John), among the Fathers (in particular the oriental doctrine of 'divinization' and Augustine), during the Middle Ages (especially Thomas Aquinas) and the Reformation period (centered particularly on Luther and the Council of Trent), right up to modern times. The third part of the text, the central one, provides a systematic understanding of Christian grace in terms of the God's life present in human believers by which they become children of God, disciples, friends and brothers of Christ, temples of the Holy Spirit. This section also provides a reflection on the theological virtues (faith, hope and charity), on the relationship between grace and human freedom, on the role of the Church and Christian apostolate in the communication of grace, and on the need humans have for divine grace. After considering the relationship between the natural and the supernatural order, the fourth and last part deals with different philosophical aspects of the human condition, in the light of Christian faith: the union between body and soul, humans as free, historical, social, sexual and working beings. The last chapter concludes with a consideration of the human person, Christianity's greatest and most enduring contribution to human thought.<br>

On the basis of this knowledge they desire and attempt to achieve their ultimate identity, to realize themselves. I have used the terms “to know” and “to achieve” because all persons, as they know themselves and act, experience a discrepancy between the concrete situation they are in (their present identity or situation, concrete, finite, and mundane) and an ultimate ideal to which they aspire (a fullness of identity that is definitive, ideal, or,<br>

  Abstract: Scripture does not have a developed and systematic anthropology. Yet both Testaments speak of the human being in a wide variety of ways.³ This is especially so in the first book of the Bible, Genesis, which recounts the creation of the universe, the first stage of the Covenant that God established with his people and with humanity as a whole regarding its origin, its life, its Fall, and the promise of salvation. The fact that these texts are situated at the very beginning of scripture, though they are not the earliest ones of the Old Testament, is not without significance.<br>

  Abstract: Let us now consider the doctrine of grace in the

First, as a maturation of the teaching of Paul and John in the light of the pastoral and intellectual challenges of the Church’s mission in different situations,⁴ particularly in the context of the Gnostic heresy. And second, as a kind of “developed Christology”: divine grace is described and understood on the basis of the insertion and manifestation of the life of Christ in believers, as the direct fruit of the incarnation of the Word, which makes the believer become a son or<br>

  13  CHILDREN OF GOD IN THE HOLY SPIRIT: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1hrdn0m">Children of God in the World</a><br>
  Abstract: Grace has God as its origin, as its only source. Grace is simply the life of God in humans. As we saw in the last chapter, grace is present at every stage of human life; it presides over a wide-ranging historical narrative composed of different stages that are, while distinct, inseparable from one another: creation, predestination in Christ, divine call, justification of the person and his gradual purification from sin, and, finally, eschatological communion with the Trinity in glory. We considered them in the previous chapter.<br>

  Abstract: We have just considered what might be called the “objective-metaphysical” side of grace: humans, through the gift of God, are transformed, ontologically elevated, renewed to the depths of their being and faculties by divine grace. On the basis of this elevation we shall now consider the “psychological-moral” side of the life of grace, that is, the renewal that God brings about within the faculties and actions of the human person. In effect, with grace God infuses truly divine powers into the soul, usually called “infused virtues,” powers with which Christians act as God’s children in a truly Christ-like and pneumatological<br>

  Book Title: Children of God in the World-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): O’Callaghan Paul<br>
  Abstract: Children of God in the World is a textbook of theological anthropology structured in four parts. The first attempts to clarify the relationship between theology, philosophy and science in their respective approaches to anthropology, and establishes the fundamental principle of the text, stated in Vatican II's Gaudium et spes, n. 22, "Christ manifests man to man." The second part provides a historical overview of the doctrine of grace: in Scripture (especially the teaching of the book of Genesis on humans 'made in the image of God', as well as Paul and John), among the Fathers (in particular the oriental doctrine of 'divinization' and Augustine), during the Middle Ages (especially Thomas Aquinas) and the Reformation period (centered particularly on Luther and the Council of Trent), right up to modern times. The third part of the text, the central one, provides a systematic understanding of Christian grace in terms of the God's life present in human believers by which they become children of God, disciples, friends and brothers of Christ, temples of the Holy Spirit. This section also provides a reflection on the theological virtues (faith, hope and charity), on the relationship between grace and human freedom, on the role of the Church and Christian apostolate in the communication of grace, and on the need humans have for divine grace. After considering the relationship between the natural and the supernatural order, the fourth and last part deals with different philosophical aspects of the human condition, in the light of Christian faith: the union between body and soul, humans as free, historical, social, sexual and working beings. The last chapter concludes with a consideration of the human person, Christianity's greatest and most enduring contribution to human thought.<br>

  Abstract: Humans inevitably want to know themselves, they want to know about the meaning of their life, they want to know their identity, their inner truth, their destiny. On the basis of this knowledge they desire and attempt to achieve their ultimate identity, to realize themselves. I have used the terms “to know” and “to achieve” because all persons, as they know themselves and act, experience a discrepancy between the concrete situation they are in (their present identity or situation, concrete, finite, and mundane) and an ultimate ideal to which they aspire (a fullness of identity that is definitive, ideal, or,<br>

  4  THE HUMAN BEING ACCORDING TO SCRIPTURE: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1hrdn0m">Children of God in the World</a><br>
  Abstract: Scripture does not have a developed and systematic anthropology. Yet both Testaments speak of the human being in a wide variety of ways.³ This is especially so in the first book of the Bible, Genesis, which recounts the creation of the universe, the first stage of the Covenant that God established with his people and with humanity as a whole regarding its origin, its life, its Fall, and the promise of salvation. The fact that these texts are situated at the very beginning of scripture, though they are not the earliest ones of the Old Testament, is not without significance.<br>

  Abstract: Let us now consider the doctrine of grace in the
                  corpus paulinum.¹ In the face of human sinfulness and the presumptuous attitude humans often have in performing “good works,” the apostle to the Gentiles insists above all on humans’ absolute need for the grace of Christ, God’s pure gift, in order to be saved. Grace places us in a new state by means of a “new creation” in which we become children of God through the power of the Holy Spirit and are freed from sin and slavery, introduced into a new life, and moved to witness our faith before<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1hrdn0m">Children of God in the World</a><br>
  Abstract: In the early centuries of Christian theology, the doctrine of grace developed in two principal, fundamentally convergent, directions. First, as a maturation of the teaching of Paul and John in the light of the pastoral and intellectual challenges of the Church’s mission in different situations,⁴ particularly in the context of the Gnostic heresy. And second, as a kind of “developed Christology”: divine grace is described and understood on the basis of the insertion and manifestation of the life of Christ in believers, as the direct fruit of the incarnation of the Word, which makes the believer become a son or<br>

  Abstract: As we read scripture we come to recognize, at the heart of the mystery of God’s relationship with humans, a project of grace, a project of gratuitous and intimate love, which not only calls humans to existence but also invites them to share in the life of the Trinity, in a communion with the divine that is destined to last for ever.

  Abstract: Emblematic of a dark period in a troubled colonization, the workhouse is a dirty word in Irish history. Its system, buildings, and sites comprise a challenging representational struggle between erasure and reconstruction in remembrance. Workhouses took years to build, employed thousands in the building process, subsequently housed hundreds of thousands from 1840s onward and yet remain a quiet aspect of Famine memory in visual and material culture.¹ The absence of extensively conserved workhouses is a consequence of life going on after the Famine, as some sites became utilized for different purposes and others succumbed to politically motivated destruction.² Workhouses have<br>

  Abstract: The past is always present in Northern Ireland, structuring everyday experience to a degree not generally found elsewhere. In a society where historical events are continually relevant to contemporary life, both cultural memory and processes of memorialization become significant means whereby people live out their identities. In turn, this level of awareness also informs aspects of the visual: artists are not separate from the culture they inhabit but are equally formed by its shared experiences of community, danger, and loss. Much of the work of artists in post-conflict Northern Ireland bears the marks of this communality of experience, whether through<br>

Workhouses took years to build, employed thousands in the building process, subsequently housed hundreds of thousands from 1840s onward and yet remain a quiet aspect of Famine memory in visual and material culture.¹ The absence of extensively conserved workhouses is a consequence of life going on after the Famine, as some sites became utilized for different purposes and others succumbed to politically motivated destruction.² Workhouses have<br>

  Abstract: Since the mid–nineteenth century at least, Ireland has appeared in American culture somewhat as it does on “The Surrealist Map of the World”—larger than life and severely distorted. Most imported Irish cultural elements have, historically, been systematically mediated through mass cultural forms; that is, they have entered into American consciousness as artifacts of commodity culture. That this has been occurring for at least 150 years is clear from recent research into the tourism industry in Ireland, which has been promoting itself actively since the end of the Great Famine. Less researched, however, is what lies behind or motivates<br>

  Author(s) FRAWLEY OONA<br>
  Abstract: While terms like “memory,” “cultural memory,” and their variants frequently occur in the discourses of Irish literature, culture, and history, “memory” has remained largely undefined, addressed laterally. That the field of Irish studies has thus far failed adequately to define memory is hardly surprising, since those who have made memory their lifework experience similar problems. Memory, as the neuroscientist Antonio Damasio points out, is particularly elusive. “We are not conscious,” he writes, “of which memories we store and which memories we do not; of how we store memories; of how we classify and organize them; of how we interrelate memories<br>

  Abstract: The current proliferation of analyses dealing with memory does not signal a temporary fascination or a provisional critical turn. The sustained interest in multiple aspects of memory, remembrance, and various forms of amnesia is the product of the psychological, sociocultural, and historical denominators that have decidedly transformed our lives in the last two or three decades. The advent and global dissemination of the Internet’s ephemeral forms of knowledge and its technologization of memory as the storage capacity of digital media are themselves causes enough to review the spatial and temporal dimensions of cognition, memory, and being.

  Book Title: Placing Aesthetics-Reflections on the Philosophic Tradition<br>
  Publisher: Ohio University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wood Robert E.<br>
  Abstract: Examining select high points in the speculative tradition from Plato and Aristotle through the Middle Ages and German tradition to Dewey and Heidegger,
      Placing Aestheticsseeks to locate the aesthetic concern within the larger framework of each thinker's philosophy.In Professor Robert Wood's study, aesthetics is not peripheral but rather central to the speculative tradition and to human existence as such. In Dewey's terms, aesthetics is "experience in its integrity." Its personal ground is in "the heart," which is the dispositional ground formed by genetic, cultural , and personal historical factors by which we are spontaneously moved and, in turn, are inclined to move, both practically and theoretically, in certain directions.Prepared for use by the student as well as the philosopher,Placing Aestheticsaims to recover the fullness of humanness within a sense of the fullness of encompassing Being. It attempts to overcome the splitting of thought, even in philosophy, into exclusive specializations and the fracturing of life itself into theoretical, practical, and emotive dimensions.<br>

  Abstract: “Secularism” is a philosophy that holds that the affairs and organization of society should be arranged according to principles and rules derived from experience and human insight without reference to customs, revelations, or sacred books whose authority is derived from God or the gods or ancestors. It is distinct from the process of “secularization” whereby the state, professions such as medicine and law, and academic fields such as archeology gradually take over areas of human life once governed by religion and the church.

  Author(s) OGLETREE THOMAS W.<br>
  Abstract: Biblical portrayals of the love commands are interwoven with presentations of more comprehensive bodies of commandments, laws, and ordinances that order human affairs in particular social settings. The love commands provide a substantive foundation for these more complex resources, undergirding their authority and informing efforts to observe them faithfully in ongoing life practices. This essay focuses on distinctive yet overlapping treatments of the love commands contained in the book of Deuteronomy and in Matthew’s presentation of Jesus’s Sermon on the Mount, with selective references to related materials in other biblical texts.

  Abstract: In recent years, Christian ethics has begun to recover an appreciation for the moral and religious significance of friendship. While much of Christian ethics in the twentieth century tended to regard friendship with a somewhat skeptical eye, important insights in the last twenty years or so have helped us come to a greater appreciation for its positive contribution to the moral life. The recovery of friendship has taken place primarily within Aristotelian and Thomistic circles but also within feminism, Augustinian ethics, Lutheran ethics, narrative theology, phenomenological and personalist ethics, and elsewhere.¹<br>

  Abstract: Global health care is a subset of the problems of global justice and global poverty as well as of gender justice worldwide. Problems of global justice, including health-care access, demand a practical and political response from all Christians. This requires that Christians develop the significance of Christian love beyond personal virtue and beneficence and beyond the cultivation of a distinctive communal way of life. These meanings of love are biblically attested, have been central in Christian tradition, and remain vital to Christian ethics today. Yet Christian social ethics for a global era must also show why a personal and ecclesial<br>

Loves may be self-regarding, mate- and kin-regarding, other-regarding, genetically based, instinctive or acquired during a lifetime, conscious or subconscious, deliberated or spontaneous, proximate or ultimate, intrinsic or instrumental.

  Author(s) WERPEHOWSKI WILLIAM<br>
  Abstract: Love and Christian Ethicsaddresses significant authors, texts, and topics dealing with the interlaced meanings of divine love, love for God, neighbor love, and love for oneself. A recurring question is whether and how the Christian moral life amounts to a kind of eudaimonism. The book also offers insights and arguments that develop alternative accounts of the normative content of the command to love the neighbor as oneself. Beyond these concerns, the collection practically reframes an ethic of agape regarding (and this is a partial list) love’s motivational effectiveness, sexual life, the moral repair of communities, and interreligious exchange.<br>

  Book Title: The Intimate. Polity and the Catholic Church-Laws about Life, Death and the Family in So-called Catholic Countries<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): PÉREZ-AGOTE ALFONSO<br>
  Abstract: The waning influence of the Catholic church in the ethical and political debate. For centuries the Catholic Church was able to impose her ethical rules in matters related to the intimate, that is, questions concerning life (from its beginning until its end) and the family, in the so-called Catholic countries in Western Europe. When the polity started to introduce legislation that was in opposition to the Catholic ethic, the ecclesiastical authorities and part of the population reacted. The media reported massive manifestations in France against same-sex marriages and in Spain against the de-penalization of abortion. In Italy the Episcopal conference entered the political field in opposition to the relaxation of several restrictive legal rules concerning medically assisted procreation and exhorted the voters to abstain from voting so that the referendum did not obtain the necessary quorum. In Portugal, to the contrary, the Church made a “pact" with the prime minister so that the law on same-sex marriages did not include the possibility of adoption. And in Belgium the Episcopal conference limited its actions to clearly expressing with religious, legal, and anthropological arguments its opposition to such laws, which all other Episcopal conferences did also. In this book, the authors analyse the full spectrum of the issue, including the emergence of such laws; the political discussions; the standpoints defended in the media by professionals, ethicists, and politicians; the votes in the parliaments; the political interventions of the Episcopal conferences; and the attitude of professionals. As a result the reader understands what was at stake and the differences in actions of the various Episcopal conferences. The authors also analyse the pro and con evaluations among the civil population of such actions by the Church. Finally, in a comparative synthesis, they discuss the public positions taken by Pope Francis to evaluate if a change in Church policy might be possible in the near future.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1jkts6b">The Intimate. Polity and the Catholic Church</a><br>
  Author(s) BÉRAUD CÉLINE<br>
  Abstract: The management of death, the regulation of pregnancy termination and medically assisted procreation and the institutionalization of same-sex couples and same-sex parenting: in the different European countries that we have studied, the public authorities are preoccupied by such issues which relate to questions concerning life (from its beginning until its end), sexuality and gender. As per Michel Foucault¹, new bio politics are being developed, a new “government of bodies” (according to Didier Fassin and Dominique Memmi²). This usually concerns women’s bodies, regardless whether it is abortion, medically assisted reproduction – as Frisina writes in the chapter on Italy – or same-sex marriage.³<br>

  Author(s): ATIENZA CRISTINA MONEREO<br>
  Abstract: De manera bastante reciente los textos político-jurídicos sobre orientación sexual e identidad de género han empezado a proliferar significativamente. Las reivindicaciones del colectivo de lesbianas, gays, bisexuales y transexuales (a partir de ahora LGBT) se atendieron de forma más o menos anecdótica en sus inicios, pero actualmente este grupo se está considerando con más atención. Además, el oportuno interés por la igualdad y los derechos del colectivo de LGBT ha trasladado a la esfera de la Política y el Derecho un intenso debate filosófico sobre la condición individual y social de las personas integrantes de este grupo, que a su vez ha retomado conceptos complejos también analizados y discutidos en otros colectivos como el feminista. Como sucede en el caso del feminismo, la tarea de delimitar las nociones implicadas es espinosa por la heterogeneidad existente entre sus miembros y por la propia organización social del sistema social. Sin embargo, es una labor primordial para entender y atender a sus proposiciones. Esta investigación va dirigida a aclarar este mapa conceptual complejo con el fin de promover la igualdad real y la eficacia de los derechos, no tan nuevos ni emergentes, del colectivo de LGBT.<br>

  Abstract: In the early 1890s a stark vision of life in the East End emerges from the pens of two writers with a close acquaintance with life there: Arthur Morrison and George Gissing. Morrison was born in Poplar in 1863, the son of an engine fitter who worked on the docks. His father died of consumption when Arthur was a boy, and his mother raised the three children by running a haberdasher’s shop in Grundy Street.

  Abstract: Gissing’s response to East End poverty was, like Hardy’s to rural poverty, to associate energy with antisocial behavior and enervation with the requirements of goodness. There was a type of active energy that writers could deploy, however: the energy required by social investigation and reporting.

  Abstract: The archetypalist position is a very familiar one in literary studies, where it has sanctioned a long history of interpretation as the art of translating symbols into universal archetypes. From this we learn, according to Jung, that the creative process “consists in the unconscious activation of an archetypal image, and in elaborating and shaping this image into the finished work. By giving it shape, the artist translates it into the language of the present, and so makes it possible for us to find our way back to the deepest springs of life.”³ Jung is clearly the most influential figure in<br>

She wrote of herself: “I am a Catholic peculiarly possessed of the modern consciousness, that Jung describes as unhistorical, solitary, and guilty.” Likewise her characters comprise a gallery of misfits isolated in a present and sentenced to a lifetime of exile from the human community.

  ONE  Language and the Unconscious: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1m3nxp7">Language and Desire in Seneca's "Phaedra"</a><br>
  Abstract: Consciousness does not cover the entire field of our mental life. There is another area of mental activity that we glimpse in what we recall of dreams, in slips of the tongue, and more dramatically in behavior under hypnosis. This area, the unconscious, resists being known or spoken; and to bring it to consciousness we encounter resistance or repugnance and feel a sense of exertion.¹ Because of its resistance to becoming conscious knowledge, the unconscious has a paradoxical nature. It is both there and not there, both known and not known. “The unconscious, Lacan says, is knowledge; but it is<br>

  Abstract: Following Freud, Lacan questions the Cartesian identification of our conscious mental processes with our identity as a “self” (
                  cogito ergo sum). Going somewhat beyond Freud, he suggests too that the language in which we can express the existence of self is also the condition of our alienation from self. The processes of substitution implied in language make civilized life possible, but at the cost of our alienation from the primary “knowledge” of ourselves hidden in the unconscious.¹ Language is itself part of a series of absences through which the unconscious leaves its mark.

  Abstract: There has been much talk in recent years of the worlding of Irish writing, in line with the proclamation of Ireland’s as one of the most globalised economies in Europe. But it’s not at all clear just how worlded Irish writing now is. Certainly, more writers are living abroad and writing about overseas life than were doing so in, say, 1990. The decade which followed that year was one in which Irishness became sexy, as people used Celtic pubs, the memoirs of Frank McCourt or the spectacle of Riverdance to connect with their inner Paddy.<br>

  Abstract: When Ireland became part of the European Union in 1973, the country entered a new phase of rapid social, political, and economic transformation. This radical change was perceived at all levels of Irish life. Ireland’s gradual transformation from a predominantly agricultural economy to a hi-tech multinational one was simultaneously accompanied by other influential events such as the rise and success of the women’s movement, the shrinking influence of the Catholic Church, and noteworthy political achievements in the North such as the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. New descriptions were needed for identifying this fresh and almost unrecognisable Ireland which was emerging.<br>

                  Dublinersto plays by Seán O’Casey, Brendan Behan, Hugh Leonard, Bernard Farrell, and, more recently, Conor McPherson and Mark O’Rowe, Dublin and its people have definitely been the protagonists of many a story. In the 1990s, Ireland’s capital city became the epicentre of a large-scale transformation, which affected both its geographical and cultural landscapes, and which was inevitably reflected in theatre productions. ‘Dublin itself ’ – as Keating put it in theIrish Times– ‘became a stage again’ (2010: 5).

  Author(s) Ash Kate<br>
  Abstract: Canonised in 1250, Queen Margaret of Scotland is perhaps one of the most familiar Scottish saints to modern readers, yet surprisingly little material relating to her life (beyond brief mentions in chronicles) survives from the Middle Ages. Furthermore, there has been little scholarly consideration of the literariness of representations of Margaret. What work has been done focuses on Margaret as a historical figure, or uses material relating to her sanctity as evidence for the existence of particular sites of veneration within Scotland. These studies are useful for understanding Margaret’s role in Scotland in historical and religious terms, and suggest avenues<br>

  Abstract: In the fifteenth century, it has been argued, hagiography underwent a ‘turn to more “literary” saints’ lives’.¹ This turn, which is characterised by a new depiction of saintly exemplarity and a new self-understanding among the authors of hagiographic writings, is said to have inaugurated the saint’s life as a literary genre.² Chaucer’s

  Abstract: Sanctity, the quality of being holy, is by definition an inviolable state.¹ This chapter takes as its subject two plays that give dramatic shape to the life of Mary Magdalene, the sinner turned saint whose conversion might best be read as a crash course in becoming holy. They are: the Digby

  Book Title: Sodomscapes-Hospitality in the Flesh<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Gallagher Lowell<br>
  Abstract: Sodomscapes presents a fresh approach to the story of Lot’s wife, as it’s been read across cultures and generations. In the process, it reinterprets foundational concepts of ethics, representation, and the body. While the sudden mutation of Lot’s wife in the flight from Sodom is often read to confirm our antiscopic bias, a rival tradition emphasizes the counterintuitive optics required to nurture sustainable habitations for life in view of its unforeseeable contingency. Whether in medieval exegesis, Russian avant-garde art, Renaissance painting, or today’s Dead Sea health care tourism industry, the repeated desire to reclaim Lot’s wife turns the cautionary emblem of the mutating woman into a figural laboratory for testing the ethical bounds of hospitality. Sodomscape—the book’s name for this gesture—revisits touchstone moments in the history of figural thinking and places them in conversation with key thinkers of hospitality. The book’s cumulative perspective identifies Lot’s wife as the resilient figure of vigilant dwelling, whose in-betweenness discloses counterintuitive ways of understanding what counts as a life amid divergent claims of being-with and being-for.<br>

  Book Title: Who Was Jacques Derrida?-An Intellectual Biography<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): MIKICS DAVID<br>
  Abstract: Who Was Jacques Derrida?is the first intellectual biography of Derrida, the first full-scale appraisal of his career, his influence, and his philosophical roots. It is also the first attempt to define his crucial importance as the ambassador of "theory," the phenomenon that has had a profound influence on academic life in the humanities. Mikics lucidly and sensitively describes for the general reader Derrida's deep connection to his Jewish roots. He succinctly defines his vision of philosophy as a discipline that resists psychology. While pointing out the flaws of that vision and Derrida's betrayal of his most adamantly expounded beliefs, Mikics ultimately concludes that "Derrida was neither so brilliantly right nor so badly wrong as his enthusiasts and critics, respectively, claimed."<br>

  Abstract: During his lifetime, Derrida elicited both intense celebration and intense scorn. Rather than judging him in the manner of his disapproving critics, or celebrating him like his followers, I aim to explain his career. Now that Derrida is gone, it is time for a more measured assessment of his worth. His thought was neither as world changing as his disciples claimed nor as dangerous (or absurd) as his critics suspected. It does, however, offer us a necessary lesson concerning the self-imposed limits of philosophy: the way that it tries to purify itself, and the hazards of such purity. Derrida’s work,<br>

  Abstract: Derrida’s thought cannot be understood apart from his life. From the beginning, he was an intellectual outsider, a rebel. His efforts to redefine the discipline of philosophy took place against the rigid institutional system of the École Normale Supérieure. The young man from Algeria, a colonial backwater, confronted the powers that be in Paris, the vibrant center of advanced thought. Throughout his life, Derrida retained his early sense of being excluded from the sophisticated hierarchy that told students what and how to think. Even when deconstruction became a dominant institutional force in America, Derrida still felt that he was a<br>

  Abstract: In the 1990s, as he neared the close of his life and his academic career, Derrida again sought an arena outside philosophy: a wider and more consequential place than arguments about the coherence of metaphysical texts could provide. His chosen term, increasingly, was politics. And the accent of Derrida’s political writings was a prophetic one, full of commanding ethical import. He relied more than before on a Lévinasian view of our responsibility toward others. Derrida was no doubt reacting to his own role in the de Man and Heidegger scandals, when he failed to confront the political commitments of these<br>

  Abstract: Gerald Graff argues that our schools and colleges make the intellectual life seem more opaque, narrowly specialized, and beyond normal learning capacities than it is or needs to be. Left clueless in the academic world, many students view the life of the mind as a secret society for which only an elite few qualify.In a refreshing departure from standard diatribes against academia, Graff shows how academic unintelligibility is unwittingly reinforced not only by academic jargon and obscure writing, but by the disconnection of the curriculum and the failure to exploit the many connections between academia and popular culture. Finally, Graff offers a wealth of practical suggestions for making the culture of ideas and arguments more accessible to students, showing how students can enter the public debates that permeate their lives.<br>

  Abstract: THIS BOOK IS AN ATTEMPT by an academic to look at academia from the perspective of those who don’t get it. Its subject is cluelessness, the bafflement, usually accompanied by shame and resentment, felt by students, the general public, and even many academics in the face of the impenetrability of the academic world. It examines some overlooked ways in which schools and colleges themselves reinforce cluelessness and thus perpetuate the misconception that the life of the mind is a secret society for which only an elite few qualify.<br>

For others in our culture, however, the trouble with contemporary intellectual life is that it is intellectual. Contemporary culture, it is said, has become so cerebral and analytic that it alienates us from our bodies, our pleasures, and our true selves.

  Abstract: John 5:18 says that the plot to have Jesus killed began because Jesus was “making himself equal to God.” This assertion can hardly be historical, so we must seek an explanation for it in the history of the Johannine circle. It was not only the Johannine Christians who made such connections, of course. Already in Mark hostility against Jesus is first aroused by his claim to exercise a prerogative—to forgive sins—that is God’s alone (Mark 2:7), and the actual plot against his life springs, as in John, from a Sabbath healing (3:6). Christians prior to John had appropriated<br>

What is required for a robust ethical life, writes Williams, is “moral confidence,” and moral confidence “is basically a social phenomenon.”¹ The study of the work of Paul acquires a new accent if we consider his letters in light of the question suggested by Williams’s argument: What is the social process by which a religious movement like that of the early Christians undertakes to instill moral confidence in its<br>

  ON TRUSTING AN UNPREDICTABLE GOD: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1npn08">In Search of the Early Christians</a><br>
  Abstract: One of Paul Meyer’s colleagues has shown us how important is the issue of finding a “coherent” Paul among the Apostle’s varied responses to the “contingencies” of his situation.² Yet, for anyone who still hopes to find some guidance from the Bible in trying to form a Christian life today, there is a more urgent question: not whether Paul is consistent, but whether God is. This question is at the center of Romans 9–11, and Paul Meyer has clearly articulated it: If God’s action in Christ was as radical as Paul (and subsequent Christian faith) claims, “what then becomes<br>

  Abstract: Before science developed, humans elaborated mythical reflections to give some meaning to events and experiences they encountered and to establish classifications that were “superior to chaos,” as Claude Lévi-Strauss said. Theories included creation by gods and spontaneous generation. Common concepts included great floods to punish sins and re-create the world, and creation of life in a primeval ocean by successive steps. In the West the myth of dualism of body and soul emerged. The dualist, creationist view was opposed from ancient Greece onward by more materialist concepts, some of which emphasized that diverse elements could be combined randomly to form<br>

  Abstract: Recent progress in neuroscience and its integration in dynamic evolutionary processes, which include culture and its history, prompt us to rethink certain central philosophical questions, such as the significance of death. Death is an essential biological phenomenon directly related to the evolution of species. It has taken on a special dimension in the history of humanity. Buff on rightly said that “death is as natural as life.” Many philosophical and religious fundamentals, which emphasize the sacred character of life, maintain the balance by doing the same for its interruption by death. I feel it is opportune today more than ever<br>

  Book Title: The Spirit of Early Christian Thought-Seeking the Face of God<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wilken Robert Louis<br>
  Abstract: In chapters on topics including early Christian worship, Christian poetry and the spiritual life, the Trinity, Christ, the Bible, and icons, Wilken shows that the energy and vitality of early Christianity arose from within the life of the Church. While early Christian thinkers drew on the philosophical and rhetorical traditions of the ancient world, it was the versatile vocabulary of the Bible that loosened their tongues and minds and allowed them to construct the world anew, intellectually and spiritually. These thinkers were not seeking to invent a world of ideas, Wilken shows, but rather to win the hearts of men and women and to change their lives.Early Christian thinkers set in place a foundation that has endured. Their writings are an irreplaceable inheritance, and Wilken shows that they can still be heard as living voices within contemporary culture.<br>

  Abstract: READING THE SCRIPTURES as an old man Saint Augustine was drawn to the historical books of the Bible. As a young priest he had studied the epistles of Saint Paul, and as a bishop he preached a series of sermons on the Gospel of John, on the first epistle of John and on the Psalms. In the last years of his life, however, he found himself rereading the history of the kings of Israel recorded in the books of Samuel and Kings. What impressed him most in these books, Peter Brown observes in his biography of Augustine, “was the manner<br>

  Book Title: Edmund Husserl and Eugen Fink-Beginnings and Ends in Phenomenology, 1928–1938<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRUZINA RONALD<br>
  Abstract: Eugen Fink was Edmund Husserl's research assistant during the last decade of the renowned phenomenologist's life, a period in which Husserl's philosophical ideas were radically recast. In this landmark book, Ronald Bruzina shows that Fink was actually a collaborator with Husserl, contributing indispensable elements to their common enterprise.Drawing on hundreds of hitherto unknown notes and drafts by Fink, Bruzina highlights the scope and depth of his theories and critiques. He places these philosophical formulations in their historical setting, organizes them around such key themes as the world, time, life, and the concept and methodological place of the "meontic," and demonstrates that they were a pivotal impetus for the renewing of "regress to the origins" in transcendental-constitutive phenomenology.<br>

  Abstract: Husserl seizes the opportunity of his inauguration as professor to present his philosophy—transcendental phenomenology, its method and its field of research—to the audience, his colleagues in Freiburg, who are not familiar with his newly developed mode of thinking.¹ Beginning with a quick reference to the revolutionary changes that have been taking place in the spiritual life of humankind, the dissolution of norms that previously were regarded as unchangeable, Husserl brings them all under the concept of “dissatisfied reason” (“die unbefriedigte Vernunft”). Even philosophy exhibits such a change. The well-established styles of doing philosophy were in flux. It is<br>

Although this text represents our most ancient witness to his life and teaching, it is one step removed from the historical person. There can be no question that Jesus addressed his disciples and the larger circle of his fellow Jews in their own tongue, either Hebrew or Aramaic (or most likely, some combination of the two). Evidence of the underlying Semitic flavor of Jesus’s teaching comes through from time to time in the form of the Greek we presently possess. As I<br>

  Abstract: For more than three hundred years Richard Norwood (1590–1670) was known to historians primarily through his public roles as navigator, inventor of the diving bell, and surveyor of Bermuda. The publication of his journal in 1945, however, promised scholars a rare opportunity for learning about the relation between public roles and private life in the seventeenth century. The trouble is that Norwood’s journal is different from the confessional memoirs familiar from today’s bestseller lists. It concerns itself primarily with external events and spiritual development, and like other early autobiographical texts, it remains stubbornly reticent about feelings and fantasies—so<br>

  Book Title: Agitations-Essays on Life and Literature<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Krystal Arthur<br>
  Abstract: We disagree. From small questions of taste to large questions concerning the nature of existence, intellectual debate takes up much of our time. In this book the respected literary critic Arthur Krystal examines what most commentators ignore: the role of temperament and taste in the forming of aesthetic and ideological opinions. In provocative essays about reading and writing, about the relation between life and literature, about knowledge and certainty, about God and death, and about his own gradual disaffection with the literary scene, Krystal demonstrates that opposing points of view are based more on innate predilections than on disinterested thought or analysis.Not beholden to any fashionable theory or political agenda, Krystal interrogates the usual suspects in the cultural wars from an independent, though not impartial, vantage point. Clearly personal and unabashedly belletrist, his essays ask important questions. What makes culture one thing and not another? What inspires aesthetic values? What drives us to make comparisons? And how does a bias for one kind of evidence as opposed to another contribute to the form and content of intellectual argument?<br>

  Abstract: Several years ago, a man I knew, an assistant professor of English at an Ivy League university, decided to scrap his library—a gesture that at the time did not properly impress me. What interested me were the books themselves, as I was one of those invited to plunder the novels, biographies, anthologies of plays and poetry, works of criticism, short-story collections, a sampling of history and philosophy—exactly what you’d expect from a lifetime of liberal-arts collecting. The reason he gave them away, and the reason I didn’t catch on to what was really happening, is that he had<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1nq906">Agitations</a><br>
  Abstract: Not so long ago, though it may seem that way, literary criticism was practiced by people for whom literature was essential to thinking about life. Such people wrote about books in order to write about art, politics, religion, and the interaction of society and culture—in short, what men and women of letters have always brought to the table. Although the same can be said of current literary practitioners, something else can be said as well: Unlike those who interpret books today, earlier critics possessed an implicit belief in literature’s significance, not simply because literature espoused a point of view,<br>

  Book Title: The God of All Flesh-and Other Essays<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Hanson K.C.<br>
  Abstract: Biblical faith is passionately and relentlessly material in its emphasis. This claim is rooted in the conviction that the creator God loves the creation and summons creation to be in sync with the will of the creator God. This collection of essays is focussed on the bodily life of the world as it ordered in all of its problematic political and economic forms. The phrase of the title “all flesh" in the flood narrative of Genesis 9 refers to all living creatures who are in covenant with God – human beings, animals, birds, and fish – as recipients of God’s grace, as dependent upon God’s generosity, and as destined for praise and obedience to God. The insistence on the materiality of life as the subject of the Bible means that the difficult issues of economics and the demanding questions of politics are front and centre in the text. So the Pentateuch pivots around the Exodus narrative and the emancipation from an unbearable context of abusive labour practices. In a similar manner, the prophets endlessly address such questions of social policy and the wisdom teachers reflect on how to manage the material things of life and social relationships for the well-being of the community. This emphasis, pervasive in these essays, is a powerful alternative and a strong resistance against all of the contemporary efforts to transcend (escape!) the material into some form of the “spiritual". All around us are efforts to find an easier, more harmonious faith. This may be evoked simply because of a desire to shield economic, political advantage from the inescapable critique of biblical faith. Such a temptation is a serious misreading of the Bible and a critical misjudgment about the nature of human existence. Thus the Bible addressed the most urgent issues of our day, and refuses the “religious temptation" that avoids lived reality where the power of God is a work.<br>

  Book Title: The Operation of Grace-Further Essays on Art, Faith, and Mystery<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Wolfe Gregory<br>
  Abstract: The Operation of Grace collects a decade’s worth of essays by Gregory Wolfe taken from the pages of Image, the literary journal he founded more than a quarter century ago. As he notes in the preface, his Image editorials, while they cover a wide range of topics, focus on the intersection of “art, faith, and mystery". Wolfe believes that art and religion, while hardly identical, offer illuminating analogies to one another—art deepening faith through the empathetic reach of the imagination and faith anchoring art in a vision beyond the artist’s ego. Several essays dwell on how aesthetic values like ambiguity, tragedy, and beauty enlarge our understanding of the spiritual life. There are also a series of reflections that extend Wolfe’s campaign to renew the neglected and often misunderstood tradition of Christian humanism. Finally, there are sections that contain more personal meditations arising from Wolfe’s involvement in nurturing and promoting the work of emerging writers and artists. The Operation of Grace demonstrates once again why novelist Ron Hansen has spoken of Wolfe as “one of the most incisive and persuasive voices of our generation".<br>

  Abstract: For a number of years I’ve been saving up the fiction of Anthony Trollope as a sort of mid-life treat. At least I hoped it would be a treat.

One commentator singled out Gustave Flaubert from my list and responded with a skeptical “Hmm.” I understood the reaction: after all, Flaubert was known as a writer who cared more for style than social justice (“One never tires of what is well-written, style is life!”).

Sometimes these passions are matters of aesthetic or intellectual taste, but often they bear a relationship to the individual’s ideas about what constitutes the good life and how the ideals of a past culture might nurture and strengthen one’s own. Of course, the prevailing world view of a given time period may play a role in guiding what the majority find engaging. After several centuries of<br>

                     Four Quartets. For many readers,Four Quartetsis the most powerful and resonant exploration of Christian faith in the annals of twentieth-century poetry. It is also the kind of poem that, once you fully absorb it, tends to follow you around everywhere, interpreting your life—it possesses that sort of metaphysical urgency.<br>

  The Four Cultures from:

  Abstract: An old Albert Brooks film has been rattling around in my head of late:
                     Defending Your Life. Divorced advertising exec fiddles with the CD player in his brand new BMW and plows into a city bus, only to find himself in Judgment City, where he has to account for himself in a jury trial where the evidence consists of episodes from his life. The worst possible result isn’t exactly hell; it’s being sent back to earth for another attempt, rather than moving forward, to a better planet and a better life.<br>

  Mugg, Hitch, and Me from:

  Abstract: When I was growing up, I wanted to be Christopher Hitchens. In a manner of speaking. I didn’t, in fact, learn who he was until I was in my thirties, but I can see in retrospect that Hitchens was the epitome of everything I hoped to be as a writer. My passions were political, philosophical, and literary, and it seemed to me that there could be no better life than as a prolific cultural critic who wrote bluntly and even prophetically about the follies of the age. I imagined writing long review essays of contemporary novels and biographies, laced with<br>

  Abstract: For the small child everything is of interest and natural. He or she enters into the world that surrounds them with great energy. In one sense there are few boundaries and so the child imbues everything with equal interest. “He enters into the world of things with all his senses . . . everything is alive, full of eyes and ears . . . the child is initiated into the secret life of ordinary objects, often the most miniscule.”¹ The tiny details matter and there can be either a pleasurable rapturous immersion or the opposite—great desolation.<br>

  Abstract: From both the Western and Eastern traditions it is acknowledged that characteristics of childhood are seen as essential for the spiritual life. So what goes wrong as we get older and why is it so hard to hold on to the promise of childhood spirituality? One helpful way to begin to think about it is to understand that as we grow as children we become increasingly compliant and then turn away from the vivid feelings we knew as children. As we learn to fit in and pick and choose certain words and phrases to describe what is happening and what<br>

  Abstract: For all small children life is mysterious and mostly incomprehensible until the adults caring for them begin to help them form a pattern, a routine, and then a sense of coherent order, and, so, purpose gradually emerges. The small baby is subject to strong and sometimes overwhelming feelings, both good and bad, and hopefully is helped to manage this by the containing presence of a caring and loving adult. In the next chapter we will discuss what happens when this is not the case. As small children begin to play and if their imaginations and creativity are allowed to flourish,<br>

  Abstract: Present-moment awareness is about creating a gap in the constant busyness of the mind. This also means a break in the continuum between what is past and what lies ahead. It is through such a clear space that new and creative possibilities are born. The closing down of present-moment awareness in the small child happens as the weight of the adult life of care and rational thought gradually but relentlessly obscures the enchanted world. The possibility of re-enchantment and sometimes the invitation to move from the grown-up life of care can come from a child: from being in the presence<br>

  Abstract: It is generally recognized that Karl Jaspers was the first to define the three main criteria for a belief to be considered delusional: certainty, incorrigibility and impossibility of content. But the fundamental point for Jaspers is that we have to think of delusion not as an isolated phenomenon but as a modification of the way we live in the world, or – in Heideggerian words – of our being-in-the-world. Which kind of event could explain such a modification?

  Book Title: The Cruft of Fiction-Mega-Novels and the Science of Paying Attention<br>
  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): LETZLER DAVID<br>
  Abstract: While mega-novel text is often intricately meaningful or experimental, sometimes it is just excessive and pointless. On the other hand, mega-novels also contain text that, though appearing to be cruft, turns out to be quite important. Letzler posits that this cruft requires readers to develop a sophisticated method of attentional modulation, allowing one to subtly distinguish between text requiring focused attention and text that must be skimmed or even skipped to avoid processing failures.
      The Cruft of Fictionshows how the attentional maturation prompted by reading mega-novels can help manage the information overload that increasingly characterizes contemporary life.<br>

However, ever since Tristram Shandy set out to recount his life and opinions, only to find upon finishing the fourth volume that he was barely past his own birth and that “ things have crowded in so thick upon me, that I have not been able to get into that part of my work, towards which, I have all the way, looked forwards,” we have known that the details of a single life can sprawl out similarly.¹ While Tristram finds this situation stressful,<br>

  Abstract: Though the previous chapters have used mega-novels’ relationships to several nonfictional genres to examine how their detailed accumulation of the facts of real life can overload readers’ attention capacities and subsequently prompt them to modulate their methods of text processing, cruft is not limited to the small-scale cases of the incoherent word, the irrelevant datum, the passing moment of consciousness. The following three chapters will examine how mega-novels’ incorporation of elements from other literary genres produces more extensive but equally pointless cruft, inducing the same characteristic frustration and boredom to provoke a similar reorientation of attention.

After graduating from the gymnasium in 1899, he wandered through the country, a common practice of the revolutionary intelligentsia in the Russian Empire.

  Abstract: The practice of exile has its beginnings with the advent of settled and socially organized societies. The first known human experience of exile, the story of Sinuhe (documented on an Egyptian papyrus), dates back to 2000 BC (Tabori, 43). The limited social mobility, settled way of life, and minimal knowledge of the “other” in geographical and cultural terms in early societies meant that physical expulsion from the homeland was one of the most severe forms of punishment, almost equivalent to death.¹ Exile is connected to a range of other important signifiers: separation, loss, alienation, loneliness, and nostalgia.

Kathleen Woodward and Murray Schwartz argue that “aging anticipates loss,” which intensifies the work of memory and fantasy (3). Although it is generally understood that the elderly experience a waning in their ability to remember, the decline mainly affects the recall of new learning, while the capacity to vividly recall episodes from the past may be high and even stronger than that of young adults (Burke, 124–6).

  Author(s) IMBERT PATRICK<br>
  Abstract: The only undeniable information one can have access to is that they were living people, and now they are dead. Apart from this information, there is an accumulation of discursive constructions in which the deaths of people are used in media images and political discourses in order to endorse a given logic or strategy in the battle for recognition and power. However, the statement of passage from life to death is more than a referential base. It is a way of reinstating an ethic of recognizing the Other. It traces a path towards self-reflection that demands new and different solutions.<br>

  Book Title: The Vision of the Soul-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): Wilson James Matthew<br>
  Abstract: Ours is an age full of desires but impoverished in its understanding of where those desires lead-an age that claims mastery over the world but also claims to find the world as a whole absurd or unintelligible. In
      The Vision of the Soul, James Matthew Wilson seeks to conserve the great insights of the western tradition by giving us a new account of them responsive to modern discontents. The western- or Christian Platonist-tradition, he argues, tells us that man is an intellectual animal, born to pursue the good, to know the true, and to contemplate all things in beauty. Wilson begins by reconceiving the intellectual conservatism born of Edmund Burke's jeremiad against the French Revolution as an eff­ort to preserve the West's vision of man and the cosmos as ordered by and to beauty. After defining the achievement of that vision and its tradition, Wilson off­ers an extended study of the nature of beauty and the role of the fine arts in shaping a culture but above all in opening the human intellect to the perception of the form of reality. Through close studies of Theodor W. Adorno and Jacques Maritain, he recovers the classical vision of beauty as a revelation of truth and being. Finally, he revisits the ancient distinction between reason and story-telling, between mythos and logos, in order to rejoin the two.Story-telling is foundational to the forms of the fine arts, but it is no less foundational to human reason. Human life in turn constitutes a specific kind of form-a story form. The ancient conception of human life as a pilgrimage to beauty itself is one that we can fully embrace only if we see the essential correlation between reason and story and the essential convertibility of truth, goodness and beauty in beauty. By turns a study in fundamental ontology, aesthetics, and political philosophy, Wilson's book invites its readers to a renewal of the West's intellectual tradition.<br>

  Abstract: We saw in the Introduction that conservatism seeks to defend a particular vision of human life that George Santayana defined as Christian Platonic in nature. In chapter 1, I considered one aspect of that vision: how it envisions human happiness in comparison with typical modern accounts of it. It now seems appropriate to ask a more foundational question. If conservatism seeks to conserve the western tradition, then what are that tradition’s constitutive principles?<br>

                  Art and Scholasticism(1920) constitutes one of the French neo-Thomist philosopher’s briefest and most austere works; and yet, belying the more or less serviceable prose and apparent modesty of scope, it is a wide ranging series of interventions on nearly every significant philosophical question of Maritain’s—or any—day. In speaking of beauty, Maritain sought to guide the intellectual life of an entire age. This can make the short treatise and the essays and notes later appended to it difficult reading: one cannot fully appreciate the significance of Maritain’s claims if one does not also sense the positions<br>

As we have seen in discussing both Burke and Dante, venerable claims have been made in our tradition for the power of the poetic and literary imagination; but Burke’s counter-revolutionary importance should also remind us that many of those claims have been compensatory for losses experienced elsewhere.

  CHAPTER 4  The Scandal of Consent from:

  Abstract: The previous chapter raised the question of how the concept of the political should be interpreted in theories of democracy. One key difference of interpretation is captured in Hannah Pitkin’s distinction between the idealist and realist dimensions of political life and also in Oliver Marchart’s distinction between associative and dissociative concepts of the political. The distinction at stake is not simply one between more consensual or more agonistic perspectives. It is, rather, a distinction that turns on different ways of understanding the dynamics of conflict and discord. Understood in this way, the difference of interpretation is closely related to another<br>

These models underwrite laments about the postpolitical condition as well as excited declarations of the radical potential of dramatic protest events. From within this worldview, properly political events have no determinative content—they exceed given forms of expression and order. Political events occur when singularities that cannot be represented in current formations of political life make their presence felt.

  Abstract: David Williams shows that images associated with saints are not simply illustrations of written accounts, nor are the gestures, prayers, and liturgical practices of devotees of saints' cults simply derivative of them. Rather, images and enactments expand and complete the text, adding visual and dramatic dimensions. Williams demonstrates his ideas through discussion and case studies of three saints: the biblical figure of Saint Anne, mother of the Virgin; the medieval English martyr Saint Thomas Becket; and Saint Maximillian Mary Kolbe, who gave his life to save that of another in the Auschwitz concentration camp. A remarkable study of text, image, and enactment, Saints Alive presents a complete study of the depiction of saints that will change the way they are understood.<br>

  Abstract: For a figure with no historical basis, to whom there is no reference in scripture, whose very existence depends on logical deduction, Saint Anne has had a remarkable career. Although her life cannot be verified by any historical source, we are sure she existed, if only because Mary, the mother of Jesus, had to have had a mother herself. Her Hebrew name, Hannah, is probably derived from identification with the prophetess Hannah, and the foundation for the rest of her rich and complex history is found in the

  Chapter Three  SAINT THOMAS BECKET from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1q5zsz">Saints Alive</a><br>
  Abstract: Few Lives of mediaeval saints are more voluminously documented than that of the twelfth-century Archbishop of Canterbury, murdered in his cathedral by four knights acting on the wishes of King Henry II. The force of the historical in Thomas’s 
                  Vita is assured by the fact that the principal authors of his first biographies were men who knew him and were present at his martyrdom. There are many accounts of the murder as well as of other aspects of Thomas Becket’s life, most of which are available in James Craigie Robertson’s Materials for the History of Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury.<br>

  Chapter Four  SAINT MAXIMILIAN KOLBE from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1q5zsz">Saints Alive</a><br>
  Abstract: With the last saint to be discussed, we have a modern figure historicized according to modern standards. There is ample documentation concerning his parents, his childhood, his youth and mature years, and his death. There are many letters, articles, conferences, and other documents written by him and a host of eyewitnesses who knew him, some still living. His life is documented in a twentieth-century manner. In comparison to the saints we have discussed, however, our twentieth-century saint possesses a much smaller cult and what might be called an incipient iconography. Thus the historical dimension of the text that is Saint<br>

  The Meaning of Old Age: from:

  Author(s) Moody Harry R.<br>
  Abstract: Does old age have any meaning? Does the prolongation of life really amount to a benefit either for individuals or for society? Or on the contrary have recent gains in human life expectancy been instead a prolongation of decrepitude, frailty, and a meaningless existence? No topic seems less promising for productive public debate than a discussion about the “meaning of life.” Talk about “meaning” is notoriously difficult and divisive. Yet without confronting questions about the meaning of old age, we risk impoverishing public discussion of choices that we all must face.<br>

  Abstract: Aging poses a peculiar puzzle for medicine.¹ As a biological reality, aging is an inherent part of organic life, affecting humans no less than animals, plants, and microorganisms. It is in that sense beyond the realm of medicine, a permanent backdrop to all of life. But aging is also ordinarily accompanied by disease, bodily decline, and disability. It is thus well within the realm of medicine, whose historical mission has been the cure of disease and the relief of pain, each much desired by those who grow old.<br>

  Abstract: Increasing life expectancy and decreasing birthrates are responsible for a significant demographic change in the industrial nations. In Germany, the proportion of people who are sixty years and older is about 20 percent of the total population; this is similar to other Western nations. Demographic projections show that by the year 2025 about one-third of our population will be over sixty. Already by the year 2000, Germany will have the highest rate of people over sixty compared with the other European countries, the United States, Canada, and Japan.¹<br>

  Abstract: 1.
                     The highest future goal of medicine for the elderly should be a reduction in morbidity and disability and not an explicit effort to reduce mortality or increase average life expectancy. Old age is an inevitable human condition, one that should not be defined as a medical problem to be conquered or as a set of problems wholly amenable to medical or scientific solutions. Human beings will continue to age, to get sick, and to die.<br>

The Professor asserts that art and religion are compatible, that they are—or at least have the potential to be—equal and complementary forces for finding meaning in life.

  Book Title: Identity and Control-How Social Formations Emerge (Second Edition)<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): White Harrison C.<br>
  Abstract: In this completely revised edition of one of the foundational texts of network sociology, Harrison White refines and enlarges his groundbreaking theory of how social structure and culture emerge from the chaos and uncertainty of social life. Incorporating new contributions from a group of young sociologists and many fascinating and novel case studies, Identity and Control is the only major book of social theory that links social structure with the lived experience of individuals, providing a rich perspective on the kinds of social formations that develop in the process. Going beyond traditional sociological dichotomies such as agency/structure, individual/society, or micro/macro,
      Identity and Controlpresents a toolbox of concepts that will be useful to a wide range of social scientists, as well as those working in public policy, management, or associational life and, beyond, to any reader who is interested in understanding the dynamics of social life.<br>

  Abstract: Motherhood is an identity common to women in all societies, but the expression of it varies greatly both within and across social groups. Mothering emerges from the intersection of a woman’s personality, her life experiences, and choices available to her, and is embedded in gender role expectations shaped by religion, culture, and historical context. Every woman constructs her own expression of motherhood through a process of accepting and resisting role expectations. The process of establishing individual motherhood priorities may be covert or overt—likely influenced by the consequences of the choices. Thus the social construction of motherhood is dynamic and<br>

Yet, Beachy Amish-Mennonites have sought to retain Amish characteristics, including an emphasis on lifelong redemption through separatist community life, defined gender roles, and distinct practices. This hybridization of evangelical and Old Order reorganized their society in nuanced ways, including how women contributed to community and family formation.

  Abstract: A common assumption concerning childhood play in societies with well-entrenched gender roles and conservative religious values is that imaginative play is discouraged and that play simply replicates anticipated “real-life roles” (Carlson, Taylor, and Levin 538; Taylor and Carlson 257). However, scholars of cross-cultural research on childhood, and particularly on childhood play, argue that children’s play is more independent of pragmatic expectations and adult supervision than often assumed (Aguilar 29-30, 37; Edwards 335-7; Rabain-Jamin, Maynard, and Greenfield 204-5; Watson-Gegeo 148; McMahon and Sutton-Smith 297-8), since children’s symbolic behaviour is not necessarily compliant, but at times even subversive, defying cultural expectations (Ackerley<br>

  Author(s): BURTON NADYA<br>
  Abstract: Natal Signs: Cultural Representations of Pregnancy, Birth and Parenting explores some of the ways in which reproductive experiences are taken up in the rich arena of cultural production. The chapters in this collection pose questions, unsettle assumptions, and generate broad imaginative spaces for thinking about representation of pregnancy, birth, and parenting. They demonstrate the ways in which practices of consuming and using representations carry within them the productive forces of creation. Bringing together an eclectic and vibrant range of perspectives, this collection offers readers the possibility to rethink and reimagine the diverse meanings and practices of representations of these significant life events. Engaging theoretical reflection and creative image making, the contributors explore a broad range of cultural signs with a focus on challenging authoritative representations in a manner that seeks to reveal rather than conceal the insistently problematic and contestable nature of image culture. Natal Signs gathers an exciting set of critically engaged voices to reflect on some of life’s most meaningful moments in ways that affirm natality as the renewed promise of possibility.Natal Signs: Cultural Representations of Pregnancy, Birth and Parenting explores some of the ways in which reproductive experiences are taken up in the rich arena of cultural production.

  Abstract: Thinking about representations of pregnancy, childbirth, and parenting is an exciting project in the contemporary context. Positioned in an era when traditional and historical constraints on representations of these life events have been unsettled, we find ourselves facing a shifting landscape. We are, furthermore, also confronted by evolving economies of cultural production and consumption; not only are we encountering new images, but we are continuing to witness changes in the systems of generation and circulation by which they are produced and consumed.<br>

  Abstract: When it comes to video games, much attention is paid to representations of death. Game developers spill considerable digital blood crafting elaborate spectacles of violent demise in death-oriented games, while academics and the popular media spill equally as much ink debating the implications of those virtual fatalities. Avatars, visual representations of human players in these digital spaces, die repeatedly in games, such that experiences of dying become “part of the everyday life in the world” (Klastrup 144). However, in the context of this discussion and a medium in which death has so often been the focus, what about birth?<br>

This work imagines a family line, with umbilical cords still attached, a snapshot of multiple generations seen at once, in non-linear time. Centering a representation of queer birthers, including trans folks and LGBT-TIQ2S people, is integral to this web of generations. Homage is paid to the curious reality of human reproductive physiology—a fetus with ovaries is born containing their entire life’s supply of “eggs” (Moore, Persaud, and Torchia 269).

  Abstract: The prevalence of imagery and metaphor related to pregnancy, birth, and mothering in Indigenous cultures of Turtle Island reveal the significance of these life events within these communities. While negative representations of Indigenous women are used by colonizing forces to legitimize extermination and assimilation projects, Indigenous artistic representations of pregnancy, birth, and mothering continue to be a powerful tool to push back against these efforts. Artwork by contemporary Indigenous artists depicting pregnancy, birth, and mothering present a positive image of contemporary cultures, recognizing the ceremonial value of these experiences and creating powerful narratives of Indigenous women and communities.<br>

  Author(s) EINION ALYS<br>
  Abstract: This paper emerged from my work for a Ph.D. in Creative Writing. Motivated by a desire to analyse women’s life stories, and informed by many years as a midwife, I took on the task of retelling a life story revolving around the centrality of the character’s bodily experience of womanhood, manifested through her experiences of rape, intimate violence, birth, and mothering. This enterprise opened the door to a critical understanding of the nature of subjectivity as represented and re-presented in fiction and non-fiction in the form of birth narratives. As a midwife and a feminist, I had long been aware<br>

  Birth is a Labour of Art from:

  Author(s) KOTAK MARNI<br>
  Abstract: For me, my existence as an artist and a mother are deeply intertwined and reflect my belief that human life is the most profound work of art. Being a mother as an artist has the potential to unlock cultural institutions that have traditionally codified the maternal body as irrational, weak, and economically ineffectual (Liss 2). Giving birth and raising my child as a work of art challenges our capitalist society that glorifies products over people and the spectacle over authentic human experience.<br>

  Author(s) WILSON SHEENA<br>
  Abstract: Mothers and the experience of motherhood have been historically overwritten by patriarchal practices that accord some lives and certain life stories greater value. Fiction and non-fiction stories by and about mothers—particularly the stories of poor women, working women, and women of colour—have gone largely unrecorded. What remains are patriarchal daughter-centred stories of young women who move from one male protector to another: father to husband to son. As a response to this history of literary and cultural production, the telling of mother-stories can be reclaimed as an act of resistance, whether mothers are telling their own stories, or<br>

  Abstract: Instead of feeling excitement or joy upon hearing she is pregnant, Jenna Hunterson, the protagonist of Adrienne Shelly’s 2007 independent film,
                  Waitress, resents her unborn child. In the above internal narration, Jenna expresses anger towards her child after her abusive husband finds the pile of cash that she had hoped to use to run away and start a new life; he uses it to purchase a crib. Jenna’s character inWaitressstands in stark contrast to the prevailing cultural ideal of “the good mother” stereotype because she is unapologetically anti-motherhood. Similarly, Ray, the leading figure in Courtney Hunt’s 2008 independent<br>

  Author(s) WANSINK SUSAN<br>
  Abstract: The berlin wall and life behind the iron curtain remain popular topics for German filmmakers. Communist East Germany actually only came into existence after the end of World War II, when Germany was divided into four separate zones, each occupied by Great Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union. In 1949, the Soviets declared the Soviet zone its own country, and the German Democratic Republic (GDR) was born, becoming a satellite country of the Soviet Union. The communist government was a dictatorship, in which the people were denied rights such as the freedom of speech, assembly, and press.<br>

  Author(s) BERNS FERNANDO GABRIEL PAGNONI<br>
  Abstract: Argentine classical films illustrate the reality of a nation built through the efforts of immigrants, who wanted for their children a better life in the young Argentina of the early nineteenth century. In these films, a mother’s role is clear and unambiguous: to sacrifice herself for the sake of her children—even giving her own life if necessary—so that they could be promoted in social, economic, and cultural ways. However, in the1980s, with the return of democracy in Argentina and Latin America, a break happened in the hegemonic discourse of the stereotypical ideal mother figure (as well as the<br>

  Abstract: Mapmaking can be a process by which individuals orient themselves and navigate from place to place. The process of mapmaking can also be used as a tool for understanding one’s sense of place. The mapmaking experience is rooted in what Sobel (1998, p 5) identifies as ‘our visual, kinesthetic, and emotional experiences’. As a visual method, mapmaking provides one example of how individuals engage with place. Individuals throughout the lifecourse – from young children to ageing adults – influence and are influenced by place. And in order to better understand individuals’ experience with place, research methodologies have increasingly turned to<br>

  Abstract: The study of spatial mobility in European social sciences suffers from institutional and thematic segmentation (daily mobility, tourism, residential mobility, migration). However, a growing number of studies have shown that a comprehensive, linked approach to mobility is an effective way of capturing hybrid practices that fall between residential and daily mobility (such as multiple residences and long-distance commuting: Dupont and Dureau, 1994; Lévy and Dureau, 2002; Kaufmann and Vincent-Geslin, 2012).

  Abstract: This book is a study of nostalgia, belonging and community which provides a new theoretical framework for understanding retirement migration. It is the first account of retirement migration that focuses on the voices of retired working-class British women, who are considering either return migration to the UK or permanent/temporary settlement in Spain. Through a narrative approach, we follow their journeys as they seek, recreate and construct community in a new context and their experiences of belonging and non-belonging are unravelled. The book offers a critical perspective, challenging positivistic, essentialist definitions of community.The book offers a critical perspective, challenging positivistic, essentialist definitions of lifestyle migration.

  Abstract: How do we sustain agency and identity amidst the frailty of advanced old age? What role does care play in this process? Pushing forward new sociological theory, this book explores the theoretical and practical issues raised by age and infirmity. It begins with a theoretical examination of the fourth age, interrogating notions of agency, identity and personhood, as well as the impact of frailty, abjection and ‘othering’. It then applies this analysis to issues of care. Exploring our collective hopes and fears concerning old age and the ends of people’s lives, this is essential reading on one of the biggest social issues of our time.Pushing forward new sociological theory, this book explores the theoretical and practical issues raised by ageing, and the associated problems of mental and physical frailty in later life.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1t89766">Personhood, identity and care in advanced old age</a><br>
  Abstract: In the previous chapter we outlined the various ways that terms like ‘agency’, ‘identity’ and ‘personhood’ have been understood within philosophy, and how such understandings have been applied particularly in response to the problems of mental infirmity in later life. We argued that the de-construction of the term ‘person’ into the separable issues of agency and identity may provide a more useful framework through which to interpret these problems than by approaches based on the more generic term ‘personhood’. Irrespective of their ‘powers’ to express agency and identity, the common humanity of people with infirmities can serve as the underlying<br>

  Abstract: The emergence of what has been called a ‘hyper-cognitive’ society (Post, 1995) and its structural individualisation (Beck and Beck-Gernsheim, 2002) has made the body a key site of identity and embodied difference. The ‘corporeal capital’ that could be said to be associated with owning a fit body has become a critical resource throughout life (Higgs, 2012). In later life, being fit and healthy enables effective participation in the cultures of the third age, and serves as a key point of reference for older people in judging how well they are doing and how effectively they are managing to age at<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapter we outlined the various ways that terms like ‘agency’, ‘identity’ and ‘personhood’ have been understood within philosophy, and how such understandings have been applied particularly in response to the problems of mental infirmity in later life. We argued that the de-construction of the term ‘person’ into the separable issues of agency and identity may provide a more useful framework through which to interpret these problems than by approaches based on the more generic term ‘personhood’. Irrespective of their ‘powers’ to express agency and identity, the common humanity of people with infirmities can serve as the underlying<br>

  FOUR  Frailty from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1t89766">Personhood, identity and care in advanced old age</a><br>
  Abstract: The emergence of what has been called a ‘hyper-cognitive’ society (Post, 1995) and its structural individualisation (Beck and Beck-Gernsheim, 2002) has made the body a key site of identity and embodied difference. The ‘corporeal capital’ that could be said to be associated with owning a fit body has become a critical resource throughout life (Higgs, 2012). In later life, being fit and healthy enables effective participation in the cultures of the third age, and serves as a key point of reference for older people in judging how well they are doing and how effectively they are managing to age at<br>

  Book Title: Biography and social exclusion in Europe-Experiences and life journeys<br>
  Publisher: Policy Press<br>
  Author(s): Torrabadella Laura<br>
  Abstract: Throughout Europe, standardised approaches to social policy and practice are being radically questioned and modified. Beginning from the narrative detail of individual lives, this book re-thinks welfare predicaments, emphasising gender, generation, ethnic and class implications of economic and social deregulation.Based on 250 life-story interviews in seven European Union countries, Biography and social exclusion in Europe: analyses personal struggles against social exclusion to illuminate local milieus and changing welfare regimes and contexts; points to challenging new agendas for European politics and welfare, beyond the rhetoric of communitarianism and the New Deal; vividly illustrates the lived experience and environmental complexity working for and against structural processes of social exclusion; refashions the interpretive tradition as a teaching and research tool linking macro and micro realities. · · Students, academic teachers and professional trainers, practitioners, politicians, policy makers and researchers in applied and comparative welfare fields will all benefit from reading this book.<br>

  Author(s) Chamberlayne Prue<br>
  Abstract: This book describes the life experiences of individuals in contemporary Europe whose lives have been marked by one or more forms of ‘social exclusion’, as this term has come to be used over the past decade or so (Askonas and Stewart, 2000; Levitas 1998). We try to make meaningful such experiences as being made redundant, being blocked in a career, leaving school without qualifications, finding a place as a migrant in a European country, or bringing up children as a ‘single parent’. These were among the life contingencies that had originally led to individuals being selected for our study sample<br>

  Author(s) Torrabadella Laura<br>
  Abstract: The research work carried out by Sostris was based on the shared assumption that our subjects were active and resourceful individuals dealing with all kinds of challenges. This chapter puts this basic assumption to the test. Nicolás from Catalonia and Heike from eastern Germany, two well-educated young adults who, geographically speaking, happen to live at opposite ends of the EU, have both come to a dead end in their life journeys – a ‘biographical blockage’. Although we found it demanding enough to try to understand the processes that brought these two young people to this point, we also wanted to<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1t8982m">Biography and social exclusion in Europe</a><br>
  Author(s) Rustin Michael<br>
  Abstract: The chapter demonstrates how the life experiences of a small number of individuals can illuminate an important dimension of British social structure. Its particular focus is an ever-present aspect of British society – class¹. The meaning and effects of class are seen through the prism of four people’s experience of enforced redundancy or early retirement during the early 1990s. Two of our subjects belonged to what would normally be described as industrial working-class occupations – both were coal miners. One had worked on the coalface, the other was a craftsman engineer, engaged in maintenance work underground. Their stories show that<br>

  Author(s) Murard Numa<br>
  Abstract: Readers of Robert Roberts’ famous book,
                  The classic slum, will remember a photograph showing men standing at the doorstep of a pub, with the legend: “The shortest way out of Manchester”. What these men wish to escape by drinking is not work in itself, the book relates, but the combination of low wages, exhaustion and awful working conditions, together with miseries in everyday life, such as terrible housing, shortage of food, illness, and all the outcomes of these at the levels of public and private life, privacy and intimacy. These men want to escape from their life as a whole,<br>

  Author(s) Ioannidi-Kapolou Elisabeth<br>
  Abstract: Current European debates concerning the decline of the nuclear family, the forms and implications of new family type structures, and the role of the welfare state in changes in family and gender relationships are hardly on the political agenda in Greece. There are clear indications that aspects of family life are altering. These include the later age of marriage¹, increasing rates of divorce², the increase in female participation in the paid labour force³, and the very slow increase in single parenthood⁴. Other new phenomena indirectly relating to family life, such as increased drug and alcohol use, and homelessness among young<br>

  Author(s) Breckner Roswitha<br>
  Abstract: More and more people share the experience of migration, in the sense of crossing nation-state borders to start a new life in a different society. Theories of globalisation and postmodernism present this experience as a typical occurrence, almost taken for granted, in the lives of growing numbers of people. Even though migration constitutes the ‘normality’ of many societies to a greater or lesser degree, the public and, not least, the sociopolitical discourses of migration, are still predominantly shaped by the view that the large-scale movement of people somehow constitutes a problem. In the first place, the ‘problem’ of migration within<br>

  Abstract: This piece of narrative may well evoke memories – and many questions – for you as a reader. What has been the impact on Djamillah’s life and identity of that ‘misrecognition’ of her brown skin as ‘dirty’? How did this event affect the children doing the excluding, and the teacher standing by? How widespread were such experiences in the 1970s, in Britain and in other countries, and for Black, Asian and Arab immigrants? How do schools tackle such incidents?

  Book Title: Biographical methods and professional practice-An international perspective<br>
  Publisher: Policy Press<br>
  Author(s): Apitzsch Ursula<br>
  Abstract: The turn to biographical methods in social science is invigorating the relationship between policy and practice. This book shows how biographical methods can improve theoretical understanding of professional practice, as well as enrich the development of professionals, and promote more meaningful practitioner - service user relationships.This book uses a range of interpretive approaches to reveal the dynamics of service users' and professionals' individual experiences and life-worlds. From their research the contributors show how biographical methods can improve theoretical understanding of professional practice, as well as enrich the learning and development of professionals, and promote more meaningful and creative practitioner - service user relationships. The book: · reviews applications of biographical methods in both policy and practice in a range of professional contexts, from health and social care to education and employment; · explores the impact of social change in three main arenas - transformation from Eastern to Western types of society in Europe, major shifts in social and welfare principles, experiences of immigration and of new cultural diversities - on professional practice; · critically evaluates subjective and reflexive processes in interactions between researchers, practitioners and users of services; · considers the institutional arrangements and cultural contexts which support effective and sensitive interventions; · draws on actual projects and tracks reflection, progress and outcomes. With contributions from leading international experts, it provides a valuable comparative perspective. Researchers, policy analysts and practitioners, postgraduate students, teachers and trainers will find this book a stimulating read.<br>

  FOUR  Considerations on the biographical embeddedness of ethnic entrepreneurship from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1t89d2j">Biographical methods and professional practice</a><br>
  Author(s) Kontos Maria<br>
  Abstract: Over recent decades in most European countries, the long-term decline in self-employment rates has significantly reversed (Apitzsch, 2000; Bögenhold, 2000). These ‘new self-employed’ differ from the classical type of self-employed in their motives for entrepreneurship. Whether it is the desire for self-realisation, to achieve an autonomous life plan (Hakim, 1999) or, in the case of collective entrepreneurship, a wish for solidarity in the workplace through self-employment (Vonderach, 1980; Heider, 1996), or the goal of gaining access to income (Bögenhold, 1987), the ‘new self-employment’ seems to have little to do with the classical entrepreneur. Self-employment seems to have become an individual<br>

  Abstract: The use of biography and autobiography today, compared with only 20 years ago in the UK, is now ubiquitous in work with vulnerable people in care settings. Biographical materials exist implicitly and explicitly in a variety of forms, from documents (such as case notes, patient histories, and care plans) to more journalistic public accounts in the media following instances of abuse or fatal accident, as well as in service users’ own accounts often presented in the form of life storybooks, or audiovisual recordings.

  Author(s) Mortlock Belinda<br>
  Abstract: This chapter engages with three categories of narrative: stories about teaching a social research course; students’ stories about their practice as researchers; and the stories of 42 women and men working for community organisations in a city in New Zealand. These stories emerge from a teaching programme in which final-year sociology students are involved in biographical research. Students write a life-story narrative drawn from multiple interviews with a single narrator, as well as a research journal, in which they offer an autobiographical account of their research process. They also submit an analytical essay; that is, a sociological commentary that locates<br>

  ONE  Modernity and the Rupture with the Past from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1tfj8w7">Zhou Zuoren and an Alternative Chinese Response to Modernity</a><br>
  Abstract: This is a study of the modern Chinese writer Zhou Zuoren (1885-1967) and of alternative responses to nationalism and modernity. Zhou was an important early contributor to the watershed May Fourth New Culture movement (1917-23), which set the direction for the subsequent development of modern Chinese literature.¹ Zhou represented the humanistic strand of thinking concerned with defining an ideal life. A founding member of the Literary Association of China (Wenxue yanjiu hui), set up in 1920, he initially advocated the creation of literature to foster humanitarian values? However, two years later he broke with the idea that literature had a<br>

They constitute the vast majority of minorities in every Chinese city, with the exception of cities in the border regions of Tibet, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia. The ethnic identity of these urban Hui and the expression of that identity, however, is different from the northwestern Hui Muslim communities and the dispersed southeastern Hui lineages in many aspects. The issues and concerns facing these Hui as they seek to continue to adapt to changing urban life are well illustrated by the following conversation with a Hui cook at a small

Combinding the history of exegesis with a theological exploration of the meaning of faith in the face of suffering, this book examines Luther‘s and Kierkegaard‘s lively--and very different--interpretations of Genesis 22 to demonstrate how the way we read the Bible is crucial to the life of faith.<br>

  Abstract: Since his death in 2010, there has been continuing and growing interest in the life, vision, and thought of the late Spanish-Indian mystical theologian Raimon Panikkar. As well as offering both a personal affirmation and critique of Panikkar‘s thought from a Catholic and Protestant perspective, the work compares and contrasts him with a range of Western and Indian theologians, both Catholic and Protestant, and outlines the possibilities of learning from Panikkar in an ecumenical context.<br>

During that span, he published over three hundred articles and sixty books on a wide range of scientific, philosophical, cultural, and theological topics as seismic shifts in global cultural life were occurring—a point of which he was keenly aware.

Preaching was not made to live. At most, preaching is a witness, a sign, a crimson X marking a demolition site.

  Abstract: Faced with situations of injustice and human suffering, people with genuine faith cannot remain indifferent. They must take a stand and engage in movements or struggles for justice and for overcoming oppressive situations and suffering. Such engagement breaks away from the divide established by the modern world between public and private spheres, the latter being the one where religion should play its role. That is why Christian groups engaging in those struggles feel the need for theologies that are not restrained by the modern relegation of religion to the private sphere and eternal life; they search for reasons for their<br>

  Abstract: A recurrent stumbling block to comprehending the principalities exists, for many people, at just this point. Human beings are reluctant to acknowledge institutions—or any of the other principalities—as creatures having their own existence, personality, and mode of life. Yet the Bible consistently speaks of the principalities as creatures.… The typical version of human reluctance to accord the principalities their due integrity as creatures is the illusion of human beings that they make or create and, hence, control institutions and that institutions are no more than groups of human beings duly organized. How do these creatures called principalities come<br>

Even against the “guilty,” violence involves an idolatrous and preemptive exploit of the divine prerogative. This is more than merely “God on our side.” Whether it is in the death penalty or war, the exercise of official violence generally presumes to know or to execute (which is to say, usurp) the judgment of God who alone holds the power of life and death.<br>

How is it possible that literally billions of people permit themselves to be hoodwinked and fleeced by tiny circles of elites propped up by armies far from adequate to subdue the population of the world?

That much is clear, not just from the Sermon on the Mount, but from his entire life and teaching and, above all, the way he faced his death. His was not merely a tactical or pragmatic nonviolence seized upon because nothing else would have “worked” against the Roman Empire’s near monopoly on violence. Rather, he saw nonviolence as a direct corollary of the nature of God and of the new reality emerging in the world from God.

Violence “saves.” It is “redemptive.” All we have to do is make survival the highest goal, and death the greatest evil, and we have handed ourselves over to the gods of the Domination System. We trust violence because we are afraid. And we will not relinquish our fears until we are able<br>

In “Anthropology as Kulturkampf,” George Stocking (1992: 92–113) argues for understanding Boasian anthropology within the framework of progressive and reformist politics, which shifted during various phases of Boas’s life. As I have argued elsewhere, I believe that this trajectory continued beyond Boas’s lifetime and that American anthropology of the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries has become identified with a particular political worldview: what Richard Rorty (1983) called “postmodernist bourgeois liberalism.” It is important to note that while Rorty claims Dewey as<br>

  Abstract: Arthur Nole, Tahltan Indigenous elder and storyteller, died on January 3, 2015, after breaking his leg while chopping wood. He lived a life indicative of the complexities of Indigenous lives and, particularly, the meshing of traditional activities and wage work. He was a dedicated moose hunter and passionate hunting guide, and he was tremendously interested in the telling and recording of Tahltan history. His later life was dominated by family activities and motivated by teaching young people the traditional skills of camping, hunting, and life on the land.<br>

  CHAPTER 7  Film Museum Exhibition Spaces from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1v2xssp">The Film Museum Practice and Film Historiography</a><br>
  Abstract: As with film theatres and cinemas, film museums are ‘other spaces’, with very different rules, customs and time dimensions to those we are accustomed to in daily life (Foucault, 1984: 48). These other spaces, which Foucault also calls ‘heterotopias’, are separated from the world we normally live in and can only be entered after performing a number of rituals. To step over the threshold of one of these institutions is literally to make the transition from our everyday world into that other space (Poppe, 1989: 21). From the moment that the visitors enter a theatre, for example, their expectations are<br>

  Abstract: As has been argued in previous chapters, discourses relating to what constitutes popular culture in France have experienced a sweeping paradigm shift in the last fifty or so years. This has been witnessed across a range of cultural practices and philosophical and political debates. This period of change and negotiation coincides to a great extent with the development and gradual entrenchment of television in French cultural life, from its early days as a little-watched curiosity to its current incarnation as an ever-present and highly influential medium.

  Abstract: In seminal works such as
         Go Tell It on the Mountain,Notes of a Native Son, andThe Fire Next Time, acclaimed author and social critic James Baldwin (1924--1987) expresses his profound belief that writers have the power to transform society, to engage the public, and to inspire and channel conversation to achieve lasting change. While Baldwin is best known for his writings on racial consciousness and injustice, he is also one of the country's most eloquent theorists of democratic life and the national psyche.<br>

  Author(s) Shulman George<br>
  Abstract: Although James Baldwin’s essays depict the relationship of white supremacy to the formation of American society and the shaping of national identity, prevailing forms of liberal and Marxist political thought, as well as most versions of so-called democratic theory, do not recognize him as a political thinker or even contributing to the understanding of politics. Their resounding silence about race, and his exclusion from their canons, bespeak the very conditions he analyzes as a political and moral catastrophe. These conditions are, in short, ongoing racial domination as the foundation of American life, and its disavowal by those it enfranchises. On<br>

  Book Title: Negative Cosmopolitanism-Cultures and Politics of World Citizenship after Globalization<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): TOMSKY TERRI<br>
  Abstract: From climate change, debt, and refugee crises to energy security, environmental disasters, and terrorism, the events that lead nightly newscasts and drive public policy demand a global perspective. In the twentieth century the world sought solutions through formal institutions of international governance such as the United Nations, the International Criminal Court, and the World Bank, but present-day responses to global realities are often more provisional, improvisational, and contingent. Tracing this uneven history in order to identify principal actors, contesting ideologies, and competing rhetoric, Negative Cosmopolitanism challenges the Kantian ideal of cosmopolitanism as the precondition for a perpetual global peace. Uniting literary scholars with researchers working on contemporary problems and those studying related issues of the past – including slavery, industrial capitalism, and corporate imperialism – essays in this volume scrutinize the entanglement of cosmopolitanism within expanding networks of trade and global capital from the eighteenth century to the present. By doing so, the contributors pinpoint the ways in which whole populations have been unwillingly caught up in a capitalist reality that has little in common with the earlier ideals of cosmopolitanism. A model for provoking new and necessary questions about neoliberalism, biopolitics, colonialism, citizenship, and xenophobia, Negative Cosmopolitanism establishes a fresh take on the representation of globalization and modern life in history and literature. Contributors Include Timothy Brennan (University of Minnesota), Juliane Collard (University of British Columbia), Mike Dillon (California State University, Fullerton), Sneja Gunew (University of British Columbia), Dina Gusejnova (University of Sheffield), Heather Latimer (University of British Columbia), Pamela McCallum (University of Calgary), Geordie Miller (Dalhousie University), Dennis Mischke (Universität Stuttgart), Peter Nyers (McMaster University), Liam O’Loughlin (Pacific Lutheran University), Crystal Parikh (New York University), Mark Simpson (University of Alberta), Melissa Stephens (Vancouver Island University), and Paul Ugor (Illinois State University).From climate change, debt, and refugee crises to energy security, environmental disasters, and terrorism, the events that lead nightly newscasts and drive public policy demand a global perspective.

  Abstract: Looking back over his life in 1888—“What I Owe to the Ancients” serves as the starting point for Nietzsche’s “autobiography”
                  Ecce Homo—Nietzsche declares thatThe Birth of Tragedy, first published in 1872, was his “first revaluation of all values’ (TI Ancients 5). It is from this “soil”—that is, his study of the Greeks—that his “will,” his “abilitiesgrow.” During this time Nietzsche had noted a series of reflections onThe Birthin preparation for his “Revaluation of All Values,” demonstrating that the book and its themes were on his mind, and a number of letters of<br>

                  Human, All Too Human(1878–80),Daybreak(1881), and the first four books ofThe Gay Science(1882), Nietzsche demonstrates a favorable disposition toward democracy.¹ Writers such as William Connolly, Owen, Paul Patton, and Schrift offer upThe Wanderer and His Shadow293 (1880), titled “Ends and Means of Democracy,” as typifying Nietzsche’s allegedly prodemocratic sentiment.² There, Nietzsche explains that “democracy wants to create and guarantee as muchindependenceas possible: independence of opinion, of mode of life, and<br>

  Abstract: Nietzsche’s productive life almost exactly spans Bismarck’s era. He was a medical orderly in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71), but fell ill and only served for two months. Serving as a medical orderly was quite a common experience for many of the more “spiritual” types of Nietzsche’s generation. Most, however, were not as fortunate as he was to have actually survived, being decimated by various diseases contracted on the battlefield—illness already being a greater harvester of souls than war itself.¹ Nietzsche had previously volunteered as a cavalry officer in his local town, Naumburg, but after a self-described promising start,<br>

  Abstract: In depicting the character and personality of their deceased subject, English Protestant ministers in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries employ features of writing strikingly comparable to contemporary works of fictional narrative. Such features include not only the selective inclusion of biographical details from the subject’s life and death, but a spectrum of seemingly ‘literary’ devices such as the portrayal of multiple points of view through eyewitness ‘testimonials’, direct quotation of correspondence, poetry, diary entries, and vividly-realized deathbed scenes (some of which include dialogue).<br>

  Abstract: Plays which deal directly with political life are rare in the Irish canon. Mostly, the emphasis is on family relations, with the direct political context placed in the background, if not almost entirely effaced. But there are those exceptional occasions when contemporary playwrights have felt the need to address the state of the nation more directly by placing politicians squarely on the stage. Brian Friel did so in his 1969 play

  Abstract: One of the familiar conventions of autobiography is its revelation of an individual life through a compelling first-person narrative voice. To work upon its readers most effectively, autobiography needs to present the life in question as both unique and typical; it must offer an appealing account of an existence that is special enough and significant enough to warrant attention, but it must also sustain that attention through an insistence on common human dilemmas and a shared sense of endeavour. At the same time as presenting a single life as unfolding and uncertain, shaped by that which can only be dimly<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1wvwdtb">Rethinking Sincerity and Authenticity</a><br>
  Abstract: What Celan’s line reveals, if paradoxically, is that there is at least one more problem with self-congruence.¹ Specifically, ”Sincerity and the Problem of Individualism” recognizes that the modern obsession with self-congruence may often be less virtue than vice. Despite Polonius’s advice, life (the moral aspect of it, in particular) involves being true not so much to myself as to the others who surround me. An uncompromising commitment to self-congruence, therefore, stands at odds with the moral imperative’s defining commitment to doing for others around me. Self-congruence resembles, instead, self-interest and the narcissism that threatens genuine ethical concern for others.<br>

  6  The National Memorial Paradigm from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1x76f8h">Holocaust Monuments and National Memory</a><br>
  Abstract: The proliferation of monuments and commemorations and the social and political values invested in them since the 1970s are symptomatic of societies that have been actively seeking a symbolic reinforcement of collective memories. Public symbols are neither a cause nor a consequence of the present international preoccupation with memory, however, but the very language with which these societies transmit and negotiate their pasts. What are the historical and political origins and the social consequences of this phenomenon? And how do contemporary societies legitimate their existence on the basis of memory and historical representations? The rise of memory cultures, which is<br>

  Abstract: Without denying the importance of the postmodernist approach to the narrative form and rhetorical strategies of historiography, the author, one of Germany's most prominent cultural historians, argues here in favor of reason and methodical rationality in history. He presents a broad variety of aspects, factors and developments of historical thinking from the 18th century to the present, thus continuing, in exemplary fashion, the tradition of critical self-reflection in the humanities and looking at historical studies as an important factor of cultural orientation in practical life.<br>

  Abstract: My aim in this essay is to defend a complex, imprecise, and, at crucial points, uncertain account of society and politics. I have no hope of theoretical simplicity, not at this historical moment when so many stable oppositions of political and intellectual life have collapsed; but I also have no desire for simplicity, since a world that theory could fully grasp and neatly explain would not, I suspect, be a pleasant place. In the nature of things, then, my argument won’t be elegant, and though I believe that arguments should march, the sentences following one another like soldiers on parade,<br>

If I have picked what could be called an “abnormal” context for ethnographic research, the territory of Northern Cyprus carved out of international recognition, I intend this “facing [of] the extreme,” in Tzvetan Todorov’s terms,¹ of an exaggerated context, to accentuate the “abnormal” in contexts that are usually considered politically “normal.” The purpose is not to normalize, by default, the abnormal (i.e., the illegal<br>

A 19-year-old refugee from Afghanistan, Mohammed had withdrawn unobtrusively from the group of men who were sitting around outside talking together. He went to his room, locked the door and hanged himself. Despite the efforts of journalists and refugee advocates, we know little else about Mohammed. We do know that he was from the Hazara community, a minority religious and ethnic group in Afghanistan that has endured ongoing persecution from other Afghani groups. He<br>

  Abstract: ‘Diaspora’ is a useful umbrella term under which we can discuss large-scale migration, but it can lead to homogenized representations of migrants and may fail to reflect the individual pressures or dreams that motivated the migrants to leave their homelands. As part of a broader interest in how the Pacific War affected the Japanese diaspora, in this chapter I attempt to personalize and re-examine the notion of diaspora through the life story of Joseph Clement Kisaburo Murakami, an Australian-born ethnic Japanese who holds an Australian passport and has permanent residency in Japan.

  Abstract: The genres of autobiographical writing and utopian writing have little in common. While an autobiography is an account of the life of an individual written by that individual, utopian narrative offers a vision of an ideal place and social system for a collective. In fact, according to Robert F. Sayre, autobiography and utopia indicate polarities: between experience and prophecy, self and society, private and public or emotional unity and rational order (Sayre 1972, 21, 23). Both forms have firmly marked their presence in the culture and history of Australia. Autobiography, as Joy Hooton writes, has always been a prolific genre<br>

  Author(s) Bloechl Jeffrey<br>
  Abstract: Following the definition established by Aristotle, ethics examines the relationship between our capacity to mark and repeat certain actions, which includes recognizing rules and giving them to oneself, and the passivity denoted in the fact that experiences and ideas impress themselves on us. The good life consists in managing this activity and passivity on the complex field of economic, social and political life. The primary occasion in which we feel this challenge is the encounter with someone in need, where a face alone is often enough to call forth a response visibly guided by prior education and experience.

Eliza Barkan, notably, has spoken of an “age of apology,” referring to the impressive number of heads of state, leaders of the ecclesiastical hierarchies, and even multinational companies, who over the last twenty-five years have been asked to—and in some cases have made—public confessions, offers of apology, and requests for forgiveness.¹ It is to the detriment of many of these studies that they have not been informed by a careful reading of the work of the philosopher<br>

  Abstract: The constellation of personal, historical, and esthetic forces that shape Sylvia Plath’s poetic and plot her life traces the same pattern that Poe’s ill-starred poet originally marked. With Plath, we once more begin “in a kingdom by the sea,” before all separations and departures. In such a prelapsarian mythic matrix, human breath, the breath of the sea, and the breath of poetry pulse in unison. Plath recalls this origin in “ocean

Untethered words wander around aimlessly, whence we get our concept of ambiguity or the waywardness of discourse. However, the tying down of one’s words is not easy. In fact, sometimes Socrates makes it sound like the question is all that can be justifiably put into words. For the rest one should keep silent, or speak only in the most guarded fashion, darkly, and then perhaps only of<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xp3sjh">Heidegger's Estrangements</a><br>
  Abstract: One therapeutic effect of Heidegger’s first essay on language is that it disconnects us—estranges or alienates us—from the very idea of language, especially as this comes down to us in idealist and analytic philosophies of language, linguistics, semiotics, various criticisms, and so on; and this also means alienation from what we might call the social theory of language, where the idea is not to retrieve the deep grammatical, semantic, or propositional structure of human expression, but just to study how people talk, what they say when, their language games, their discursive practices and institutions, their forms of life.<br>

It may seem odd, even confounding, to introduce certain norms or “goods” where the notoriously crafty business of rhetoric is concerned. Today we have spin doctors and image consultants, audience-manipulators of every ideological stripe—hence the much discussed flight of audiences from the public arena.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xp3sn2">Norms of Rhetorical Culture</a><br>
  Abstract: Proclamations of reason’s eclipse, like many a categorical dismissal, have shown themselves to be a bit hasty. Perhaps the life of practical reason, as a mode of reflection open to the collectivity, may be thought of as a generational phenomenon.¹ In any historical period, there are likely to be cultures in which reason and rhetoric have been poisoned. But it seems premature to pronounce any state of affairs, however extreme, as having eliminated forever the prospects for recovery. In the retrospection of dark times, utopian thought can appear foolish. But some such thought may be necessary if possibilities for reflection<br>

  Abstract: Nobody admits to liking rhetoric very much. But almost everyone admits to having occasionally been seized and transported by a discourse which changed or influenced their life and priorities. It is a commonplace that such discourse is rare, the exception that proves our (usually untested) rule. But all practices need to have outstanding exemplars, touchstones of accomplishment. And virtually by definition, such outstanding cases will be rare. It is probably not possible to determine whether great or eloquent rhetoric is rarer now than it was in the various golden ages of the past. Nor do I think that the determination,<br>

Perhaps this is as it should be in an age that is suspicious of grand designs. But not so terribly long ago it was otherwise.

  5  Universal Pragmatics and Practical Reason: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xp3sn2">Norms of Rhetorical Culture</a><br>
  Abstract: Proclamations of reason’s eclipse, like many a categorical dismissal, have shown themselves to be a bit hasty. Perhaps the life of practical reason, as a mode of reflection open to the collectivity, may be thought of as a generational phenomenon.¹ In any historical period, there are likely to be cultures in which reason and rhetoric have been poisoned. But it seems premature to pronounce any state of affairs, however extreme, as having eliminated forever the prospects for recovery. In the retrospection of dark times, utopian thought can appear foolish. But some such thought may be necessary if possibilities for reflection<br>

  Abstract: Nobody admits to liking rhetoric very much. But almost everyone admits to having occasionally been seized and transported by a discourse which changed or influenced their life and priorities. It is a commonplace that such discourse is rare, the exception that proves our (usually untested) rule. But all practices need to have outstanding exemplars, touchstones of accomplishment. And virtually by definition, such outstanding cases will be rare. It is probably not possible to determine whether great or eloquent rhetoric is rarer now than it was in the various golden ages of the past. Nor do I think that the determination,<br>

  Abstract: This book presents a theoretical account of the music of Béla Bartok. Constantly implicit in such an account is the tension between two conflicting demands: that the account be theoretical, that is, composed of (among other things) broadly applicable general statements directed to certain kinds of musical understanding; and that it be firmly situated within the detailed context formed by Bartok’s works and life, as that context has grown in our knowledge over the past fifty years and more. Where it is necessary to choose between these demands, generality must give way to context. But the book attempts to avoid<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xp3w37">Return from Exile - Rückkehr aus dem Exil</a><br>
  Author(s) BESNER NEIL<br>
  Abstract: Born in Vienna in 1922, novelist, short-story writer, critic, and scholar Henry Kreisel was forced to flee Vienna with his family after the
                  Anschlussin 1938. The vital and many-layered significance of that forced departure from Vienna in Kreisel’s writing – as in his life – exerted, both autobiographically and imaginatively, a strong and enduring hold on him. It is a very old cliché, perhaps because over time it has proven truer than a cliché, that no city comes alive in the collective imagination unless and until it has been memorably invoked in narrative art: Defoe’s or Dickens’ London, Mordecai<br>

  Book Title: Vatican II and Beyond-The Changing Mission and Identity of Canadian Women Religious<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Smyth Elizabeth M.<br>
  Abstract: The year 2015 marked the fiftieth anniversary of the end of the Second Vatican Council, which aimed to align the Church with the modern world. Over the last five decades, women religious have engaged with the council’s reforms with unprecedented enthusiasm, far exceeding the expectations of the Church. Addressing how Canadian women religious envisioned and lived out the changes in religious life brought on by a pluralistic and secularizing world, Vatican II and Beyond analyzes the national organization of female and male congregations, the Canadian Religious Conference, and the lives of two individual sisters: visionary congregational leader Alice Trudeau and social justice activist Mary Alban. This book focuses on the new transnational networks, feminist concepts, professionalization of religious life, and complex political landscapes that emerged during this period of drastic transition as women religious sought to reconstruct identities, redefine roles, and signify vision and mission at both the personal and collective levels. Following women religious as they encountered new meanings of faith in their congregations, the Church, and society at large, Vatican II and Beyond demonstrates that the search for a renewed vision was not just a response to secularization, but a way to be reborn as Catholic women.The year 2015 marked the fiftieth anniversary of the end of the Second Vatican Council, which aimed to align the Church with the modern world.

  Author(s) Smyth Elizabeth M.<br>
  Abstract: The year 2015 marked the fiftieth anniversary of the closure of the Second Vatican Council (Vatican II). The council, which broadly aimed at aligning the Church with the modern world, is considered the most significant event in the history of contemporary Roman Catholicism. The impact of the council on women religious, who engaged with the reforms with unprecedented enthusiasm, far exceeded the changes expected by the hierarchy of the Church. The decline of religious life is often blamed on the Second Vatican Council, but this book documents and demonstrates the greater complexity of the issues involved.<br>

  Book Title: The Spirit of God-Short Writings on the Holy Spirit<br>
  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): Clifford Catherine E.<br>
  Abstract: Yves Congar was the most significant voice in Catholic pneumatology in the twentieth century. This new collection of short pieces makes his thought accessible to a broad range of readers - scholars, teachers, ecumenists and laity - and thus helps to ensure that an important theological voice, one that influenced many of the documents of the Second Vatican Council, continues to be heard.
      The Spirit of Godbrings together for the first time eight of Yves Congar's previously untranslated writings on the Holy Spirit composed after Vatican II (from 1969 to 1985). Two of these selections offer general overviews of Congar's pneumatology, a pneumatology based upon Scripture and the Tradition of the Church, but articulated in conversation with philosophers, ecumenical partners and non-believers. Other articles make clear the historical context of Vatican II's pneumatology and the Holy Spirit's crucial influence upon the unfolding of history and upon the moral life, the efficacy of the sacraments and, especially, upon ecclesial life.The writings inThe Spirit of Godhave been translated and edited by a team of scholars familiar with the work of the French Dominican theologian. An introduction situates each of the writings historically and highlights its theological significance. A bibliography lists Congar's publications on the Holy Spirit, the major articles and books written about his pneumatology, and the major scholarly resources to which Congar made reference in the notes that accompanied these writings. An index of biblical references and of personal names is also included.<br>

All three come from the last period of Congar’s scholarly life, 1969 to 1991, according to the periodday ization of Cornelis Van Vliet.¹ The climax of this part is arguably Congar’s most important article on the Holy Spirit, “Pneumatology or ‘Christomonism’ in the Latin Tradition?” We have included two additional writings, “Theology of the Holy Spirit and Theology of History” and “The Holy Spirit in the<br>

  Abstract: First of all, I must clarify the meaning of some terms. “Pneumatology” designates the ensemble of actions proper to the Holy Spirit (or appropriated to the Holy Spirit) in the life of the Church and of the world. It is obvious that what I will say on this subject makes sense only if one presupposes the traditional Christian faith. But that is true, too, for “theology of history.” This expression designates, in the most general way, a consideration of history from God’s point of view in so far as we know it, that is, in the light not only of<br>

The story, he wrote, would reflect the “contemporary moment (as far as possible, of course) of our inner life.” The central character would be “a certain type of Russian abroad”: Dostoevsky’s comparison of this story with hisNotes from theHouse of the Deadis of particular interest.

  Abstract: Three things may be said about the lifelong polemic of Maxim Gorky (1868–1936) with Dostoevsky. First, it had deep psychological roots in a confrontation with aspects of his own nature; overcoming Dostoevsky, for Gorky, was a process of self-overcoming. Second, this process of self-overcoming became linked with a central effort of Gorky’s literary and cultural writings—the task of overcoming Russian history, the painful legacy of violence and disorder in Russian man and life, all that he once called “our most implacable enemy—our past.”² And third, this overcoming ultimately took on the dimensions of a struggle between worldviews,<br>

  Abstract: As one considers any biographical treatment of Alexander Pushkin it is prudent to bear in mind the words of the eminent cultural historian, literary theorist, and biographer of the poet Yury Lotman. In his biography Lotman “wanted to show how, like the mythological King Midas who turned everything he touched to gold, Pushkin turned everything he touched into creativity, art.

  Abstract: Pushkin was possessed of a richly mythopoetic consciousness. He was also, as numerous friends attest, intensely superstitious. Indeed, for a poet of Pushkin’s range and energy, it is not surprising that some of his finest works are motivated thematically on the dual and interpenetrating notions that myths can, literally, come to life and that forces beyond one’s control can prearrange one’s destiny. Yet Pushkin never made the connection between certain crucial myths (or beliefs, superstitions) and his own unfolding biography

  Abstract: Central to any understanding of Joseph Brodsky as poet and thinker is his myth of language, his belief in words, and not just any words but specifically poetic words, ability to restructure time and to outwit states, tyrants, history itself. “Prosody is simply a repository of time within language,”² writes Brodsky in a statement repeated many times over in different guises and contexts. Poetic words, by their very nature, got there, and are always still getting there, first. Indeed, what makes this idea a myth in the first place, that is, something larger than the life it explains, is these<br>

  Chapter 2  The Novel on Translation and “Über-Translation”: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1zxsjwj">The Translator’s Doubts</a><br>
  Abstract: In his 1937 French essay for the
                  Nouvelle Revue française, “Pouchkine, ou le vrai et le vraisemblable” (“Pushkin, or the Real and the Plausible”),³ Nabokov claimed that the truth of another’s life is inaccessible because thought inevitably distorts whatever it tries to encompass. However, the intuitions of a fictionalized biography motivated by love for its subject might convey a “plausible” life bearing a mysterious affinity for “the poet’s work, if not the poet himself.”⁴ This relatively early statement on this subject by Nabokov, made during centennial celebrations of Aleksandr Pushkin’s death, becomes poignant in light of Nabokov’s novel Pale Fire<br>

  Book Title: Reasoning from Faith-Fundamental Theology in Merold Westphal’s Philosophy of Religion<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): SANDS JUSTIN<br>
  Abstract: Merold Westphal is considered to be one of the preeminent Continental philosophers of religion. His articulation of faith as the task of a lifetime has become a touchstone in contemporary debates concerning faith's relationship to reason. As Justin Sands explores his philosophy, he illuminates how Westphal's concept of faith reveals the pastoral, theological intent behind his thinking. Sands sees Westphal's philosophy as a powerful articulation of Protestant theology, but one that is in ecumenical dialogue with questions concerning apologetics and faith's relationship to ethics and responsibility, a more Catholic point of view. By bringing out these features in Westphal's philosophy, Sands intends to find core philosophical methodologies as well as a passable bridge for philosophers to cross over into theological discourses.<br>

  Abstract: The interior environment that Kira Muratova creates in
                  Brief Encounters, her first independently made film, is strange, to say the least. Overflowing with objects and textures of all kinds—heavily ornamented furniture, kitchenware, bookshelves, wallpaper, curtains, sculptural reliefs, pictures, and much more—her environments monopolize our attention, drawing us away from the people who inhabit and have shaped them. Sometimes these objects appear next to a human figure, doubling the focal point of the image; at other times they alone are presented in prolonged, nearly immobile shots reminiscent of still-life compositions. We can observe this, for instance, in the opening<br>

  Abstract: This essay develops the hypothesis that social death is utterly central to the evil of genocide, not just when a genocide is primarily cultural but even when it is homicidal on a massive scale. It is social death that enables us to distinguish the peculiar evil of genocide from the evils of other mass murders. Even genocidal murders can be viewed as extreme means to the primary end of social death. Social vitality exists through relationships, contemporary and intergenerational, that create an identity that gives meaning to a life. Major loss of social vitality is a loss of identity and<br>

  Abstract: Between 1948 and 1967 the story of Kfar Etzion, one of the best-known cases of heroism in Israel’s War of Independence, became the defining myth in religious Zionism. No other story or single event in the history of religious Zionism has attained such mythical proportions and had so much influence on religious Zionists. The essence of religious-Zionist belief, how to live a life of purity and holiness and how to die a hero’s death, all for the sanctification of God’s name (

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2005th6">Cosmopolitanism and Place</a><br>
  Author(s) Failache Juan Carlos Pereda<br>
  Abstract: Socialization processes normally imply that we stimulate and praise—or discourage and scorn—some of our desires. And something comparable happens to our beliefs, emotions, interests, and, of course, to our actions. A tradition or cultural heritage is not just something out there; it entails a complex, and usually implicit, social normativity. However, communities also make explicit, in a fragmentary way, that normativity by means of codes, regulations, exhortations, suggestions, prohibitions, historical narratives, monuments, songs—all in a more or less vague and inconsistent manner. Is this how a public normativity becomes rooted in every person’s life?<br>

  Abstract: In his

In this, art mirrors life itself. Nevertheless, in spite of the admitted plurality, he issues a call for an “open aesthetics” and an “aesthetic pluralism” and asks, “Is there really an aesthetics that cuts across all human<br>

  Abstract: It is no secret that life in the twenty-first century happens, for many of us, in a “place” that defies traditional conceptions of place, community, and communication—namely, in the nebulous and Heraclitean world of the internet. Not only information but socialization and political life exist online; for many people, in fact, those relationships and conversations accessed via electronic mediums constitute the majority of all such interactions. And despite the hand-wringing that this fact might inspire in those nostalgic for pre-internet days, these interactions are
                  real: they are lived by flesh-and-blood people who not only inhabit traditionally physical communities but<br>

  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): RAYMAN JOSHUA<br>
  Abstract: What are the foundations of human self-understanding and the value of responsible philosophical questioning? Focusing on Heidegger's early work on facticity, historicity, and the phenomenological hermeneutics of factical-historical life, Hans-Helmuth Gander develops an idea of understanding that reflects our connection with the world and other, and thus invites deep consideration of phenomenology, hermeneutics, and deconstruction. He draws usefully on Husserl's phenomenology and provides grounds for exchange with Descartes, Dilthey, Nietzsche, Gadamer, Ricoeur, and Foucault. On the way to developing a contemporary hermeneutical philosophy, Gander clarifies the human relation to self in and through conversation with Heidegger's early hermeneutics. Questions about reading and writing then follow as these are the very actions that structure human self-understanding and world understanding.<br>

  Abstract: The lifeworld as the pretheoretical world in which we live—with a view to the question of human self-relations, how are we to make it adequately accessible to a philosophical thematization? This question is all the more urgent insofar as the critical objections that have arisen in the course of the discussion of Husserl’s last great transcendental meditation are taken as valid.

                  pretheoretical experiences,from which it works on its ontological analysis of structure by means of the interpretation of concrete appearances. In the context of discussions of the<br>

  Abstract: With the hermeneutical demonstration that our never other than life worldly situated self-understanding is always already historical at the origin of its self-worldly significance, the factual analysis of Heidegger’s early work comes to an end, in that for one thing, it makes explicit the point of departure of phenomenological hermeneutics of factical historical life in the wealth of its structures. For another, beyond the fact of placing the starting point in life, the central question of his early work illuminates at the same time how “factical life-experience belongs in a wholly originary sense to the problematic of philosophy,”¹ in that<br>

  Book Title: Persuasion, Reflection, Judgment-Ancillae Vitae<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
  Abstract: As one of the most respected voices of Continental philosophy today, Rodolphe Gasché pulls together Aristotle's conception of rhetoric, Martin Heidegger's debate with theory, and Hannah Arendt's conception of judgment in a single work on the centrality of these themes as fundamental to human flourishing in public and political life. Gasché's readings address the distinctively human space of the public square and the actions that occur there, and his valorization of persuasion, reflection, and judgment reveals new insight into how the philosophical tradition distinguishes thinking from other faculties of the human mind.<br>

These have included the implementation of protectionist, but isolationist, measures and efforts aimed at restoring “social order” through a process of group segmentation. Communication across gender lines in these neighborhoods has diminished, identities have become increasingly ethnicized, and the importance of religion has been amplified. Today’s France is witnessing the creation of ghettos, neighborhoods populated by what are effectively second-class citizens, and who have become increasingly withdrawn into their own communities as a reaction to their lack of integration.<br>

In the 1930s, the enemy sought to “Sovietize” France, to take power, to impose Soviets, and to destroy our colonial empire; in the early twenty-first century, the enemy intends to “Islamize” our country, destroy our “national identity,” wage international jihad, destroy Israel.

With #GamerGate in the national news, shows like The Big Bang Theory on ever-increasing numbers of screens, and Peter Orzsag and Paul Ryan on magazine covers, it is clear that nerds, policy wonks, and neoconservatives play a major role in today's popular culture in America. The Year's Work in Nerds, Wonks, and Neocons delves into subcultures of intellectual history to explore their influence on contemporary American intellectual life. Not limiting themselves to describing how individuals are depicted, the authors consider the intellectual endeavors these depictions have come to represent, exploring many models and practices of learnedness, reflection, knowledge production, and opinion in the contemporary world. As teachers, researchers, and university scholars continue to struggle for mainstream visibility, this book illuminates the other forms of intellectual excitement that have emerged alongside them and found ways to survive and even thrive in the face of dismissal or contempt.<br>

  Abstract: It says a lot about your intellectual life if you remember being pushed around for wearing glasses and reading books as a kid—or if you remember pushing around kids who wore glasses and read books. Such persecutions may have faded to a distant memory or persist as a lingering ordeal. But what was the appeal—or the pathology—of glasses and books in the first place? Perhaps you were a Young Republican and flourished on the debating club; perhaps you were the manager for the varsity sports team, more comfortable with a clipboard than a sports bra or jockstrap.<br>

  Author(s) GRANT NATHAN L.<br>
  Abstract: Shortly before 1900, the growing ability of the weekly newspaper comic strip to bend the imagery of the everyday soon made it a staple of modern American life, as was the case with film. Beginning in 1895, Richard Outcault’s Sunday strip
                  The Yellow Kid, depicting a bald, barefoot boy who, through the solecisms printed on his shirt, eventually helped to sell the idea of war with Spain to Americans, appeared in both William Randolph Hearst’s New York Journal and Joseph Pulitzer’sNew York World, becoming wildly popular toward the end of the century.

  Author(s) GLASER JENNIFER<br>
  Abstract: As I struggled to finish a monograph on Jews, race, and writing, I couldn’t help but feel that I was futilely circling the point. Yes, Jewish writers were preoccupied with questions of race and racialization after the rise of civil rights in America. Yes, many of these same writers (and the intellectuals who influenced them) grappled with their anxiety by speaking in the cadences of more marginalized and racially marked others. But these arguments never felt like they fully encompassed the sometimes messy politics of race at the heart of postwar Jewish life. My project, like those of the Jewish<br>

  Author(s) ROOF JUDITH<br>
  Abstract: In the latter half of the nineteenth century, Sir Francis Galton, halfcousin of Charles Darwin and most remembered for his advocacy of eugenics (he coined the term), worked to define scientifically the phenomenon of genius. Using surveys and developing statistical methods as the basis for his anthropometric studies, Galton published

  Abstract: FOR VIKTOR SHKLOVSKY, the Russian-language Formalist writer and critic, and for David Bergelson, the Yiddish prose author, the city of Berlin, the place of their temporary exile in the 1920s, presented a fascinating spectacle of city life and technological sophistication, as well as the horrific traces of World War I. Both refer to the so-called broken men, veterans who had suffered severe and dramatically visible bodily disfigurement. In the “postscript” to

  Abstract: I have described what I take to be some fundamental processes in musical experience and conceptualization. In addition to specific processes, this includes an essential variability in how these play out in different musical practices, among different individuals, and even for a given individual at different points in one’s life.

  Author(s) Bílik René<br>
  Abstract: The first ideas about how literature and literary life in Slovakia should look after the end of World War II were formulated by their protagonists as early as 1945. In the short period between 1945 and 1948, a part of modern domestic policy and of the ideological and literary traditions was actualized in programme-guided discussions and debates, but also in legally binding documents. The first line of this actualization movement reached back to the depth of the nineteenth century – to the Romantic concept of mighty Slavdom and pan-Slavic reciprocity. This line had a politically and ideologically declarative form, which<br>

  Book Title: Echoes of the Tambaran-Masculinity, history and the subject in the work of Donald F. Tuzin<br>
  Publisher: ANU E Press<br>
  Author(s): Roscoe Paul<br>
  Abstract: In the Sepik Basin of Papua New Guinea, ritual culture was dominated by the Tambaran —a male tutelary spirit that acted as a social and intellectual guardian or patron to those under its aegis as they made their way through life. To Melanesian scholarship, the cultural and psychological anthropologist, Donald F. Tuzin, was something of a Tambaran, a figure whose brilliant and fine-grained ethnographic project in the Arapesh village of Ilahita was immensely influential within and beyond New Guinea anthropology. Tuzin died in 2007, at the age of 61. In his memory, the editors of this collection commissioned a set of original and thought provoking essays from eminent and accomplished anthropologists who knew and were influenced by his work. They are echoes of the Tambaran. The anthology begins with a biographical sketch of Tuzin's life and scholarship. It is divided into four sections, each of which focuses loosely around one of his preoccupations. The first concerns warfare history, the male cult and changing masculinity, all in Melanesia. The second addresses the relationship between actor and structure. Here, the ethnographic focus momentarily shifts to the Caribbean before turning back to Papua New Guinea in essays that examine uncanny phenomena, narratives about childhood and messianic promises. The third part goes on to offer comparative and psychoanalytic perspectives on the subject in Fiji, Bali, the Amazon as well as Melanesia. Appropriately, the last section concludes with essays on Tuzin's fieldwork style and his distinctive authorial voice.<br>

  Author(s) Leavitt Stephen C.<br>
  Abstract: Childhood stories in personal narratives of Western subjects often convey pivotal moments of experience aimed at communicating personal identity. Such strategies rely on cultural models that see identity as the product of past life events, with childhood experience especially important. But what do personal childhood stories reveal in societies with very different cultural models of early lifeʹs role in shaping identity? Among the Bumbita Arapesh of Papua New Guinea—a group bordering the Ilahita Arapesh—childhood is the time of life when a new growing being takes in essential life substance from parental nurturing, supplemented by ritual transformation in initiation<br>

  Abstract: What can an architect mean when he writes of his own discipline that “in order to be significant, architecture must be forgotten?” The author of 
                     A Scientific Autobiography makes this assertion repeatedly.

  Abstract: As I write this, the tenth anniversary of 9/11 is upon us. In the decade following the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, much has changed in the United States, particularly for South Asian Americans. As Divakaruni’s quote suggests, while South Asian American community members mourned the terrible events, for many their horror was mixed with fear. In this crisis, an unfortunate number of South Asian Americans became the target of verbal insults and physical threats from both strangers and neighbors, sometimes despite lifetimes spent participating in civic activities, building local relationships, or creating community connections.<br>

  XI  Literary Canons and Social Value Options from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284vhr">Postmodernism and Cultural Identities</a><br>
  Abstract: In the previous chapter a strong pillar of the whole argument was a discussion and support of the “literary canon” as an element of stability and continuity in the academic life whether Catholic or secular, and ultimately in human society with its incessant convulsions as well. It is therefore appropriate to take a closer look at these canons, which are themselves under debate and often seem quite uncertain. Of course, doubts and apprehension are natural and predictable in any kind of exploration. Fresh openings toward areas of the secondary, marginality, and heteronomy, and a more generous valuation spread over broader<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284vhr">Postmodernism and Cultural Identities</a><br>
  Abstract: The case of Ernst Jünger, one of the greatest German writers of the twentieth century, is highly significant in connection with the studies undertaken in the present book. Above all, he is significant because his life and the period of his writing career cover an unusually long time, virtually the whole of the twentieth century, and his artistic sensibility responded faithfully to all the changes experienced during this time. The author’s responses were highly symptomatic not least because they focused on three points that are fully relevant to our stream of ideas. One of these is the dialectic between alienating<br>

  Abstract: If what I have been arguing for is true about comedy, then it might also have been a thought familiar to that one-time dramatist and lover of Aristophanes, Plato, and so, feeling merry and self-indulgent at the end of this project—it being a season of merriment—and entertaining the fleeting recollection of having been, in a previous life, a flute girl in the house of Agathon, I will make bold in closing to philosophize a little about the famous drinking party.

Rather than grinding to a halt, certain people hurdle the obstacles or creatively maneuver around them. They even make something positive out of the negative situation. In the face of crisis, they not only survive but also thrive. Resilience capacities involve coping well with difficulty, actively resisting destructive pressures, and rebuilding positively after adversity. However, people do not exercise these capacities in equal measure. Human beings faced with similar situations end up in diverse spots. Some manage destructive life events more efficaciously.

  TWO  Christian Marriage from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284xt0">Humanae vitae, a generation later</a><br>
  Abstract: Humanae Vitae depends on a Christian understanding of the nature or meaning of marriage and in particular on a Christian understanding of the importance of the marital gift of having children. Although the condemnation of contraception fundamentally depends on natural law principles, the Church draws on specifically Christian understandings when it calls on Christian disciples to live a moral life. In this chapter, Humanae Vitae will be placed primarily within the context of the teaching on marriage conveyed through Casti Connubii (1930) and Gaudium et Spes (1965). These documents, of course, are not the only place to look for the<br>

  7.  Gregory Nazianzen and Philosophy, with Remarks on Gregory’s Cynicism from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284zwd">Re-Reading Gregory of Nazianzus</a><br>
  Author(s) CHIODO CAROL<br>
  Abstract: It is well known that for the Cappadocian fathers—and especially for Gregory of Nazianzen—the term “philosophy” signifies “the Christian life” or “the contemplation of Christian truth.”¹ When referring to the contemplation of Christian truth, 
                     philosophein and theologein are almost equivalent in Gregory’s works, though philosophein occurs with greater frequency. Yet, in addition to these basic senses, philosophein carries a controversial meaning, as well. This polemical sense reflects Gregory’s sophistic art and his refined use of logoi: “[the doctor] discoursing learnedly on your disease after you are dead,” as he puts it in one of his orations.²<br>

  Abstract: “Children, for my sake, ‘guard what has been entrusted to you’; remember my stoning! The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all! Amen!”¹ With these words, Gregory of Nazianzus ends his Farewell to the Bishops, dramatically set in his departure from Constantinople in 381.² Gregory ensures that people would remember his stoning from the Easter Vigil of 380 by referring or alluding to it throughout his writings.³ For example, it is here evoked in Pauline fashion.⁴ What is the significance of this oft-recalled episode of Gregory’s life for his Christology?⁵<br>

  Author(s) Sterk Andrea<br>
  Abstract: As a young pupil in Thessalonica, Constantine the Philosopher, better known as St. Cyril, apostle to the Slavs, drew the sign of the cross on his wall and penned this eulogy to his lifelong patron and mentor. Gregory Nazianzen’s influence in Byzantine literature is well attested,¹ and the translation and importance of his writings in the Slavic world have also received attention.² Less explored and more puzzling in light of Gregory’s own career, however, is the connection in the latter half of the ninth century between Gregory and the fresh burst of missionary activity in this era.

  Author(s) JOHNSON JAMES TURNER<br>
  Abstract: Do medieval views of war have any relevance today? There are clearly enormous differences between life in the Middle Ages and life today, differences in social relationships, forms of political order, assumptions about the natural and supernatural world, available technology, and so on, which shaped warfare as they did every other aspect of everyday life. Since historical distance tends to present a somewhat abstracted and idealized picture of medieval warfare, the differences may loom as even more distinctive, with an image of knights in armor colliding on the field of battle contrasted to various models of contemporary warfare: ethnically or<br>

  Author(s) SYSE HENRIK<br>
  Abstract: Augustine is often referred to as the founder of just war doctrine. While that is not quite accurate, since Cicero and several of the earlier Church Fathers had already formulated the basic elements of the just war idea,¹ it is certainly true that Augustine would become the most influential of the early Christian teachers writing on the morality of war. He formulated his ideas at a crucial time in Church history, just when the Western Roman Empire was crumbling and Christianity had to accommodate to life in the world—a world that was showing few signs of an imminent end,<br>

  Author(s) FORHAN KATE L.<br>
  Abstract: During the Middle Ages, traditions of blood feud, desires for conquest and power, and even the chivalric code of honor intensified the frequency and legitimacy of war. Yet war as an inescapable fact of life does not diminish the desire for peace; in fact it may intensify our human sense of its value. Because conflict was so terribly damaging to land and lives in medieval Europe, ensuring peace often meant controlling war, or at least some of the negative and destructive by-products of the seemingly interminable hostilities. Consequently, the desire for peace in the Middle Ages was intimately related to<br>

  Author(s) JANSSEN DIETER<br>
  Abstract: In the months preceding the recent war against Iraq, the U.S. administration made clear that it sought not only to disarm Saddam Hussein and coerce him to comply with international law but also to force a change of regime.¹ Alongside the legitimacy of preemptive/preventive strikes and the justification of militarily enforcing nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), the problem of forcible regime change was thus brought to the fore of international attention.<br>

  Abstract: After affirming that genocide is a crime under international law whether committed in time of peace or war, the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide defines genocide as “any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, as such: killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2851gx">Necessity and Possibility</a><br>
  Abstract: It is not uncommon in introductory philosophy courses to receive a picture of Kant that paints him as a paradigmatic old-fashioned, detached Prussian scholar, whose walks were so predictable that the residents of Königsberg could set their clocks by them, and whose life passed as the most regular of regular verbs. Such an image is reinforced by the overwhelming attention to what might be called the “positive” dimension of Kant’s philosophy, for example, the Transcendental Analytic. There we find obscure arguments couched in arcane, inscrutable terminology, as well as intricate, elaborate proofs of synthetic a priori concepts and principles. All<br>

  Abstract: The ensuing chapter comprises an overview of key aspects of episcopal public life, legal activity, and governance. The social stature of bishops and the social doctrine of episcopal councils in Gaul were crafted during the fourth century, a period corresponding to what is customarily termed the Gallican period of episcopal law (314–506 AD). During this period, the political world of Gaul was transformed as the late imperial world of Rome gave way to newly dominant tribal kingdoms, most notably the Visigoths, Ostrogoths, Franks, and Burgundians.

The meaning and function of ecclesiastical law and the legal authority of bishops were developed in councils of the fourth century and afterward. This chapter offers an approach to the Gallic councils, with their ancient legacy of law and aristocratic activity. The legal activity of bishops of the late Roman Empire contained new elements, but in other regards connected the bishops to ancient structures of law and aristocratic cultural values.

  Abstract: The ensuing discussion is a reinterpretation of Carolingian royal ideology in the time of Charlemagne, during the establishment of an imperial church. One of the most widely held views of Carolingian politics is that this royal ideology should be thought of as a “political Augustinianism.” The subtle hesitant political views of Augustine were not suited to the life of an aggressively expanding kingdom.¹ To understand the political culture of the Carolingian world, it is more helpful to observe the continued relevance of episcopal law and social doctrine, with their roots in aristocratic traditions of the Mediterranean shore.

  8  Inside the Family from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2852kt">Papal Justice</a><br>
  Abstract: At Rome and in the Papal State, the control of the family, of spousal relations, of violence and transgressions perpetrated inside domestic walls, and also of familial relations with society, fell to multiple and varied institutions. Ecclesiastical and “lay” tribunals—the distinction here is merely relative—plus bishops, inquisitors, parish priests, and confraternities all kept their eye on society’s basic cell. Via open repression and charitable aid, all aimed to discipline behavior and punish transgressions that clashed with the family model imposed and sacralized by the Council of Trent. Family life also fell under the inquisitive, not always benevolent, eyes<br>

  12  Rivers of Ink: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2852kt">Papal Justice</a><br>
  Abstract: In the old regime’s society, the commonest means of communication between subjects and their sovereign was the petition. It was an instrument for modulating and adapting justice, a device to narrow the gap between sentence and punishment; it spoke to power and, by grace of communication, recognized it and bestowed legitimacy. Petitions 
                  (suppliche) and memorials (memoriali), as sources, are both fascinating and enigmatic.¹ Although prone to repetition, they are often quirky and captivating. They offer an image of daily life, of collective and individual behavior; though sieved through a mesh of commonplaces and formulae, they are a device for self-representation<br>

  Abstract: In January 1944 the English Catholic historian Christopher Dawson posed what he called “the basic sociological problem of our time,” the relation of religion and mass culture.³ Writing in the midst of World War II, Dawson saw the choice facing the West as between spiritual renewal, on the one hand, and technocracy and totalitarianism, on the other: “Unless we find a way to restore the contact between the life of society and the life of the spirit our civilization will be destroyed by the forces which it has had the knowledge to create but not wisdom to control.”⁴ Dawson was<br>

  Chapter Two  THREE PREMISES from:

  Abstract: Three premises of this book’s analysis need explicit articulation and defense: 1) the claim that there is a natural fit between a religious and a communal existence, that is, the claim for the superiority of a “communitarian” over an “individualistic” form of life for nurturing the religious individual; 2) the claim that, despite increasing attacks on ideas of progress during the past century and the demonstration of the inadequacy of such ideas for understanding history and politics, they largely continue, to our detriment, to shape our lives; and 3) the claim that politics must be founded on a non-or anti-utopian<br>

  Chapter Five  THE LOSS OF TRANSCENDENCE from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2852qr">The Turn to Transcendence</a><br>
  Abstract: All religions make cosmological claims, claims about the structure, nature, and purposes of the cosmos, but, like Judaism before it, Christianity from the beginning was of its essence cosmological, seeing human life both as dramatic, centered on a struggle to achieve a proper use of freedom, and as eschatological, receiving its orientation from beyond history. All was viewed against a cosmic background articulated in Scripture and preserved in the liturgy. The previous chapter described the abundant variety of expressions of transcendence, both the transcendence of the philosophers and that of the theologians, found in ancient Christianity and to the eve<br>

  Chapter Six  ALTERNATIVES from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2852qr">The Turn to Transcendence</a><br>
  Abstract: The previous two chapters traced the history of the practice and expression of a sense of transcendence, and the diminishment of an orientation to transcendence in recent centuries. Earlier, the third chapter gave some idea of the role of the arts in both fostering and diminishing the place of transcendence in life. This final chapter considers thinkers and movements outside the arts who have rebelled against the diminishment of transcendence and have proposed various alternatives as to how the transcendent dimension of life might be expressed today.<br>

  CHAPTER TWO  HEIDEGGER’S RELIGIOUS-PHILOSOPHICAL  from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2853gt">The Early Heidegger and Medieval Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: Heidegger began his career at Freiburg University in 1915 as an interpreter of the Catholic Middle Ages and as, to all appearances, a devout Roman Catholic: former seminarian and son of the sexton in Meßkirch. As his views on facticity and historicity developed, he became increasingly critical of “the system of Catholicism.” He came to believe that Catholicism inured itself from life through an architectonic of Scholastic concepts, a “pseudo-philosophy” with “police power” (GA60 313). Scholasticism (not identical to Catholicism in Heidegger’s mind but nonetheless inseparable from it) distorted Aristotle and compounded the forgetfulness of being already underway in antiquity<br>

  CHAPTER THREE  THE PHENOMENOLOGY OF THE EARLY HEIDEGGER from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2853gt">The Early Heidegger and Medieval Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: The early Heidegger’s circuitous path, from the Habilitationsschrift to Sein und Zeit ultimately moves in a single direction. The question that drives the Daseinanalytic of Sein und Zeit—the question of the being of time—first surfaces in Heidegger’s 1995 Scotus research. It reappears in the 1917–19 mysticism research, the remarks on Luther, the 1920–21 religion lectures, and the 1921–26 Aristotle research. The early Freiburg lectures document the variety of approaches Heidegger took to this problem, tentative solutions, experiments with language, and forays into the tradition, some that became lifelong projects, like the retrieval of non-Platonic Greek<br>

  CHAPTER FIVE  MYSTICISM from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2853gt">The Early Heidegger and Medieval Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: “
                  The most extreme sharpness and depth of thought belong to genuine and great mysticism,” Heidegger wrote in 1955.¹ The insight came to him far earlier. Joseph Sauer’s course in the history of medieval mysticism, which Heidegger took in 1910–11, was the beginning of a lifelong interest in Meister Eckhart.² In the Habilitationsschrift, Heidegger spoke of mysticism as the other side of the Middle Ages, “the living heart of medieval Scholasticism” (GA1 205–6). The fragments published in GA60 under the erroneous title “The Philosophical Foundations of Medieval Mysticism [Outlines and Sketches for a Lecture, Not Held, 1918–1919]” actually<br>

  CHAPTER SIX  LUTHER from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2853gt">The Early Heidegger and Medieval Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: The year 1917 was a turning point for Heidegger. Prior to 1917, he never openly questioned the Roman Catholic/Scholastic appropriation of philosophical methods into theology. After 1917, Heidegger began to regard Scholasticism as the site of the hegemony of theoretical speculative-aesthetic concepts in Christianity and the consequent forgetting of factical Christian life. The catalyst in this reversal was Heidegger’s discovery of Protestantism, Schleiermacher, Dilthey, and above all, Luther. We know Heidegger was reading Luther as early as 1909, although evidence of an intensive study of Luther only appears ten years later.¹ Heidegger came to believe that Luther had correctly identified<br>

  CHAPTER NINE  BEING-BEFORE-GOD IN THE MIDDLE AGES from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2853gt">The Early Heidegger and Medieval Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: Scholasticism did not leave the Jewish-Christian sense of history as it found it nor did it annul it. It sublated the early Christian understanding of time, fusing it with Hellenistic theoretical structures into a distinctively new way of being Christian. Greco-Roman “circular thinking” (the emphasis on the eternity of form) and Jewish-Christian historical thinking (the emphasis on the singularity of event), which initially tended to conflict with one another, achieved a precarious balance in Scholasticism. The Jewish-Christian historical sense was initially antagonistic to cultural and scientific life. There was no sense in building up culture when the Last Day was<br>

  Abstract: In dramatizing a frozen imagination and a sterilized world, Baudelaire’s rocklike formations crush the life from any belief in the spellbinding or “reenchanting” capabilities of lyric. Subjectivity turned to stone has also been linked (most notably in the wake of Benjamin’s reflections on Baudelaire) to another distinction—that between symbol and allegory in the aesthetics of poetic representation. In Baudelaire the petrified order of things signifies the death of the “symbol,” understood as the quasi-animistic, “living,” and embodying force of analogy and
                  correspondances, and a fall back into the disjunctive, broken sphere of the allegorical, where matter is but the<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2jbj4x">Information Systems Foundations: Constructing and Criticising</a><br>
  Author(s) Indulska Marta<br>
  Abstract: As techniques for conceptual modelling, enterprise modelling, and business process modelling have proliferated over the years (e.g. Olle et al., 1991), researchers and practitioners alike have attempted to determine objective bases on which to compare, evaluate, and determine when to use these different techniques (e.g. Karam and Casselman, 1993; Gorla et al., 1995) . However, throughout the 1980s, 1990s, and into the new millennium, it has become increasingly apparent to many researchers that without a theoretical foundation on which to base the specification for these various modelling techniques, incomplete evaluative frameworks of factors, features, and facets will continue to proliferate.<br>

                  inter vivos gifts) as well as upon gifts that operate only upon the donor′s death (testamentary gifts). Some of these constraints are readily comprehensible; for example, it makes sense that the law would seek to protect donors against improper exploitation by would-be donees. Other legal constraints upon gift giving, however, are more difficult to explain. Why is it, for example, the<br>

  Abstract: This paper develops two major themes of Mandaya social structure which operate at different levels of social and political activity. One of these principles or themes is the structure of hierarchy or precedence which operates primarily at the political level of leadership and warfare as it articulates the domination of the centre or points of origin to the periphery of social life. In this context the dominant expression of precedence is based on the political role of the

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2jbstq">Religion in Human Evolution</a><br>
  Abstract: Chapter 1 was about religion and ontogeny. It was not an effort to understand the development of religion in the life course of the individual, though that would be a valuable undertaking; instead its purpose was to look at human development as the acquisition of a series of capacities, all of which have contributed to the formation of religions. This chapter is about religion and phylogeny, religion in deep history. When did religion begin? If only among humans, were there earlier developments that made its emergence possible, even in other species, and that might help us understand it? If we<br>

  Abstract: It is with more than a little trepidation that I begin this chapter on India in the axial age. Of the four axial chapters, this is the one for which I was least prepared and had furthest to go with my research. In the case of ancient Israel, Greece, and China I had read the major primary texts in translation for most of my adult life and was aware of the major secondary literature. In preparing for those chapters I had to review much that I thought I knew and, in particular, do a lot of reading in recent secondary<br>

  Abstract: The fisherman has managed with his cunning ruse to trick the furious – and highly gullible – Sakhr back into the copper bottle and is walking back to the water’s edge to throw him back into the sea when, from within, the jinni pleads for his life. The fisherman sternly refuses, while the jinni promises him every blessing. ‘You are lying,’ says the fisherman. ‘Your promises are empty. You and I are like the vizier of King Yunan and Douban, the doctor. ‘Tell me how we’re like them,’ says the jinni, and so sparks the next story within a story<br>

  Abstract: Marouf the Cobbler’s life is made a misery by his wife, a harridan who subjects him to her whims and beats him when he fails to produce what she wants. He finds it hard to earn a living at his trade; nobody seems to have their shoes mended any more. One day, she demands that he bring her back a sweetmeat – shredded wheat drenched in wild honey. No work comes his way that day, but the baker takes pity on him and advances him the money he needs to buy the sweetmeat, nicely cooked in butter but steeped in<br>

There the boy studied, and made great progress. On his eighteenth birthday, however, he told his father he wanted to taste the world; he had acquired deep learning, but no experience of life.

  Abstract: The Mongols descended upon the world like a sudden thunder, a storm, a tsunami—and took the sedentary, sedate, civilized, and corrupted empires of the Seljuqids and the Abbasids, and beyond them the known and the unknowing world, by their throats. The Mongols hit like a vengeance—and in the fertile soil of blood and booty they shed and plundered and the ruins and fears they left behind, grew flowers—colorful, aromatic, deeply rooted, robust, and plentiful—of life and love and liberty and revolt and a renewed pact with humanity all before they had descended from their horses.

  Book Title: In Search of the Good Life-A Pedogogy for Troubled Times<br>
  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): DALLMAYR FRED<br>
  Abstract: The great German novelist Thomas Mann implored readers to resist the persistent and growing militarism of the mid-twentieth century. To whom should we turn for guidance during this current era of global violence, political corruption, economic inequality, and environmental degradation? For more than two millennia, the world's great thinkers have held that the ethically "good life" is the highest purpose of human existence. Renowned political philosopher Fred Dallmayr traces the development of this notion, finding surprising connections among Aristotelian ethics, Abrahamic and Eastern religious traditions, German idealism, and postindustrial social criticism. In Search of the Good Life does not offer a blueprint but rather invites readers on a cross-cultural quest. Along the way, the author discusses the teachings of Aristotle, Confucius, Nicolaus of Cusa, Leibniz, and Schiller, in addition invoking more recent writings of Gadamer and Ricoeur, as guideposts and sources of hope during our troubled times. Among contemporary themes Dallmayr discusses are the role of the classics in education, proper and improper ways of spreading democracy globally, the possibility of transnational citizenship, the problem of politicized evil, and the role of religion in our predominantly secular culture. Dallmayr restores the notion of the good life as a hallmark of personal conduct, civic virtue, and political engagement, and as the road map to enduring peace. In Search of the Good Life seeks to arouse complacent and dispirited citizens, guiding them out of the distractions of shallow amusements and perilous resentments in the direction of mutual learning and civic pedagogy -- a direction that will enable them to impose accountability on political leaders who stray from fundamental ethical standards.<br>

  Book Title: The Philosophy of Neo-Noir-  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Conard Mark T.<br>
  Abstract: Film noir is a classic genre characterized by visual elements such as tilted camera angles, skewed scene compositions, and an interplay between darkness and light. Common motifs include crime and punishment, the upheaval of traditional moral values, and a pessimistic stance on the meaning of life and on the place of humankind in the universe. Spanning the 1940s and 1950s, the classic film noir era saw the release of many of Hollywood's best-loved studies of shady characters and shadowy underworlds, including Double Indemnity, The Big Sleep, Touch of Evil, and The Maltese Falcon. Neo-noir is a somewhat loosely defined genre of films produced after the classic noir era that display the visual or thematic hallmarks of the noir sensibility. The essays collected in The Philosophy of Neo-Noir explore the philosophical implications of neo-noir touchstones such as Blade Runner, Chinatown, Reservoir Dogs, Memento, and the films of the Coen brothers. Through the lens of philosophy, Mark T. Conard and the contributors examine previously obscure layers of meaning in these challenging films. The contributors also consider these neo-noir films as a means of addressing philosophical questions about guilt, redemption, the essence of human nature, and problems of knowledge, memory and identity. In the neo-noir universe, the lines between right and wrong and good and evil are blurred, and the detective and the criminal frequently mirror each other's most debilitating personality traits. The neo-noir detective -- more antihero than hero -- is frequently a morally compromised and spiritually shaken individual whose pursuit of a criminal masks the search for lost or unattainable aspects of the self. Conard argues that the films discussed in The Philosophy of Neo-Noir convey ambiguity, disillusionment, and disorientation more effectively than even the most iconic films of the classic noir era. Able to self-consciously draw upon noir conventions and simultaneously subvert them, neo-noir directors push beyond the earlier genre's limitations and open new paths of cinematic and philosophical exploration.<br>

  Problems of Memory and Identity in Neo-Noir’s Existentialist Antihero from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2jcts3">The Philosophy of Neo-Noir</a><br>
  Author(s) Spicer Andrew<br>
  Abstract: One of the most arresting traits of film noir is its depiction of male protagonists who lack the qualities (courage, incorruptibility, tenacity, and dynamism) that characterize the archetypal American hero and who therefore function as antiheroes. Typical noir male protagonists are weak, confused, unstable, and ineffectual, damaged men who suffer from a range of psychological neuroses and who are unable to resolve the problems they face. Noir’s depiction of its male protagonists—what Frank Krutnik calls its “pervasive problematising of masculine identity”—is expressive of a fundamentally existentialist view of life.¹ As Robert Porfirio argues, noir’s “nonheroic hero” is such<br>

Noir, in Borde and Chaumeton’s view, is inextricable from the mood of disillusionment. As James Naremore describes their thinking about noir films: “Such pictures functioned as a critique of savage capitalism.”¹ This essay considers how the everyday, if unseen, compulsions of capitalism shape neo-noir and distinguish it from classic noir. Art may express the defining shape of its world, as Hegel teaches, but historical materialism reminds us that human life is conditioned by historically changing<br>

  Book Title: The Philosophy of Spike Lee-  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Conard Mark T.<br>
  Abstract: Over his twenty-plus year tenure in Hollywood, Spike Lee has produced a number of controversial films that unapologetically confront sensitive social issues, particularly those of race relations and discrimination. Through his honest portrayals of life's social obstacles, he challenges the public to reflect on the world's problems and divisions. The innovative director created a name for himself with feature films such as
         Do the Right Thing(1989) andMalcolm X(1992), and with documentaries such as4 Little Girls(1997) andWhen the Levees Broke(2006), breaking with Hollywood's reliance on cultural stereotypes to portray African Americans in a more realistic light. The director continues to produce poignant films that address some of modern society's most important historical movements and events.<br>

  Author(s) Pitter Robert<br>
  Abstract: Spike Lee is an accomplished filmmaker who drew much public attention following the release of his first feature films in the late 1980s.
                  School Daze(1988),Do the Right Thing(1989), andJungle Fever(1991), which he both wrote and directed, tell stories involving complex social, political, and philosophical issues. And they do this so effectively and provocatively that they generated significant controversy when they were first released, illustrating Lee’s skill at portraying the complexities of contemporary life on the big screen in a way that provokes serious and sometimes harmful misinterpretation. For example, several American media outlets opposed the<br>

  Author(s) Peterson Charles F.<br>
  Abstract: W. E. B. DuBois’s essay “Of Our Spiritual Strivings” provides one of the most revered articulations of Afri-US¹ psychoracial identity; even more, it stands, as I believe DuBois intended, as a statement on the very nature of U.S. citizenship. DuBois’s focus on the manner in which Afri-US (Negro) identity, citizenship, and social life were experienced as divided, antagonized, and marginal serves as a model for a new American urban sensibility. By the time “Of Our Spiritual Strivings” was published, the swelling ranks of the “tired . . . poor and huddled masses” that filled the cities of the United States<br>

  Abstract: Can someone else write my autobiography? The question challenges the conventional meaning of autobiography. And since writing an autobiography—in America, after Benjamin Franklin—often occurs with an awareness that the status of the work is bound up with the authority of its author, the notion of authorship also becomes troubled.¹ For instance, because an autobiography appears to be direct communication from its author, the very conditions of its presentation may suggest we are reading a true story, a mere record of what happened. Yet, like the life it aims to account for, autobiography is fashioned, a literary artifact, necessarily<br>

  Abstract: The principle of the common good holds considerable promise for improving life both in American society and globally, particularly when it is reinterpreted through the lens of women’s experience. It has become commonplace today to recognize that a significant cultural blinder in the United States is individualism, and that nation-states internationally are all too often guided by narrow national interests rather than what is best for the global community. The retrieved notion of the common good can serve as a necessary corrective, whether discussing health care policy, as this book has done, or other domestic social issues such as welfare<br>

  Book Title: Christianity in Evolution-An Exploration<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): MAHONEY JACK<br>
  Abstract: Evolution has provided a new understanding of reality, with revolutionary consequences for Christianity. In an evolutionary perspective the incarnation involved God entering the evolving human species to help it imitate the trinitarian altruism in whose image it was created and counter its tendency to self-absorption. Primarily, however, the evolutionary achievement of Jesus was to confront and overcome death in an act of cosmic significance, ushering humanity into the culminating stage of its evolutionary destiny, the full sharing of God's inner life. Previously such doctrines as original sin, the fall, sacrifice, and atonement stemmed from viewing death as the penalty for sin and are shown not only to have serious difficulties in themselves, but also to emerge from a Jewish culture preoccupied with sin and sacrifice that could not otherwise account for death. The death of Jesus on the cross is now seen as saving humanity, not from sin, but from individual extinction and meaninglessness. Death is now seen as a normal process that affect all living things and the religious doctrines connected with explaining it in humans are no longer required or justified. Similar evolutionary implications are explored affecting other subjects of Christian belief, including the Church, the Eucharist, priesthood, and moral behavior.<br>

  Abstract: Narratives are fundamental to our lives: we dream, plan, complain, endorse, entertain, teach, learn, and reminisce through telling stories. They provide hopes, enhance or mitigate disappointments, challenge or support moral order and test out theories of the world at both personal and communal levels. It is because of this deep embedding of narrative in everyday life that its study has become a wide research field including disciplines as diverse as linguistics, literary theory, folklore, clinical psychology, cognitive and developmental psychology, anthropology, sociology, and history. In
      Telling Storiesleading scholars illustrate how narratives build bridges among language, identity, interaction, society, and culture; and they investigate various settings such as therapeutic and medical encounters, educational environments, politics, media, marketing, and public relations. They analyze a variety of topics from the narrative construction of self and identity to the telling of stories in different media and the roles that small and big life stories play in everyday social interactions and institutions. These new reflections on the theory and analysis of narrative offer the latest tools to researchers in the fields of discourse analysis and sociolinguistics.<br>

  Book Title: The Sexual Person-Toward a Renewed Catholic Anthropology<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Lawler Michael G.<br>
  Abstract: Two principles capture the essence of the official Catholic position on the morality of sexuality: first, that any human genital act must occur within the framework of heterosexual marriage; second, each and every marriage act must remain open to the transmission of life. In this comprehensive overview of Catholicism and sexuality, theologians Todd A. Salzman and Michael G. Lawler examine and challenge these principles. Remaining firmly within the Catholic tradition, they contend that the church is being inconsistent in its teaching by adopting a dynamic, historically conscious anthropology and worldview on social ethics and the interpretation of scripture while adopting a static, classicist anthropology and worldview on sexual ethics. While some documents from Vatican II, like
      Gaudium et spes("the marital act promotes self-giving by which spouses enrich each other"), gave hope for a renewed understanding of sexuality, the church has not carried out the full implications of this approach. In short, say Salzman and Lawler: emphasize relationships, not acts, and recognize Christianity's historically and culturally conditioned understanding of human sexuality.The Sexual Persondraws historically, methodologically, and anthropologically from the best of Catholic tradition and provides a context for current theological debates between traditionalists and revisionists regarding marriage, cohabitation, homosexuality, reproductive technologies, and what it means to be human. This daring and potentially revolutionary book will be sure to provoke constructive dialogue among theologians, and between theologians and the Magisterium.<br>

  Abstract: HUMAN BEINGS are historical creatures. We not only live within time, like all things, but we also construct the meaning 
                  of time through stories, rituals, traditions, and cultures. Present experience aims toward anticipated futures and is interpreted through the lenses of understandings and beliefs from the past. Children demonstrate this historicity of human life acutely. No child chooses the inherited languages and mores that already shape the structures of their lives and thinking from birth. But every child interprets these conditions in new ways for themselves and in relation to their own open and unfolding futures. However diverse human histories<br>

  Abstract: THE IDEAS OF THE previous three chapters have implications for any area of moral life. In the following three chapters I offer but three examples. The application of theory to practice is not a one-way street: theory sheds light on action just as understanding action changes theory—in a hermeneutical circle, as it were.

  Abstract: HUMAN BEINGS are historical creatures. We not only live within time, like all things, but we also construct the meaning 
                  of time through stories, rituals, traditions, and cultures. Present experience aims toward anticipated futures and is interpreted through the lenses of understandings and beliefs from the past. Children demonstrate this historicity of human life acutely. No child chooses the inherited languages and mores that already shape the structures of their lives and thinking from birth. But every child interprets these conditions in new ways for themselves and in relation to their own open and unfolding futures. However diverse human histories<br>

  Abstract: THE IDEAS OF THE previous three chapters have implications for any area of moral life. In the following three chapters I offer but three examples. The application of theory to practice is not a one-way street: theory sheds light on action just as understanding action changes theory—in a hermeneutical circle, as it were. However, if the ethics of childhood calls for anything, it calls for addressing moral relations not only abstractly but also in their practical concreteness.<br>

  Abstract: Does anyone ever really change?¹ Religions tend to answer this question with an emphatic yes. And it does seem that religions can transform people: Some believers become selfless servants of the poor, or even suicide bombers. But how and why might this happen? Similar circumstances push people in quite different ways; “good intentions” alone are not sufficient for real conversion to some demanding new form of life. This book focuses on how ethical and religious commitments are conceived, articulated, and nurtured through methodical practices that guide aspirants through alternative territories of sin and salvation, ignorance and wisdom, or suffering and<br>

  CHAPTER FOUR  Broken Images of the Divine from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2tt78n">Overcoming Our Evil</a><br>
  Abstract: Rather than providing a supposedly static summary, much of the best contemporary work on Augustine carefully traces the development of his thought, often correlating it to events in his life.¹ One great virtue of this approach is that it maps the changes in his views over time, illuminating every contour and ridge of his evolving conceptions, and thereby aids a more precise grappling with his ideas. Another virtue is suitability to Augustine’s thought itself, which “proceeds by way of ceaseless inquiry”² and is preserved in a vast collection of writings, almost all of which were provoked by particular circumstantial needs<br>

  Abstract: We have adopted the hypothesis of a psychical apparatus extended in space, appropriately constructed, developed by the exigencies of life, which gives rise to the phenomena of consciousness only at one particular point and under certain conditions.

  Abstract: Freud’s colossal prejudices, in Wittgenstein’s view, all stem from three underlying assumptions of Freudian theory which he implicitly or explicitly contests. The first of these is psychic determinism, which Freud himself regularly presented as a constitutive preconception that could not be questioned. As Sulloway writes: “Freud’s entire life’s work in science was characterized by an abiding faith in the notion that all vital phenomena, including psychical ones, are rigidly and lawfully determined by the principle of cause and effect” (

  Abstract: It is commonly agreed that we live in an age of globalization, but the profound consequences of this development are rarely understood. Usually, globalization is equated with the expansion of economic and financial markets and the proliferation of global networks of communication. In truth, much more is at stake: Traditional concepts of individual and national identity as well as perceived relationships between the self and others are undergoing profound change. Every town has become a potential cosmopolis -- an international city -- affecting the way that people conceptualize the relationship between public order and political practice.<br>

They have explained his numerous "false stories," particularly those about military honors he actually never earned and war wounds he never sustained, with psychopathological imposture-theories.

  Author(s) Baker Houston A.<br>
  Abstract: Analyzing William Faulkner’s relationship to contemporaries is an expansive chore. His life covered more than sixty years and found him traveling abroad and cross regionally in the United States, joining convivial associates in New York, New Orleans, Paris, and Los Angeles. To ask of his contemporaries, therefore, requires selectivity. If we look to Faulkner’s earlier contemporaries—or better, influences—we discover a poetical Faulkner under the tutelage of his friend and first mentor Phil Stone. At Stone’s urging, Faulkner apprenticed himself to romantic and late-romantic poets such as Keats and Shelley, Aubrey Beardsley, and Algernon Swinburne. By the 1920s, however,<br>

  Author(s) SELZER LINDA<br>
  Abstract: If historically the line between fiction and philosophy has often been blurred—as Plato’s dialogues, Nietzsche’s aphorisms, and the twentieth-century proliferation of existentialist literature in a number of genres all attest—this is especially true in the case of African American philosophy, which by necessity in America has had its roots in nonacademic forms of writing. As John P. Pittman points out in
                  African American Perspectives and Philosophical Traditions(1997), to define philosophy only in terms of a specialist discourse is to leave out “an entire world of intellectual life, and for traditionally excluded groups, any ‘representation’ at all” (xii).<br>

The response to Johnson’s 1998 novel,Dreamer, could well be the same: the novel announces a dramatic shift in Johnson’s primary concerns, in terms of the aesthetics, the politics, and the philosophical dilemmas that the novel engages. Most strikingly,Dreamerreveals a new religious investigation for Johnson, one that both complements and complicates his earlier explorations of spirituality and the ethical life. The radical difference ofDreameris first suggested in the epigraphs that open the novel:<br>

  Abstract: When a biblical scholar such as N. T. Wright, a confessing Christian with a deserved reputation for theological depth, faults Patristic and medieval theology for a distortion of the biblical portrait of God, his argument deserves attention from theologians.¹ This is even more the case when his view corresponds to a movement in Protestant (Barth, Moltmann) and Catholic (Mühlen, Balthasar) Trinitarian theology to employ the Paschal mystery of Jesus Christ as the fundamental datum for speculation into the life of the Trinity.² Anne Hunt, in her study of this theological movement, speaks for many of these theologians in arguing that<br>

  Author(s) Leget Carlo<br>
  Abstract: The concept of “life” is without any doubt a key word in both Aquinas’s theology and the Gospel of St. John. This can easily be shown as regards both statistics and content.¹ In this essay I will address two questions. The first question is how Thomas deals with this concept in his 
                  Commentary on St. John. In answering this question I will refer to other works of Aquinas where he deals with the concept of “life” and show how these interrelate. The second question concerns the way Aquinas’s exegesis relates to doing theology at the threshold of the third millennium.<br>

  Abstract: Why is it that some people accept Christ as the Son of God and their Savior and others do not? Why is it that some respond to evangelization and others do not? Certainly, sometimes inadequate knowledge or unpersuasive arguments make an evangelizer ineffective. Perhaps the evangelizer’s own life is not a model of what he is preaching and thus his teaching is unattractive. But when Christ is the evangelizer, none of these negatives could possibly apply. Is there any explanation why some recognize Christ for who he is when they are invited to “Come and see” and others do not?<br>

  Abstract: John 6 offers a unique view of Jesus Christ. It begins with a miracle of the loaves and fishes, continues with a miracle of Jesus walking on water, and then culminates with the bread of life discourse. Almost all biblical scholars and theologians recognize some connection between the miraculous multiplication of physical bread and the subsequent discourse on the bread of life. But what is the character of that living bread come down from heaven? Is the bread of life simply equivalent to Jesus’ wisdom from on high, or is it the Eucharistic flesh of Jesus?

  Abstract: Everyday life can be problematic. Whether simple or difficult, the challenges we face raise questions. At some point our questioning of life leads to what Lonergan calls “ultimate questions.” Such questions seek insight into the meaning of life, the reason things are the way they are, whether things can improve, and how improvements might be made. Those who pursue such questions with rigor eventually seek insight into the ultimate origin and end of existence. Put in traditional Christian terms, life leads us to questions about the universe, about God, and about God’s relation to the universe as its creator and<br>

  Abstract: One premise of this essay is that freedoms of speech and religion are necessary means for each human person to pursue what she holds as the ultimate purpose and meaning of her life. In other words, people tend to link the value of rights such as freedoms of speech and religion to the purpose for which they are asserting those rights rather than to affirm them for their independent abstract value. This does not mean that entitlement to the right should be made conditional upon satisfying some commonly preconceived purpose of free speech or authoritatively sanctioned meaning of the religion<br>

  Abstract: Is the notion of tradition applicable to all cultural phenomena, both secular and religious? Or is it to be associated especially with religious phenomena? We speak very easily of both cultural and religious traditions, and in general we tend to contrast a “traditioned” mode of life with a “modern” mode of life that is seen as having emanated from the West. “Tradition” as a category then appears to be at once global, ecumenical, and nostalgic. It is seen in contrast to the “modern,” which—though contemporary and now global—is also regarded as parochial because of its specifically European lineage.<br>

  Book Title: Troubling Natural Categories-Engaging the Medical Anthropology of Margaret Lock<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): KIELMANN KARINA<br>
  Abstract: Where do our conventional understandings of health, illness, and the body stem from? What makes them authoritative? How are the boundaries set around these areas of life unsettled in the changing historical and political contexts of science, technology, and health care delivery? These questions are at the heart of Troubling Natural Categories, a collection of essays honouring the tradition of Margaret Lock, one of the preeminent medical anthropologists of our time. Throughout her career, Lock has investigated how medicine sets boundaries around what is deemed "normal" and "natural," and how, in turn, these ideas shape our technical and moral understandings of life, sickness, and death. In this book, nine established medical anthropologists - all former students of Lock - critically engage with her work, offering ethnographic and historical analyses that problematize taken-for-granted constructs in health and medicine in a range of global settings. The essays elaborate cutting-edge themes within medical anthropology, including the often disturbing, inherently political nature of biomedicine and biotechnology, the medicalization of mental health processes, and the formation of uniquely "local biologies" through the convergence of bodily experience, scientific discourse, and new technologies of care. Troubling Natural Categories not only affirms Margaret Lock's place at the forefront of scholarship but, with these essays, carves out new intellectual directions in the medical social sciences. Contributors include Sean Brotherton, Vinh-Kim Nguyen, Junko Kitanaka, Stephanie Lloyd, Dominique Behague, and Annette Leibing.<br>

  Abstract: Margaret Lock’s path-breaking scholarship on the anthropology of the body, spanning her earlier work on demystifying the assumptions of the natural body to more recent work on the commodification of bodily life and the materiality of the body, has set a foundational precedent in medical anthropology for critically reworking the relationship between dominant ideologies and the lived experience of bodies (Lock 1993a; 1993b; 1997; 2002; Lock and Schepher-Hughes 1987). Buttressed by rich ethnographic research in both Japan and North America, and with an acute attention to social theory, Lock’s comparative methodology has been pivotal in challenging the takenfor-granted notion of<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32b7ds">Genuine Multiculturalism</a><br>
  Abstract: In a common-sense way, the maxims at the start of the previous chapter capture a contradiction immanent to life. Their irony gives them a generalized truth that is not always the case, while they remind us that we always face the certainty of despair and hope – often from the same source. Despair and hope are dialectical, for they can be opposing, and at times even complementary, parts of the same whole. The sayings also speak to the possibility of change for the better or the worse and to how every thought and act appear pregnant with the possibility of producing<br>

  8  Canada: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32b7ds">Genuine Multiculturalism</a><br>
  Abstract: Historically, official multiculturalism in Canada emerged in the early 1970s out of the frustration of various groups trying to determine whether they should all exist according to Anglo conformity, Franco conformity, or no conformity at all.² In the end, they chose none at all – or so we hear, for there are many people who still argue that life in multicultural Canada is an exercise in conformity to the ideals of either a Franco or an Anglo mainstream, or to a hybridized Anglo-French culture.<br>

  10  Crisis 2001: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32b7ds">Genuine Multiculturalism</a><br>
  Abstract: Immigration, including the role of immigrants in Canadian culture, became a national issue by the summer of 2001, when Statistics Canada reported an ethnic and demographic makeover under way. The impact was analogous to the point in Hegelian analysis when Eve had to teach the facts of life to a rationalist and self-centred Adam, an archetypal Bad John. Just like the exemplary Adam, Canada was coming to know itself as a tragic hero: it was ageing and dying but wanted to live forever. As a self-consciousness, it had to realize that it was ultimately a

These challenges set high stakes for ensuring theory and practice are well matched and oriented toward social flourishing.

  Abstract: Bearing witness is an ethical act. Whether a person bears truthful witness or false witness, the act involves moral agency. Choosing to testify to an experience or event that others, or the established narrative of a culture, may contest may alter the rest of a person’s life. Witnessing is not without cost to both the agent bearing witness and also possibly to the audiences, the secondary witnesses hearing or observing the testimony. Therefore, deciding to bear or not bear witness has moral and cultural significance. Consider the example of two British journalists working in Soviet Russia and the moral and<br>

  CHAPTER 2  Art and the Notation of Community from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32b997">Art and Its Uses in Thomas Mann's 'Felix Krull'</a><br>
  Abstract: Much has been written about the structural dichotomy of 
                  Bürger and Künstler in the early works of Thomas Mann. In this early phase, the Künstler, as the representative of Geist, finds himself isolated from, and opposed to, the coarse realities of bourgeois life (Leben); and the possibility of conciliation between these two spheres appears remote. By the time Mann came to write the autobiographical Tonio Kröger (1903), however, he was beginning to realize that this opposition was too simplistic, and that a person could contain both types within himself. Tonio Kröger is both artist and ‘verirrter Bürger’ (VIII, 305), torn<br>

  CONCLUSION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32b997">Art and Its Uses in Thomas Mann's 'Felix Krull'</a><br>
  Abstract: The main argument of this book is that, in 
                  Felix Krull, art and aesthetics are shown to be central to the life of the mind and to the life of society. The Müller-Rosé episode offers a paradigm of how art works: not as an imposed illusion, but as a mutually agreed, deliberate pretence.¹ The crucial point of this episode is that art is not a deception, but an imaginative exchange which relies upon an intersubjective arrangement. Müller-Rosé requires the ‘stillschweigende[s] Einverständnis’ (294) of his audience in order to succeed. Mann, like Coleridge, is advocating a willing suspension of disbelief,² in<br>

  Author(s) Roberts Patricia<br>
  Abstract: A recurrent issue in the study of public discourse is whether a public sphere might be so constituted as to be both free and liberatory: free in the sense that it would be perfectly inclusive; liberatory in that it would enable participants to identify and critique coercion in institutions. Jürgen Habermas’s lifelong project might best be understood as an attempt to define the characteristics of a sphere with both such qualities, as well as to argue the feasibility of attaining it. The recent translation of Habermas’s early book,

  Abstract: When I think about the politics of speech and writing, I return again and again to the final scene in Akira Kurosawa’s movie
                  Ran, or “chaos,” which contemplates, among many other things, the fragmentation of social life in postmodernity. Kurosawa shows us a man in the fading light, bent forward on his staff at the edge of an enormous cliff. This man, really a boy, cannot see that the sun is going down because he can no longer see anything, having lost his eyes in a dynastic struggle that left most of his family dead. Nor can he know that<br>

  Abstract: Consider, for just one moment Jackson Pollock’s 
                  Cut-Out of 1948–1950. Don’t flip to look at a reproduction. Instead, and perhaps more appropriately, conjure it in your mind. For though Pollock’s Cut-Out is a painting, it is a work from which the center, the figure, has quite literally been excised, extinguished, a work with nothing more at its core than a ghostly trace, figuration as corpse. Emptied of its bodily fullness, its corporeality, its life, Cut-Out leaves us with nothing other than figuration as a hollow shell, a specter which can only haunt abstraction.

  Abstract: DURING THE YEARS SHE LIVED IN AMERICA, HANNAH Arendt seldom spoke about her childhood. Long before the last of her relatives had left the family’s home in Königsberg, East Prussia, and the city had been destroyed by bombs and rebuilt as Kaliningrad, USSR, she had divided her life into “Then” and “Now” several times. With each division, the first Then, childhood, became a more secret, private matter. When she was eighteen and a student of theology at Marburg University, she made her temporal divisions in the poetic language of her teacher Martin Heidegger: “No longer” and “Not yet.” As she<br>

They celebrated 8 May 1945 with champagne and hoped that a new life would come to the country that Hannah Arendt admitted was the only one she felt homesick for in America. Letters from France had been few and far between in the last two years of the war, and Arendt had waited eagerly for what she always called

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bm6t">Passage to Modernity</a><br>
  Abstract: The modern age was the first to distinguish itself from all others by a time indicator:
                  modo—“now.” Anxious to assert its superiority to past epochs, its culture exchanged the older claim of upholding a tradition for the one of surpassing it. A different sense of time directly followed the new sense of freedom. An unprecedented awareness grew that what humans accomplish in the transitoriness of time definitively changes the very nature of human life. History thereby suddenly acquired an existential significance that it had not possessed before. In a medieval cosmic play the human person clearly had the lead,<br>

  Abstract: The analysis of the relationship between history and fiction—a problem that has stimulated European thought since the time of Aristotle, was developed by Vico, and then elaborated in structural and post-structural theory—has special relevance in the Russian context in general and for the study of Pushkin in particular. The beginning of the nineteenth century was a turning point in the development of both Russian literary and historical imagination. This was the time of artistic experimentation, when old genres were rethought and new ones proliferated. The Romanticist interest in history generated an intense growth in historical fiction and history<br>

According to Vladimir Dal’, Pushkin was so preoccupied with the image of Peter the Great that he sought to portray him both in fictional and non-fictional genres and considered this one of the main tasks of his life.

  Book Title: Metaphysics in Ordinary Language-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Rosen Stanley<br>
  Abstract: In this rich collection of philosophical writings, Stanley Rosen addresses a wide range of topics-from eros, poetry, and freedom to problems like negation and the epistemological status of sense perception. Though diverse in subject, Rosen's essays share two unifying principles: there can be no legitimate separation of textual hermeneutics from philosophical analysis, and philosophical investigation must be oriented in terms of everyday language and experience, although it cannot simply remain within these confines. Ordinary experience provides a minimal criterion for the assessment of extraordinary discourses, Rosen argues, and without such a criterion we would have no basis for evaluating conflicting discourses: philosophy would give way to poetry.Philosophical problems are not so deeply embedded in a specific historical context that they cannot be restated in terms as valid for us today as they were for those who formulated them, the author maintains. Rosen shows that the history of philosophy-a story of conflicting interpretations of human life and the structure of intelligibility-is a story that comes to life only when it is rethought in terms of the philosophical problems of our own personal and historical situation.<br>

  Abstract: The passage from Stendhal that serves as our motto is recorded by Nietzsche in a notebook entry dating from 1887–88.¹ It expresses a theme that fascinates Nietzsche at all stages of his productive life. The most powerful statement of that theme occurs in paragraph 30 of
                  Beyond Good and Evil, as part of the climax of Nietzsche’s account of the distance that separates the exceptional human being from the multitude (par. 26–30): “Our highest insights must—and should—sound like follies, perhaps like crimes, when in an impermissible manner they reach ears which are not suited or predetermined<br>

  Chapter 8  Sad Reason from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bsjw">Metaphysics in Ordinary Language</a><br>
  Abstract: I trust that the title I have chosen is not too melancholy. The topic is a large one, but it is certainly familiar to all of us, and it is difficult to see how anything could be of greater concern to thoughtful human beings. The question before us is whether the life of reason is happy or sad. Those who dislike large topics might be inclined to reply, “Sometimes sad, sometimes happy,” and I suppose they would mean by this that happiness depends upon something other than our degree of rationality. In one sense, I agree with this sober reply.<br>

  Chapter 13  Philosophy and Ordinary Experience from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bsjw">Metaphysics in Ordinary Language</a><br>
  Abstract: I propose to deal with the question of the relation between philosophy and ordinary experience. This sounds quite straightforward, but I am afraid that it is actually an unusually difficult problem. It is a striking fact of our century that philosophy has become increasingly concerned with ordinary experience, ordinary language, everyday life, or the life-world, to cite four often-used expressions. This concern is evident in both wings of the two major contemporary philosophical movements, which are popularly if inaccurately designated as the analytical and the continental or phenomenological schools. Interest in everyday or ordinary language has clearly been stimulated by<br>

  12  Consciousness as Time from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32btm9">On the Nature of Consciousness</a><br>
  Abstract: We have begun to consider consciousness in terms of its “with” — as the socially shared forms of awareness in self-referential symbolic beings. In addition, since symbolic cognition reuses the here-there, whence-whither dimensions of the array, this human “with” extends into the envelope of flow shared by all sentient motile beings. It remains to turn our attention back toward the “in” of consciousness. Human consciousness is inseparable from a being-in-the-world. The life worlds of sentient creatures are also “in” the physical universe as understood by modern physical science. Accordingly, we would expect the being of sentient creatures to be broadly<br>

  Abstract: Every psychoanalyst of some clinical experience is aware of apparently unpromising analytic situations that turned out well and of analyses that began favorably but ended badly. Often, with benefit of hindsight, it is possible to identify sources of strength or weakness that were not recognized at the outset. Examples of such situations include barely mentioned but psychologically lifesaving relationships in the patient’s early childhood, or disturbances of thinking not manifest in the initial consultation. The analyst’s particular unresolved conflicts that lead to countertransference interferences may impede the ability to work with otherwise promising patients. Sometimes the reasons for unexpected outcomes<br>

A century of clinical experience has taught us much about the fate of different kinds of cases, the clinical management of the array of patients who consult psychoanalysts, the scope and limitations of the psychoanalytic method, and the qualities of patients that make them suitable or unsuited for psychoanalysis.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32c046">The Future of the Biblical Past</a><br>
  Author(s) Andiñach Pablo R.<br>
  Abstract: A combination of social changes, the political climate, and various incipient new winds in the life of the Christian churches supplied the fertile ground in which a new mode of reading the Scriptures began to germinate. Around 1970, the need for other tools with which to understand the Christian mission became evident in Latin America, and what would later come to be called the Theology of Liberation was born, a different way of approaching theological reflection. Alongside this theology, as faithful companion, an alternative way of interpreting the Bible came to be, as well. This is what Juan Luis Segundo<br>

  Abstract: The Jewish communities of al-Andalus—the part of the Iberian Peninsula under Muslim rule—were particularly illustrious between the reign of the Umayyad caliph of Cordova ‘Abd al- Rahman III (912–961) and the Almohad takeover after 1140. No other medieval Jewish community had so many high-ranking personalities in the political and economic spheres; no other produced a literary culture of such breadth, revealing an intellectual life shared with the Muslims. That blossoming was all the more unexpected in that the Jews of Hispania had lived in great social and legal insecurity during the time of the Visigoths, when they<br>

  Abstract: Apart from its plurality, the image of the Israeli in Palestinian literature is noteworthy for its evolution in concert with historical events. In addition, the writers—the talented ones at least—approach and describe this image without any racist or discriminatory projections. Above all, they present a nuanced image, dependent on the level and nature of the relations between the two camps: between the Palestinians and the Israeli authority, for example, or between individuals in everyday life within mixed populations and mixed organizations, such as Maki, the political party that unites Jewish and Arab Communists.

  Jewish and Muslim Charity in the Middle Ages: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fgz64">A History of Jewish-Muslim Relations</a><br>
  Author(s) Lev Yaacov<br>
  Abstract: Christianity, Judaism, and Islam consider the three “theological virtues” of faith, hope, and charity to be the foundational stones of their value systems. Contrary to what some may think, charity is as essential to Jewish and Islamic life as it is to the Christian worldview. Between pure generosity and social redistribution, it deeply structures traditional societies by defining the respective roles of the rich and the poor, the use of money, and the legitimacy of the institutions that have taken up the task to collect and redistribute it.<br>

  Abstract: The Andalusian philosophical milieu of the Middle Ages holds the key to understanding the dual transmission of knowledge between East and West at that time. First, the centers of cultural life under the Abassids communicated their knowledge to Andalusia (tenth to twelfth centuries). Shortly thereafter, philosophical works from Andalusia were dispersed to the major intellectual centers of Christian Europe. Because of this dual movement of cultural transfer, Arabic Spain was the site of one of the most significant historical moments in terms of scientific exchanges and the development of ideas.

  Abstract: Jews have lived in Iran for almost three millennia and became profoundly acculturated to many aspects of Iranian life. This phenomenon is particularly manifest in the literary sphere, defined here broadly to include belles lettres, as well as nonbelletristic (i.e., historical, philosophical, and polemical) writings. Although Iranian Jews spoke many local dialects and some peculiar Jewish dialects, such as the hybrid lo- Torah[i] (Heb. + Pers. suffix of abstraction), meaning “non-Torahic” (a dialect that combines both Semitic [Hebrew and Aramaic] and Persian elements), their written, literary language was Judeo-Persian (Farsi in Hebrew script), which was close to the

  Abstract: Family life, among Jews and Muslims, carried forward many cultural features that were widespread in the Middle East since antiquity. The specifics of each society also reflected the impact of the two religions as these evolved over time. The norms and practice of family life entailed ongoing adjustment among taken-for-granted lifestyles, explicit values, and canonized written sources. A systematic comparison between biblical and Qurʾanic prescriptions, or between
                  fiqhandhalakha, would far exceed the boundaries of this article. We will thus limit ourselves to an anthropological outlook on the shared cultural values between Jews and Muslims concerning family life, as<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fgz64">A History of Jewish-Muslim Relations</a><br>
  Author(s) Bahloul Joëlle<br>
  Abstract: Over the some twelve centuries that the Jews and the Muslims lived together in the Mediterranean world and the Near East, relations between the two communities were nowhere so dense and reciprocal as in the leisurely routines of everyday life. This rich relationship between two religious communities with a turbulent history has not been documented as meticulously as their hostile relations and their segregation. The colonial period in the Maghreb, which lasted until the 1950s, was emblematic of these everyday exchanges. In analyzing Judeo-Muslim cultural and social relationships as they were expressed in the Jewish diet and Jewish cuisine in<br>

  Translating History from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fgz7m">Nation, Language, and the Ethics of Translation</a><br>
  Author(s) BERMANN SANDRA<br>
  Abstract: René Char’s “Feuillets d’Hypnos” brings before us the lived history of the French resistance, joining traumatic memory with hopes for a future of freedom and human dialogue. Closely intertwined with Char’s own actions as captain on the maquis, the collection of prose poems offers a rare engagement with historical experience in poetic form, both a tragic affirmation of life and, in its own right, a means of resistance. But I also argue here that this example of historical poetry illustrates some important connections between the writing of lived historical event and translation. Both are linguistic acts dedicated to the “survival”<br>

  Book Title: Homo Narrans-The Poetics and Anthropology of Oral Literature<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Niles John D.<br>
  Abstract: It would be difficult to imagine what human life would be like without stories-from myths recited by Pueblo Indian healers in the kiva, ballads sung in Slovenian market squares, folktales and legends told by the fireside in Italy, to jokes told at a dinner table in Des Moines-for it is chiefly through storytelling that people possess a past. In
      Homo NarransJohn D. Niles explores how human beings shape their world through the stories they tell. The book vividly weaves together the study of Anglo-Saxon literature and culture with the author's own engagements in the field with some of the greatest twentieth-century singers and storytellers in the Scottish tradition. Niles ponders the nature of the storytelling impulse, the social function of narrative, and the role of individual talent in oral tradition. His investigation of the poetics of oral narrative encompasses literary works, such as the epic poems and hymns of early Greece and the Anglo-SaxonBeowulf, texts that we know only through written versions but that are grounded in oral technique. That all forms of narrative, even the most sophisticated genres of contemporary fiction, have their ultimate origin in storytelling is a point that scarcely needs to be argued. Niles's claims here are more ambitious: that oral narrative is and has long been the chief basis of culture itself, that the need to tell stories is what distinguishes humans from all other living creatures.<br>

  Book Title: Shelter Blues-Sanity and Selfhood Among the Homeless<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Desjarlais Robert<br>
  Abstract: Desjarlais shows us not anonymous faces of the homeless but real people.While it is estimated that 25 percent or more of America's homeless are mentally ill, their lives are largely unknown to us. What must life be like for those who, in addition to living on the street, hear voices, suffer paranoid delusions, or have trouble thinking clearly or talking to others.
      Shelter Bluesis an innovative portrait of people residing in Boston's Station Street Shelter. It examines the everyday lives of more than 40 homeless men and women, both white and African-American, ranging in age from early 20s to mid-60s. Based on a sixteen-month study, it draws readers into the personal worlds of these individuals and, by addressing the intimacies of homelessness, illness, and abjection, picks up where most scholarship and journalism stops.Robert Desjarlais works against the grain of media representations of homelessness by showing us not anonymous stereotypes but individuals. He draws on conversations as well as observations, talking with and listening to shelter residents to understand how they relate to their environment, to one another, and to those entrusted with their care. His book considers their lives in terms of a complex range of forces and helps us comprehend the linkages between culture, illness, personhood, and political agency on the margins of contemporary American society.Shelter Bluesis unlike anything else ever written about homelessness. It challenges social scientists and mental health professionals to rethink their approaches to human subjectivity and helps us all to better understand one of the most pressing problems of our time.<br>

  Abstract: Thinkers like Foucault, who emphasize the priority of cultural discourses in shaping our lives, tend to speak of incarnations of self or power as generic to an age. Yet while such approaches are useful in mapping forms of mind and personhood specific to historical periods and sometimes show how these forms take shape in everyday life, they seldom consider how the stuff of personhood is built out of the events and doings of everyday life. They also tend to neglect the plurality of forces that occasion diverse ways of being at any moment within a society. To rectify this tendency<br>

  Abstract: Despite their dangers, the walls protected those within them. Many found refuge in the building from the streets, the police, and the potential violence of everyday life. It sometimes seemed as if each person heeded a distinct geography of fear and safety. Wendy Dyer, for instance, told me one day that she only felt comfortable “in this building and around it.” She was particularly frightened of East Boston, where her ex-boyfriend lived. When I asked Julie Mason what she took to be safe places to stay, she named the shelter, the building, and Virginia: “People don’t die in Virginia. Here<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fhjmz">Shelter Blues</a><br>
  Abstract: Although the shelter was very much founded in a conversation-based reality, the social life there was such that people enjoyed contact and quick exchanges with others but tended not to sit down and participate in extensive conversations. To “sit with” someone was to engage in a long and stationary conversation, usually while seated at a table in the common room or television room. More incidental socioeconomic exchanges typically took place on foot, which enabled one to “stand away,” if necessary, when asking for things. Some preferred not to sit with others: “I don’t sit with anyone,” Peter said; “I don’t<br>

  Abstract: Questions such as Carla’s and Sylvia’s pointed to another side of many utterances in the shelter. This was a tendency to bemoan some aspect of one’s life. The larger realities of many shelter lives, which were spent in and out of hospitals, psychiatrists’ offices, and halfway houses, help to explain the use-value of complaints. Complaints typically rode on the first person singular: the “I” was plaintive. They often alluded to some private feeling or personal trouble, but primarily for practical reasons: by noting a pain or oppression, the complaints could effect a reality to which one’s audience might feel compelled<br>

  Abstract: So, too, is reason. In the shelter at least, ideas of truth, reason, sincerity, and responsibility were not foundational in any sense. They owed their strength to political concerns and pragmatic effects, and served as tropes in the lives of staff and residents alike. Paul Rabinow notes that sociologies of scientific practices “have sought (with some success) to lower-case the abstractions of Science, Reason, Truth and Society.”¹ Reflections on a commonplace but perhaps less well understood kind of reasoning—reasoning that takes form in everyday life—might enable us to similarly lower-case reason, intimate its cultural and political features, and<br>

  How to Do Things with Feeling from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fhjmz">Shelter Blues</a><br>
  Abstract: In the State Service Center, feeling was ensconced in rhetoric. The shelter was a place for all things psychological. A great deal of talk involved comments on or indications of states of feeling—such as when Carla said, “I just feel wretched. I really do,” at a group meeting. Although I did not keep count, overt references to feelings seemed more numerous in the shelter than in most other contexts. The high frequency of glossings had a lot to do with the fact that shelter life evolved around therapeutic care. Niko Besnier points out that “in probably all speech communities,<br>

  Abstract: The future of Jewish-American literature has been a controversial issue for some time. It goes back at least to the publication of Philip Roth’s

Howe suggested that, since for a younger writer like Roth memories of the Jewish-immigrant culture and way of life were fading, “[i] t is possible that [his book] signifies ... the closing of an arc of American Jewish experience”<br>

King’s Coyote—denizen of a vast number of American Indian stories including King’s novel, Green Grass, Running Water—wanders through each of the works in the collection and even leaves “Coyote tracks,” in the form of graphic images, throughout the white spaces in the text that conventionally separate one story from another.

  Abstract: The increased earning power of women in the economic market is introducing fundamental changes in ritual life and the social values it expresses. The Moroccan bride negotiates between relations of reciprocity (between two families who are merging their destinies by mingling their bloods) and relations of commodity, expressed in the bride’s ability to “make good” and goods in the material economy. Ritual, in representing an intensification of social relations and values, provides a potent example of social change. The bride may still be considered a gift between families, but her packaging has changed considerably; and the packaging affects the contents,<br>

Rather, the study illuminates how incremental changes leading to larger paradigm shifts take place discursively and in relation to the marketplace, indicated by subtle transformations of both speech genres and larger conceptual categories.<br>

  Abstract: Psychology, the study of the soul, held a particular fascination for Avicenna. That the subject clearly lies near the heart of his concern for philosophy is indicated by the fact that he devoted numerous major and minor tracts to the subject and returned repeatedly to its elaboration throughout his life.¹ Avicenna’s psychological doctrines are stable in their general parameters, but his individual presentations of them differ according to considerations of philosophical intent, generic format, and audience of address.² Like any psychology aspiring to comprehensiveness, Avicenna’s theory addresses four considerations:<br>

  Book Title: Aliens and Sojourners-Self as Other in Early Christianity<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): DUNNING BENJAMIN H.<br>
  Abstract: Early Christians spoke about themselves as resident aliens, strangers, and sojourners, asserting that otherness is a fundamental part of being Christian. But why did they do so and to what ends? How did Christians' claims to foreign status situate them with respect to each other and to the larger Roman world as the new movement grew and struggled to make sense of its own boundaries?
      Aliens and Sojournersargues that the claim to alien status is not a transparent one. Instead, Benjamin Dunning contends, it shaped a rich, pervasive, variegated discourse of identity in early Christianity. Resident aliens and foreigners had long occupied a conflicted space of both repulsion and desire in ancient thinking. Dunning demonstrates how Christians and others in antiquity capitalized on this tension, refiguring the resident alien as being of a compelling doubleness, simultaneously marginal and potent. Early Christians, he argues, used this refiguration to render Christian identity legible, distinct, and even desirable among the vast range of social and religious identities and practices that proliferated in the ancient Mediterranean. Through close readings of ancient Christian texts such as Hebrews, 1 Peter, theShepherd of Hermas, and theEpistle to Diognetus, Dunning examines the markedly different ways that Christians used the language of their own marginality, articulating a range of options for what it means to be Christian in relation to the Roman social order. His conclusions have implications not only for the study of late antiquity but also for understanding the rhetorics of religious alienation more broadly, both in the ancient world and today.<br>

  Abstract: In two texts written 50 years apart, Erikson (1972: 274) and Bauman (2003) both attribute the relatively recent preoccupation with identity processes to the great economic and social transformations which destroyed community life, made subjects and families culturally vulnerable and created mounting internal and international migratory fluxes which temporarily increased tolerance to uncertainties (Appadurai 1998). Erikson developed his cluster of identity concepts within a relatively closed community, based on intergenerational recognition, and characterised by an antagonistic exteriority that conveniently sanctioned its relative closure.

  Abstract: In Western cinema, food and drink have often served as symbols for life and sensuality. The enjoyment of food is used to celebrate the pure physical joy of life and sensuality, reminding us of our immediate corporeal sensations, and affirming the vitality of human life. A number of films about food use food imagery in a “carnivalesque” fashion: in Babette’s Feast (Gabriel Axel, Denmark, 1987), the maid of two minister’s daughters wins the lottery and spends the entire sum on an elaborate banquet for her Lutheran employers and their church community.

  Abstract: The line between the idea of cultural region, generally delineated according to human criteria, and ecological region and bioregion, defined by natural factors, would seem to be fairly sharp and clear. Sometimes, though, that line becomes blurred in ways that force closer examination of these spatial concepts and the ways that they relate to each other. For example, northern New England can be seen as a distinct literary subregion distinguished by the differences that writers more or less self-consciously draw between dominant tropes of New England regional identity as a whole and the ways of life that they feel characterize<br>

If we are fortunate, some of these conversations take unexpected turns, develop into genuine dialogues, and continue over many years.

In this way, they differ fundamentally from structured interviews, where one of the participants claims rights both to pose the questions and interpret the responses.<br>

  Book Title: The Archaeology of Class War-The Colorado Coalfield Strike of 1913-1914<br>
  Publisher: University Press of Colorado<br>
  Author(s): McGuire Randall H.<br>
  Abstract: The Archaeology of the Colorado Coalfield War Project has conducted archaeological investigations at the site of the Ludlow Massacre in Ludlow, Colorado, since 1996. With the help of the United Mine Workers of America and funds from the Colorado State Historical Society and the Colorado Endowment for the Humanities, the scholars involved have integrated archaeological finds with archival evidence to show how the everyday experiences of miners and their families shaped the strike and its outcome.The Archaeology of Class War weaves together material culture, documents, oral histories, landscapes, and photographs to reveal aspects of the strike and life in early twentieth-century Colorado coalfields unlike any standard documentary history. Excavations at the site of the massacre and the nearby town of Berwind exposed tent platforms, latrines, trash dumps, and the cellars in which families huddled during the attack. Myriad artifacts—from canning jars to a doll’s head—reveal the details of daily existence and bring the community to life.The Archaeology of Class War will be of interest to archaeologists, historians, and general readers interested in mining and labor history.<br>

  7  Material Culture of the Marginalized from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt46nv52">The Archaeology of Class War</a><br>
  Author(s) GRAY AMIE<br>
  Abstract: The history of the southern Colorado coalfields is a complex one involving social interactions among established residents, Anglo-Americans, Hispanos, African Americans, Asians, and newly arriving immigrants from Europe and Mexico. By studying the material culture of immigrants and “in-between peoples,” we can begin to examine their experiences in America and the cultural negotiations that occurred in their lives. The negotiation of culture through the use of the objects of daily life is of interest in this study. Analysis of the use of objects in “facilitating judgment, classification, and self-expression” provides insight into the construction of an individual’s cultural identity (Beaudry,<br>

  Abstract: In 1913 the coal miners of southern Colorado drew up a list of seven demands to be presented by their union, the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), to the mining companies. The sixth of the seven demands encompassed the frustration miners and their families felt over their employers’ intrusion into all aspects of home life—a lack of choice in where to live, where to shop, and where to obtain medical services. While early–twentieth-century mining companies had an interest in keeping workers relatively satisfied, the deskilling of the work and a ready force of new immigrants made workers<br>

  Abstract: The “mass exodus” of striking families from the coal camps in the rain and snow on September 17, 1914, struck an emotional chord among those who saw it (Long 1989:272). In her historical account of the 1913–1914 strike, Priscilla Long quotes remarks Mary “Mother” Jones made to the strikers several days later: “ ‘There was a lot of poor wretches on that wagon,’ Jones said of one family, ‘their life earnings were piled on that wagon….

  Book Title: The Sacredness of the Person-A New Genealogy of Human Rights<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Skinner Alex<br>
  Abstract: According to Joas, every single human being has increasingly been viewed as sacred. He discusses the abolition of torture and slavery, once common practice in the pre-18th century west, as two milestones in modern human history. The author concludes by portraying the emergence of the UN Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 as a successful process of value generalization. Joas demonstrates that the history of human rights cannot adequately be described as a history of ideas or as legal history, but as a complex transformation in which diverse cultural traditions had to be articulated, legally codified, and assimilated into practices of everyday life. The sacralization of the person and universal human rights will only be secure in the future, warns Joas, through continued support by institutions and society, vigorous discourse in their defense, and their incarnation in everyday life and practice.<br>

  Book Title: Hysteria Complicated by Ecstasy-The Case of Nanette Leroux<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): GOLDSTEIN JAN<br>
  Abstract: Hysteria Complicated by Ecstasyoffers a rare window into the inner life of a person ordinarily inaccessible to historians: a semiliterate peasant girl who lived almost two centuries ago, in the aftermath of the French Revolution. Eighteen-year-old Nanette Leroux fell ill in 1822 with a variety of incapacitating nervous symptoms. Living near the spa at Aix-les-Bains, she became the charity patient of its medical director, Antoine Despine, who treated her with hydrotherapy and animal magnetism, as hypnosis was then called. Jan Goldstein translates, and provides a substantial introduction to, the previously unpublished manuscript recounting Nanette's strange illness--a manuscript coauthored by Despine and Alexandre Bertrand, the Paris physician who memorably diagnosed Nanette as suffering from "hysteria complicated by ecstasy." While hysteria would become a fashionable disease among urban women by the end of the nineteenth century, the case of Nanette Leroux differs sharply from this pattern in its early date and rural setting.<br>

  Book Title: Marrow of Human Experience, The-Essays on Folklore by William A. Wilson<br>
  Publisher: Utah State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Call Diane<br>
  Abstract: As a body, Wilson's essays develop related topics and connected themes. This collection organizes them in three coherent parts. The first examines the importance of folklore-what it is and its value in various contexts. Part two, drawing especially on the experience of Finland, considers the role of folklore in national identity, including both how it helps define and sustain identity and the less savory ways it may be used for the sake of nationalistic ideology. Part three, based in large part on Wilson's extensive work in Mormon folklore, which is the most important in that area since that of Austin and Alta Fife, looks at religious cultural expressions and outsider perceptions of them and, again, at how identity is shaped, by religious belief, experience, and participation; by the stories about them; and by the many other expressive parts of life encountered daily in a culture.<br>

  Book Title: Professionalism in the Information and Communication Technology Industry-  Publisher: ANU E Press<br>
  Author(s): Selgelid Michael J.<br>
  Abstract: Professionalism is arguably more important in some occupations than in others. It is vital in some because of the life and death decisions that must be made, for example in medicine. In others the rapidly changing nature of the occupation makes efficient regulation difficult and so the professional behaviour of the practitioners is central to the good functioning of that occupation. The core idea behind this book is that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is changing so quickly that professional behaviour of its practitioners is vital because regulation will always lag behind.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hgxws">Professionalism in the Information and Communication Technology Industry</a><br>
  Author(s) Rogerson Simon<br>
  Abstract: A central problem of the ethics of technology is that it tends to arrive too late. In many cases ethical issues are only recognised when the technology is already on the market and problems arise during its widespread use. Ethics can then become a tool to clean up a mess that might have been avoidable. It is probably not contentious to say it would be desirable to have ethical input at the earlier stages of technology design and development. Indeed, there are ethical theories and approaches that explicitly aim at an early integration of ethics into the technology life cycle<br>

  Abstract: The impact of techno-scientific developments on societal evolution and lifestyles no longer needs to be demonstrated. In particular, the last half of the twentieth century has witnessed a considerable acceleration of the integration of technological elements into the means of economic production and social life in general. The profound transformations that have taken place in the last few decades equally involve energy, transportation, construction, telecommunications, administration, medicine, pharmacy and agricultural sectors. These transformations are closely linked to techno-scientific developments and particularly to stunning developments in information and communications technologies (ICTs).

  Abstract: Perhaps the question “What is philosophy?” can only be posed late in life, when old age has come, and with it the time to speak in concrete terms. It is a question one poses when one no longer has anything to ask for, but its consequences can be considerable. One was asking the question before, one never ceased asking it, but it was too artificial, too abstract; one expounded and dominated the question, more than being grabbed by it. There are cases in which old age bestows not an eternal youth, but on the contrary a sovereign freedom, a pure<br>

  Abstract: As we proceed to our study of the social world, we abandon the strictly phenomenological method. We shall start out by simply accepting the existence of the social world as it is always accepted in the attitude of the natural standpoint, whether in everyday life or in sociological observation. In so doing, we shall avoid any attempt to deal with the problem from the point of view of transcendental phenomenology. We shall, therefore, be bypassing a whole nest of problems whose significance and difficulty were pointed out by Husserl in his

  Abstract: Every expression of human mental life can be understood as a kind of language, and this understanding, in the manner of a true method, everywhere raises new questions. It is possible to talk about a language of music and of sculpture, about a language of justice that has nothing directly to do with those in which German or English legal judgments are couched, about a language of technology that is not the specialized language of technicians. Language in such contexts means the tendency inherent in the subjects concerned—technology, art, justice, or religion—toward the communication of mental meanings. To<br>

  Abstract: The correlation between
                  knowledge, understood as disinterested contemplation, andbeing, is, according to our philosophical tradition, the very site of intelligibility, the occurrence of meaning (sens). The comprehension of being—the semantics of this verb—would thus be the very possibility of or the occasion for wisdom and the wise and, as such, isfirst philosophy.

If so, one could be excused perhaps for thinking that “scriptures” are an inherently unstable category bound up with the life and changing fortunes of a community. To conclude thus, however, would be wrong. While a community renews itself in the vicissitudes of<br>

  Abstract: I read the call for an Institute for Signifying Scriptures primarily as a methodological statement, one that resonates well with my own research affiliations and inclinations. Vincent Wimbush proposes an approach to “scriptures” that shifts attention from the correct interpretation of canonical texts to the use of scriptural material in practice. Understood as phenomena, “scriptures” derives their meaning not from authorial intent but from their activation in everyday life in often unintended and surprising uses. Shifting from “
                  what ‘scriptures’ mean” to “how ‘scriptures’ mean,” Wimbush also directs our attention to the range of scriptural materials evident in the meaning-making, or<br>

  1  Dementia-Near-Death and “Life Itself” from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjbhp">Thinking About Dementia</a><br>
  Author(s) KAUFMAN SHARON R.<br>
  Abstract: This chapter is about the cultural work that dementia does, the sociomedical uses to which it is put in the American hospital at the end of life. I suggest that dementia works there in three ways: as a rationale for facilitating death, as a contested feature of what matters about the patient’s identity, and as a moralclinical designation of value when a frail life is perceived to hang in the balance. In performing this multiplex work, dementia makes manifest one aspect of the ethics and politics of life itself in the negotiations it elicits about “quality of life,” “loss of<br>

  5  The Biomedical Deconstruction of Senility and the Persistent Stigmatization of Old Age in the United States from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjbhp">Thinking About Dementia</a><br>
  Author(s) BALLENGER JESSE F.<br>
  Abstract: This oft-quoted characterization of the seventh and final stage of a person’s life has usually been taken as a commonplace of old age: this period has always been stigmatized. In particular, the mental losses associated with age, “second childishness and mere oblivion,” have been among the most deeply stigmatized conditions. In its frightening totality—effacing the memories and abilities that are widely seen as the very essence of personhood—senile dementia seems to taint the entire experience of aging. In its relentless inevitability, deeply associated with aging and the mere passage of time, it makes a mockery of the achievement<br>

  7  Coherence without Facticity in Dementia: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjbhp">Thinking About Dementia</a><br>
  Author(s) McLEAN ATHENA HELEN<br>
  Abstract: The narrative turn in the study of aging has brought forth a variety of nonpositivist, nonrealist approaches to examining an elder’s life story within the terms of the story itself, independent of its truth content. Beginning with the early 1980s, anthropology witnessed a flood of studies concerning the life history approach (cf. Bertaux 1981; Crapananzo 1980; Shostak 1981). By 1988, however, the influence of illness in the construction of one’s life history received little attention (Kaufman 1988, 217). Since then, bolstered by interpretive approaches to narrative in anthropology (e.g., Rabinow and Sullivan 1987), as well as theory and methods from<br>

  Author(s) CHATTERJI ROMA<br>
  Abstract: In an influential essay on dementia care, Kitwood (1993) uses the notion of
                  cultureto orient caregivers to the communicative aspects of care on psychogeriatric wards. By talking about a “culture of dementia” he provides a new perspective on the way in which dementia sufferers are usually represented, that is, in terms of a loss of voice and of the possibility of constituting a lifeworld (Leering 1967; Chatterji 1998). He tries to think of the ward in terms of an intersubjective space that can be shared by both caregivers and patients, that offers possibilities for the development of a lifeworld.<br>

  Book Title: The King James Version at 400-Assessing Its Genius as Bible Translation and Its Literary Influence<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Towner Philip H.<br>
  Abstract: In this collection of essays, thirty scholars from diverse disciplines offer their unique perspectives on the genius of the King James Version, a translation whose 400th anniversary was recently celebrated throughout the English-speaking world. While avoiding nostalgia and hagiography, each author clearly appreciates the monumental, formative role the KJV has had on religious and civil life on both sides of the Atlantic (and beyond) as well as on the English language itself. In part 1 the essayists look at the KJV in its historical contexts—the politics and rapid language growth of the era, the emerging printing and travel industries, and the way women are depicted in the text (and later feminist responses to such depictions). Part 2 takes a closer look at the KJV as a translation and the powerful precedents it set for all translations to follow, with the essayists exploring the translators’ principles and processes (with close examinations of “Bancroft’s Rules" and the Prefaces), assessing later revisions of the text, and reviewing the translation’s influence on the English language, textual criticism, and the practice of translation in Jewish and Chinese contexts. Part 3 looks at the various ways the KJV has impacted the English language and literature, the practice of religion (including within the African American and Eastern Orthodox churches), and the broader culture. The contributors are Robert Alter, C. Clifton Black, David G. Burke, Richard A. Burridge, David J. A. Clines, Simon Crisp, David J. Davis, James D. G. Dunn, Lori Anne Ferrell, Leonard J. Greenspoon, Robin Griffith-Jones, Malcolm Guite, Andrew E. Hill, John F. Kutsko, Seth Lerer, Barbara K. Lewalski, Jacobus A. Naudé, David Norton, Jon Pahl, Kuo-Wei Peng, Deborah W.

  Author(s) Sakenfeld Katharine Doob<br>
  Abstract: When I was asked to prepare this paper on the King James Version and women, I initially declined because it was not at all an area of my research. Eventually the organizers of this symposium persuaded me to dig around. Since scholarly reporting and discussion of the origins and afterlife of the KJV has been overwhelmingly focused on the role of men in that story, I tried to approach my assignment from a wide range of angles. As I began to identify topics relating to women that might bear fruit, it quickly became evident that most of these areas should<br>

  Abstract: Human dignity insists that every human deserves respect and a safe place to live. For many, this is not a reality. The essays collected here analyze the background of this problem in contemporary family life and society at large, with special emphasis on the role of women and on the Bible as a source of inspiration and transformation. The collection is the product of a six-year conversation on family, violence, and human dignity between the Protestant Theological University in Kampen, The Netherlands, and the Faculty of Theology at Stellenbosch University, South Africa, a North-South dialogue that included annual conferences, a series of responsive letters, and additional external responses. The contributors are Cheryl B. Anderson, Hendrik Bosman, Gerrit Brand, Athalya Brenner, L. Juliana Claassens, Dorothea Erbele-Küster, Leo J.

Most of us are born into families that provide a child care not only to survive, but also to thrive. Family thus serves as the space that protects life.

  Abstract: A central theme guiding this volume is that politics is marked by everyday forms of innovation, what Gerald Berk and Dennis Galvan refer to as creative syncretism.¹ Focusing on this creativity, they argue, offers key insights into the nature and conduct of politics. What at first may appear to be fixed and rigid structures, such as rules and roles, interests and institutions, are in fact multiple and malleable elements of political life. This diversity allows actors to combine and recombine elements in pursuit of their political goals. The payoff from such an analytical move is twofold. First, attention to the<br>

                  The Second Sex, which stands at the beginning of the second wave of feminism: “One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman.” This most famous sentence from Beauvoir’s book sums up her argument against biological determinism. Beauvoir’s comprehensive and still controversial text also initiated existential feminism, as she developed her themes within the emergence of existentialist philosophy—an open-ended, anti-essentialist, and nonsystematic philosophy that studies life as an undecided project-in-the-making. She did not call herself a feminist at first, but associated<br>

I study Beauvoir’s work here in close proximity to Maurice Merleau-Ponty, a contemporary of hers, and Judith Butler, a contemporary of mine. These three comprise a trio of related but significantly divergent phenomenological critiques of determinism. Through them we can see how the concept of determinism shifts back and forth, how it is performed. Questions of tradition and gender in ballet also shift around essentialist thinking. I provide a<br>

  Book Title: Illness as Narrative-  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Jurecic Ann<br>
  Abstract: For most of literary history, personal confessions about illness were considered too intimate to share publicly. By the mid-twentieth century, however, a series of events set the stage for the emergence of the illness narrative. The increase of chronic disease, the transformation of medicine into big business, the women's health movement, the AIDS/HIV pandemic, the advent of inexpensive paperbacks, and the rise of self-publishing all contributed to the proliferation of narratives about encounters with medicine and mortality.While the illness narrative is now a staple of the publishing industry, the genre itself has posed a problem for literary studies. What is the role of criticism in relation to personal accounts of suffering? Can these narratives be judged on aesthetic grounds? Are they a collective expression of the lost intimacy of the patient-doctor relationship? Is their function thus instrumental-to elicit the reader's empathy?To answer these questions, Ann Jurecic turns to major works on pain and suffering by Susan Sontag, Elaine Scarry, and Eve Sedgwick and reads these alongside illness narratives by Jean-Dominique Bauby, Reynolds Price, and Anne Fadiman, among others. In the process, she defines the subgenres of risk and pain narratives and explores a range of critical responses guided, alternately, by narrative empathy, the hermeneutics of suspicion, and the practice of reparative reading.
      Illness as Narrativeseeks to draw wider attention to this form of life writing and to argue for new approaches to both literary criticism and teaching narrative. Jurecic calls for a practice that's both compassionate and critical. She asks that we consider why writers compose stories of illness, how readers receive them, and how both use these narratives to make meaning of human fragility and mortality.<br>

  Abstract: In part 2, we are still moving away from those futile existentialist views that fail to see meaning in life because they emphasize lifeʹs contingency rather than its cohesion, and fail to see the impossibility of erasing (even in our thoughts, let alone our actions) the compelling connectedness of self, body, earth, and world – a universe (a single verse), rendering both unity and diversity possible. Disconnection is possible only if connection is assumed. Likewise, irrationality stands in relation to rationality, nonbeing to being, negative to positive, and contingent properties must be contingent upon something. In short, all oppositions stand<br>

  Abstract: Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Martin Heidegger, and Jean-Paul Sartre take a particular perspective on time, describing its lived character – its metaphoric and poetic dimension in experience, rather than its objective measure. Space, inseparable from time, is similarly conceived in its poetics by Gaston Bachelard.¹ Preceding their writings was Henri Bergsonʹs exposition of our intuitive grasp of time.² These philosophers are interested in explaining time and space as experienced or perceived in subjective life.

  Book Title: The Reparative in Narratives-Works of Mourning in Progress<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROSELLO MIREILLE<br>
  Abstract: The authors studied in this book can be visualized as the islands that constitute an unknown, fragile and trembling literary and cultural Francophone archipelago. The archipelago does not appear on any map, in the middle of an ocean whose name we already know. No Francophone anthology would put these authors together as a matter of course because what connects them is a narrative grammar rather than a national origin or even a language. Yet, their writing techniques and their apprehension of the real (the ways in which they know and name the world) both reflect and actively participate in our evolving perception of what Gayatri Spivak calls the “planet”. The Reparative in Narratives argues that argue that they repair trauma through writing. One description of these awe-inspiring, tender and sometimes horrifying tales is that their narrators are survivors who have experienced and sometimes inflicted unspeakable acts of violence. And yet, ultimately, despair, nihilism, cynicism or silence are never the consequences of their encounter with what some quickly call evil. The traumatic event has not killed them and has not killed their desire to write or perform, although the decidedly altered life that they live in the aftermath of the disaster forces them to become different types of storytellers. They are the first-person narrators of their story, and their narration reinvents them as speaking subjects. In turn, this requires that we accept new reading pacts. That pact is a temporal and geographical signature: the reparative narrative needs readers prepared to accept that healing belongs to the realm of possibilities and that exposure and denunciation do not exhaust the victim’s range of possibilities. Rosello contends that this context-specific yet repeating pattern constitutes a response to the contemporary figuration of both globalized and extremely localized types of traumatic memories.<br>

  Author(s) Gallagher Mary<br>
  Abstract: Lafcadio Hearn (1850–1904) is famous principally for having ‘interpreted’ Japan for the West in the closing years of the nineteenth century. Even if his life and work are recognized as falling into two main periods, the American and the Far Eastern, the latter is usually seen as outshining the former. It is less, however, the work of Hearn’s Japanese period than the inscapes of his American/Caribbean writings that hold the key – if not to the overall significance, then certainly to the contemporary resonance of this unusual

  Abstract: On the cover of the second edition of Richard Price’s

American anthropologist Richard Price’s study of the role of memory in modern Martinican society examines the strange fate of a social pariah, Médard Aribot, thief and artist, who, following his return from prison on Devil’s Island, divided his time during the final years of his life between Petite-Anse and the town of Le Diamant in the south west of Martinique.<br>

  CHAPTER 5  Frantz Fanon: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjgn6">Postcolonial Thought in the French Speaking World</a><br>
  Author(s) Silverman Max<br>
  Abstract: Little more than twenty years ago, Homi Bhabha could justifiably write ‘in Britain today Fanon’s ideas are effectively “out of print”’ (Bhabha, 1986: viii). This demonstrates the extent to which Fanon’s current status as probably the most influential thinker in the field of postcolonial studies is a relatively recent phenomenon. In this chapter, following a brief overview of Fanon’s life and career, I will outline the major stages of his thought in three sections. In the opening section, I will discuss his first major work,

  Abstract: There is, perhaps, an excessive obviousness in the decision to focus on the concept of freedom in any discussion of Jean-Paul Sartre, since if there is one pre-eminently Sartrean theme, it is arguably that of freedom. However, precisely because of the dangers inherent in the ‘obviousness’, in regarding the chosen subject as already known and comprehended, but also because of the inevitably changing and evolving sense of the term in the context of a lifetime’s passionate engagement, we would be wrong to think that we fully understand Sartre’s repeated working through – ‘elaboration’ in the strongest Gramscian sense – of<br>

  Abstract: Since the beginning of the new millennium there has been a remarkable turnaround in the critical appraisal of the life and work of Senegalese poet-president, Léopold Sédar Senghor, the writer most closely associated with the Francophone literary movement of Negritude. In the course of the preceding decades, Senghor had come to be seen by numerous critics (if by no means all) as an anachronistic figure, whose ideas had served their time and were no longer useful in thinking about Africa. The high point of the more recent positive reappraisal came in 2006 (the centenary of his birth), which l’Organisation Internationale<br>

  Abstract: Questions of immigration, diversity and race have dominated the social, cultural and political life of France since the late twentieth century. Even before the widespread uprisings in the
                  banlieues(France’s deprived suburbs) in the autumn of 2005, the question of how the French might conceive of themselves as a nation that could (or could not) embrace peoples of different origins and traditions fuelled seemingly endless debates among intellectuals, politicians and people of all walks of life.

  Author(s) Forsdick Charles<br>
  Abstract: The Bicentenary of the French Revolution in 1989 heralded the series of commemorations by which late twentieth-century France now appears to have been increasingly characterized. In the 1990s, literature, cinema and intellectual debate all began to reflect an increasing focus on memory, a tendency also apparent in popular culture and public life. The historian Pierre Nora, inaugurating in 1984
                  Les Lieux de mémoire, a monumental collection of essays on key ‘sites’ of the French historical experience understood as having had an impact on national self-identity, presented the lack of shared post-war national memory as a rationale for alternative manifestations of<br>

  Aestheticism in Translation: from:

  Abstract: Schiller’s celebrated defence of the redemptive social value of art as autonomous aesthetic illusion (
                  Täuschung, translated as ‘fiction’ by Carlyle)¹ offers a suggestive proleptic commentary on the close relationship between late nineteenth-century aestheticism and a certain logic of translatability. Whilst this defence alludes to a familiar mimetic conception of the relationship between art and life—between the ‘copy’ and its ‘original’—it also enacts a striking defamiliarization of this paradigm by claiming for aesthetic illusion a truth which is lacking from its ostensibly reflected source. Art, Schiller would seem to say, offers a truth which is lacking from truth; only<br>

  Abstract: There are several concepts of Shakespearean translation that might offer us a way into the reading of James Joyce’s

  4  Constructing Famine Spaces in Ireland from:

  Abstract: In Ireland, unlike so many previous epochs of historical commemorations where local efforts piggy-backed onto or modified narratives enshrined at the national level (as with the 1798 rebellion, Easter Rising, or the First World War), the Famine was an intensely local experience, not one which occurred at a remove from daily life. Today the remnants of that experience pervade the depopulated Irish landscape: abandoned stone cottages, crumbling workhouses and overgrown mass graves, and the endlessly stonewalled and subdivided smallholdings that are testament to the meagre acreage allotted to the Famine poor existing at the very margins of society.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjkzw">French Studies in and for the 21st Century</a><br>
  Author(s) Kelly Michael<br>
  Abstract: ‘L’intellectuel est quelqu’un qui se mêle de ce qui ne le regarde pas.’¹ Sartre’s canonical definition of the intellectual suggests a basic question about the public impact of French scholars. To what extent have they intervened in British society, and how far have they stepped outside their areas of expertise to do so? In attempting to answer this question, the following discussion examines how scholars of French have engaged in activities that have shaped different aspects of life in the UK beyond the world of French Studies. Examining the current debate around the question of public impact, it will look<br>

  Abstract: Irish people have been deeply woven into the fabric of London life for centuries. The first records of Irish migrant workers originate from the twelfth century, when the majority were employed as labourers and street-vendors, although some had to resort to other means of survival, as evidenced by a statute in 1243 to expel Irish beggars.¹ By Tudor times, the Irish were no strangers to a city which had, in John Denvir’s lurid description, ‘seen many an Irish chief and noble brought in chains to perish miserably in the gloomy dungeons of the Tower’.² Lesser mortals were excluded from work<br>

  Abstract: Emigration has been at the heart of Irish life for centuries, not least in the post-war years. Even if many men and women chose not to leave Ireland, nobody was entirely immune to the effects of migration. Most people knew at least one person, whether it was a relative or an acquaintance, who had decided to ‘take the boat’. Conversation and, to some degree, preoccupations and way of life in Ireland during the post-war years were deeply underscored by emigration. Even if its economic and social ravages were sometimes consigned to the periphery of public debate by politicians and the<br>

Born in the Bronx, Donaghy lived most of his life in London and, through his work, epitomized the ambivalent yet undeniable attachment to Ireland experienced by many of the second generation.

  CHAPTER 2  Latin American Varieties of Modernity from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjmbn">Varieties of World Making</a><br>
  Author(s) Larrain Jorge<br>
  Abstract: Following Castoriadis, I shall understand by ‘modernity’ the conjunction of two key significations: autonomy and control. Autonomy refers to the freedom of a society to make its own laws; control has to do with the expansion of rational mastery over the world of things, including the development of science and technology and their application to production and the control of nature (Castoriadis 1990: 15–17). Peter Wagner has developed this idea more precisely into an ‘interpretative approach’, which focuses on the responses that human beings give to certain basic

  Abstract: The historico-political developments following September 11 2001 have raised the profile of Islam and its political relevance. From a secular and liberal perspective, religious/transcendental struggles should be confined to the private domain and should concern individual consciences. However, the forceful entry of Islam as a topic into the public domain post-9/11 represents a questioning of the secular/liberal world. This raises broader questions about the links between religion and politics and the relevance of religious interpretations for our life in common and in the commons, that is, in the public domain.

  Abstract: Implicit in the idea of world-making are the assumptions that human beings are the makers of their own history and that in the incessant shaping of their socio-historical worlds they experience some sort of commonality. This dual presupposition entails the attribution of at least some sort of control to both individuals and emerging collectivities over the status and direction of socio-historical institutions and life-trajectories. The allegedly ‘common’ world, emerging and/or persisting in time, poses a number of theoretical problems, of which this chapter attempts to examine only those relating to its creation and constitution.

Space is one of the ideas listed by Tim Edensor in his discussion of the imbrications of legal frameworks, national identities and everyday life. ‘In a very practical sense, national identity is facilitated by the state’s legislative framework, which delimits and regulates the practices in which people can partake, the spaces in which they are permitted to move, and in many other ways provides a framework for<br>

  Book Title: Thresholds of Meaning-Passage, Ritual and Liminality in Contemporary French Narrative<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): DUFFY JEAN H.<br>
  Abstract: Thresholds of Meaning examines contemporary French narrative and explores two related issues: the centrality within recent French fiction and autofiction of the themes of passage, ritual and liminality; and the thematic continuity which links this work with its literary ancestors of the 1960s and 1970s. Through the close analysis of novels and récits by Pierre Bergounioux, François Bon, Marie Darrieussecq, Hélène Lenoir, Laurent Mauvignier and Jean Rouaud, Duffy demonstrates the ways in which contemporary narrative, while capitalising on the formal lessons of the nouveau roman and drawing upon a shared repertoire of motifs and themes, engages with the complex processes by which meaning is produced in the referential world and, in particular, with the rituals and codes that social man brings into play in order to negotiate the various stages of the human life-cycle. By the application of concepts and models derived from ritual theory and from visual analysis, Thresholds of Meaning situates itself at the intersection of the developing field of literature and anthropology studies and research into word and image.<br>

The part played by religion and, in particular, Christianity in the stigmatisation of the act of self-destruction and the individual who kills or attempts to kill himself/herself has, of course, been rehearsed on countless occasions. As Georges Minois points out in his overview of the history of suicide, the early Christian Church seemed to give out mixed messages on the question: the earthly life is a vale of tears and the Christian should aspire to death so that he/she can be united with God<br>

  Book Title: Heidegger and the Thinking of Place-Explorations in the Topology of Being<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Malpas Jeff<br>
  Abstract: The idea of place--topos--runs through Martin Heidegger's thinking almost from the very start. It can be seen not only in his attachment to the famous hut in Todtnauberg but in his constant deployment of topological terms and images and in the situated, "placed" character of his thought and of its major themes and motifs. Heidegger's work, argues Jeff Malpas, exemplifies the practice of "philosophical topology." In Heidegger and the Thinking of Place, Malpas examines the topological aspects of Heidegger's thought and offers a broader elaboration of the philosophical significance of place. Doing so, he provides a distinct and productive approach to Heidegger as well as a new reading of other key figures--notably Kant, Aristotle, Gadamer, and Davidson, but also Benjamin, Arendt, and Camus. Malpas, expanding arguments he made in his earlier book Heidegger's Topology (MIT Press, 2007), discusses such topics as the role of place in philosophical thinking, the topological character of the transcendental, the convergence of Heideggerian topology with Davidsonian triangulation, the necessity of mortality in the possibility of human life, the role of materiality in the working of art, the significance of nostalgia, and the nature of philosophy as beginning in wonder. Philosophy, Malpas argues, begins in wonder and begins in place and the experience of place. The place of wonder, of philosophy, of questioning, he writes, is the very topos of thinking.<br>

  2  The Turning to/of Place from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjp35">Heidegger and the Thinking of Place</a><br>
  Abstract: In T. H. White’s magnificent retelling of Malory,
                  The Once and Future King, the character of Merlin has one especially peculiar characteristic: he lives his life backward, from future to past.¹ It has always seemed to me that a similarly backward trajectory is particularly suited to the reading of philosophers—at least those whose work is sustained by a significant unity of vision—and especially to the reading of a philosopher such as Heidegger (who himself tells us that in essential history the beginning comes last²). Much of my own reading of Heidegger (and not only Heidegger, but Davidson too)<br>

  9  Death and the End of Life from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjp35">Heidegger and the Thinking of Place</a><br>
  Abstract: “Eternity is a terrible thought,” says Rosencrantz in Tom Stoppard’s alternative view on
                  Hamlet, “I mean, where’s it going to end?” And Guildenstern adds a little later, “Death followed by eternity … the worst of both worlds. It is a terrible thought.”¹ Death, as they say, is forever, but if the same were true of life—if one could live a life without end—would this be any less terrible? Some philosophers have argued that life in the absence of death would indeed be terrible—it would be a life, according to Bernard Williams, of unendurable boredom.² I think there<br>

  11  Heidegger in Benjaminʹs City from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjp35">Heidegger and the Thinking of Place</a><br>
  Abstract: The work of Walter Benjamin is inextricably bound with the images and ideas associated with the metropolitan spaces and places that figure so prominently in his writing, and in close proximity to which his own life, from his childhood in Berlin to the last years in Paris, was lived. The work of Martin Heidegger, on the other hand, is usually taken to bring with it an almost entirely contrary set of associations—those of the rural and the provincial, of the peasant and the countryside—that can be seen as themselves deriving from Heidegger’s own rootedness in the Alemannic-Swabian countryside,<br>

  The Invention of Language in the Poetry of Job from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjz47">Interested Readers</a><br>
  Author(s) Greenstein Edward L.<br>
  Abstract: The book of Job, particularly its poetic core, appears to contain more unique words and linguistic usages than any comparable work from the ancient Near East. The distinctive language of Job has been attributed to a number of literary factors. For one thing, the characters and events are set in a much earlier, legendary period—the time of the patriarchs.¹ Not only does Job enjoy a lifestyle that is reminiscent of the rural, sheep-and-goat-herding Hebrew patriarchs, but the description of Job and his situation in the narrative framework of the book features language and allusions to the stories of Genesis.²<br>

                  entretiensor symposia held at Pontigny, France, from 1910 to 1940, there is one that has, in retrospect, a particular resonance. For Walter Benjamin, a keen observer of French and European intellectual life and an occasional, admiring participant at Pontigny, theentretiensconducted there in 1939 effectively signaled the decline of what Pontigny had stood for throughout the period between the two world wars: the diffusion of French culture and the spread of a cosmopolitan, pacifist ideal.

  [Part V: Introduction] from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vk4c8">Artists, Intellectuals, and World War II</a><br>
  Abstract: As many of the contributors to this volume have argued, the face-to-face encounters at Pontigny-en-Amérique engendered fruitful, if subtle, shifts in the poetic, philosophical, and artistic exchanges between American and European culture. The formal and informal conversations that took place then may not have led to immediate or discernible outcomes. Nevertheless, more than sixty years later, their afterlife continues to occupy us. The contributions in this section embody the very essence of conversation as a form of action and of response to injustice and to imagining a world not prone to war and violence.<br>

  Author(s) Danigelis Alyssa<br>
  Abstract: Rachel Bespaloff’s books were the only ones I ever considered stealing. I held the old copies in my hands at the Mount Holyoke College library in the spring of 2001 and seriously contemplated breaking the law and the honor code. Not having these copies would make a post-graduation attempt to write her biography nearly impossible. Right? But I couldn’t do it, not only because I have never stolen anything in my life, but also because my mother is a librarian. All books must be returned.<br>

  Abstract: As a brand-new freshman in Pearsons Hall, I crossed College Street, walked through the gates, and fell in love with Mount Holyoke College. It is a love affair that has lasted more than fifty years. Little did I know in those early days that Mount Holyoke would change my life forever. Rachel Bespaloff was the architect of that change.

She did not explain why she felt sorry for the lovely young woman in the picture, who, being only eighteen years old, appeared to have “her whole life ahead of her.” She was fifty-five when she committed suicide. I am almost seventy-six, and I don’t think I will kill myself. I, too, know a deep and abiding sadness below the surface of my everyday life, no doubt akin<br>

  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Miller Jane Ann<br>
  Abstract: In this penetrating biography, Brodsky's life and work are illuminated by his great friend, the late poet and literary scholar Lev Loseff. Drawing on a wide range of source materials, some previously unpublished, and extensive interviews with writers and critics, Loseff carefully reconstructs Brodsky's personal history while offering deft and sensitive commentary on the philosophical, religious, and mythological sources that influenced the poet's work. Published to great acclaim in Russia and now available in English for the first time, this is literary biography of the first order, and sets the groundwork for any books on Brodsky that might follow.<br>

The transit prison with its abusive guards was a genuine ordeal; life in exile turned out to be less hard. Meanwhile, Western journalists describing Brodsky’s lot talked of the “Gulag” and “Arctic labor camps”—which in the minds of readers foggy on Russian geography and the realities of Soviet life called up visions of permanent winter and ragged convicts in shackles.¹<br>

  Abstract: Tolstoy intended Natasha Rostova to be an authentic character. She was unique for Tolstoy, and represents a turning point. “Natasha, in her freshness and vitality, is absolutely unprecedented in previous writings,” as Kathryn Feuer puts it, “which makes it all the more astonishing that Tolstoy seems to have created her so effortlessly.”¹ Whereas Nikolai and Andrei dramatize the metafictional debate about boundaries between fiction and reality, the novel and history, Natasha lives along the boundary of art and life. Readers might at first assume that no such boundary can be distinguished in Natasha’s life, since she is, of all characters,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkwn0">Leo Tolstoy and the Alibi of Narrative</a><br>
  Abstract: Although it might at first seem a simplification, the passage about Levin in the epigraph says much about Tolstoyan aesthetics: love and language go together, and representing love is its own philosophical problem. “The world as
                  loveand representation” may compare poorly with life itself, but that keeps neither Levin nor Tolstoy from repeatedly trying similar philosophies. Tolstoy was never convinced of his power to communicate his ideas in and through language; he often doubted the ability of literature to break through barriers of social isolation; and he used motifs of romantic betrayal, infidelity, trust, and reconciliation to test the<br>

Narrative alibi is the term I have been using throughout this study to describe, first, Tolstoy’s exculpatory fictions, works like “Father Sergius,” where the author looks back at his previous sinful life and creates a narrative arc that leads toward conversion and repentance.

  Abstract: Saint Thomas More's
      Utopiais one of the most important works of European humanism and serves as a key text in survey courses on Western intellectual history, the Renaissance, political theory, and many other subjects. Preeminent More scholar Clarence H. Miller does justice to the full range of More's rhetoric in this masterful translation. In a new afterword to this edition, Jerry Harp contextualizes More's life andUtopiawithin the wider frames of European humanism and the Renaissance."Clarence H. Miller's fine translation tracks the supple variations of More's Latin with unmatched precision, and his Introduction and notes are masterly. Jerry Harp's new Afterword adroitly places More's wonderful little book into its broader contexts in intellectual history."-George M. Logan, author ofThe Meaning of More's "Utopia""Sir Thomas More'sUtopiais not merely one of the foundational texts of western culture, but also a book whose most fundamental concerns are as urgent now as they were in 1516 when it was written. Clarence H. Miller's wonderful translation of More's classic is now happily once again available to readers. This is the English edition that best captures the tone and texture of More's original Latin, and its notes and introduction, along with the lively afterward by Jerry Harp, graciously supply exactly the kinds of help a modern reader might desire."-David Scott Kastan, Yale University<br>

  Abstract: ʺCorruptionʺ is one of the most powerful words in the English language. When (for instance) we think of corruption of food, human bodies, or other physical objects, we think of something that is fundamentally or revoltingly altered, impure, rotten, or worse. When we think of corruption in government—the subject of this book—the impact of this word is equally powerful. Charges of corruption in public life have condemned men, destroyed the lives of women, and accelerated the decline and fall of governments. Corruption is something that human beings instinctively loathe, and that<br>

  Abstract: The idea of the rule of law is of unquestioned importance in the liberal democratic political tradition. Indeed, it is—in some form—essential to human interaction. The idea of the rule of law is the centuries-old solution for mediating interhuman conflict over applicable moral principles and for controlling the despotism of rulers.¹ The law, as conceptualized by this idea, is an articulated set of rules, objectively enforced. The importance of the rule of law in Western jurisprudence has been expressed in ringing terms: ʺ[L]aw becomes necessary to make life in society tolerable….

  Abstract: Arlette Farge's
      Le Goût de l'archiveis widely regarded as a historiographical classic. While combing through two-hundred-year-old judicial records from the Archives of the Bastille, historian Farge was struck by the extraordinarily intimate portrayal they provided of the lives of the poor in pre-Revolutionary France, especially women. She was seduced by the sensuality of old manuscripts and by the revelatory power of voices otherwise lost. InThe Allure of the Archives, she conveys the exhilaration of uncovering hidden secrets and the thrill of venturing into new dimensions of the past.Originally published in 1989, Farge's classic work communicates the tactile, interpretive, and emotional experience of archival research while sharing astonishing details about life under the Old Regime in France. At once a practical guide to research methodology and an elegant literary reflection on the challenges of writing history, this uniquely rich volume demonstrates how surrendering to the archive's allure can forever change how we understand the past.<br>

In this collection of essays, eminent Cassirer scholars examine the many different aspects of his thinking on this subject and demonstrate how pioneering and important it is to cultural studies.<br>

  Book Title: Contemporary Culture-New Directions in Art and Humanities Research<br>
  Publisher: Amsterdam University Press<br>
  Author(s): Zijlmans Kitty<br>
  Abstract: Are the humanities still relevant in the twenty-first century? In the context of pervasive economic liberalism and shrinking budgets, the importance of humanities research for society is increasingly put into question. This volume claims that the humanities do indeed matter by offering empirically grounded critical reflections on contemporary cultural practices, thereby opening up new ways of understanding social life and new directions in humanities scholarship. The contributors argue that the humanities can regain their relevance for society, pose new questions and provide fresh answers, while maintaining their core values: critical reflection, historical consciousness and analytical distance.<br>

  Chapter One  Mediacity: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wp6n0">Contemporary Culture</a><br>
  Author(s) Boomkens René<br>
  Abstract: Generally, cities, urban culture and the urban public sphere have often been taken to represent the source or centre of modern social and cultural life, which then is said to differ radically from social and cultural life in pre-modern, feudal or medieval times and from life in the countryside. The sociological opposition between the face-to-face culture of pre-modern villages and the abstract, mediated and complex culture of modern cities as an opposition between
                  GemeinschaftandGesellschaft,introduced by Ferdinand Tönnies, has becomethecommonplace of more than hundred years of urban sociology and theory. His sociological contemporary, Georg Simmel, described<br>

  Chapter Three  Imagining the City: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wp6n0">Contemporary Culture</a><br>
  Author(s) Vega Judith<br>
  Abstract: The city is, historically and presently, regarded as
                  thecentre and epitome of modern life. It is in the city that the various self-images of modernity (freedom, rationality, wealth), as well as the various critiques of modernity (decadence, alienation, poverty) find their exemplars. The city constitutes the focal point of many ambivalences about modern life. Still, if it is thoroughly disputed what modern urban life stands for, the dispute also evidences how the city is thought to constitute a certain way of life, to engender some or other general mode of being. As René Boomkens (in this volume) puts it,<br>

  Author(s) de Waal Martijn<br>
  Abstract: The city would not exist as a modern urban society without the urban public domain. This is the central claim of a large number of theories of urban culture.¹ After all, urban life is defined by the fact that we are forced to share the city with a multitude of strangers from disparate backgrounds and with diverse identities and interests. For this reason it is of great importance that there are public spaces where we encounter these “others”, are confronted by them and must relate to them. In each of these theories, the urban public domain in which people negotiate<br>

  Author(s) Thissen Judith<br>
  Abstract: When the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research invited me in 2006 to develop an art-science project about the commercialization of culture, I had no concrete idea what form such a collaborative project would possibly take, except that I wanted us to critically investigate the market ideology that over the last decades has infiltrated almost all aspects of everyday life in the Netherlands. From the 1990s onwards, large sectors of the welfare state system – notably health-care insurance, communication services and public transport – have been privatized.

  Abstract: In early 1870 W. L. Hathaway, subcollector of the South Indian district of Thanjavur, condemned the “traffic” in people across the Bay of Bengal. He alleged that migration between South India and Malaya was “a regularly organized system of kidnapping.” Time and again, “captives were shipped from Negapatam for Penang and other countries, where the males were employed as coolies, and the females sold to a life of prostitution.” This “traffic,” Hathaway wrote, “is contrary to the law . . .

  Abstract: The artist’s life has long been the subject of fables and legends. If we explore, as Ernst Kris and Otto Kurz have done, the literature on artists from classical antiquity to the present, we can assess the recurrence of such themes as the innate gift, precocity, self-teaching, and the role of chance in the discovery and consecration of talent.¹ These themes all transform artistic engagement into a vocation and the artist himself into a charismatic figure who, assuming luck comes his way, is driven exclusively by an inner need to realize himself through self-expression.

  Abstract: From the later Unamuno’s perspective, science holds a position of primacy in European culture, a fact that permanently distances Spain from Europe. The “tragic feeling of life” results from the most difficult question ever to face philosophy: how to justify its pursuit of reason as a worthy facet of a life well lived. For Unamuno, reason alone can provide only intellectual, not emotive or spiritual, fulfillment: “el más trágico problema de la filosofía es el de conciliar las necesidades intelectuales con las necesidades afectivas y con las volitivas”

  Abstract: The Book of Jeremiah is unique among the prophetic books insofar as it presents the oracles and activities of the only one of the prophets to live through the Babylonian siege and destruction of Jerusalem. Other prophets may have lived through such catastrophe, for example, Ezekiel received the news of Jerusalem’s fall while living in Babylonian exile, and Isaiah lived at the time of Samaria’s fall to the Assyrian empire, but Jeremiah is the only prophetic book to give its readers a glimpse of life in the doomed city and the struggles in which its inhabitants engaged as they faced<br>

The following attempt to account for the unusual relationship between “my self” and “my work,” and between “my work” and “my field” will be partial both epistemologically and chronologically.

  Author(s) Morahg Gilead<br>
  Abstract: From the earliest settlement period, mainstream Zionist writers have expressed concern that the psychological and ideological deformations that shaped Jewish life in the Diaspora will continue to define Israeli identity and pervert the relationship of the people of Israel to the Land of Israel. This concern, which has its canonical literary expression in Haim Hazaz’s story, “The Sermon” (1942), is still very much in evidence in A. B. Yehoshua’s masterful novel,

  Author(s) Garber Zev<br>
  Abstract: Though many articles, reviews, and books are not of one opinion on the life and time of Jesus, there is a general understanding in the dogma of the church and in the quests of the academy that the incarnate Christ of Christian belief lived and died a faithful Jew,¹ and what this says to contemporary Jews and Christians is the focus of this volume depicting Jesus in the context of Judaism and its impact on Jewish and Christian traditional and contemporary views of the other.<br>

  Author(s) Garber Zev<br>
  Abstract: My own approach to finding the historical Jesus in the text of the New Testament may appear to some as extreme. It seems to me that Mark, the earliest Gospel version on the life of Jesus compiled shortly after the destruction of the Second Jewish Temple by the Romans in 70 CE, contains authentic traces of the historical Jesus shrouded in repeated motifs of secrecy which are intended to obscure the role of Jesus as a political revolutionary sympathizer involved in the Jewish national struggle against Rome.

  Abstract: To speak today of “Jesus the Jew” is commonplace. Jesus, son of Joseph and Mary, residents of Nazareth, was born a Jew, lived as a Jew and died as one. But what kind of Jew was he? During the course of the years, scholarship has helped us understand much about his life and his basic teachings and not a small amount of work has been done on the Jewish context of his life and teachings. However, much less attention has been paid to the physical and material realities surrounding the everyday life and teachings of Jesus. The “academic” Judaism of<br>

  Author(s) Silverman Emily Leah<br>
  Abstract: Edith Stein (1891-1942), a philosopher, mystic, and Jewish Carmelite nun, had a queer relationship to Jesus in that her personal religious framework was simultaneously Jewish and Roman Catholic. Her relationship to Jesus was unusual and out of line within the context of Carmelite spiritual practice. She saw Jesus as a Jew before Christian theologians took this fact seriously, but her mystical marriage to him reveals that she advanced in her interior life an unambiguous supersessionism that demands the replacement of Judaism with Christianity. For Stein, this interior devotion to her husband, Jesus the Jew, was a form of spiritual resistance<br>

Husserl may very well have been the most influential philosopher of the century. Toward the end of his life he was often discouraged. In addition to the almost unbearable political situation in which he had come to find himself, there was the full realization that there really was nobody willing and able to continue the work he had started. He had hoped that Heidegger would have been this person; yet Heidegger preferred to go his own way. In Husserl’s view, the task<br>

  Abstract: Gustav Shpet's theoretical work on literature and theater has not been systematically studied, nor has sufficient attention been paid to his overall presence on the Russian cultural scene from the 1910s to the 1930s.

For all his inclination towards rigorous scientific categorization Shpet always ties theory to practice.

His philosophy is never autotelic; he unremittingly strives to explain the objective phenomena of the world. In hisOutline of the Development of Russian<br>

  Abstract: Although the emergence of research on women in the Holocaust dates from the 1980s, the task of integrating the role of women—and that of children—into Holocaust Studies is far from complete, not the least because of the publication of so many women's life writing texts during the last decades, most of which remain virtually unknown.

  Author(s) Richmond Oliver P.<br>
  Abstract: Scholars and policy makers concerned with conflict resolution and peacebuilding have recently turned their attention to the importance of local community participation in efforts to generate sustainable peace. But the Western frameworks through which local engagement is promoted displays very specific cultural biases. The dominant form of international engagement with local practices of conflict resolution is strongly shaped by liberal approaches to peacebuilding. Such approaches revolve around a top-down approach that prescribes and then enforces particular understandings of governance. Traditional liberalism seeks to establish a contract between ruler and ruled that enables the preservation of life, liberty, and property. The<br>

  Abstract: After almost a decade of war (1989–1998) and the bloodiest violent conflict in the South Pacific since the end of the Second World War, Bougainville has gone through a comprehensive peacebuilding process. This process is a rare success story in contemporary postconflict peacebuilding. Because the conflict occurred during a time of statelessness in Bougainville, space was opened for a renaissance of nonstate customary institutions and processes. In the absence of state institutions, local practices resumed their central role in the life of the communities. In many places elders and chiefs, assisted particularly by women and local church people, became<br>

  Author(s) Sonja Jiun<br>
  Abstract: Jiun Sonja was a leading Buddhist reformer, scholar, and apologist during the Edo period (1600–1868). At a time when the Buddhist establishment was increasingly occupied with tasks imposed on it by the Tokugawa government, such as keeping registers of the local citizenry, and conducting funeral and memorial services, Jiun devoted himself to reviving traditional monastic life, based on the model of the historical Buddha and grounded in Buddhist philosophy. To study early Buddhism, he undertook the study of Sanskrit, using the limited resources available to him in Japan, and compiled the 1,000-chapter

  Author(s) Soseki Musō<br>
  Abstract: Musō Soseki was one of the central figures in the extraordinary first generation of native-born and native-trained Japanese Zen masters who oversaw Zen’s emergence as a widespread spiritual and cultural force in fourteenth-century Japan. Born in 1275 to an aristocratic family, he was placed at the age of eight in the nearby Tendai temple of Heien-ji, where he soon displayed the deep interest in sacred literature and profound love of nature that was to characterize his entire life. He received ordination in Nara, but after the difficult death of his ⌜Shingon⌝ master, the course of his life changed drastically. Convinced<br>

  Author(s) Sōjun Ikkyū<br>
  Abstract: Ikkyū lived at a time marked by social unrest, a struggle for power, and large-scale destruction of Kyoto’s treasured monuments. It was also a time of an overturning of traditional values and of great creativity in classical arts and literature. A Rinzai Zen master and poet, he threw himself into the maelstrom of this world of change, emerging as one of the most colorful and unconventional, if also controversial, figures in Japanese Buddhist history. Like his poetry, his life was a mixture of abstract philosophical ideas and earthy sensuality. His life is so covered in legend, due in no small<br>

  Abstract: After serving for several years as an officer of the guard at Osaka Castle, Suzuki Shōsan shaved his head and spent two years wandering, homeless and in a life of severe austerity. He entered a temple and was ordained, but gradually became impatient with the isolation and quiet. He was appointed by the feudal government to reassert Buddhist influence in the heavily Christian island of Amakusa and later moved to the capital, Edo, in order to preach within the secular realm.

  Author(s) Bunan Shidō<br>
  Abstract: A Zen master in the Myōshin-ji lineage of the Rinzai School, Shidō Bunan (or Munan) is best known for his teaching that the best approach to Zen would be “to die while you are alive” and then try to remain that way for the rest of your life. One of Bunan’s disciples became the master of Hakuin, and thus the germ of Hakuin’s notion of “the great death” of the self originated with Bunan.

  Abstract: Bankei was a Zen monk of the Rinzai School who, after studying with both Japanese and immigrant Chinese Zen masters, initially settled into a quiet life away from the major cities, tending to the spiritual needs of his local community. But in his fifties he was invited to preside over major teaching monasteries in Kyoto and Edo (later Tokyo) and quickly became a famed master of many in both metropolitan areas.

  Author(s) Kōsen Imakita<br>
  Abstract: During the final decades of the early modern period (1600–1868), Confucian scholars intensified their long-standing criticisms of Buddhism, depicting it as immoral and economically wasteful. Imakita Kōsen, an important Rinzai Zen master whose life spanned the transition into the modern era, responded to these challenges by writing an erudite treatise entitled
                  One Wave in the Zen Sea, in which he sought to elucidate the common ground between the two traditions. Imakita was well equipped for this apologetical mission: before taking the tonsure he had taught in a Confucian academy for several years, and continued to study, debate, and lecture<br>

  Abstract: Karaki Junzō was active throughout the Shōwa period more as a critic than a philosopher professionally trained in western sources. He studied under Nishida Kitarō* at Kyoto University and remained indebted to the thinking of Kyoto School philosophers throughout his life. At the same time, the religious ideas of Dōgen’s* Zen and Shinran’s* ⌜Pure Land⌝ teachings are also reflected in the development of his thought.

  Abstract: Often referred to as the founder of a movement scholars call “Kamakura Buddhism” and revered by the ⌜Pure Land⌝ sect of Buddhism as its founder, Hōnen in fact spent his entire adult life as a traditional monk in the Tendai School, understanding his ideas to be consistent with that intellectual tradition. Hōnen was thoroughly familiar with the exoteric-esoteric mix of Tendai beliefs and practices, and while some have argued that this way of thinking was so pervasive that no one would have been able to conceptualize outside this paradigm, there is much to suggest that Hōnen did indeed offer his<br>

  Abstract: Soga Ryōjin was one of the most innovative Buddhist thinkers of the twentieth century, but unlike some of the other philosophical minds of modern Japan, he focused on his own tradition of ⌜Shin Pure Land Buddhism⌝ throughout his life. As a young student, he lived in a communal study center started by Kiyo-zawa Manshi*, and was one of the first graduate students in Shinshū University.

  Author(s) Jinsai Itō<br>
  Abstract: Itō Jinsai’s family moved to Kyoto, the ancient imperial capital, towards the end of the sixteenth century, just before Tokugawa Ieyasu (1543–1616) was to consolidate the samurai rule of Japan as the new shōgun, and inaugurate the Tokugawa period (1600–1868). Ieyasu based his samurai regime in Edo (later Tokyo), the capital of his ⌜shogunate⌝. Within a century Edo had become the cultural center of Japan, increasingly eclipsing Kyoto in the intellectual, artistic, and cultural arenas. During Jinsai’s life, however, Kyoto retained its status as the center of traditional culture, if not political power.<br>

Differences in interpretation eventually led Ansai to break with Keisai and Sato Naokata*, who, though his best pupils, were not on good terms with one another.

  Abstract: Nishida Kitarō, generally considered Japan’s greatest academic philosopher, made it his lifelong task to wed the spiritual awareness cultivated through a decade of Zen practice with modern philosophy. From Zen he had come to appreciate the living unity of experience that precedes dichotomies of mind and body, subject and object; in western philosophy he recognized the importance of logical thinking, the critical examination of preconceptions, and a comprehensive vision of the world. Beginning with the experiment of his maiden work,

  Abstract: The thirteen essays in this volume come from Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Malaysia, South Africa, and Hawai'i. With a shared focus on the specific local conditions that influence the ways in which life narratives are told, the authors engage with a variety of academic disciplines, including anthropology, history, media studies, and literature, to challenge claims that life writing is an exclusively Western phenomenon. Addressing the common desire to reflect on lived experience, the authors enlist interdisciplinary perspectives to interrogate the range of cultural forms available for representing and understanding lives.Contributors:Maria Faini, Kenneth George, Philip Holden, David T.

  Abstract: In today’s globalized, hyper-international, post-migration times, it may seem obvious that Kipling’s claim about East and West no longer holds true. Nevertheless, the East/West split is still widely held to have relevance, not only in popular stereotypes and vague generalizations, but even in academic scholarship across a range of fields, including psychology, literature, and some areas of politics. Witness Samuel Huntington’s Clash of Civilizations theory, which posits a West under increasing threat from the “civilization” of Islam. The field of life writing has also at times been prone to make generalizations about whole swathes of humanity, suggesting that “Western” life<br>

  Abstract: This essay explores some of the cultural, political, and ethical work of life writing that goes on in national and transnational art worlds. We commonly think of life writing as forms or fragments of discourse that depict the lives of human actors, and that give actors’ experiences intelligibility, purpose, and recognition. But life writing also plays a part in the making of what I call “companionable objects”—those things with which we have ethical and affective ties. Things, too, can be actors, and mingle with us in our everyday lifeworlds and publics. They, too, gain intelligibility and purpose from life<br>

  Book Title: Great Fool-Zen Master Ryokan--Poems, Letters, and Other Writings<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): HASKEL PETER<br>
  Abstract: Taigu Ryokan (1759-1831) remains one of the most popular figures in Japanese Buddhist history. Despite his religious and artistic sophistication, Ryokan referred to himself as "Great Fool" and refused to place himself within the cultural elite of his age. In contrast to the typical Zen master of his time, who presided over a large monastery, trained students, and produced recondite religious treatises, Ryokan followed a life of mendicancy in the countryside. Instead of delivering sermons, he expressed himself through kanshi (poems composed in classical Chinese) and waka and could typically be found playing with the village children in the course of his daily rounds of begging. Great Fool is the first study in a Western language to offer a comprehensive picture of the legendary poet-monk and his oeuvre. It includes not only an extensive collection of the master's kanshi, topically arranged to facilitate an appreciation of Ryokan's colorful world, but selections of his waka, essays, and letters. The volume also presents for the first time in English the Ryokan zenji kiwa (Curious Accounts of the Zen Master Ryokan), a firsthand source composed by a former student less than sixteen years after Ryokan's death. Although it lacks chronological order, the Curious Account is invaluable for showing how Ryokan was understood and remembered by his contemporaries. It consists of colorful anecdotes and episodes, sketches from Ryokan's everyday life.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wqmgc">Great Fool</a><br>
  Abstract: Generations have called this beggar-monk of the early nineteenth century “Ryōkan-san,” the informal suffix “
                  san” expressing affectionate respect. Only two other eminent Buddhist figures in Japanese history have received this particular honor: “Kōbō-san” or “Daishi-san,” Kūkai, the ninth-century founder of Shingon Buddhism, who is remembered in popular legends as a savior–miracle worker; and “Ikkyū-san,” the fifteenth-century Zen monk whose eccentric life-style has inspired numerous folk stories in which he is depicted as a marvelously quick-witted child novice. Ryōkan is a singularly attractive figure. Minakami Tsutomu, the celebrated contemporary novelist, explains why, despite countless earlier works examining the minutest details<br>

  Abstract: Spend time at one of Japan’s busy commuter train stations and you will probably notice a bookstore crowded with silent rows of well-dressed “salarymen” and “salarywomen” browsing through an array of paperbacks and magazines. There, among the ubiquitous tabloids, the sex-and-violence comics, and the very latest Japanese and American bestsellers, you are likely to find several books devoted to the Zen master Taigu Ryōkan (1758–1831), a penniless monk whose life was spent in obscurity in Japan’s snow country, meditating, playing with children, and writing poems that vividly describe his world. He lived by begging in the villages and towns<br>

  Abstract: Because of the vast amount of legendary literature, both oral and written, that has accumulated around Ryōkan since his death, it is often forgotten that the effort to document Ryōkan’s life and to preserve his writings had already begun during his lifetime (1758–1831). This brief survey identifies the key primary sources for Ryōkan’s biography, sketches the historical context in which the contemporaneous biographies of Ryōkan were composed, and illustrates the intertwining historical relationships that join these texts. Many of the sources exist only as unpublished manuscripts. In cases where there exist printed editions of these sources, whether partial or<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wqmgc">Great Fool</a><br>
  Abstract: Ryōkan has frequently suffered from being presented in one-dimensional terms. Because of his fame as a poet and a calligrapher, for example, Ryōkan is sometimes treated primarily as a literary figure. But to many ordinary Japanese, Ryōkan is above all a cultural hero, a teacher in the broadest sense of the word, one who has something to say not simply about poetry, but about life itself. This is the “Ryōkan san” familiar to millions of Japanese who may never even have attempted Ryōkan’s poems. Indeed, Ryōkan lived his life as a Zen Buddhist beggar-monk, and his poetry and other writings<br>

  Book Title: Relative Histories-Mediating History in Asian American Family Memoirs<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Davis Rocío G.<br>
  Abstract: Relative Histories focuses on the Asian American memoir that specifically recounts the story of at least three generations of the same family. This form of auto/biography concentrates as much on other members of one’s family as on oneself, generally collapses the boundaries conventionally established between biography and autobiography, and in many cases—as Rocío G. Davis proposes for the auto/biographies of ethnic writers—crosses the frontier into history, promoting collective memory. Davis centers on how Asian American family memoirs expand the limits and function of life writing by reclaiming history and promoting community cohesion. She argues that identity is shaped by not only the stories we have been told, but also the stories we tell, making these narratives important examples of the ways we remember our family’s past and tell our community’s story. In the context of auto/biographical writing or filmmaking that explores specific ethnic experiences of diaspora, assimilation, and integration, this work considers two important aspects: These texts re-imagine the past by creating a work that exists both in history and as a historical document, making the creative process a form of re-enactment of the past itself. Each chapter centers on a thematic concern germane to the Asian American experience: the narrative of twentieth-century Asian wars and revolutions, which has become the subtext of a significant number of Asian American family memoirs (Pang-Mei Natasha Chang’s Bound Feet and Western Dress, May-lee and Winberg Chai’s The Girl from Purple Mountain, K. Connie Kang’s Home Was The Land of Morning Calm, Doung Van Mai Elliott’s The Sacred Willow); family experiences of travel and displacement within Asia in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which unveil a history of multiple diasporas that are often elided after families immigrate to the United States (Helie Lee’s Still Life With Rice, Jael Silliman’s Jewish Portraits, Indian Frames, Mira Kamdar’s Motiba’s Tattoos); and the development of Chinatowns as family spaces (Maxine Hong Kingston’s China Men, Lisa See’s On Gold Mountain, Bruce Edward Hall’s Tea that Burns). The final chapter analyzes the discursive possibilities of the filmed family memoir ("family portrait documentary"), examining Lise Yasui’s A Family Gathering, Ruth Ozeki Lounsbury’s Halving the Bones, and Ann Marie Fleming’s The Magical Life of Long Tack Sam. Davis concludes the work with a metaliterary engagement with the history of her own Asian diasporic family as she demonstrates the profound interconnection between forms of life writing.<br>

  Chapter 2  Family Memoirs in the Context of Auto/biographical Writing: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wqmkt">Relative Histories</a><br>
  Abstract: In his book,
                  Oneself as Another,Paul Ricoeur explains that identity is partly bound up in identification with significant others, which is the reason why, especially in autobiographies, writing the self implies writing the other. This idea resounds with one of the key insights in autobiography theory in the 1990s, namely that identity—for both men and women—is essentially relational, formed and defined in relation to others. As Laura Marcus points out, “Recounting one’s own life almost inevitably entails writing the life of an other or others; writing the life of another must surely entail the biographer’s identifications with<br>

  Abstract: This examination of the family narratives of Asian diasporic subjects gives us a sociohistorical portrait of an increasingly dynamic phenomenon. These stories explain particular histories by juxtaposing public events with private experiences, to reveal the ways families construct (or reconstruct) identity within the experience of diaspora. Giving a sense of cohesion and closure to the lives of grandparents and parents can establish a sense of authority and meaning to the writer’s own life story. Access to these stories also allows readers to understand the development of particular ethnic communities, as the narratives support the production of a history and culture<br>

  Book Title: On Diary-  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): DURNIN KATHERINE<br>
  Abstract: On Diary is the second collection in English of the groundbreaking and profoundly influential work of one of the best-known and provocative theorists of autobiography and diary. Ranging from the diary’s historical origins to its pervasive presence on the Internet, from the spiritual journey of the sixteenth century to the diary of Anne Frank, and from the materials and methods of diary writing to the question of how diaries end, these essays display Philippe Lejeune’s expertise, eloquence, passion, and humor as a commentator on the functions, practices, and significance of keeping or reading a diary. Lejeune is a leading European critic and theorist of diary and autobiography. His landmark essay, "The Autobiographical Pact," has shaped life writing studies for more than thirty years, and his many books and essays have repeatedly opened up new vistas for scholarship. As Michael Riffaterre notes, "Lejeune’s work on autobiography is the most original, powerful, effective approach to a difficult subject. . . . His style is very personal, lively. It grabs the reader as scholarship rarely does. Lejeune’s erudition and methodology are impeccable." Two substantial introductory essays by Jeremy Popkin and Julie Rak place Lejeune’s work within its critical and theoretical traditions and comment on his central importance within the fields of life writing, literary genetic studies, and cultural studies.<br>

  Book Title: The Melodrama of Mobility-Women, Talk, and Class in Contemporary South Korea<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): ABELMANN NANCY<br>
  Abstract: How do people make sense of their world in the face of the breakneck speed of contemporary social change? Through the lives and narratives of eight women, The Melodrama of Mobility chronicles South Korea's experience of just such dizzyingly rapid development. Abelmann captures the mood, feeling, and language of a generation and an era while providing a rare window on the personal and social struggles of South Korean modernity. Drawing also from television soap operas and films, she argues that a melodramatic sensibility speaks to South Korea's transformation because it preserves the tension and ambivalence of daily life in unsettled times. The melodramatic mode helps people to wonder: Can individuals be blamed for their social fates? How should we live? Who can say who is good or bad? By combining the ethnographic tools of anthropology, an engagement with prevailing sociological questions, and a literary approach to personal narratives, The Melodrama of Mobility offers a rich portrait of the experience of compressed modernity in the non-West.<br>

Thus the ellipses follow “when it’s all said and done” to underscore how very hard it has been for many of the women in this book to enjoy a seamless, easy relationship to<br>

This chapter is about a fantasy inside view of death. It is not an exposé of the topography or organization or activities of the afterlife, (although there are many Chinese stories that do this), but rather what it means to inhabit the subjective viewpoint of the dead.

  Abstract: The years from 1580 to 1700 witnessed an explosion of ghosts in writings for the stage. In part, this increase stemmed from a general proliferation of new plays, for this was the heyday of the southern drama(chuanqi). As the playwright Yuan Yuling (1592–1674) declared: “There’s never been such a superabundance of plays as nowadays.”¹ This surge had as much to do with the late Ming boom in publishing as with the passion of literary men for the theater.

The revival of political philosophy in academic circles reflects a need to rethink some basic issues concerning what democracy is and how it should be conceived. Political philosophers are discussing whether democracy is merely a form of government, or a political way of life, and how proceduralism relates to questions concerning the good, or if it is even capable of dealing with such substantial issues.

  Abstract: The great integrative processes characterizing the twentieth century lead some people to forecast radical quantitative changes in the life of the world community, up to and including the emergence of a single planetary civilization with a new system of human values. Others, whose projections strike me as more probable, forecast the rise of a metacivilization that will become a kind of a cultural “common denominator,” and which, instead of absorbing or pushing aside national, regional civilizations, will rather stand above all of them. Under any scenario of future developments, it is quite evident that the expansion of contacts and cultural<br>

Place making, they argued, was an art of placing and timing. Coherence and stability arise in this situation because public spaces are constitutionally discursive, sites incubating a primary sociality characterized by a desire to meet. The relationship of the movement form (De Quincey’s “undistinguishable blot”) to design is the same one occupied by rhythmic geography in the field of cartography. Notating what<br>

  Abstract: Protestant Christianity has often been guilty of cultural imperialism. Guided by the idea of the “white man’s burden” to “civilize” the world, Victorian-era missionaries regarded with contempt the cultures and religions of non-Western peoples and imposed upon them not only a new faith, but also a new way of life. Korea was no exception. When the first Protestant missionaries arrived in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, they condemned ancestor veneration as “idol worship” and instructed converts to burn traditional ritual objects. They also carried out a whole range of social reforms, from temperance to hygiene. The missionaries saw<br>

  Abstract: The elites of Kyoto — emperors, court officials, monks, literati, and poets — have been the focus of many studies of Heian Japan. What is often overlooked is that the local population in the provinces provided the food, clothing, and various supplies the elites needed to perform their daily duties.

  Chapter 1  THE BANUA AS A CATEGORY AND A SOCIAL PROCESS from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wr474">Custodians of the Sacred Mountains</a><br>
  Abstract: The social landscape of highland Bali is patterned by regional networks of ritual alliance among groups of villages. Such networks are locally referred to as
                  banua,or “ritual domains.” How these regional associations are conceptualized and maintained, and how they generate a sense of shared identity among the mountain people and set the stage for a regional status economy will be explored in the following chapters. The study of regional social interaction among the Bali Aga leads to a magical world where human beings, ancestors, spirits, and gods share a sacred landscape and timescape, brought to life in an intricate<br>

  Chapter 7  THE STATUS ECONOMY OF HIGHLAND BALI: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wr474">Custodians of the Sacred Mountains</a><br>
  Abstract: Exploring the lifeworld of the Mountain Balinese from the perspective of their regional alliances within ritual domains (
                  banua) has relegated to the background the more immediate community and family settings that form the stage for many of their mundane and ritual activities. This chapter is concerned first with the internal social organization of Bali Aga communities, so far referred to by the gloss “village” or by the popular local term of Sanskrit origin “desa” (village or place).Desa, in turn, include even smaller and denser spheres of social interaction, among kin and affines, defined by their common worship at private<br>

  Book Title: The Hermes Complex-Philosophical Reflections on Translation<br>
  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>
  Author(s): Folkart Barbara<br>
  Abstract: When Hermes handed over to Apollo his finest invention, the lyre, in exchange for promotion to the status of messenger of the gods, he relinquished the creativity that gave life to his words.The trade-off proved frustrating: Hermes chafed under the obligation to deliver the ideas and words of others and resorted to all manner of ruses in order to assert his presence in the messages he transmitted. His theorizing descendants, too, allow their pretentions to creatorship to interfere with the actual business of reinventing originals in another language.Just as the Hermes of old delighted in leading the traveller astray, so his descendants lead their acolytes, through thickets of jargon, into labyrinths of eloquence without substance.Charles Le Blanc possesses the philosophical tools to dismantle this empty eloquence: he exposes the inconsistencies, internal contradictions, misreadings, and misunderstandings rife in so much of the current academic discourse en translation, and traces the failings of this discourse back to its roots in the anguish of having traded authentic creativity for mere status.<br>

  Abstract: In this remarkable book, Charles Le Blanc subjects the received wisdom of academic translation studies to the scrutiny made possible by a formidable philosophical culture. Engaging with his elegant, rigorous and unflinchingly polemical argumentation has been for me, as I hope it will for the reader of this translation, an immensely stimulating experience. It has also provided validation of a position I have long been defending in my own writings: if the translator is unable to make the original hers, she will fail to bring it to life in the target-language.

  Abstract: African American Women speak and write in public arenas, so the saying of when and where they enter, they certainly did. They entered every arena they could, with Anna Julia Cooper being one of the most eloquent among them in articulating their rights and abilities to do so. Cooper was born a slave in 1858 in Raleigh, North Carolina. Despite such humble beginnings, however, over the course of her life and work her accomplishments were manifold.

  Abstract: On the back cover of the English edition of
                  The Fox from Up Above and the Fox from Down Below(2000), Alberto Moreiras characterizes Jose María Arguedas’s novel as “epochal” and “intense enough to arrest our world, and any world.” Today few critical readers would object to that description, but when the novel was published in 1971, reactions were mixed. The novel’s form and content, the wild proliferation of unpredictable characters, and what was perceived as a deep-seated pessimism were all difficult to reconcile with the image of Arguedas as a major cultural icon of progressive Peruvian culture.

  Author(s) Gethmann-Siefert Annemarie<br>
  Abstract: If we treat the question of to what extent art can be an interpretation of our world, self-concept, and historical forms of life by referring to Hegel, it seems that we come to a dead end. The authoritative and original place for a connection between art and interpretation in the traditional philosophy of aesthetics is at best the aesthetics of reception. Its traditional version relies on the basic assumption that a piece of art is constituted each time in its reception, that is, in the multiple, historically varying interpretations of its meaning and sense.¹ Even a discussion of the impact<br>

  Abstract: Reflection on olfactory and gustatory perceptions and their epistemological status has not been playing a major role in the philosophical tradition. Most classical philosophers deal with the senses of smell and taste rather parenthetically and with a sense of flippancy—if at all.¹ Sometimes philosophical texts cite phenomena of smell and taste where exemplification in factually unrelated, particularly abstract contexts is needed²—as if the difficulties of abstraction might be evened out by choosing examples from an area of life that is surrounded by a sense of light-heartedness and concreteness. But almost no classical text of philosophy has dealt with<br>

  Author(s) GOODBODY AXEL<br>
  Abstract: It is striking how often literary representations of nature appear within recollections of childhood, or more broadly in the context of acts of remembering. At the same time, memories of the past, in literature as in life, are commonly anchored in places, landscapes, or buildings. As approaches to the study of culture, ecocriticism and cultural memory studies differ in their principal concerns: while the former relates to nature and space, and examines cultural constructions of the natural environment, the latter is oriented toward history and time, and principally preoccupied with representations and understandings of the social, in formulations relating the<br>

  Abstract: So long as ecocritics are trapped in the “two cultures” ideology that polarizes literature from science and human society from nonhuman nature, we will find it difficult to define a middle ground from which literature and science can be seen as partners, and humans and nonhumans as agents, all cooperating to form the world we share. To locate this middle ground we need to think not of a monolithic “Science” but of the various practices and disciplines of the sciences, and in this quest our natural allies will be our colleagues in science studies.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wrjgw">Textual Intimacy</a><br>
  Abstract: We should not be surprised, while reading the autobiographies of fellow Americans, to encounter religious self-disclosures. After all, roughly 85 percent of Americans self-identify as religious. In addition, religion is so pervasive in our society that the life of any American is likely to include references to religion in some form and degree or other. American autobiographies that include religious disclosures are not exceptional, then. Conversely, autobiographies that include religious self-disclosures are potentially engaging to American readers because they themselves are likely to have had to deal with religion as part of their pasts, their current interactions, or their thoughts<br>

While the need or desire for acceptance or inclusion may seem to signal weakness or low self-confidence, I think of it as a sign of health and as part of daily life. Even more, however, it is part of religious belief and behavior. Indeed, the religious desire for inclusion or acceptance, among other things, accounts, it seems to me, for the expectation of a positive outcome beyond death, which can arise less<br>

  Abstract: It is often assumed that the law and religion address different spheres of human life. Religion and ethics articulate complex systems of moral reasoning that concern norms, deliberation of ends, cultivation of disposition, and transformation of moral agency. Law, in contrast, seeks to govern human conduct through procedural justice, rights, and public good. Doing Justice to Mercy challenges this assumption by presenting the reader with an urgent conversation between the law and religion that yields a constructive approach, both theoretically and practically, to the complex role of mercy in our legal process.<br>

Homes for the elderly provide the space where visible traces of old age are conveniently kept out of sight. Through Beryl Gilroy’s

  Abstract: This book gathers wide-ranging essays on the Italian Renaissance philosopher and cosmologist Giordano Bruno by one of the world's leading authorities on his work and life. Many of these essays were originally written in Italian and appear here in English for the first time. Bruno (1548-1600) is principally famous as a proponent of heliocentrism, the infinity of the universe, and the plurality of worlds. But his work spanned the sciences and humanities, sometimes touching the borders of the occult, and Hilary Gatti's essays richly reflect this diversity.<br>

Bruno’s lifetime in the second half of the sixteenth century thus covers a vital if often turbulent moment of cultural transition, which would radically affect the history of both science and the humanities.

                  De l’infinito,universo et mondi, Giordano Bruno described his life’s work as an attempt to define a “tranquil universal philosophy”: a philosophy that he imagined as a peaceful swim through the infinite ocean of universal being.¹ This was Bruno’s third philosophical dialogue written in Italian. In it, he criticizes the fifteenth-century Catholic cardinal, Nicholas Cusanus, who anticipated him in proposing an infinite universe. Cusanus, however, proposed a dualistic universe of Aristotelian origin and with clearly Christian and neo-Thomistic implications, divided between spheres of being of intense<br>

  Abstract: What are the philosophical antecedents of Freud’s attempt to establish a science of the mind?

He struggled with balancing the intellectual appeal of philosophy with the “certainty” he hoped to find in positivist science.

  CHAPTER SIX  Three Models of Reading Renunciation from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rs06">Reading Renunciation</a><br>
  Abstract: The exegetical modes outlined above, I will argue, should not be understood as purely formal constructs: they were used by early Christian writers to counsel, exhort, and warn “real-life” audiences concerning issues of marriage, sexuality, and ascetic renunciation. Hence the Fathers’ ways of interpreting Biblical texts correlate closely with their (somewhat) differing marital and ascetic axiologies. In this chapter I hope to show how the evaluations of marriage and asceticism by three patristic authors—John Chrysostom, Jerome, and Origen—relate to their respective modes of reading. Although other authors of the early Christian era might have served to illustrate my<br>

  Abstract: The
                  commedia, perhaps more than any other text ever written, consciously seeks to imitate life, the conditions of human existence. Not surprisingly, then, the narrative journey begins with the problem of beginnings.¹ Dante’s beginning, “Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita” (“In the middle of the path of our life”), evokes biblical and classical precedents for not beginning at the beginning. As Frank Kermode reminds us, “Men, like poets, rush ‘into the middest,’in medias res, when they are born; they also diein mediis rebus.”² This is to say that we exist in time, which, according to Aistotle, “is<br>

  Abstract: Paradise Lostwas published in two different editions during Milton’s life. The first edition of 1667 appeared in ten books, the second of 1674 in twelve. Apart from some fifteen new lines, there were no other important changes between the two editions, yet the alteration of its external form shifts the way in which one perceives the poem’s informing structure, what Aristotle called themythos. The longest books of the first edition were the last four. These were divided into six for1674. Most of the extra lines also occur in the second half of the poem, changes that had<br>

  Book Title: Brahms and His World-(Revised Edition)<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): KARNES KEVIN C.<br>
  Abstract: Since its first publication in 1990,
         Brahms and His Worldhas become a key text for listeners, performers, and scholars interested in the life, work, and times of one of the nineteenth century's most celebrated composers. In this substantially revised and enlarged edition, the editors remain close to the vision behind the original book while updating its contents to reflect new perspectives on Brahms that have developed over the past two decades. To this end, the original essays by leading experts are retained and revised, and supplemented by contributions from a new generation of Brahms scholars. Together, they consider such topics as Brahms's relationship with Clara and Robert Schumann, his musical interactions with the "New German School" of Wagner and Liszt, his influence upon Arnold Schoenberg and other young composers, his approach to performing his own music, and his productive interactions with visual artists.<br>

  Time and Memory: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rxmx">Brahms and His World</a><br>
  Author(s) BOTSTEIN LEON<br>
  Abstract: How can one grasp the nature and impact of Brahms’s musical language and communication in his own time? In the first instance one has to guard against an uncritical sense of the stability of musical texts, their meaning, and how they can be read and heard. The acoustic, cultural, and temporal habits of life of the late nineteenth century in which Brahms’s music functioned demand reconsideration if the listener in the early twentyfirst century wishes to gain a historical perspective on Brahms’s music and its significance. A biographical strategy and the history of critical reception themselves are insufficient.<br>

  Author(s) OSTWALD PETER F.<br>
  Abstract: Brahms was a Janus-like figure who looked backward, seeking inspiration from the older Baroque and Classical traditions, while at the same time he looked forward and seemed the embodiment of modernism. A man of many contrasts, Brahms was devoted to his homeland in north Germany, but chose to live in southern Europe. He adored his parents and enjoyed family life, but never married. He was a kind and generous man, but often adopted an extremely rude manner toward others. He was fiercely independent, yet would mourn bitterly the loss of friends and relatives.He amassed a small fortune, but always lived<br>

  Author(s) AVINS STYRA<br>
  Abstract: The title of this essay is not capricious. Brahms was godfather to at least sixteen children, a little-known facet of his life that accords strangely with his current reputation as a lonesome and solitary man. His first godchild, Johanna Cossel, was the daughter of his first piano teacher. Brahms was barely twenty years old when asked to fill this office, a sign of esteem, trust, and honor. Thirty-seven years later he agreed to stand godfather to the child of another of Cossel’s daughters, Marie. In between were many little Johanneses and Johannas, plus one Felix and one Max Hermann.

  Abstract: During the first week of May 1883, Leipzig played host to the twentieth Tonkünstler-Versammlung of the Allgemeiner Deutscher Musikverein, the organization founded by Franz Brendel some years earlier to promote the musical avant-garde. The opening of the congress was marked by C. F.Kahnt, publisher of the

  Author(s) KARNES KEVIN C.<br>
  Abstract: Brahms, who emerged from the circles of the Romantics, embodies the enduring principle of the Romantic tendency: the principle of mixed moods and rapid movement in the life of the emotions. But Brahms surpasses all previous representatives of musical Romanticism in the versatility of his spirit, acquired in the course of a wonderfully purposeful and energetic development, and in the objectivity, stringency, and diversity of his style. Among all the symphonic composers of our century, Brahms is the only one who equals Beethoven in the logic and economy of his structure, the unbroken expansiveness of his material and creations, and<br>

He, who until recently was able to vaunt the fact that he had never been sick in his entire life, not even for a single day! That had continued to be the case until the end of the summer, when he suddenly became sick without realizing it himself. In Ischl, some friends pointed out to him that his face had acquired a sickly yellow hue. With the explanation that he never looked at himself in the mirror, he cut the conversation short, since it irritated him. Brahms,<br>

  Abstract: When I think of the time during which I had the fortune to know Brahms personally—it was during the last two years of his life—I can recall immediately how his music affected me and my colleagues in composition, including Schoenberg. It was fascinating, its influence inescapable, its effect intoxicating. I was still a pupil at the Vienna Conservatory and knew most of Brahms’s works thoroughly. I was obsessed by this music. My goal at the time was nothing less than the appropriation and mastery of this wonderful, singular compositional technique.<br>

  Abstract: Performance!—a ubiquitous term that currently is mapped onto disparate social worlds as if it were transcendent, its meaning immediately apparent. Yet the social life of performance as a concept is worth unraveling to track its significance in creating distinctive regions and different subjects. There is no better place to explore the contours of performance as an idea and as practice than in the context of
                  Africa, which has been made into an object through a number of performative tropes. This work examines the ways performance becomes a frame ofenactment, creating moments of “Africa” not justinAfrica but,<br>

  Abstract: Many contemporary social analysts have suggested that the distinctive feature of late capitalism is consumption. These analysts have traced how consumerism surrounds us, marketing our identities, lifestyles, and sense of belonging through consumption. One key feature of this globalized consumption is tourism: tourists, particularly from the global North, want to travel everywhere to consume the heterogeneity and richness of culture. In The Gambia, tourism is important; it shapes local articulations of culture both within and beyond the practices of jali.<br>

Consequently, they guide the reader away from narrowly defined or unreflected positions of interpretation. “As other histories emerge from the archaeology of modernity to disturb the monologue of History,” writes Iain Chambers, “we are reminded of the multiple rhythms of life that have been written out and forgotten.”¹ Benjamin’s reflections on history suggest that the narratives of the powerful are remembered as history, but those of the disenfranchised need to be “wrested away” as memory from the<br>

A brief list may serve to make the point thatA Fable, though set during a single week of the Great War, addresses militarization in a more extensive sense.

  Abstract: MY ACCOUNT of
                  A Fable, seeking the Jew and finding him in the potentially Semitic semen of the old general, risks simplifying the complex politics of the supreme commander’s sexuality. In 1918, aged sixty-two, the “old” general apparently approaches what Faulkner elsewhere spoke of as ungendered peace, but the biography of his missing years (1877–circa 1914), fabricated over two meetings by his contemporaries (graduates of the St Cyr military academy) in Paris (1877) and Zermatt (1887–88), suggests a life founded on a systematic negation of sexuality. Since the life is collectively and substantially made up, its findings may<br>

  Book Title: Contesting Spirit-Nietzsche, Affirmation, Religion<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROBERTS TYLER T.<br>
  Abstract: Nietzsche criticizes the ascetic hatred of the body and this-worldly life, yet engages in rigorous practices of self-denial--he sees philosophy as such a practice--and affirms the need of imposing suffering on oneself in order to enhance the spirit. He dismisses the "intoxication" of mysticism, yet links mysticism, power, and creativity, and describes his own self-transcending experiences. The tensions in his relation to religion are closely related to that between negation and affirmation in his thinking in general. In Roberts's view, Nietzsche's transfigurations of religion offer resources for a postmodern religious imagination. Though as a "master of suspicion," Nietzsche, with Freud and Marx, is an integral part of modern antireligion, he has the power to take us beyond the flat, modern distinction between the secular and the religious--a distinction that, at the end of modernity, begs to be reexamined.<br>

Yet, Nietzschean affirmation takes shape in the resistance to Schopenhauer’s conclusion that the denial of life is the ultimate human response to this condition and that such denial—exemplified in the saint—is definitive of holiness.

  Abstract: I began with the prefaces of 1886 and Nietzsche’s celebration of a life rejuvenated in the recovery of health and love. By the turn of the new year 1889, Nietzsche had fallen into madness, where he would remain for the final ten years of his life. In the months leading up to his collapse, Nietzsche had been working at a feverish pace, and at times had experienced intense feelings of euphoria. Some of his most “affirmative” statements come out of this period, particularly in
                  Ecce Homo. We do not know why Nietzsche went mad—whether he suffered from a congenital<br>

  Book Title: Contesting Spirit-Nietzsche, Affirmation, Religion<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROBERTS TYLER T.<br>
  Abstract: Nietzsche criticizes the ascetic hatred of the body and this-worldly life, yet engages in rigorous practices of self-denial--he sees philosophy as such a practice--and affirms the need of imposing suffering on oneself in order to enhance the spirit. He dismisses the "intoxication" of mysticism, yet links mysticism, power, and creativity, and describes his own self-transcending experiences. The tensions in his relation to religion are closely related to that between negation and affirmation in his thinking in general. In Roberts's view, Nietzsche's transfigurations of religion offer resources for a postmodern religious imagination. Though as a "master of suspicion," Nietzsche, with Freud and Marx, is an integral part of modern antireligion, he has the power to take us beyond the flat, modern distinction between the secular and the religious--a distinction that, at the end of modernity, begs to be reexamined.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7sjd2">Contesting Spirit</a><br>
  Abstract: In 1886, at the height of his powers as writer and thinker, Friedrich Nietzsche wrote a series of prefaces for new editions of his early works.¹ As autobiography, they embellish the plain facts of his life; as philosophy, they say more about what Nietzsche was thinking in 1886 than about the early texts with which they are concerned. Still, they disclose a vibrant and paradoxical vision of Nietzsche as a thinker. Read together, the new prefaces narrate the trajectory of Nietzsche’s writing and thinking as a life that transpired between hopeless disillusion and the joy of love’s recovery. In the<br>

  Chapter Six  NIETZSCHE’S AFFIRMATION: from:

  Abstract: Throughout his life, Nietzsche remained wedded to the Schopenhauerian idea that suffering was constitutive of the human condition. As he puts it in
                  Twilight of the Idols, “all becoming and growing . . . postulates pain” (TI: 120). Yet, Nietzschean affirmation takes shape in the resistance to Schopenhauer’s conclusion that the denial of life is the ultimate human response to this condition and that such denial—exemplified in the saint—is definitive of holiness. Nietzsche did not share Schopenhauer’s estimation of the Christian saint, but he nevertheless remained fascinated with the way that the religious virtuoso used renunciation, intoxication, and<br>

  Book Title: The Wind from the East-French Intellectuals, the Cultural Revolution, and the Legacy of the 1960s<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wolin Richard<br>
  Abstract: Wolin's riveting narrative reveals that Maoism's allure among France's best and brightest actually had little to do with a real understanding of Chinese politics. Instead, it paradoxically served as a vehicle for an emancipatory transformation of French society. French student leftists took up the trope of "cultural revolution," applying it to their criticisms of everyday life. Wolin examines how Maoism captured the imaginations of France's leading cultural figures, influencing Sartre's "perfect Maoist moment"; Foucault's conception of power; Sollers's chic, leftist intellectual journal
         Tel Quel; as well as Kristeva's book on Chinese women--which included a vigorous defense of foot-binding.<br>

  Book Title: Charred Lullabies-Chapters in an Anthropography of Violence<br>

  Abstract: How does an ethnographer write about violence? How can he make sense of violent acts, for himself and for his readers, without compromising its sheer excess and its meaning-defying core? How can he remain a scholarly observer when the country of his birth is engulfed by terror? These are some of the questions that engage Valentine Daniel in this exploration of life and death in contemporary Sri Lanka. In 1983 Daniel "walked into the ashes and mortal residue" of the violence that had occurred in his homeland. His planned project--the study of women's folk songs as ethnohistory--was immediately displaced by the responsibility that he felt had been given to him, by surviving family members and friends of victims, to recount beyond Sri Lanka what he had seen and heard there. Trained to do fieldwork by staying in one place and educated to look for coherence and meaning in human behavior, what does an anthropologist do when he is forced by circumstances to keep moving, searching for reasons he never finds? How does he write an ethnography (or an anthropography, to use the author's term) without transforming it into a pornography of violence? In avoiding fattening the anthropography into prurience, how does he avoid flattening it with theory? The ways in which Daniel grapples with these questions, and their answers, instill this groundbreaking book with a rare sense of passion, purpose, and intellect.<br>

  Book Title: Cultures in Flux-Lower-Class Values, Practices, and Resistance in Late Imperial Russia<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Steinberg Mark D.<br>
  Abstract: The authors vividly convey the vitality as well as the contradictions of social life in old regime Russia, while also confronting problems of interpretation, methodology, and cultural theory. They tell of peasant death rites and religious beliefs, family relationships and brutalities, defiant peasant women, folk songs, urban amusement parks, expressions of popular patriotism, the penny press, workers' notions of the self, street hooliganism, and attempts by educated Russians to transform popular festivities. Together, the authors portray popular culture not as a static, separate world, but as the dynamic means through which lower-class Russians engaged the world around them.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7ssdz">Cultures in Flux</a><br>
  Author(s) Worobec Christine D.<br>
  Abstract: In the preindustrial and early industrial worlds, people had to confront death frequently. The average life expectancy was much lower than it is today in developed countries, and sudden death, brought on by epidemics or famine, was a regular phenomenon. Individuals had to deal with the loss of not only the elderly, but also wives, husbands, sisters, brothers, and other adults in the prime of life—as well as children, many of whom died before the age of ten.¹<br>

  Author(s) Morrison Rebecca<br>
  Abstract: This article offers several preliminary views on the sources of Soviet authoritarianism, which I seek to locate within the popular culture of the prerevolutionary peasantry. The essence of my hypothesis rests on a fundamental reality of life in the prerevolutionary Russian countryside: authoritarian relations served as the basic model for all interpersonal relations among peasants, including social relations. This was a result of the fact that the peasantry’s primary social institutions—the family and the commune—were authoritarian, cultivating, through socialization, authoritarian personalities. The Russian peasantry (which accounted for more than 80 percent of Russia’s population in 1917) and Russian<br>

  Author(s) Frank Stephen P.<br>
  Abstract: In an 1889 report on his field studies of Sarapul’skii district, Viatka province, the Russian ethnographer P.M. Bogaevsky noted that peasants who spent time working in cities served as pioneers of urban culture upon returning to their villages. Unfortunately, he added, repeating with dismay an already widespread observation, the rural population had interpreted this culture in the most undesirable manner, thereby allowing it to destroy ancient precepts and customs. Young peasants in particular now regarded with disdain the centuries-old traditions of their grandparents—traditions that had given the Russian peasantry its special form of communal life and shaped its worldview.<br>

As a result of industrialization and the ensuing social changes, an urban mass culture developed that centered on such new media as the cinema or the music hall but that also included older forms of entertainment, like the circus or the fairground. At the same time, the traditional high culture of opera, concert hall, and the fine arts continued to flourish. The war was reflected in the cultural life of Europe in many ways, and for some countries more or less detailed studies have<br>

  Book Title: Slavery and the Culture of Taste-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Gikandi Simon<br>
  Abstract: Gikandi focuses on the ways that the enslavement of Africans and the profits derived from this exploitation enabled the moment of taste in European--mainly British--life, leading to a transformation of bourgeois ideas regarding freedom and selfhood. He explores how these connections played out in the immense fortunes made in the West Indies sugar colonies, supporting the lavish lives of English barons and altering the ideals that defined middle-class subjects. Discussing how the ownership of slaves turned the American planter class into a new aristocracy, Gikandi engages with the slaves' own response to the strange interplay of modern notions of freedom and the realities of bondage, and he emphasizes the aesthetic and cultural processes developed by slaves to create spaces of freedom outside the regimen of enforced labor and truncated leisure.<br>

After spending four ostensibly blissful years in England and the high seas living out a meaningful life as a sailor, a profession that often masked his condition of enslavement, Equiano suddenly found himself back in the belly of the beast that was slavery. Without warning or explanation, his master, Michael Henry Pascal, decided to sell Equiano to a Captain James Doran, who planned to take the African back to the West Indies and the accursed life of plantation slavery.

  Abstract: This book is part history and part ethnography, and it includes a detailed account of everyday life in the treatment of Vietnam veterans with PTSD. To illustrate his points, Young presents a number of fascinating transcripts of the group therapy and diagnostic sessions that he observed firsthand over a period of two years. Through his comments and the transcripts themselves, the reader becomes familiar with the individual hospital personnel and clients and their struggle to make sense of life after a tragic war. One observes that everyone on the unit is heavily invested in the PTSD diagnosis: boundaries between therapist and patient are as unclear as were the distinctions between victim and victimizer in the jungles of Southeast Asia.<br>

This figure emerges at the intersection of three domains—life, labor, and language—unstably unified around, and constituting, a would-be sovereignsubject. The doubling of a transcendental subject and an empirical object and their dynamic and unstable relations defined the form of this being. In 1966, Foucault held an epochal view of Man and of modernity. In his conclusion, Foucault intimated the imminent coming of a new<br>

They are readily inspired by disconfirmed expectations and failed actions and the regrets they evoke.³ In these circumstances, counterfactual scenarios can empower us by making us believe that we could have brought about better outcomes.⁴ When people invent counterfactuals for any of these<br>

  Book Title: Touching the World-Reference in Autobiography<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): EAKIN PAUL JOHN<br>
  Abstract: Paul John Eakin's earlier work Fictions in Autobiography is a key text in autobiography studies. In it he proposed that the self that finds expression in autobiography is in fundamental ways a kind of fictive construct, a fiction articulated in a fiction. In this new book Eakin turns his attention to what he sees as the defining assumption of autobiography: that the story of the self does refer to a world of biographical and historical fact. Here he shows that people write autobiography not in some private realm of the autonomous self but rather in strenuous engagement with the pressures that life in culture entails. In so demonstrating, he offers fresh readings of autobiographies by Roland Barthes, Nathalie Sarraute, William Maxwell, Henry James, Ronald Fraser, Richard Rodriguez, Henry Adams, Patricia Hampl, John Updike, James McConkey, and Lillian Hellman. In the introduction Eakin makes a case for reopening the file on reference in autobiography, and in the first chapter he establishes the complexity of the referential aesthetic of the genre, the intricate interplay of fact and fiction in such texts. In subsequent chapters he explores some of the major contexts of reference in autobiography: the biographical, the social and cultural, the historical, and finally, underlying all the rest, the somatic and temporal dimensions of the lived experience of identity. In his discussion of contemporary theories of the self, Eakin draws especially on cultural anthropology and developmental psychology.<br>

  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): FRIEDMAN SUSAN STANFORD<br>
  Abstract: In this powerful work, Susan Friedman moves feminist theory out of paralyzing debates about us and them, white and other, first and third world, and victimizers and victims. Throughout, Friedman adapts current cultural theory from global and transnational studies, anthropology, and geography to challenge modes of thought that exaggerate the boundaries of gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, class, and national origin. The author promotes a transnational and heterogeneous feminism, which, she maintains, can replace the proliferation of feminisms based on difference. She argues for a feminist geopolitical literacy that goes beyond fundamentalist identity politics and absolutist poststructuralist theory, and she continually focuses the reader's attention on those locations where differences are negotiated and transformed.<br>

  Book Title: Politics and the Imagination-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Geuss Raymond<br>
  Abstract: In politics, utopians do not have a monopoly on imagination. Even the most conservative defenses of the status quo, Raymond Geuss argues, require imaginative acts of some kind. In this collection of recent essays, including his most overtly political writing yet, Geuss explores the role of imagination in politics, particularly how imaginative constructs interact with political reality. He uses decisions about the war in Iraq to explore the peculiar ways in which politicians can be deluded and citizens can misunderstand their leaders. He also examines critically what he sees as one of the most serious delusions of western political thinking--the idea that a human society is always best conceived as a closed system obeying fixed rules. And, in essays on
      Don Quixote, museums, Celan's poetry, Heidegger's brother Fritz, Richard Rorty, and bourgeois philosophy, Geuss reflects on how cultural artifacts can lead us to embrace or reject conventional assumptions about the world. While paying particular attention to the relative political roles played by rule-following, utilitarian calculations of interest, and aspirations to lead a collective life of a certain kind, Geuss discusses a wide range of related issues, including the distance critics need from their political systems, the extent to which history can enlighten politics, and the possibility of utopian thinking in a world in which action retains its urgency.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7t8mt">Politics and the Imagination</a><br>
  Abstract: Nietzsche, as is well known, was trained as a classical philologist, but it is, I think, often insufficiently appreciated that he remained intellectually true to this original choice of professions, albeit in his own highly idiosyncratic way, to the very end of his life. To be sure, from very early on Nietzsche understood “philology” as a discipline that was distinctively “philosophical” both in its method and in its content. The philologist cultivates an art of interpreting ancient monuments of civilization through the exact and subtle reading of obscure and difficult texts, and such practice is the best possible preparation for<br>

The period in Lausanne, which marked the entry of the Senator from Chambéry into political and literary life, has attracted biographers and historians who have had at their disposal abundant information, particularly precious when it throws light on the genesis of his works.

  Abstract: In Paris during the autumn of 1896 William Butler Yeats was introduced to a young Irishman, John Millington Synge. Yeats seldom missed an opportunity to promote Irish nationalism, and he quickly seized on this one, as he relates: “He told me he had learned Irish at Trinity College, so I urged him to go to the Aran Islands and find a life had never been expressed in literature, instead of a life where all been expressed.

  Abstract: In a letter complaining about the composition of
                  Under Milk Wood,Dylan Thomas noted that through “the complicated violence of the words” his comedy was turning into “some savage and devious metaphysical lyric” (SL, 364).¹ The phrase more accurately describes his poetry, which deviously and energetically argues about questions of life and death in a manner that is nevertheless lyrical. Although never a learned thinker,² he was fascinated by thought and by the intensity and intricacy of its operation; that is, he had a passionate mind, which wrestled with ideas and delighted in ingenious means of expressing this conflict.

  Abstract: Throughout this book I have used the ungainly term “unreason” to suggest and to challenge a number of questionable assumptions of modernist theory. In different ways for different poets and critics, unreason is whatever necessitates and permits the unreasonable aggression of poetic argument. It is the special means by which, in Octavio Paz’s phrase, poetry liberates thought; or it is the contradictory ability of thought to think the unthinkable and say the unsayable; or it is the fundamental life of the mind prior to rational organization, whether understood as intuition, experience, subjectivity, or the inner self; or it is the<br>

  Abstract: In 1818 Keats, in distinguishing the sort of “poetical Character” to which he belonged, contrasted it to “the wordsworthian or egotistical sublime; which is a thing per se and stands alone.”¹ The statement seems to define in an important way a certain irreducible attitude in Wordsworth's life and art. Benjamin Haydon, for instance, said that though Wordsworth was a “great Being,” he could use his intense feelings only “as referring to himself.”² Coleridge, indeed, observed as early as 1799 that “Wordsworth appears to me to have hurtfully segregated & isolated his Being/Doubtless, his delights are more deep and sublime;/but he<br>

                     ständige Unganzheit—that continuing incompleteness—seen by Heidegger as an unavoidable limitation of life itself, we might expect the form and purpose of those strivings to reveal themselves, under inspection, as an attempt to overcome or at least to compensate for such fragmentation. We might expect to find that the ceaseless effort discharged into philosophical formulation, interchangeably with the continuously pulsating transformations of spirit into poetic statement, was somehow prompted by the diasparactive condition of our existence.<br>

  Book Title: Milton's Epics and the Book of Psalms-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): RADZINOWICZ MARY ANN<br>
  Abstract: The Psalms were of intense interest to Milton, who read them not only as impassioned voices conveying significant moments in life's journey, but also as examples of various genres, each containing rhetorical and poetical conventions appropriate to the expressive intent of the speaker. In this book Mary Ann Radzinowicz describes the pervasive influence of these biblical works on Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained. She shows that the dramatic moments when Milton's characters respond to the numinous are shaped by his appreciation of the lyricism of the Psalms and by his studies of their thematic relationships.<br>

  INTRODUCTION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7ztqxb">Milton's Epics and the Book of Psalms</a><br>
  Abstract: Milton read the Book of Psalms as the record of a journey through life traversing all the tempers, moods, passions, and uneven reactions that mark the psalmist’s search for an adequate faith. Such a mode of reading was common to Englishmen in his day, guided by the Geneva Bible’s representation of Psalms as a course of life by which “at length [to] atteine to [an] incorruptible crowne of glorie.”¹ Since the journey is not a consistent progress toward enlightenment, individual psalms register backsliding, fear, self-deception, even inadequacy of response no less truly than nobility of spirit.

  Abstract: Generation, here, concerns not only the production of an offspring by two parents; or any asexual productions from one parent, in budding say; or any from none at all, as in spontaneous generation.

  Author(s) Cohen I. Bernard<br>
  Abstract: It is well known that Darwin’s theory of evolution was founded in the first instance on two kinds of observations: the occurrence of variations in animals and plants and the inheritability of such variations. In the opening chapter of the
                  Origin, Darwin refers specifically to the existence of variation among “individuals of the same variety or sub-variety” and to the “endless” “number and diversity of inheritable deviations of structure, both those of slight and those of considerable physiological importance” (pp. 7,12). Since far more individuals are regularly produced than can possibly survive, there is a consequent “struggle for life” or<br>

  Author(s) Acanfora Michele<br>
  Abstract: As is well known, Darwin produced a large number of theories, many of which dealt explicitly with evolution or special aspects of it, and many others of which were closely related to problems in evolution, although the evolutionary aspect was only implicit. Furthermore, throughout his life Darwin varied the emphasis he placed on different processes and mechanisms, and, for some of them, he radically altered his position. In his published works, Darwin hardly ever indicated precisely how any single topic he discussed could or should be connected with other topics, in an overall interpretative framework of evolutionary phenomena.

  Book Title: Beauty and Holiness-The Dialogue Between Aesthetics and Religion<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Martin James Alfred<br>
  Abstract: In this broad historical and critical overview based on a lifetime of scholarship, James Alfred Martin, Jr., examines the development of the concepts of beauty and holiness as employed in theories of aesthetics and of religion. The injunction in the Book of Psalms to "worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness" addressed a tradition that has comprehended holiness primarily in terms of ethical righteousness--a conception that has strongly influenced Western understandings of religion. As the author points out, however, the Greek forbears of Western thought, as well as many Eastern traditions, were and are more broadly concerned with the pursuit of beauty, truth, and goodness as ideals of human excellence, that is, with the "holiness of beauty." In this work Martin describes a philosophical stance that should prove to be most productive for the dialogue between aesthetics and religion.<br>

  3  Brotherhood from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7ztzd7">The Social Vision of William Blake</a><br>
  Abstract: Two metaphors govern nearly all of Blake’s formulations of social life: brotherhood and membership. Membership in a body is one of the most ancient images by which individuals have tried to grasp a sense of belonging to a group, and in various forms it is a central analogy in classical, Christian, and modern political thought. Brotherhood is probably an equally ancient notion—certainly brotherhoods are found in many traditional societies—but while the language of fraternity persists into our day, the idea has attracted only occasional scrutiny by Christian thinkers and virtually none by secular theorists.

  Abstract: Plato presents Lysias as someone who thinks himself able to control all the risks, alarms and inebriations of eros by means of a prodigious emotional calculus. The Lysian strategy of life and love applies to real erotic events a set of tactics that are by now familiar to us. The Lysian nonlover steps aside from the moving current of his beloved’s life and places himself at a point of aesthetic distance. It is the vantage point of the writer. Lysias’ insights on eros are a writer’s insights, and the theory of control he expounds treats the experience of love as<br>

  Abstract: No one in 1623 would have said that Shakespeare’s work marked and embodied some general change in European self-understanding. We often say so now. Portentous and wistful by turns, our talk about Shakespeare habitually sets him between times, last witness for the old, first prophet of the new, a genius of the divided vision and a symbol of our own life on the margins of tradition. Commonplaces can be false, of course, but the proof of this one is repetition, not only iteration of such judgments about Shakespeare’s place in history, but our constant recurrence to his texts, which have<br>

On one hand, as his career ripened, he perfected what Marlowe had begun, producing a supple and evocative blank verse after a remarkably short time and creating a decorous stratification of style that mirrors the social standing of its speakers, with particularly brilliant effect in
                  Midsummer Night’s Dream. The only play Shakespeare wrote that contains no audibly distinguishable low-life characters at all isTroilus and Cressida, which is his purest expression of satire in the innovative humanist manner. Thersites rails in prose in that play, but for all his<br>

  Abstract: Aristotle, we might say, contributed to Greek civilization, Burke to the ferment following the French Revolution, both to our understanding of political theory, the human condition, or the political life. In so saying we use the term ‘contribution’ in rather different senses, the first two of which are, if trite, unexceptionable insofar as they refer to tangible quantitative phenomena. The third occasion of use is interesting and dubious. For it is not entirely clear how any thinker contributes, in any significant sense of the word, to an abstraction such as the political life.

  Abstract: “The Dreamers” was probably the first story of Seven Gothic Tales tohave been written after Dinesen returned to Rungstedlund, having left her African life behind her. And since she did nothing to discourage a comparison between herself and Pellegrina Leoni, the story’s mysterious central figure, we might suppose that this particular tale had a special significance for its author. Like Pellegrina, Dinesen had suffered loss by fire, had attempted suicide¹ and was forced to leave behind a life which had seemed perfectly resonant of her deepest self. Also like her heroine,Dinesen ever after mistrusted investing herself fully in one persona.In<br>

  Chapter 2  HISTORY AS AN ART OF THE IMAGINATION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvdgf">History as a Visual Art in the Twelfth-Century Renaissance</a><br>
  Abstract: Every study has its fascination. The fascination of history is power. In one aspect, power is wielded over the outer world of human destinies, over the conditions and possibilities of life itself. Histories of politics and war are among the branches of inquiry devoted to this aspect. In another, power is represented in the inner world, where mind and heart imagine what they have sought in the physical world and what it has disclosed to them. Investigation into the inner world has unfolded into histories of religions, of ideas, and (not least) moralities, apart from many other forms.<br>

  Book Title: I Am You-The Hermeneutics of Empathy in Western Literature, Theology and Art<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Morrison Karl F.<br>
  Abstract: Important trends in contemporary intellectual life celebrate difference, divisiveness, and distinction. Speculative writing increasingly highlights "hermeneutic gaps" between human beings, their histories, and their hopes. In this book Karl Morrison identifies an alternative to this disruption. He explores for the first time the entire legacy of thought revolving around the challenging claim "I am you"--perhaps the most concise possible statement of bonding through empathy. Professor Morrison shows that the hope for thoroughgoing understanding and inclusion in another's world view is central to the West's moral/intellectual tradition. He maintains that the West may yet escape the fatal flaw of casting that hope in paradigms of sexual and aesthetic dominance--examples of empathetic participation inspired by hunger for power, as well as by love.<br>

  FOURTEEN  NO NO NANA: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvn6q">Neverending Stories</a><br>
  Author(s) Mickelsen David<br>
  Abstract: Nana, Emile Zola’s 1880 portrayal of courtesan life during the Second Empire, is a novel dominated by sustained waiting. Readers of novels, especially nineteenth-century readers and readers of nineteenth-century novels, have been schooled to seek closure—to overcome gaps, domesticate the unfamiliar, establish connections and coherence, understand motives, and anticipate climax. InNanaone can indeed engage these goals, but only at a relatively general level; the text prevents a narrower application of that understanding, despite the personal focus implied by eponymy. For all its proliferation of data, this novel expands without quite filling out a portrait of Nana herself.<br>

  Abstract: The language world of Bal1 is one of remarkable richness and diversity in all its spoken, written, sung, and chanted manifestations. So various are the different linguistic forms employed, so complex the interweaving of vocal styles and literary genres, that both language and literature seem a tangled confusion that escapes characterization and conceals both sources and structures. Yet this linguistic proliferation is indeed like a richly woven fabric, no matter how complex the design, a discemable warp and weft underlie its form and provide essential unity.<br>

  Abstract: Most readers naturally assume that all autobiographies are based on the verifiable facts of a life history, and it is this referential dimension, imperfectly understood, that has checked the development of a poetics of autobiography. Historians and social scientists attempt to isolate the factual content of autobiography from its narrative matrix, while literary critics, seeking to promote the appreciation of autobiography as an imaginative art, have been willing to treat such texts as though they were indistinguishable from novels. Autobiographers themselves, of course, are responsible for the problematical reception of their work, for they perform willy-nilly both as artists and<br>

Awakened by the ticket-collector, the child admits that he has neither ticket nor money, not even an identity card. To save himself, he reveals that his presence is urgently required in Dijon; the fate of France and even mankind itself hangs in the balance. Like Scheherazade, the child instinctively recognizes that his life depends on words: as long as he keeps on talking, the ticket-collector will not make him get off the train. He never learns, however, whether or not his claim to an<br>

  Abstract: The collapse of human structures, when subjected to unremitting natural forces, troubles Conrad’s imagination more than it does Hardy’s. Despite the bleakness of Hardy’s outlook—his view of life as an inherently unsanctioned process, an empty sequence of happenstances—he retained an enabling attachment (however complicated) to his native Dorset countryside. He absorbed its legends, its history, its customs, its landscape; and these absorptions may account for the modulated tone of even his darkest utterances. He is not surprised, his tone keeps repeating, because what is human history if not the immemorial story of expectation drained dry by time’s passage?<br>

Lawrence seeks to center identity on flame-life (he even sees the surrounding world of matter, the sun and the moon, as derived from flame-life),¹ and the goal of the Lawrentian protagonist is as simple as it is elusive: to achieve the mobile flame-life of pure being.

He spent those years finding and then defending his identity from his culture’s claims upon it.¹ His culture conspired to make him other, to coerce him into signing its testimonials.

  Abstract: Twentieth-century existential thinkers, critical of traditional, overly rationalistic approaches to ethics, sought to provide a better account of what it means to be human in the world. They articulated ethical views that respected the individual yet were fundamentally concerned with the Other and the ethical value of an authentic life. Their philosophy has often been dismissed as unsuccessful.<br>

  Abstract: EO Wilson, in his provocative essay “Back From Chaos” (

Wilson prophesies that the understanding of this fundamental unity is the key that may lead humankind away from the brink of self-destruction, not only of ourselves but of the myriad life forms with which we share our celestial home. His thesis is that ongoing fragmentations of knowledge are not reflections of the real world but “artifacts of scholarship.”<br>

In the interrelated socio-political, linguistic, and narratological contexts I have examined, voice reconfigures itself as the embodied reality to which subjects in conversation and debate lend their own voices. By extending my investigation to an analysis of Milton's revolutionary conception of history as conversation, I have demonstrated that the view of history as exemplary and challenging to life coincides with and anticipates what will hardly<br>

  Book Title: Living Prism-Itineraries in Comparative Literature<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): KUSHNER EVA<br>
  Abstract: She discusses the current state of comparative literary studies and the renewed role of comparative literature in a world that is at once more plural and more globalized, as well as some of the debates now taking place within literary criticism as a whole, including the interchange between comparative literature and cultural studies, the re-envisaging of the Renaissance, the work of Northrop Frye, myth and literature at the end of the twentieth century, modern drama, and post-colonialism. To play an important role in the human sciences, comparative literature had first to free itself of a number of restrictive habits, such as an insufficiently critical literary history. In order to do this, it had to think theoretically, but without yielding to the temptation of letting theory become an end in itself. Kushner demonstrates that, while under strong pressures to be a more rigourous science, comparative literature has realized that in the human sciences the validation of knowledge has to seek its own tests and criteria, becoming increasingly more open to individuality, difference, and life situations and controlling its tendency to universalize. With its emphasis on whether literary history is possible and the problems it raises for literary theory and for comparative literature in particular, The Living Prism adds an important dimension to the ongoing debate about criticism and comparative literary studies.<br>

Because interest groups of all kinds have proliferated since the 1960s, they now are often in vigorous competition with each other, as well as with political parties, in the policy-making process.

  Abstract: Where Eliot's poetry is dominated by cultural, religious, and philosophical anxiety, Stevens' is bright, witty, and playful - and commonly dismissed as superficial. Surette demonstrates the seriousness of Stevens' life-long engagement with the modern dilemma of disbelief, showing that he, like Eliot, rejected the Humanist resolution. Surette proceeds by juxtaposing the two poets' responses in poetry and prose to the same texts and events: Marianne Moore's poetry, the Great War, Humanists and anti-Humanists, the Franco-Mexican Humanist Ramon Fernandez, Pure Poetry, and, finally, the gathering war clouds of the late 1930s.<br>

  4  Rethinking Western Culture from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt809f7">The Modern Dilemma</a><br>
  Abstract: Eliot regretted the failure of the belief that had permeated European and American culture, but he did not evidently share Stevens’ distaste for having “to think all these things over,” and persisted in a search for an unqualified belief. Like many converts, once baptized, Eliot led a much more pious and dutiful religious life than most of his fellow Anglicans. He apparently needed a degree of certainty that, as he told Montgomery Belgion,¹ his study of Bradley had not provided.<br>

  Sounding the Path: from:

  Author(s) Castro Ricardo L.<br>
  Abstract: Our life is marked by continuous movement through space. Standing upright, on two legs, and looking forward contributes to our mobility and has a significant influence on our existential condition. The act of moving is an everyday affair that acquires a poetic dimension in creative domains such as dance, theatre, literature, and architecture. Paths constitute the basic physical support for movement. As one of the first and most basic communal manifestations of humankind, they also link us to other species whose existential movements leave definite traces (paths) on the landscape.<br>

  Author(s) Reeh Henrik<br>
  Abstract: Towards the end of the second millennium, the issue of whether fragmentation is part of modernity is no longer in dispute. In many spheres of human endeavour and perception, phenomena linked with fragmentation express a general diversification in social and cultural life. One only has to think of the social division of labour which has distanced architecture from engineering, and both of these professions from urban studies in the social sciences as well as in the humanities. Furthermore, fragmentation has had profound spatial consequences, since privately owned parcels of space are used for construction rather independently of one another. In<br>

The briefest glance at any one of the hundreds of plates given in bequest to the Bibliothèque Royale will bear witness to his great skill. During a lifetime dedicated to the representation of architecture and its historical allegories, ornamental drawings were Lequeu’s principal means of expression. Many scholars have come to see, in the eyes and hands of this late-eighteenth/early-nineteenth-century

  Abstract: One consequence of Humphries’ first autobiography,

As Janet Frame says in her story “Prizes” (1963), “Life is hell, but at least there are prizes.”¹ She should know: winning the Hubert Church Award for her story collectionThe Lagoon(1951) saved her from a forced leucotomy. For Frame the prize had a consequence, whereas for Humphries the prize was a consequence, yet each prize was a take in an Aristotelian absurdity of cause and effect. Whether Humphries’ life is hell, only Humphries can say; but if Jean-Paul Sartre’s character Garcin<br>

  Abstract: These words, a journal entry of 1844, could be inscribed as the motto above everything Kierkegaard wrote. Not that he did not yearn and seek after unity, and find it in the experience of Christian faith/love. But his fundamental conviction was that any unity, however arrived at, which erased, “annulled,” or even blurred “life's doubleness” would lead to the loss of freedom and to the absorption and destruction of the human individual, of human “existence.” This duality is at the base<br>

                  Works of Love(1847), he confides to his journal, “That which has made my life so strenuous but also full of discoveries is that I ... have had to choose decision infinitely. ... In the decisions of the spirit, one can make up one’s mind freely. ... To ’be compelled” is the<br>

  Book Title: Knight-Monks of Vichy France-Uriage, 1940-1945<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): HELLMAN JOHN<br>
  Abstract: In The Knight-Monks of Vichy France John Hellman describes the founding, operation, transformation, and demise of the school, details the institution's ideological and political struggles with other segments of French society, and deals with the remarkable rise of Uriage ideas and alumni in postwar France. By focusing on the social, philosophical, and psychological concepts propounded by the staff of the school, Hellman has produced the first study that shows the École Nationale des Cadres d'Uriage to have been an original educational and group experience which inspired French youth from very different backgrounds to abandon the liberal democratic tradition for a new political and social vision. Drawing on a variety of sources, including interviews, newly available archival material, Vichy publications, correspondence, and diary entries, Hellman contributes to the current, lively debate concerning the phenomenon of collaboration and the response of the French population to fascism and to the occupation during the Second World War. This book will be of particular interest to readers concerned with the intellectual and political life of modern France, modern religious thought and experience, fascism and the Vichy regime, changes in France in the prewar and postwar periods, and the "third way" political option in contemporary Europe.<br>

  Abstract: During the second half of 1941 the École Nationale des Cadres d’Uriage was, for its admirers, the flagship of the National Revolution, the first school in the land, the training centre of France’s new elites. But was Uriage during its heyday in fact the truly national institution its title implied? Who was studying and teaching there? What was their daily life, and their real relationship with the Vichy government? What was the actual agenda of Dunoyer de Segonzac and his staff — for example, with regard to Vichy’s youth movements, or toward modern women? How should history judge the Uriage experience?<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter I study Karl Polanyi’s reflection on the role of ethics in the making of society and in the social scientific understanding of it. Polanyi, who in his personal life was greatly inspired by Leo Tolstoy,¹ was not a philosopher in the strict sense. Yet he believed that as a social and political thinker he had to articulate his intuitions regarding the ethical foundation of human thought and action. He first did so as a young man in the Vienna of the 1920s while struggling against his depression over the useless killing of the Great War. As Polanyi<br>

  Abstract: It is not surprising that Antoine de Saint-Exupéry would demonstrate a penchant for aphoristic discourse, in light of his early attraction to Nietzsche and his lifelong admiration for Pascal. Whether it is a question of influence or simple affinity matters little for our purposes here; suffice it to say that we are often reminded of the sententiousaphoristic style of these two predecessors as we read Saint-Exupéry’s text. The most clear-cut manifestation of the style in question occurs in Saint-Exupéry’s highly aphoristic

  Author(s) Verdon John<br>
  Abstract: That higher life forms exist in the two physical categories of female and male is universally self-evident and is not of itself a problem. Beyond this basic understanding, however, the two sexes become associated with a vast panorama of cultural phenomena, including categorical ascriptions of social roles, behavioural expectations, and personality characteristics. How does the simple, incontrovertible, and universal fact of biological dimorphism generate the staggering complexity of cultural, social, and psychological dynamics of the human condition? It is the translation of the biological into social/cultural experience that is the heart of an epistemology of gender. An elaboration of the<br>

  Abstract: The second volume of a series, especially if it deals with a very young girl, is the hardest for me to write—because the public and the publisher won’t allow me to write of a young girl as she really is. One can write of children as they always are; so my books of children are always good; but when you come to write of the “miss” you have to depict a sweet, insipid young thing—really a child grown older—to whom the basic realities of life and reactions to them are quite unknown.

  Abstract: The poems that Matthew Arnold addressed to Arthur Hugh Clough in life and death, most notably “The Scholar Gipsy” and “Thyrsis,” make these poets the
                  dioscuriof nineteenth century English literature, as securely twinned as Castor and Pollux. There is, of course, a conventionally acknowledged difference: Arnold is major-canonical, while Clough, until recently at least, has been regarded as minor, generally no more than a footnote to his younger friend.¹ In 1849, the year of the composition of the majority of Arnold’s “Switzerland” lyrics and Clough’s epistolary novel in verse,Amours de Voyage, they were pretty much on a footing<br>

                  Il. T.40, 22.170;Od. I.66). Ancient piety rested on a foundation of killing, death, and eating.

  Abstract: Even in his later years, when he had withdrawn from much of his former active involvement in political life, Merleau-Ponty continued to think about politics, in the sense both of general political theory and of the particular concrete problems of his day. Theory and practice were for him, as for many French intellectuals, ultimately inseparable: the position we take on particular practical problems (such as the relations of France and Europe as a whole with the USA) must be determined by a general theoretical view of the kind of society we want to create. In turn, his political theory can<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter we analyze the general epistemological conditions for knowability and explicability of the universe as a whole. Both knowability and explicability imply an anthropological dimension in cosmology, for both these requirements have human origin: to speculate about the universe one must experience its presence through the instantaneous synthesis associated with conscious life. It is argued that the cosmological principle acts as reduction of this synthesis to a mental spatial uniformity of the universe. However, the contingent facticity of the cosmological principle leads to the necessity of its explication in terms of generative steps required to grasp the sense<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9m0t0m">Augustine's Theology of Preaching</a><br>
  Abstract: Augustine holds a foundational place in the development of the Christian sermon. This is partly due to the fact that he began life as a professional teacher of rhetoric. His conversion led to him being changed from a professor of rhetoric into a Christian preacher. His unique experiences put him in the position of being able to offer self-conscious reflection upon the nature of preaching and its relationship to oration. The fruit of this is seen in

  Abstract: Augustine’s preaching does not merely make frequent reference to death and resurrection: it is saturated with a thorough-going emphasis upon the end of mortal life. A case study upon this theme of death and resurrection permits us to examine how Augustine appealed to interiority and temporality when applying Scripture to this important concern. It is our intention in this chapter to expose the methods Augustine used in a way which demonstrates empathy for his approach. Just as we have selected the topic of death and resurrection because it is so prevalent in his preaching, so the aspects of that preaching<br>

  Book Title: Christian Doctrine and the Grammar of Difference-A Contribution to Feminist Systematic Theology<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): McRandal Janice<br>
  Abstract: Christian Doctrine and the Grammar of Difference argues that the most potent and resourceful theological response to the challenging questions of gender and difference is to be found in a retrieval of a doctrinal framework for feminist theology. In particular, it is suggested that a doctrinal narrative of creation, fall, and redemption—underpinned by the doctrinal grammar of the Trinity—provides resources to resolve the theological impasse of difference in contemporary feminist theology. The divine economy reveals a God who enters into history and destabilizes fixed binaries and oppressive categories. The biblical narrative discloses a subtle yet potent fluidity to the Triune relationships. As created subjects—precisely in our difference—we are sustained, affirmed, and drawn back into the Triune life. The subtleties of divine transgression are already recognized in the patterns of the liturgy, in prayer, and in practices of contemplation. Here, bodies not only encounter the transgressive love of God but are enabled to inhabit their differentiated humanity with distinctiveness and grace. The grammar of Christian faith cannot ultimately be uncovered except in prayer, opened beyond itself to a source of life and giving.<br>

  Author(s) Manzo J. L.<br>
  Abstract: Hunger and famine were powerful images to the people of the ancient Near East. In Palestine, an abundant harvest depended on an adequate water surplus. On a land that experienced frequent droughts, hunger and famine meant suffering and loss of life. According to the biblical text, hunger stalked Abraham (Gen. 12:10), Isaac (26:1), Joseph (41:27, 54), David (2 Sam. 21:1), Elijah (1 Kgs. 18:2), and Elisha (2 Kgs. 4:38; 8:1). We also learned that Israel experienced physical hunger in the wilderness (Exod. 16:3) and that hunger was a prominent image in Hebrew poetry (Ps. 107:5, 9, 26; Neh. 9:1). This<br>

  Abstract: Repeatedly, the prophets proclaim the foreboding message that people, animals, and the land will be made to suffer by God because of the iniquities committed by some members within the human community. One of the divine chastisements to be suffered is drought, which will inevitably lead to hunger and starvation for all communities of life, most of whom will suffer the direct consequences of a few who have misused and abused their power and have violated right relationship. This essay explores Jeremiah 14:1-9, “The Great Drought,” in its own context and then in the context of contemporary times, where the<br>

  5  Social and Theological Aspects of Hunger in Sirach from:

  Abstract: Ben Sira was a scribe who lived and worked in Jerusalem in the late third and early second centuries bce, when Judea was under the rule first of the Ptolemies and then the Seleucids. While his primary mode of instruction was oral, near the end of his life, perhaps around 180 bce, he set his teachings into written form.¹ Ben Sira’s work is characteristic of “traditional wisdom” and he was deeply influenced by the book of Proverbs in both form and content. While the focus here will be on the role of hunger in Ben Sira’s thought, it will be<br>

  Author(s) Perkins Miriam Y.<br>
  Abstract: Meaningful understanding, often called “interpretation” in academic contexts, is vital throughout seminary education. Interpretation is deliberative exploration and creative expression of fruitful encounter. It is essential to understanding scripture texts, historical sources and artifacts, theological writers across time, and real-time conversations about ethical, spiritual, and pastoral matters. The finding and sharing of insight involved in interpretation is always shaped by encounters between ourselves and what we read, ourselves and other people, and our own life experiences and the presence of God.<br>

  Book Title: Postmodernity and Univocity-A Critical Account of Radical Orthodoxy and John Duns Scotus<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Horan Daniel P.<br>
  Abstract: Nearly twenty-five years ago, John Milbank inaugurated Radical Orthodoxy, one of the most significant and influential theological movements of the last two decades. In Milbank’s Theology and Social Theory, he constructed a sweeping theological genealogy of the origins of modernity and the emergence of the secular, counterposed by a robust retrieval of traditional orthodoxy as the critical philosophical and theological mode of being in the postmodern world. That genealogy turns upon a critical point—the work of John Duns Scotus as the starting point of modernity and progenitor of a raft of philosophical and theological ills that have prevailed since. Milbank’s account has been disseminated proliferously through Radical Orthodoxy and even beyond and is largely uncontested in contemporary theology. The present volume conducts a comprehensive examination and critical analysis of Radical Orthodoxy’s use and interpretation of John Duns Scotus. Daniel P. Horan, OFM, offers a substantial challenge to the narrative of Radical Orthodoxy’s idiosyncratic take on Scotus and his role in ushering in the philosophical age of the modern. This volume not only corrects the received account of Scotus but opens a constructive way forward toward a positive assessment and appropriation of Scotus’s work for contemporary theology.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9m0vtn">Consider Leviathan</a><br>
  Abstract: Job’s Friends are infamous for their attempts to comfort Job, and the broad strokes of their arguments are well known: righteous behavior produces a life of harmony and prosperity while wickedness causes sure ruin. In truth, however, the notion that the Friends represent a single viewpoint or argumentative strategy is not exactly borne out by a close reading of the text.¹ Rather, the Friends offer a storm of conflicting viewpoints. Here are two of them: First, there is the “Deuteronomistic,”² or “Proverbial” strategy—life is a type of cosmic math equation (framed as a covenant) in which excellent moral choice<br>

  Abstract: In this final chapter I turn to the intersection of ecology, politics, and the role of the specifically Joban “self” in the creation of new possibilities for Israel’s existence in the sixth to fifth centuries bce. In the previous two chapters I have argued that this Joban “self” is a rather insecure entity, torn among several competing fragments of ancient Israelite self-making projects. The Friends’ alluring nature-response covenant posited that Job’s suddenly stunted economic life and blistered body came by way of a morally disobedient self. Job had sinned, and the world reacted.

  Abstract: Infertility affects some 8 to 14 percent of the fertility aged population worldwide (Bentley and Mascie-Taylor 2000). Many of the affected individuals seek medical assistance in their attempts to found families. Others, often after having exhausted and “failed” this option, opt for child adoption. Though popularly perceived of as the heart of one’s private life, both these routes to family founding—fertility treatments and adoption—are tightly regulated by state policies.<br>

  Book Title: Culture, Rhetoric and the Vicissitudes of Life-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Carrithers Michael<br>
  Abstract: Inspired by the Rhetoric Culture Project, this volume focuses on the use of imagery, narrative, and cultural schemes to deal with predicaments that arise during the course of life. The contributors explore how people muster their resources to understand and deal with emergencies such as illness, displacement, or genocide. In dealing with such circumstances, people can develop new rhetorical forms and, in the process, establish new cultural resources for succeeding generations. Several of the contributions show how rhetorical cultural forms can themselves create emergencies. The contributors bring expertise from a variety of disciplines, including anthropology and communications studies, underlining the volume's wider relevance as a reflection on the human condition.<br>

  Author(s) Biesele Megan<br>
  Abstract: A rhetorical subtitle for this paper might be ‘The Ubiquity of Persuasion in Medicine’. As in most other areas of human life, it is difficult, in healing performance and discourse, to get away from the primacy of nuanced communication about socialized belief. Thinking back some twelve years after my original writing in light of both anthropological work on Ju/’hoan San texts of many kinds and the complex indigenous politics which increasingly inform their production and use, I feel that social anthropology is nothing if not combined with rhetorical awareness.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qcj2p">Culture, Rhetoric and the Vicissitudes of Life</a><br>
  Author(s) Basso Ellen B.<br>
  Abstract: There is a kind of rhetorical functioning in the disorderly zones of human life, which sustains and transforms the persons involved. Linguistic operations at the edges of disorder appear as we engage our human deceptive and imaginative abilities, our abilities to produce alternatives, to resist what we learn is expected of us. In these zones, discomfort with the limits of our own cultures motivates tropological experiments, ‘the sleight of hand at the limit of a text’, as Voloshinov wrote. Here especially, the rhetorics of emotion work to transform socioemotional reality, having a critical and often unwitting impact on social life.<br>

  Author(s) Hardtwig Wolfgang<br>
  Abstract: When addressing the public, the academic discipline of history has recently been facing unprecedented competition. Television broadcasts and series have been presenting the history of Nazi and post-war Germany in a manner appealing to a broader audience. Motion pictures tell stories from the Third Reich, the air raids and post-war life. Documentaries are in great demand. They offer an attractive combination of solid research, eyewitness interviews, a moving soundtrack and contemporary photographs and filmstrips (Benz 1986; Knopp and Quandt 1988; Bösch 1999: 204–18). As demonstrated by Steven Spielberg’s

  Abstract: In 2005, Germans encountered Albert Einstein virtually everywhere. The jubilee of his
                  annus mirabilis, 1905, when he published three epochal discoveries, among them the special theory of relativity, brought Einstein to the title pages of all major journals and magazines. A government campaign using the physicist’s quotations and portrait encouraged Germans to become actively involved in cultural, scientific and public life. People queued for hours at the entrance of an Einstein exhibition at the famous Kronprinzenpalais, Berlin, which was one of several important exhibitions about the scientist.

  Abstract: It may seem odd to compare the cultural phenomenon of stardom with politics, and probe the extent to which stardom and a star system might exist here too. In approaching French politics in this way, however, we can shed light on its very singular nature, its preoccupation with the personalisation of leadership, and on how de Gaulle – the biggest star since Napoleon – influenced French politics. In one sense, as regards our study of the 1950s and 1960s, de Gaulle was the biggest star of them all: in 1958, he returned to public life after twelve years in obscurity; was hailed<br>

  Abstract: The two essays in Part III find human actors immersed in worlds of categories and things, of identities and relationships that take on classificatory forms. Indeed, in these chapters ethnographic attention is focused on the very thing-iness of human social existence: on our seeming modern fetish of inventing new things – ‘entifying’ – whereby life can become further specialized and commodified (Chapter 6); and on people treated as kinds of things, valued according to where they happen to have been born (Chapter 5). But it is also true to say that here are the human capacities to reflect on the<br>

  Abstract: The most compelling aspect of Charismatic and Pentecostal ritual is not its repertoire of specific ritual practices such as speaking in tongues, laying on of hands, or resting in the Spirit. It is not the inventory of ritual events such as prayer meetings, healing services, or revival meetings. Neither is it the integrated system of ritual language genres including prophecy, prayer, teaching, and witnessing. What is most compelling is the manner in which ritual performance has the potential, for individuals and communities, to bring about the transformation of everyday life, to generate a new habitus, indeed to subsume quotidian practices<br>

  Abstract: In his book
                  The Theater of Truth,Egginton(2010) argues that the principal theoretical value of the term “Baroque” derives from its relation as an aesthetic category to the historical period of modernity. While the historical Baroque relies on proliferation of décor and a conscious embrace of artifice, it also reveals an organizing logic that goes beyond that specific age (the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries). This organizing logic is a theatrical one, where the space of representation is severed into a “screen of appearances,” and the truth is presumed to reside behind it. It is this basic premise, divided between<br>

If a death is thought to have been needless—or worse, politically motivated—mourning may well take on the trappings of public protest.

Would not arrival at the camps offer relief from suffocation and stench in the trains? Preparations for arrival at the camp, and the process of unloading, prompted some deportees to return to the hopes they had when the journey began.

  Abstract: Shakespeare’s interest in the ways that rhetorical discourse and culture interact is expressed in his countless references to the similarity between living and acting, and in his fascination with the figures of the actor, the hypocrite, and the king, the man most conspicuously called upon to perform a part in the drama of life. The comparison of the world with the stage is of course an ancient one, and one that runs through all of English Renaissance drama from the mid-sixteenth century to 1642, the year the theaters were closed down, not to reopen until 1660.

  Book Title: Young Men in Uncertain Times-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Dyck Noel<br>
  Abstract: Anthropology is particularly well suited to explore the contemporary predicament in the coming of age of young men. Its grounded and comparative empiricism provides the opportunity to move beyond statistics, moral panics, or gender stereotypes in order to explore specific aspects of life course transitions, as well as the similar or divergent barriers or opportunities that young men in different parts of the world face. Yet, effective contextualization and comparison cannot be achieved by looking at male youths in isolation. This volume undertakes to contextualize male youths' circumstances and to learn about their lives, perspectives, and actions, and in turn illuminates the larger structures and processes that mediate the experiences entailed in becoming young men. The situation of male youths provides an important vantage point from which to consider broader social transformations and continuities. By paying careful attention to these contexts, we achieve a better understanding of the current influences encountered and acted upon by young people.<br>

  Chapter 3  Institutionalizing an Extended Youth Phase in Chinese Society: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qddtx">Young Men in Uncertain Times</a><br>
  Author(s) Pan Tianshu<br>
  Abstract: Throughout most of Chinese history, males—and especially sons—have comprised the preferred social category in which parents strove to develop emotional and ethical obligation. This relationship has constituted the fundamental value orientation by which Chinese society has traditionally organized itself. But the 1949 communist transformation of society, especially urban life, profoundly altered the parent-son dyad, and in its place the parent-daughter bond became increasingly paramount. Even in the countryside, where the parent-son relationship and the patrilineal principle remained sociological constants, a transformation took place by the late twentieth century. Increasingly, urbanites and some rural residents (Shi 2009; Yan 2003)<br>

  Author(s) Steiner André<br>
  Abstract: The Europeanization of economic life is not a new phenomenon in recent history. Traders have consistently been connected throughout the various parts of Europe, and the emergence of the modern nation-state did not bring transnational economic activities to an end. The first multinationals emerged in Europe in the second half of the nineteenth century, and their economic importance further increased in the twentieth century. But the attempt to create a transnational economic area with supranational institutions was successful for the first time only after the Second World War. Western European integration began as an economic process with the Marshall Plan,<br>

  Author(s) Segel Harold B.<br>
  Abstract: The Russian writer Mikhail Kuzmin was an active participant in Saint Petersburg’s lively cabaret life in the early years of the twentieth century. Besides songs and dramatic skits, he also wrote pantomime. One of his pantomimes,
                  Dukhov den v Toledo(All Souls’ Day in Toledo), was staged apparently only once, on 23 March 1915, at the Moscow Kamerny Theater under the direction of Aleksandr Tairov. The pantomime had in fact been commissioned by Tairov so that the season in which it was performed would have at least one pantomime, given the contemporary interest in nonverbal drama.

  9  Belgian Images of the Psycho-Pedagogical Potential of the Congolese during the Colonial Era, 1908–1960 from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qdwdd">Between Educationalization and Appropriation</a><br>
  Author(s) Depaepe M.<br>
  Abstract: It would be unfortunate if ISCHE, the international organization for the history of education, did not heed the colonial experience. Not only is this theme of research international by definition, it is also clearly an educational phenomenon of the first order: by means of education, the intention was to “convert” and to “civilize” the autochthons, which, willingly or unwillingly, was accompanied by the imposition of a number of elements of the “Western” way of life and thought.¹<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qdwdd">Between Educationalization and Appropriation</a><br>
  Author(s) Depaepe M.<br>
  Abstract: In a previous study the author and his co-author compared the educational project in the Belgian Congo (1908-1960) with a runaway locomotive that, in spite of all the good intentions, drove to self-destruction (Depaepe & Van Rompaey, 1995:225). What did we intend by use of this image taken from Emile Zola’s novel
                  La bête humaine(1890)? Rather than wanting to breathe new life into the stereotypical, often leftist-revisionist coloured discourse of the ‘missionary as an accomplice to a cohort that was out for economic profit’ (Rodney, 1976), we found that colonial educational historiography, more sharply still than Western educational history, exposes<br>

  Author(s) Depaepe M.<br>
  Abstract: “My life in the history of education” – to borrow the title of a recent British series of scholarly autobiographies¹ – began with a lively interest in educational practice. I became interested in the organization of the subject-based grade-school system and wished to find its origins. This was an organizational form introduced for reasons not particularly educational, and it persisted chiefly because of the order and efficiency to which it gave rise.² My work was both a form of educational criticism and a demonstration of the relevance of the history of education to educational science, practice, and policy.<br>

  Author(s) MEUWESE Martine<br>
  Abstract: Whereas miniatures or historiated initials generally attempt to illustrate the relevant text, marginal images need not do so. The abundant marginal decorations in psalters and prayer books are often text-independent, for they usually do not illustrate the accompanying religious text. In the margins artists could indulge their imagination, reverse roles, and even mock the authority of Christian doctrine. Marginal themes may refer to the accompanying text, to works of ‘literature’ such as sermons, romances, fables and bestiaries, but also to the activities of daily life such as hunting or children’s play, or to a whole range of oral discourse, whether<br>

  Abstract: In 1461 both France and England had a new king. Louis XI of France succeeded his father in July; Edward IV, of the house of York, had defeated his predecessor, of the house of Lancaster, in March and was crowned in June. The change of dynasty in England owed much to the greatest magnate in the country, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, who because of this and his later political activities is known today as ‘the Kingmaker’.

  Abstract: In our “enlightened” times, the concept of dogma has acquired a rather negative connotation. Most people seem to believe that we should not accept dogma(ta) without constant, or at least potential critical reflection¹. Even so, dogma continues to be relied upon in certain areas of life where we strive for a form of authoritative certitude, such as religion, or law. It seems as if our quest for stability here warrants the use of a modus of a thought that builds upon a set of premises that are accepted without constant critical re-examination, as authoritative.

  Abstract: Most Muslim societies lack a well established regime of human rights, and the more religious they are, the weaker is that regime. this needs to be explained. the explanation is to be found at various levels, such as the history of these societies, their level of economic development, their inequalities and injustices, their colonial history, contemporary international context, and the critical resources of Islam.

  Abstract: Freifunk is an assemblage of a friction–filled multiplicity of interests and effects of technology use in everyday life in the twenty–first century. It is a community that originates in Berlin, a particular form of social movement, and a specific technological approach to computer networking. The tale of Freifunk’s emergence and distillation tells of a process in which the everyday tactics of solving one’s own problems (in this case, a lack of Internet access) are integrated with a more general strategy of political subversion. Thus it is also a tale of how technical appropriation becomes a sociotechnical subversion. To<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qf7xj">Synthetic Biology and Morality</a><br>
  Author(s) Lustig Andrew<br>
  Abstract: Synthetic biology is the field whose aim is “to extend or modify the behavior of organisms and engineer them to perform new tasks” (Andrianantoandro et al. 2006).¹ Descriptions of the field vary, of course, but generally, synthetic biology involves one of two approaches: building living organisms from raw materials, and building organisms from parts already found in living organisms. The first “uses unnatural molecules to reproduce emergent behaviors from natural biology, with the goal of creating artificial life,” and the second “seeks interchangeable parts from natural biology to assemble into systems that function unnaturally” (Benner and Sismour 2005).<br>

  Abstract: Synthetic biology is the attempt to “engineer complex artificial biological systems to investigate natural biological phenomena and for a variety of applications” (Andrianantoandro et al. 2006; see also Endy 2005). We will use the expression “synthetic life-forms” to refer to the different kinds of synthetic organisms produced in synthetic biology laboratories. These organisms today are typically various kinds of genetically modified bacteria. Even if most (or even all) of the material in a synthetic life-form comes from natural forms of life, we still consider it to be “synthetic” because it is produced through the intentional activity of laboratory scientists.

  Author(s) Jennings Bruce<br>
  Abstract: Perhaps the fundamental question before us in science policy today involves the extension of human power and artifice into the realm of life. The general question is not new. Shakespeare’s Prospero pondered it, as did Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein and H. G. Wells’s Dr. Moreau. But the gap between fantasy and actual technological capacity is closing, so that now the morality of power must speak to the governance of power; ethics must inform public policy. Synthetic biology constitutes a significant extension of the human capacity to manipulate the conditions of life at several levels—the molecular and cellular level, the level<br>

  Abstract: And she should know. As the reigning Queen of soul, Aretha Franklin’s life attests to that sweet sensuality that lends power to the voice, spirit to the body and depth to understanding. Soul is the stuff of our dreams and marks that magical domain of powerful nothingness where fantasies and ancestors live.

  Book Title: A Politics of the Ordinary-  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Dumm Thomas L.<br>
  Abstract: In A Politics of the Ordinary, Thomas Dumm dramatizes how everyday life in the United States intersects with and is influenced by the power of events, on the one hand, and forces of conformity and normalcy on the other. Combining poststructuralist analysis with a sympathetic reading of a strain of American thought that begins with Emerson and culminates in the work of Stanley Cavell, A Politics of the Ordinary investigates incidents from everyday life, political spectacles, and popular culture. Whether juxtaposing reflections about boredom in rural New Mexico with Emerson's theory of constitutional amendment, Richard Nixon's letter of resignation with Thoreau's writings to overcome quiet desperation, or demonstrating how Disney's Toy Story allegorizes the downsizing of the American white-collar work force, Dumm's constant concern is to show how the ordinary is the primary source of the democratic political imagination.<br>

  Abstract: Since 9/11, the war on terror and the campaign for homeland security have increasingly mimicked the tactics of the enemies they sought to crush. Violence and punishment as both a media spectacle and a bone-crushing reality have become prominent and influential forces shaping American society. As the boundaries between “the realms of war and civil life have collapsed,” social relations and the public services needed to make them viable have been increasingly privatized and militarized.¹ The logic of profitability works its magic in channeling the public funding of warfare and organized violence into universities, market-based service providers, Hollywood cinema, cable<br>

Comprising this group are the Republican Party extremists; religious fundamentalists such as Rick Santorum, Ayn Rand disciples like Paul Ryan; and a host of conservative anti-public foundations funded by billionaires such as the Koch brothers.¹ Their pernicious influence has transformed the landscape of American political discourse into “fortresses of . . . one truth, one way, one life formula—of adamant and pugnacious certainty<br>

One indication of America’s loss of purchase on a democratic future is the discourse of denial surrounding the crises produced on a daily basis by hyper-punitive casino capitalism.¹ Rather than address the ever-proliferating crises produced by market fundamentalism as an opportunity to understand how the United States has arrived at such a point, the dominant classes now use such crises as an excuse for normalizing a growing punishing and warfare state, while consolidating the power of finance capital and the mega-rich.

The most striking facet of this transformation has been the success of new forms of jurisprudential discourse or “law talk” in penetrating, subverting, and decentering the conventional forms of legal discourse. The proliferation of different jurisprudential discourses has erased the lines between description and advocacy, making it much more difficult for traditionalists to maintain their belief in neutral and objective law. A new understanding of language and interpretation has fired the imagination of legal scholars as they reexamined and critiqued the polar<br>

  Author(s): Paul Lissa<br>
  Abstract: The study of children's literature and culture has been experiencing a renaissance, with vital new work proliferating across many areas of interest. Mapping this vibrant scholarship, Keywords for Children's Literature presents 49 original essays on the essential terms and concepts of the field. From Aesthetics to Young Adult, an impressive, multidisciplinary cast of scholars explores the vocabulary central to the study of children's literature. Following the growth of his or her word, each author traces its branching uses and meanings, often into unfamiliar disciplinary territories: Award-winning novelist Philip Pullman writes about Intentionality, Education expert Margaret Meek Spencer addresses Reading, literary scholar Peter Hunt historicizes Children's Literature, Psychologist Hugh Crago examines Story, librarian and founder of the influential Child_Lit litserv Michael Joseph investigates Liminality. The scope, clarity, and interdisciplinary play between concepts make this collection essential reading for all scholars in the field. In the spirit of Raymond Williams' seminal Keywords, this book is a snapshot of a vocabulary of children's literature that is changing, expanding, and ever unfinished.<br>

  Abstract: “Childhood” is an ancient word in English, not a young one. The

The meaning expressed there appears consistent with the most literal strand of our contemporary usage: this passage from the Gospel of Mark (“soð he cuoeð from cildhad”; 9:21) employs childhood as a temporal marker: a father explains to Jesus that his son had been wracked by fits since the earliest years of his life.

From the first cited use—notably, in Samuel Richardson’sClarissa(1747–48), a novel concerning the paragon of virtuous adolescent girlhood—the term “girlhood” has had a history as an ideologically loaded term in Western culture.

Instead, Raymond Williams (1976) traces its evolution from its fourteenth-century root, “literature.” For the first three hundred years of its life, “literature” was an all-purpose word referring sometimes to “being well-read,” and at other times to “the books in which a man is well-read” (Williams 1976). Gradually, this common-ancestor word divided into several distinct species: the root-word, “literature,” strengthened its links to nationhood (as in English literature or French literature); “literate” came to describe being well-read; “literary” became associated with the “profession of authorship”; and “literacy” arose<br>

  Author(s) Dudek Debra<br>
  Abstract: The term “multicultural” and its associated “-ism” have been the focus of many debates in literary, educational, political, and sociological circles since the terms were coined. “Multicultural” first appeared in the
                  New York Herald Tribunein 1941: “A fervent sermon against nationalism, national prejudice and behavior in favor of a ‘multicultural’ way of life” (Oxford English Dictionary[OED]). The second usage, in 1959 by theNew York Times, both narrows and broadens the definition by connecting a culturally diverse city to cosmopolitanism. In 1965, the adjective “multicultural” expanded into the noun “multiculturalism” in thePreliminary Report of the Royal Commission<br>

  Author(s) Hollindale Peter<br>
  Abstract: For the environmentalist and literary critic alike, “nature” has multiple meanings. The zoologist Colin Tudge (2005) observes that “
                  alldefinitions of nature are simply for convenience, helping us to focus on the particular aspect that we happen to be thinking about at the time.” Of the General Prologue to Chaucer’sCanterbury Tales(1387), the literary critic John F. Danby (1961) notes that for Chaucer, the word has three dimensions: Nature is a kind of goddess, the collective force of animate life; it is the material world of organic growth and change; and it is the responsive disposition in the hearts<br>

  Book Title: Transcendent in America-Hindu-Inspired Meditation Movements as New Religion<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Williamson Lola<br>
  Abstract: Yoga, karma, meditation, guru - these terms, once obscure, are now a part of the American lexicon. Combining Hinduism with Western concepts and values, a new hybrid form of religion has developed in the United States over the past century. In Transcendent in America, Lola Williamson traces the history of various Hindu-inspired movements in America, and argues that together they constitute a discrete category of religious practice, a distinct and identifiable form of new religion.Williamson provides an overview of the emergence of these movements through examining exchanges between Indian Hindus and American intellectuals such as Thomas Jefferson and Ralph Waldo Emerson, and illuminates how Protestant traditions of inner experience paved the way for Hindu-style movements' acceptance in the West.Williamson focuses on three movements - Self-Realization Fellowship, Transcendental Meditation, and Siddha Yoga - as representative of the larger of phenomenon of Hindu-inspired meditation movements. She provides a window into the beliefs and practices of followers of these movements by offering concrete examples from their words and experiences that shed light on their world view, lifestyle, and relationship with their gurus. Drawing on scholarly research, numerous interviews, and decades of personal experience with Hindu-style practices, Williamson makes a convincing case that Hindu-inspired meditation movements are distinct from both immigrant Hinduism and other forms of Asian-influenced or New Age groups.<br>

  Abstract: On February 5, 2008, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi passed away at his home and headquarters in Vlodrop, the Netherlands, where he had lived since the late 1980s. He was believed to have been ninety-one years old. In the last years of his life he rarely met with anyone face-to-face, preferring to speak with followers by closed-circuit television. Maharishi’s body was shipped to Allahabad, about six hundred kilometers southwest of New Delhi. His relatives and disciples carried his body, propped up in a yogic posture, to a specially erected platform near the Sangam, the confluence of the Ganges and the Yamuna rivers.<br>

  Abstract: The guru-disciple relationship is a defining characteristic of HIMMs. Followers of HIMMs consider the guru to be an enlightened human being or even a manifestation of God. Some of those who practice TM do not enter into a guru-disciple relationship with Maharishi, but many do. With SRF and Siddha Yoga, the guru-disciple relationship is foundational. When I asked meditators about their first encounter with their guru, the responses revealed that it was a life-changing event and often took them by surprise. Bryan’s response was typical:<br>

Basing his analysis on a long-term conception of ecological history as well as recent examples of environmental crises, his central premise is that the environmental movement is not about saving the planet itself but saving the planet as it is for future human generations. From this perspective, the planet will survive environmental degradation and eventually evolve new life, but it is the human race that may not adapt fast enough.

  Book Title: Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Feminist as Thinker-A Reader in Documents and Essays<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Smith Richard Cándida<br>
  Abstract: More than one hundred years after her death, Elizabeth Cady Stanton still stands - along with her close friend Susan B. Anthony - as the major icon of the struggle for women's suffrage. In spite of this celebrity, Stanton's intellectual contributions have been largely overshadowed by the focus on her political activities, and she is yet to be recognized as one of the major thinkers of the nineteenth century.Here, at long last, is a single volume exploring and presenting Stanton's thoughtful, original, lifelong inquiries into the nature, origins, range, and solutions of women's subordination. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Feminist as Thinker reintroduces, contextualizes, and critiques Stanton's numerous contributions to modern thought. It juxtaposes a selection of Stanton's own writings, many of them previously unavailable, with eight original essays by prominent historians and social theorists interrogating Stanton's views on such pressing social issues as religion, marriage, race, the self and community, and her place among leading nineteenth century feminist thinkers. Taken together, these essays and documents reveal the different facets, enduring insights, and fascinating contradictions of the work of one of the great thinkers of the feminist tradition.Contributors: Barbara Caine, Richard Candida Smith, Ellen Carol DuBois, Ann D. Gordon, Vivian Gornick, Kathi Kern, Michele Mitchell, and Christine Stansell.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qgf51">Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Feminist as Thinker</a><br>
  Author(s) Smith Richard Cándida<br>
  Abstract: Although Elizabeth Cady Stanton (1815–1902) was a prolific writer who produced far-ranging explorations of the political, social, historical, and religious dimensions of women’s subordinate status, little of her writing has been easily available. She is an important figure in the development of intellectual life in the United States but known today for only a handful of pieces, most prominently “The Declaration of Sentiments” drafted for the 1848 Seneca Falls women’s rights convention and her 1892 address, “Solitude of Self.”¹ Historians of women’s rights have concentrated on Stanton’s role as activist and agitator in the earliest woman’s suffrage organizations,² but<br>

  Author(s) Smith Richard Cándida<br>
  Abstract: Elizabeth Cady Stanton’s apparently absolute defense of individual rights in her talk from 1892, “Solitude of Self,” rests on a sober confrontation with mortality. She was seventy-six years old, still vibrant intellectually but facing the increasing physical limitations of old age. The feminist movement she had piloted since the 1840s was shifting away from a broad natural rights defense of women’s equality in all areas of life into a narrower, more respectable campaign for the vote. Without question, she understood the importance of suffrage, for without the vote no person could participate in the great decisions of the day, in<br>

  Abstract: Editors’ Note: Stanton wrote this daring, breathtaking overview of women’s history before this was a subject in which scholars worked. Imagining women as important actors shaping the destiny of humanity was an act of faith, necessary for her to challenge historians to approach their work with an enlarged understanding of how societies advanced. She had to review books across a variety of fields to cull any references to women’s contributions in previous societies. Stanton’s methodology suggests her sympathy for new positivist trends in history that were concerned with reconstructing patterns of everyday life rather than narrating the stories of kings,<br>

  CHAPTER ONE  TRUTH AND LOVE ANCHORED IN THE WORD from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qgk5t">Religious Imaginaries</a><br>
  Abstract: Because Barrett Browning’s connection to Congregationalism in her adult life has been under-recognized to date, this chapter necessarily begins with remapping the poet’s postmarriage religious commitments. Though somewhat preliminary to the main argument of the chapter, the opening pages resituate Barrett Browning within—or at least close to—a church group that has mistakenly been judged in its midcentury character by the theology and practice of an earlier time. The mistake matters for literary studies because it has marred our perception of the importance of religion to arguably the most important woman poet of the period. Certain of Barrett Browning’s<br>

  Book Title: Biography and turning points in Europe and America-  Publisher: Policy Press<br>
  Author(s): Négroni Catherine<br>
  Abstract: This sociological collection advances the argument that the concept of a turning point expands our understanding of life experiences from a descriptive to a deeper and more abstract level of analysis. It addresses the conceptual issue of what distinguishes turning points from life transitions in general and raises crucial questions about the application of turning points as a biographical research method. Biography and turning points in Europe and America is all the more distinctive and significant due to its broad empirical database. The anthology includes authors from ten different countries, providing a number of contexts for thinking about how turning points relate to constructions of meaning shaped by globalization and by cultural and structural meanings unique to each country. The book will be useful across a wide range of social sciences and particularly valuable for researchers needing a stronger theoretical base for biographical work.<br>

  Author(s) Hackstaff Karla B.<br>
  Abstract: As long as we have a notion of a self-identity, most people have a moment in their life when they have been forced to recognise, as a result of events, that ‘I am not the same as I was, as I used to be’ (Strauss, 1959, p 95). This is the basic definition of the sociological concept of ‘turning points’ provided by Anselm Strauss in his 1959 book,
                  Mirrors and masks: The search for identity. Since then it has been an important sociological concept for investigating identities over a lifetime in the context of an ever-changing structural, cultural and interpersonal<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter I examine how the turning point concept is defined in academic literature and its use in the life course field.

  Abstract: There is no single way of understanding migration, but the one I know of is to think of it as a journey with a certain goal. In times of global migration, there are countless people on the move every day. They intentionally set forth to make new achievements and take new chances in life. Thus, it often surprises me that there is hardly any empirical research that emphasises the empowering aspects of migration experience, and only a few researchers who conceptualise migration as an exciting, hopeful, future-oriented biographical project (see Morokvasic, 1991, 1993; Apitzsch, 2000, 2003; Lutz, 2000).

  Abstract: Critical life events such as the loss of a job, the end of a relationship or a divorce or, as discussed in this chapter, the passing of a parent, are often accompanied by depression, melancholy, disorientation and loss of perspective on life. It is the concept of critical life events in particular that is a predictor of psychological anomalies. As a general rule, a critical life event condenses the experience and takes the affected person into a stadium of ‘relative imbalance’ (Filipp, 1981, p 24; Inglehart, 1991), therefore requiring the person to reorganise his or her behaviour and experience making<br>

The main postcolonial strategies that Humphreys has used throughout his career emerged and were refined during this period: the use of Wales as the location of the plot, the use of Welsh history and myth, the discussion of the variety of Welsh life.

  Abstract: Journeys and life on the road have fired the human imagination since time immemorial and inspired some of literature’s most enduringly popular narratives. Film did not escape this attraction, and the birth of cinema itself is tantalizingly associated with recording the experience of being on the move. Early cinema, as Giuliana Bruno has pointed out, ‘envisioned “panoramic views” that incorporated site-seeing journeys and the spatio-visual desire for circulation that had become fully embedded with modernity.’¹ Such connection between mobility and film is encoded in the very titles of some of the new medium’s earliest outputs, from the Lumière brothers’ landmark<br>

  Book Title: Saul Bass-Anatomy of Film Design<br>
  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Horak Jan-Christopher<br>
  Abstract: The first book to examine the life and work of this fascinating figure, Saul Bass: Anatomy of Film Design explores the designer's revolutionary career and his lasting impact on the entertainment and advertising industries. Jan-Christopher Horak traces Bass from his humble beginnings as a self-taught artist to his professional peak, when auteur directors like Stanley Kubrick, Robert Aldrich, and Martin Scorsese sought him as a collaborator. He also discusses how Bass incorporated aesthetic concepts borrowed from modern art in his work, presenting them in a new way that made them easily recognizable to the public.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.cttq473x">Tuberculosis Then and Now</a><br>
  Author(s) BOON TIM<br>
  Abstract: This essay makes a speculative proposal: by using an approach to tuberculosis that focuses on the storied nature of lay understandings of disease, it may be possible to gain a broad grasp of its place in the culture of the past. It is a contribution to the strand within medical history that seeks to move beyond the social historical towards the cultural historical in an attempt to make an account of the past that places the experience of disease and medicine proportionally as an aspect of life and not its whole. Because the prevalence and threat of tuberculosis have declined<br>

  Abstract: I read the Torah in the light of the way Judaism reads the Torah, and that is the way called midrash.

What, then, are we to make of Mary? Mary, after all, is called Mother of God and revered and loved by Roman Catholics; she is bearer of profound religious sentiments indeed.

  Abstract: FOR ANYONE, ARTIST OR NOT, the experience of exile is bound to be upsetting to their happiness and well-being (if such things really exist). It matters little whether such an uprooting is the result of voluntary emigration in search of a better world or forcible banishment from one’s homeland. The loss of points of reference, of the feeling of belonging, combined with an abrupt break in the continuity and evolution of a person’s life, are overwhelming and can lead to an acute sense of disorientation and chaos, especially if the person is a writer.<br>

  Abstract: THE HARDER THEY COME (1971) is a chant of black dreams and frustrations. It is the story of a betrayal, the loss of innocence and the intrusion foreign values and technologies into the contemporary Caribbean. Writers Perry Henzell and Trevor Rhone craft a narrative about a mid-20th century Jamaican folk hero Ivanhoe ‘Rhygin’ Martin, whose mythic fight against the established order parallels the day-to-day struggle of society’s disenfranchised. In the film, Ivan is trapped between two worlds—the persistent poverty of Jamaica’s suffering underclass and an alluring metropolitan North American lifestyle.

  Author(s) BEGAM RICHARD<br>
  Abstract: Over the past generation, performance studies has largely transformed how we think about the contemporary stage, expanding our idea of serious theatre to include such “lowbrow” forms as mixed media, vaudeville, and monologue.¹ The “happenings” of the 1960s and 1970s serve as the immediate precursor to much contemporary art, as more distantly do the Dadaist and surrealist exhibitions of the 1910s and 1920s. These avant-garde beginnings are notable because, like the performance artists of today, the Dadaists and surrealists challenged the idea that life and art are distinct and autonomous spheres, unambiguously separated by a stage proscenium.² Yet, as we<br>

  Abstract: Samuel Beckett’s creative life (and personal life, for that matter) was marked by a series of transformations and reinventions. In the process of remaking himself, over and again, from donnish academic to avant-garde poet, from Joycean acolyte to post-Joycean minimalist, from humanist to post-humanist, perhaps, most certainly from poet to novelist to playwright to theatre director, Beckett was simultaneously reinventing every literary genre he turned his attention to. In the midst of remaking narrative in the wake of World War II, for example, he began simultaneously the reinvention of theatre, writing the ground-breaking (but still unproduced)

                  flux of life. In order to understand and communicate these sensations, however, the individual must find a way to give them ‘form’ or ‘meaning.’ Speaking through the philosopher in his playAt the Exit, for example, Pirandello (1964a: 179) states: ‘it is not enough for the living tofeel; they want to see their feelings expressed concretely, be able to touch them, and so they build a house for them.’ In the play, the philosopher is referring specifically to the notion that<br>

It was the most transparent war footage ever but at the same time it was also condemned as the most manipulative. It was transparent in its first-time use of embedded journalists and in the concentration of an international pool of reporting journalists in Baghdad itself. It was manipulative in that this unprecedented proliferation of information and imagery intensified the processes of news regulation and censorship, opening the footage to criticism of a heavy bias in favour of the coalition troops.

We may never step in the same river twice, but life surely is easier both logistically and psychologically if we act as if we do.¹ Religious conversion, at its most fundamental, is change, whether from ‘irreligion to religion; or from one religion to another; or from one denomination to another; or from one theological position to another; or from a second hand to first hand experience of religion.’² A 1604 English dictionary defines the verb

  Abstract: ‘A palinode [is] … used of those who change their minds for the better.’¹ This definition, from the

But in cases where these writings mirror or comment upon real-life denominational shifts, readers would have disagreed over whether a change was for the better. This essay explores the early career of the late Elizabethan writer William Alabaster, who underwent religious conversion at least twice, once to Catholicism and once from it, and a spate of sonnet-writing – and probably at least<br>

  Abstract: Our society may be working out a serious kind of political thinking, but we are still groping, as it is particularly difficult to relate together such disparate requirements as our economic weakness and our desire for independence, our democratic aspirations and our socialist inclinations. These difficulties are reflected in the program of the Parti québécois. Not surprisingly, it gives rise to a type of thinking that, though committed, is still critical. Combining political conviction and free inquiry, unconnected with election-time manoeuvring, is no doubt one indication among others that things can change in Quebec’s political life.<br>

At the beginning the federal Minister of Justice spoke of ‘a kind of disintegration of the will of the people.’ He returned to this later, insinuating that the hypothesis antedates the arrival on the scene of the few individuals who proposed to save Mr Laporte’s life, that it had been accepted for a fairly long time, and remained the most plausible hypothesis once the ‘parallel governments’ and pseudo-data on the ‘insurrection’ had gone up in smoke.<br>

It brought together the various interpretations of collective life to which human beings have committed themselves. The intellectual and spiritual change that Merleau-Ponty underwent has been described as cutting himself off from ‘vertical’ transcendence in the religious or philosophical sense, implying that the act was a mistake. It was motivated by his rejection of religious and philosophical dogma and the existential attractions of Hegel’s idea of commitment to humanism or a regime of mutual recognition.<br>

Proletarian internationalism and proletarian spontaneity had ceased to be effective factors in politics, and proletarian control of the means of production was grotesquely distorted by the Stalinist regime. Nevertheless the pressure of events compelled him, not to abandon Marx’s teaching, but to reinterpret it. Sartre was right to note that Merleau-Ponty had returned to his inner life, but his refuge was no more than a strategic retreat. In his lectures at the Collège de France he was undertaking an intellectual overhaul that<br>

The rapid development of techniques has tended to force men to lose their self-respect and become waste-products, despairing of life both intellectually and vitally.

This one can see in a moment when one examines his activities as a historian, a scholar, a professor, a writer, a journalist, and a practising architect, planner, and consultant. He has been involved in Expo as a consultant to the Italian pavilion. He has been involved in direct education in a very meaningful way at the University of Rome as professor<br>

  Author(s) Zevi Bruno<br>
  Abstract: IT is QUITE EVIDENT that I would not be discussing such a controversial subject as “Architecture 1967: Progress or Regression?” were it not for a fortuitous but significant coincidence. The year 1967 is not only the Canadian Centennial, a very happy event, but also the third centenary of a tragic episode in architectural history. In 1667 Francesco Borromini, perhaps the greatest architect of the Baroque period, committed suicide. Why? we ask ourselves. Was he neurotic, sexually frustrated, unhappily married? Actually he killed himself because he felt and knew that everything he had been struggling to accomplish during his life was<br>

  Abstract: MAN’S WORLD teems with potentially lethal bacteria. It is not inappropriate, therefore, to consider on this occasion how phagocytic cells defend man, and other animals, against bacterial diseases. Evidence that phagocytes might serve as protective cells was first provided by an experiment on starfish larvae performed in 1882 by the Russian zoologist Elie Metchnikoff (Fig. 1). Here is his own account of the experiment:¹ One day when the whole family had gone to a circus to see some extraordinary performing apes, I remained alone with my microscope, observing the life in the mobile cells of a transparent starfish larva, when<br>

  Abstract: In an essay entitled ‘In this Exile’, Giorgio Agamben tells a story about his studies with Martin Heidegger, whose seminars he attended in Provence in 1966 and 1968. At some stage, Agamben asked his teacher whether he had read any Kafka, to which Heidegger replied that ‘The Burrow’ was the tale that had made the biggest impression upon him. ‘The Burrow’ is a short story about a creature that devotes their life to constructing an elaborate and impenetrable underground home. And yet despite, or perhaps because of, this zealous attention to security, the creature is haunted by the fantasy that<br>

Of course, such a rethinking is exactly what he was pursuing at<br>

  Abstract: Before the publication in 2011 of his

Regole monastiche e forme di vita, perhaps the most important concept in the work of Giorgio Agamben remained an enigma.¹ The notion of a ‘form-of-life’ has been crucial for the conceptual system Agamben has slowly articulated since the first volume of his long-runningHomo Sacerproject appeared in 1995. This concept, however, was nowhere developed in a thematic way, referred to only rarely and seemingly in passing. Yet a detailed examination of those instances where this term does appear would show that they are always placed at crucial sites, as if<br>

This essay aims to fill this lacuna. Despite the lack of a full-length interrogation of this question, scholars have taken up several different positions on the relationship between these two concepts.

  Abstract: In Chapter 4, ‘A History of the Method: Examining Foucault’s Research Methodology’, Hardy provides a survey of the key research methodologies developed by Foucault across his life and work. For Hardy, it is important to distinguish between the particular methods that Foucault actually used for undertaking research (say, for example, collecting data through archival research) and what could be more broadly termed ‘Foucault’s methodology’ as such: namely, the particular theoretical frameworks he created to order and interrogate his collected data. To this end, Hardy focuses his attention mainly on the two innovative theoretical frameworks that Foucault is most famous for:<br>

  Abstract: In recent years, ‘process philosophy’ has virtually become a code-word for the doctrines of Alfred North Whitehead and his followers. But of course, this cannot really be what process philosophy is ultimately about: if there indeed is a ‘philosophy’ of process, it must pivot not on a

  Abstract: Analytical philosophers in the twentieth century have produced a rich literature that includes the philosophy of religious language and practice, analyses of divine attributes, arguments for and against the existence of God, and arguments over the significance of religious diversity, religious experience, and religious values. Theists, atheists, agnostics, and adherents to both Christian and nonChristian religions have engaged in a fruitful exchange on these topics with all the hallmarks of analytical philosophy: an emphasis on conceptual clarity, the use of analyses with examples and counter-examples, concentrated arguments about whether concepts of what exists (God, the soul, the afterlife) may be<br>

  Author(s) Zakaras Alex<br>
  Abstract: The concept of individuality expresses an ideal of personal emancipation and selfrealisation. For many philosophers of the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, individuality was the highest end, the
                  telos, not only of human life but also of social and political organisation. Its attainment, however, often seemed a distant goal: virtually all of the philosophers who defended individuality believed that it was endangered, if not entirely stifled, in their own societies. Individuality was, for them, a way of imagining a modern world worth living in. It gave ethical content to their imagined utopias; it also served as the normative foundation of<br>

  Abstract: Jacques Rancière’s book
                  The Emancipated Spectatormarks his first sustained discussion of spectatorship (Rancière 2008b; 2009a).¹ This might seem a surprisingly late addition to Rancière’s project of rethinking the conjunction of art and politics. From the disciplinary perspective of Anglo-American film studies, it is a belated intervention indeed. For the question of the spectator is the terrain upon which many of the most significant disciplinary battles over the politics of film theory have been waged over the past three decades. In that time, critical approaches to spectators have proliferated: feminist revisions of psychoanalysis; cultural studies models of differentially ‘decoding’ viewers;<br>

Even though most people will not write autobiographies, all of us are engaged in the projects of our own autobiography, which we manifest every time we tell others about our lives, attend an interview, or simply engage in processes of thinking about and understanding the world and our place within it.

                  culturalconsumption has especially increased because technological advances have led to the development and spread of new forms of media and information and communication technologies (ICTs).

  Abstract: Memory has enjoyed a well charted resurgence in the postwar period in cultural production, social life and academic study (see Huyssen 2000; Misztal 2003; Radstone 2000). The social dislocations that occurred in the aftermath of the world wars, and the radical trauma of the Holocaust, threw into sharp relief issues of remembrance and commemoration (Wolf 2004; Margalit 20002). In more recent years, a growing disillusionment with the rhetoric of progress which has been so central to modernity has required a reconsideration of pasts that had been hurriedly discarded. At this historical juncture memory is becoming an increasingly key feature of<br>

  Abstract: Engaging with history is a popular experience. It is popular in the sense that it is widespread and has huge appeal. It involves a variety of activities that include visiting museums and heritage sites, watching history programmes on television, collecting antiques and compiling a family history. Over the past thirty years, the development of popular interest in the past, in these and many other ways, has grown up alongside the development in academic life of a sceptical questioning of the value of historical enquiry and a drastic suspicion about the very grounds on which history is represented.

The social dislocations that occurred in the aftermath of the world wars, and the radical trauma of the Holocaust, threw into sharp relief issues of remembrance and commemoration (Wolf 2004; Margalit 20002). In more recent years, a growing disillusionment with the rhetoric of progress which has been so central to modernity has required a reconsideration of pasts that had been hurriedly discarded. At this historical juncture memory is becoming an increasingly key feature of<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b2nv">Research Methods for Cultural Studies</a><br>
  Author(s) Pickering Michael<br>
  Abstract: Engaging with history is a popular experience. It is popular in the sense that it is widespread and has huge appeal. It involves a variety of activities that include visiting museums and heritage sites, watching history programmes on television, collecting antiques and compiling a family history. Over the past thirty years, the development of popular interest in the past, in these and many other ways, has grown up alongside the development in academic life of a sceptical questioning of the value of historical enquiry and a drastic suspicion about the very grounds on which history is represented. There is a<br>

  CHAPTER EIGHT  Measure: from:

  Abstract: In the twentieth century, American poets, whether ‘formalist’ or ‘experimental’ are found relating poetic measure to the rhythmic structure of life. Howard Nemerov thinks that patterns in verse ‘seem to represent the world itself in its either pious or stupid comings and goings, its regular recurrences and rhythmical repetitions, cosmic in the heavens, terrene in the tides, physiological in the beating of the heart’.¹ And William Carlos Williams urges poets to make experiments that ‘will be directed toward the discovery of a new measure, I repeat, a new measure by which may be ordered our poems as well as our<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b4xz">Research Methods for English Studies</a><br>
  Author(s) Evans Mary<br>
  Abstract: The first question that should engage our attention is that of why we wish to do research. The issue is in no sense straightforward, since ‘doing research’ is a common mantra of academic life, and is, of course, an activity in which we are all expected to partake.
                  Not‘doing research’ is nowadays an unacceptable position for academics; to be described as ‘not research active’ implies (and indeed invokes) isolation in the distant steppes of the academic world, in which the only possible redemptive activity is teaching undergraduates. So let us not assume that ‘doing research’ is always, and simply,<br>

  CHAPTER 7  The Uses of Ethnographic Methods in English Studies from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b4xz">Research Methods for English Studies</a><br>
  Author(s) Alsop Rachel<br>
  Abstract: What is ethnography? Is it relevant to English studies? And, if so, how? This chapter is concerned with these questions. In academia, ethnography as a research methodology is typically associated with the social sciences, most usually, although not exclusively, with the discipline of anthropology. It is chiefly a qualitative research strategy that relies primarily on participant observation and concerns itself in its most general sense with the study and interpretation of cultural behaviour. The conventional image of the ethnographer is the academic who goes out into the field (traditionally a distant land of whose people and way of life little<br>

  Author(s) Drescher Seymour<br>
  Abstract: During the last three centuries democratisation has occurred at three levels. For individuals, it was a process of extending access to equality of status and the security of liberty under law. Within civil societies, it was the process of extending access to the means of communication and association in economic, social and religious spheres of life. Within polities, it meant the formation of constitutional processes for law making, law enforcement and broadening the access to elections of legislators and executives at all levels of the state. In this perspective anti-slavery was a movement and an ideology primarily concerned with changing<br>

  Abstract: ‘Ages of life’ are the primary objects that an individuated life comprehends, itself comprehended in classes and in genders.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1n7qhrd">Virginia Woolf and Being-in-the-world</a><br>
  Abstract: As emphasised in the previous chapter, it is the average everyday lived experience of Being-in-the-world that is a central concern and preoccupation throughout Woolf’s writings. Despite the incalculable variety of everyday experiences that any individual may encounter during his or her lifetime, each is always and inevitably located in a particular place, whether it be the home, the street, a city, the countryside, the workplace or an armchair. Place provides the setting and context for all experience.¹ The inherent connection between the individual, experience and place, and how each depends upon the other for definition and actuality, is a view<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1n7qhrd">Virginia Woolf and Being-in-the-world</a><br>
  Abstract: From an existential perspective, the notion of home is arguably one of the more significant expressions of place. Not defined simply as a co-ordinate on a map, home encompasses neighbourhoods, nations, traditions, customs, narrative, myth, the tangible, the imaginable, the dream, as well as each individual’s relation to Being. Home has relevance to all humans: despite its multifarious manifestations, our diverse relationships with home – whether positive, negative, or ambivalent – can be life-long and pervasive, creating and rekindling memories, inspiring desires and the imagination, shaping who we are, and how we relate to the Other.

  Author(s) Huang Alexander C. Y.<br>
  Abstract: Literary translation is a love affair. Depending on the context, it could be love at first sight or hot pursuit of a lover’s elusive nodding approval. In other instances it could be unrequited love, and still others a test of devotion and faith; or else an eclectic combination of any of these events. Translation involves artistic creativity, not a workshop of equivalences. As human civilizations developed and intersected, translation emerged as a necessary form of communication and a way of life. It highlighted and put to productive use the space between cultures, between individuals with different perspectives and within one’s<br>

  Author(s) Rumbold Kate<br>
  Abstract: In the twenty-first century, “Shakespeare” is not only an English cultural icon but shares some of the characteristics of a powerful global brand. This chapter shows the surprising but important role that the many books of quotations and extracts from Shakespeare’s works, published from within his own lifetime to the present day, have played in establishing that status. It argues that these anthologies have not simply reflected Shakespeare’s growing status, but actively helped to construct it. The seemingly inherent qualities for which Shakespeare is now admired – the beauty of his language, his wise understanding of human nature, his Englishness – are<br>

  Author(s) Bevington David<br>
  Abstract: Can one learn or surmise anything significant about Shakespeare’s own life from his writings? The film 
                  Shakespeare in Love (dir. John Madden, 1998) has recently brought the question into focus, even though – or perhaps especially because – that film deliberately plays fast and loose with what we know about Shakespeare’s life. The film more or less accurately places him in London as a young man, eager to succeed in the theatre, keenly aware of the success of his great rival, Christopher Marlowe. This Shakespeare lives apart from his wife and children, having left them in Stratford. And thereby hangs a tale.<br>

  Author(s) Blake Erin C.<br>
  Abstract: This chapter explores Shakespeare in paintings and prints by looking at pictures of Shakespeare himself and at pictures that illustrate the words he wrote. In essence, both types of image are portraits. They attempt to represent a pre-existing entity, whether a real person like Shakespeare, or the people and places he brought to life in his plays. Portraiture is supposedly about verisimilitude, but a successful portrait is less about replicating someone or something in another medium than about meeting expectations. Portraits depict what we want to see or what we expect to see, otherwise they prove unsatisfying. Shakespeare has meant<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r1z12">The Edinburgh Companion to Shakespeare and the Arts</a><br>
  Author(s) Engler Balz<br>
  Abstract: Sculptures, traditionally three-dimensional representations of human beings, have been popular in the history of Shakespeare reception. They usually show the writer himself, occasionally certain figures from his plays, and they do so in different sizes, from larger-than life to miniature knick-knacks, and in different materials, from marble and bronze to china and even Welsh coal. The knick-knack has been popular since the eighteenth century, in the shape of small statues, thimbles, wine-stoppers, teapots, and so on as they can be found today in Stratford souvenir shops; Batman, of course, used a switch hidden in a Shakespeare bust to open the<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r1z12">The Edinburgh Companion to Shakespeare and the Arts</a><br>
  Author(s) Greenhalgh Susanne<br>
  Abstract: The all-star Renaissance Theatre Company production of 
                  Hamlet (BBC Radio 3, 26 April 1992), featuring Kenneth Branagh as the Prince and John Gielgud as the Ghost, is a bold and richly textured achievement, one which points to many of the issues that this chapter on Shakespeare and radio will seek to address.¹ Just under four hours long, with an “entirety” script conflated from the First Folio and Second Quarto, the production presents a version “probably never heard in the author’s lifetime (and perhaps never envisaged by him)” (Jackson, 1994, 202). Effectively this is a new work, one that raises fascinating<br>

  Abstract: It has become a standard refrain of contemporary social theory that, as we begin the twenty-first century, our culture seems as incoherent and fractured as our mental life. Ideas exist in juxtaposition, contradicting each other at certain levels and complementing at others. The exploration of the interrelationship between these planes and layers of culture, as well as those of consciousness and selfhood, are what fuels art and literature and what occupies the psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of our culture is still the irresistible promise of Enlightenment rationality: that the world is there to be explained and bettered. The raw<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapter, we have looked at some themes concerning the role of consciousness in thinking differently. To similarly examine the role of the unconscious and nonconscious is, however, more problematic. The lack of insight we have into our mental life below the conscious level, and the seeming antithesis between mental functioning at such levels and social structures, makes the mapping of the former to the latter difficult. The problem has, however, already been addressed by theorists who have attempted to unpack the Freudian unconscious in political terms and it will be useful to canvas such attempts before moving<br>

  Abstract: Everything that lives, dies. Equally – for it doesn’t follow – everything that dies will have lived. Rather than being opposites, therefore, it’s fairer to say that living and dying depend on each other, each the other’s condition. Although we might think of death as standing at the end of life, as its destination or terminus, it had to be there from the start – life wouldn’t have been able to get going unless it had agreed to come to an end. Life and death make up the two sides of a same coin – not two different coins –<br>

How are they expressed?’ In exploring language, power and young people, this chapter maps some of the discursive constructions of self that articulate youth identities in everyday modern life. It examines the ways in which language is taken up and used as resistance to mainstream norms and values.

In the largely symbolic fairy tale Time in a Red Coat, the seafaring adventure story Vinland and the elegiac Beside the Ocean of Time, Brown examines the idea of community as myth, as historical reality and as fiction itself.

However, powerful media and cultural institutions whose business it is to record, archive and make accessible the everyday life, major events and social and cultural heritage of nations and communities, invariably write those narratives in ways that glorify not only themselves but the cultural hegemony of the societies they serve.

                  jouissance in its different modalities and interactions with the world of signification and social practice. Obviously the emergence of the ‘new’ cannot succeed if it ignores this important parameter, but this is not to say that sedimented, libidinally invested identifications are in any way privileged to retain their hegemonic position indefinitely. Processes of dis-identification and affective re-investment are, on the contrary, part and parcel of social and political life. In capitalist – especially late<br>

  Author(s) Zeleza Paul Tiyambe<br>
  Abstract: If communication is the lifeblood of human interaction, the media constitute the veins through which it flows. The media have a multiplicity of forms, functions, and impacts. They exist in oral, literary and visual forms; they are transmitted through print, audiovisual, and digital technologies; and they play communicative, creative, and representational roles. As a whole, or in specific artifacts and genres, the media have varied social, economic and political effects that can promote democracy, development, nation building and inclusion as much as they can sustain authoritarianism, exploitation, conflict and exclusion.

  Abstract: The cultural history of film has often been rooted in the shifting conceptions of and metaphorical uses of light. Film produces life, movement and action from light, making it seem organic (as light produces life and growth in the natural world), but also uncanny (the creation of life and movement from nothing). That the world is reproduced through the effects of light in photography and film has led numerous critics recently to reassert the uncanny and occult status of the media (Gunning 1995). Indeed light has many occult resonances, from Emanuel Swedenborg, through theories of vitalism, to the metaphorical uses<br>

  Book Title: Deleuze's Literary Clinic-Criticism and the Politics of Symptoms<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Tynan Aidan<br>
  Abstract: The first study of Deleuze's critical and clinical projectAidan Tynan addresses Deleuze's assertion that 'literature is an enterprise of health' and shows how a concern of health and illness was a characteristic of his philosophy as a whole, from his earliest works to his groundbreaking collaborations with Guattari, to his final, enigmatic statements on 'life'.He explains why alcoholism, anorexia, manic depression and schizophrenia are key concepts in Deleuze's literary theory, and shows how, with the turn to schizoanalysis, literature takes on a crucial political and ethical role in helping us to diagnose our present pathologies and articulate the possibilities of a health to come.Key FeaturesThe first book length study of Deleuze's critical and clinical project and the conceptualisations of health and illness he developed over the course of his careerUses the idea of the literary clinic to unify Deleuze's literary theory with the political critique he developed with Guattari, and argues in this way for a distinctively Deleuzian critical practiceDraws on Deleuze conceptualisations of health and illness to reassess his relationship to key thinkers such as Spinoza, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud and Melanie Klein and literary figures such as Melville F.

  2  The Paradox of the Body and the Genesis of Form and Content from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt3fgstk">Deleuze's Literary Clinic</a><br>
  Abstract: The literary clinic suggests a profound linkage between biophilosophy and literature. In the biophilosophical tradition of hylomorphism which includes Aristotle and Kant equally, life is isolated from the material it animates, since, as Toscano explains, life ‘cannot organize itself, it can only organize matter’ (Toscano 2006: 36). From the hylomorphic point of view, a self-organising life would be unintelligible, since the forms which organise matter would be indistinguishable from matter itself. Life is thus properly speaking ‘immaterial’ and immortal, the pure formal movement of the concept, while matter is mere lifeless receptivity. Deleuze is critical of this position,¹ and it<br>

Rukeyser said, ‘[t]he poem seems to me a meeting place just as a person’s life is a meeting place.’¹ By investigating the ways in which Rukeyser depicts human lives as ‘meeting places’, I will demonstrate how the biographies, individually and as a group, represent the coming together of several of the figures who<br>

By examining the ways in which Rukeyser became involved with and manipulated the forms and techniques of travel reportage and tour guiding – two closely related documentary genres that developed during the 1930s and pervaded writing and image-making well into the 1940s – this chapter will illustrate how she pioneered a poetic cartography that provided witness to both the past and the present.<br>

  Abstract: Where did modernism happen? What were its important places and distinctive geographies? These are not new questions and, until relatively recently, might have been thought settled. A powerful and well-rehearsed narrative about modernism defines it as essentially metropolitan and internationalist in character, recalling that the majority of high-modernist writers and artists were exiles or émigrés, and that their texts are conspicuously polyglot, heteronomous, and fashioned from diverse cultural materials. Modernism, according to Malcolm Bradbury, was ‘an art of cities’ and the jolting energies of life in the major European capitals can be read in the fractured, discontinuous forms of modernist<br>

The title, “Sensual Relations,” indicates that the focus will be on the interplay of the senses rather than on each sense in isolation.

  Abstract: Utopia can be a placeholder for social change, a no-place that the apparatus of theater—its liveness, the potential it holds for real social exchange, its mortality, its openness to human interactions that life outside this magical space prohibits—can model productively. In the last chapter, I found these feelings of utopia in Holly Hughes, Peggy Shaw, and Deb Margolin’s interactions with their audiences. Their stories directly addressed spectators and modeled an ephemeral but powerful intersubjectivity that let spectators experience affectively, if fleetingly, what utopia might feel like.

  Author(s) de Sousa Santos Boaventura<br>
  Abstract: Historians will probably describe the twentieth century as an unhappy century. Reared by its androgynous parent, the nineteenth century, to become a wonder child, it soon revealed itself as a fragile and sickly child. When it was fourteen years old, it fell seriously ill with a disease that, like the tuberculosis or the syphilis of the period, took a long time to be treated and, indeed, was never completely cured. So much so that when it was thirty-nine years of age, it relapsed into an even more serious illness that was to prevent it from enjoying life with the full<br>

  Author(s) Lake David A.<br>
  Abstract: Progress is hard to measure, especially in one’s own era. There is certainly no consensus on the general meaning of the term, even less so when applied to scholarly inquiry. Moreover, the implications of new ideas or concepts can take generations to become apparent. It is doubtful that many of the early experimenters with electricity envisioned the role harnessing that force would eventually play in modern life. Nor did Adam Smith, writing against the mercantilist orthodoxy of his day, expect economic theory to develop its axiomatic form or become the new orthodoxy two centuries later. As a subject, progress is<br>

  Abstract: As one whose professional life exceeds that of the International Studies Association, I have mixed feelings about the invitation to reflect critically on the accomplishments, failures, debates, standards, approaches, and future agendas of international relations (IR) and its subfields. On the one hand, I have no doubt that our shared past is marked by enormous growth and progress. The conceptual and methodological equipment with which IR is probed today is far more elaborate, incisive, and diverse than was the case at the outset—back in the 1950s when a few isolated, non–Ivy League scholars first came together around common<br>

  Accomplishments and Limitations of a Game-Theoretic Approach to International Relations from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3998/mpub.17045">Millennial Reflections on International Studies</a><br>
  Author(s) de Mesquita Bruce Bueno<br>
  Abstract: Game-theoretic reasoning emerged as an important form of analysis in international relations, especially regarding security studies, with the publication in 1960 of Thomas Schelling’s
                  The Strategy of Conflict. The remainder of the 1960s saw a proliferation of carefully reasoned, policy-relevant studies grounded in the techniques of formal logic and rational choice modeling. A small sampling includes Daniel Ellsberg’s application of expected utility reasoning to deterrence strategy, Martin McGuire’s investigation of secrecy and arms races, Anatol Rapoport and Albert Chammah’s examination of the prisoner’s dilemma in the context of cooperation and conflict, Bruce Russett’s study of the calculus of deterrence, and<br>

The boat embarks with passengers from all walks of life: up front sit a young cavalier, a young lady, her mother, a clergyman, a merchant, a scholar, and the pilot; the “poor people”—including an old soldier, two peasants, a mother, and her baby—sit in the stern.¹ They are joined by a “stranger” (312), the last passenger to board.

  CHAPTER 3  The Sublime Portrait from:

  Abstract: Mid-nineteenth-century portraits of Jesus were not as controversial in fiction as they were in realist painting. Whereas John Everett Millais, Nikolai Ge, and Édouard Manet broke with long-standing iconographic traditions, portraits of Jesus in fiction from the same time period were innovative, in large part, by the fact of their existence. Extended literary portraits are not a common feature of premodern imaginative retellings of gospel narrative. The life of Jesus, as the canonical gospels suggest, need not accommodate descriptions of the Christ image. In the 1830s and 1840s, authors of fiction began hesitantly to describe the body of Jesus thanks<br>

  Abstract: One day in July 1988, I stood on the concourse at London’s Waterloo Station thinking of the hopes once entertained by late politician Anthony Crosland. As a leading Labour Party intellectual in the mid-1950s, Crosland had dreamed of a less austere socialism where the uniformity of the reforming state would weigh less heavily on the life of the nation. As he wrote in
                  The Future of Socialism, it was a time for a “reaction against the Fabian tradition” with its reliance on state-led initiative. The mixed economy could be expected to deliver higher exports and old-age pensions, but only a<br>

  Author(s) Papailias Penelope<br>
  Abstract: The archive appears to have taken the place of historical narrative as a key locus for critical historical reflection. This shift from historiography to the archive has a number of implications. For one, it draws attention from the closed authoritative historiography to the multiplicity of texts involved in documenting the past and to their open potential for generating future histories.¹ Besides the historian-author, many other actors—archivists, informants, donors, and researchers of various kinds—are revealed to animate the archive. This sociality contrasts sharply with the stereotype of the archive as solitary and lifeless. The archive is also characterized by<br>

  Abstract: Working quietly in private during 1934–35, as the Soviet people were toiling to meet the targets of the Second Five Year Plan, celebrating Stalin the Great Leader, and condemning “enemies of the people,” Mikhail Bakhtin was developing the concept of heteroglossia (

The Russian philosopher of language understood heteroglossia as a polyphony of social and discursive forces, a diversity of social speech types that occur in everyday life. According to him, the genre of the novel is best suited for delivering the realities of heteroglossia because it allows for a network of dialogic, interactive relations among multiple<br>

Yet the afterlife of Literary Communism began much earlier than 1956 and goes on and on; one still does not have the sense of an ending. The 1930s set the stage for intersections of social realism and the avant-garde, while the postwar years produced the new contingency and then Communist literary modernism. The calamity of<br>

  Abstract: Ibn ʿArabī’s sophisticated cosmology, his profound understandings of human nature and the processes of spiritual transformation for men and women alike, and his sometimes radical gendered legal positions were birthed from within the complexities of his experience, both mystical and mundane. Using the insightful feminist adage that “the personal is political,” this chapter explores aspects of Ibn ʿArabī’s life and relationships as he presents them, imagining how these experiences created the background against which he received mystical insights and shaped his mystical understandings. For an epistemology of spiritual experience, mystical “openings” occur within a flesh-and-blood person whose personal disposition and<br>

  Book Title: “The Useless Mouths” and Other Literary Writings-  Publisher: University of Illinois Press<br>
  Author(s): Le Bon de Beauvoir Sylvie<br>
  Abstract: "The Useless Mouths" and Other Literary Writings brings to English-language readers literary writings--several previously unknown--by Simone de Beauvoir. Culled from sources including various American university collections, the works span decades of Beauvoir's career. Ranging from dramatic works and literary theory to radio broadcasts, they collectively reveal fresh insights into Beauvoir's writing process, personal life, and the honing of her philosophy. The volume begins with a new translation of the 1945 play The Useless Mouths, written in Paris during the Nazi occupation. Other pieces were discovered after Beauvoir's death in 1986, such as the 1965 short novel "Misunderstanding in Moscow," involving an elderly French couple who confront their fears of aging. Two additional previously unknown texts include the fragmentary "Notes for a Novel," which contains the seed of what she later would call "the problem of the Other," and a lecture on postwar French theater titled Existentialist Theater. The collection notably includes the eagerly awaited translation of Beauvoir's contribution to a 1965 debate among Jean-Paul Sartre and other French writers and intellectuals, "What Can Literature Do?" Prefaces to well-known works such as Bluebeard and Other Fairy Tales, La Bâtarde, and James Joyce in Paris: His Final Years are also available in English for the first time, alongside essays and other short articles. A landmark contribution to Beauvoir studies and French literary studies, the volume includes informative and engaging introductory essays by prominent and rising scholars. Contributors are Meryl Altman, Elizabeth Fallaize, Alison S. Fell, Sarah Gendron, Dennis A. Gilbert, Laura Hengehold, Eleanore Holveck, Terry Keefe, J. Debbie Mann, Frederick M.

  Book Title: Moving Consciously-Somatic Transformations through Dance, Yoga, and Touch<br>
  Publisher: University of Illinois Press<br>
  Author(s): Fraleigh Sondra<br>
  Abstract: The popularity of yoga and Zen meditation has heightened awareness of somatic practices. Individuals develop the conscious embodiment central to somatics work via movement and dance, or through touch from a skilled teacher or therapist often called a somatic bodyworker. Methods of touch and movement foster generative processes of consciousness in order to create a fluid interconnection between sensation, thought, movement, and expression. In Moving Consciously , Sondra Fraleigh gathers essays that probe ideas surrounding embodied knowledge and the conscious embodiment of movement and dance. Using a variety of perspectives on movement and dance somatics, Fraleigh and other contributors draw on scholarship and personal practice to participate in a multifaceted investigation of a thriving worldwide phenomenon. Their goal: to present the mental and physical health benefits of experiencing one's inner world through sensory awareness and movement integration. A stimulating addition to a burgeoning field, Moving Consciously incorporates concepts from East and West into a timely look at life-changing, intertwined practices that involve dance, movement, performance studies, and education.

  Author(s) Rugman Karin<br>
  Abstract: The study of somatics offers many layers of learning, from the simplest focusing of attention to the cultivation of a deeper sense of self. Somatic study is concerned with experiencing the self from an internal perspective, inviting students to feel, acknowledge, and respond to inner and outer sensations and to consciously participate in attending to, and taking responsibility for, themselves. Developing self-awareness and self-knowledge through somatic processes can allow us to find release, ease, and clarity both physically and emotionally, and can give us choice and freedom to explore new possibilities in our approach to life.<br>

  Abstract: Submerged in the marvel of breath and movement, soma is our tacit body of nature and primordial dance. Soma is not the body we see, but the body we experience. Thus to test experience, we can trace our somatic tendencies through dance. We become the dance and its record, viable in psychology of form and perception. We cultivate consciousness and memory in the ways we move, registering correlative emotional attunements. We absolutely cannot escape the
                  affectationof our movements and emotional life. Like all organisms in nature, we are somatically alive in the mind of our motion. Dance is special<br>

  Book Title: Been a Heavy Life-Stories of Violent Men<br>
  Publisher: University of Illinois Press<br>
  Author(s): Presser Lois<br>
  Abstract: In this groundbreaking work, Lois Presser investigates the life stories of men who have perpetrated violence. She applies insights from across the academy to in-depth interviews with men who shared their accounts of how they became the people we most fear--those who rape, murder, assault, and rob, often repeatedly. Been a Heavy Life provides the discipline of criminology with two crucial frameworks: one for critically evaluating the construction of offenders own stories, and one for grasping the cultural meta-narratives that legitimize violence. For social scientists generally, this book offers a vivid demonstration of just how dynamic and contingent self-narratives are.<br>

  Author(s) ARRIGO BRUCE A.<br>
  Abstract: Ethnographic studies of “dangerous men” have generally taken us behind bars. Erving Goffman’s (1961) arresting critique of the confinement setting as a generative milieu for the exercise of power helped to spawn a series of monograph-length works recounting life, death, and survival behind prison walls (e.g., Jacobs 1978; Sykes 1971; Toch 1977). A second wave of penological analysis, still concerned with “everyday experience” behind bars, challenged the correctional system as an extension of the state’s regulatory ambit. For example, Irwin’s (1970, 1985) studies of the felon and the jail respectively ushered in a new era of incisive commentary. Crime control<br>

  Abstract: Seven of the twenty-seven narrators told stability narratives. Whereas reform narratives are about desistance, stability narratives are about steady moral character. The protagonist was presented as a moral or good person, if not in the exact moment of offending then in one’s life generally.

Quite often, one’s life, including but not limited to one’s reform, was broadly described (for example, one previously enjoyed a “fast” lifestyle that was condemned) but specific crimes were neutralized. Second, desistance, like offending, was attributed to vaguely stated factors. In addition, desistance was conceptualized<br>

In an exquisite trans-Atlantic dialogue that demonstrates the complexity and multilayered history of German dance, American and European scholars and artists elaborate on definitive performers and choreography, focusing on three major thematic areas: Weimar culture and its afterlife, the German Democratic Republic, and recent conceptual trends in theater dance._x000B__x000B_Contributors are Maaike Bleeker, Franz Anton Cramer, Kate Elswit, Susanne Franco, Susan Funkenstein, Jens Richard Giersdorf, Yvonne Hardt, Sabine Huschka, Claudia Jeschke, Marion Kant, Gabriele Klein, Karen Mozingo, Tresa Randall, Gerald Siegmund, and Christina Thurner.<br>

  Abstract: New German Dance Studiesoffers fresh histories and theoretical inquiries that will resonate not only for scholars working in the field of dance, but also for scholars working on literature, film, visual culture, theater, and performance. The volume brings together essays by scholars working inside and outside Germany, by established leaders in the field as well as new voices. Topics range from eighteenth- and nineteenth-century theater dance to popular social dances in global circulation, although emphasis falls on twentieth- and twenty-first–century modern and contemporary dance. Three research clusters emerge: Weimar culture and its afterlife, a focus that is still<br>

  Abstract: Was bleibt?What remains of the culture and the arts of a country that has disappeared from the maps? I take the title of the novella by Christa Wolf, one of the most famous East German novelists, to ask this question. Written in 1979, but rewritten for publication ten years later, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, it became a metaphor for the fate of intellectuals in East Germany and their country’s historical legacy. In the book Wolf reflected on her own life, the life of a writer, pursued by the infamous Stasi, the East German secret service. In<br>

  Abstract: The world of Anne Conway (1631–79), although it may be easier for us to enter than was Hildegard’s, is still remote in time and space. Seventeenthcentury England was a cauldron of conflicting beliefs, many of which owed their origins to religious concerns that today’s readers will find difficult to assimilate. In addition, although at least a few women—such as Mary Astell—seemed to be able to rise from comparatively impoverished backgrounds to a life of gentility, the class distinctions in English life are so marked during this time period that we may experience a failure of imagination in<br>

  Abstract: Mary Astell’s (1666–1731) life and work mirrored each other; she remains, even now, a contradictory and contentious figure, whose writings are an odd amalgam of Tory principles and far-seeing calls for reform and change. Although she is described as a “pamphleteer,” the body of her work is sufficiently large, and her circle of acquaintances sufficiently vast, that she, like Anne Conway, is best thought of as a philosopher—although, in Astell’s case, as one with a decidedly political bent.¹<br>

  Abstract: In the process of beginning to work on Harriet Taylor Mill (1807–58) as a thinker, we need to remember not only the details of her personal life, but the time in which she lived and wrote. Insofar as political and social philosophy were concerned, this was a period dominated by Bentham’s utilitarianism and the economics of Ricardo (the latter, work that John Stuart Mill [JSM] did a great deal to both promulgate and criticize).<br>

  Abstract: The term
                  historyrefers simultaneously to a dimension of the human past and the representation of that past. Both uses of the word contain ambiguities, and the dissonance between the two produces an additional layer of ambiguity. Moreover, the dimension of the human past that is called history is distinguished from other dimensions. Depending on who is parsing the historical from the rest of the past, nonhistory might be called “prehistory” or “everyday life” or the personal or the spiritual. The distinction between the historical and the nonhistorical is always contested. Perhaps the bottom-line distinction between the historical and the<br>

  Abstract: Informed by James Carey’s theories of democracy and his ritual model of communication, I enter a conversation that interrogates the place of critical pedagogy in a free democratic society (Carey 1989, 1997j, 1997l; Rosen 1997). Critical pedagogy is a key component in Carey’s intellectual project. A master teacher, Carey taught us how to think critically, to think and act in ways that linked critical pedagogy with a politics of hope. With Carey I seek a democratic pedagogy crafted for life in America since September 11, 2001 (Denzin 2007).<br>

  Abstract: Wildly inflated, if not oxymoronic, versions of community—the intelligence community, military community, self-help community, and international business community—began proliferating a few decades ago, and such references continue apace. Communities have emerged around various diseases. They produce jobs, such as community literacy work. Although these may lack the thrill of “ecstatic communities,” “singular” communities are identified for academicians (the scholarly community), lawyers, artists, scientists, and various other professions and occupations. We can study a host of interpretive communities and in doing so form an interpretive community. The term has even been stretched to refer to momentary aggregations of people<br>

  Abstract: Cultural studies is going through one of those rarely acknowledged or analyzed “crises” common in the life histories of intellectual formations. Recent attacks on cultural studies, on first glance, echo earlier criticisms: cultural studies stands accused of paying too much attention to culture and not enough to the state and economics, too much to cultural differences and not enough to social commonalities, too much to popular resistance and not enough to political domination. Yet the current discomforts are not the same as earlier ones. Earlier criticisms were often hostile to the very project of cultural studies, whereas the most trenchant<br>

Those courses introduced me to C. Wright Mills, Dwight Macdonald, Lewis Mumford, Hannah Arendt, and Edward Shils.

This theory runs through a vast panorama of universal history, which is painted in the book’s central chapter in a quaintly archaic style that could make the anthropological reader wince. Not only does it employ the venerable savagery-barbarism-civilization triad, but the proliferating ethnographic references are treated in a seemingly<br>

But, in between, it is a pure sense of life, a belief, a common, which I have suggested as a belief morphed into knowledge, that overwhelms and blurs all else. My explorations here have started<br>

  Abstract: An essential process of biodegradation, composting occurs through the decomposition of nutrient-rich organic materials to enhance the soil properties. Since time immemorial nature’s invisible organic engineers have been composting to keep the soil alive, making it porous and aerated. If we zoom into this
                  living canvas(to use Dorian Sagan’s definition of soil),¹ we encounter a throng of organisms composting in an eccentric landscape of diffractive relations.² An epic of life is being played out in this extraordinary terrain of microentities internalizing one another from their own residues without completely eliminating the traces of their origins.

  Abstract: Film adaptations of
                  Romeo and Julietfrequently veer far from Shakespeare’s script. Both Franco Zeffirelli (1968) and Baz Luhrmann (1996), for example, eliminate the character of Paris from the final scene in the Capulet’s tomb.¹ But a more radical reimagining of the play’s end comes in Karina Holden’sRomeo & Juliet A Monkey’s Tale, a television documentary produced by Animal Planet in 2006 about Macaque monkeys in Lopburi, Thailand.² From the opening iambs of its modified prologue (“In Thailand’s town …”), Holden’s urban wildlife film pulls two seemingly far-removed worlds—Shakespeare’s Globe and Animal Planet—into a potentially catastrophic orbit with<br>

  Abstract: Life begins in whirling. By “life” I do not mean an interior property that distinguishes some things we call “animate” from everything else we call “inanimate.” It is not to be found in the behavior of some magic molecule such as DNA that, in the right circumstances, can turn out replicas of itself. I mean, rather, the potential of a world given in movement to generate the forms of things, to hold them fast, and in turn to portend their dissolution. In a world of life, things are formed as eddies in the flow, that is as centers of stillness<br>

  Abstract: Lacking voices, faces, and quick motility, plants have seldom been considered candidates for the category of thinking beings in the West. Following Aristotle, early natural philosophers saw plants as the most minimal expression of “life,” possessing vitality but no feeling or awareness of their own matter.¹ As Tobias Baskin’s above response to Michael Pollan’s “The Intelligent Plant,” makes clear, resistance to extending sentience to
                  species plantarumremains strong among bioscientists (Baskin is a cellular biologist studying botanic morphogenesis).² His use of the medieval figure of the mandrake root is meant to place plants’ possible “resemblance to our intelligence” firmly in<br>

  Abstract: Heritage and history are like twins separated at birth: while their origins are identical, the trajectories of their distinct life-courses are quite dissimilar. As communicative devices, history and heritage rely on antithetical modes of persuasion. Heritage does not pretend to present a genuinely authentic, and reasonably plausible, account of some past but is a declaration of faith in that which came before.¹ While some observers celebrate heritage as a complementary or alternative way of mediating the past to popular audiences, critics dismiss it as little more than counterfeit history, packaged for commercial consumption.² “While it looks old, heritage is actually<br>

  Abstract: There has been an uninvited guest at these discussions. It is the migrant. Of course, the migrant is an abstraction and stereotype, like the European philosopher or the Aboriginal elder. However, he and she represent a genuine historical vector in the afterlife of colonized countries; and it is a moot point where colonization ends and migration begins, or whether the latter is simply the aestheticization of history.

The site was chosen for its (at the time) profound isolation: it was known as the “desert of the mountains” because of its utter remoteness.¹ Indeed the order, as conceived by St. Bruno, was meant to accomplish what might seem impossible: to fuse hermetic life with the communal life of an established and official monastic discipline.

  Abstract: Several abrupt turns mark the critical career of J.

They do so, moreover, because they seem precipitated more by Miller’s translation and adaptation of the positions of other critics than by reversals in his own thinking. First, there was the New Critical dissertation at Harvard; then, after a one-year stay at Williams in 1952-53, the years of phenomenological criticism at Johns Hopkins from 1953 to 1972, and more recently the move to deconstruction at Yale.<br>

  Abstract: “Few facts about the life of our culture are more striking than the recent growth of literary criticism in both extent and prestige.” It is now “fiercely professional, an ‘institution’ as well as a discipline, a self-contained world as well as a secondary branch of humane letters.” When Irving Howe wrote this in 1958, the end seemed near to what Randall Jarrell had called “The Age of Criticism.” M.

In On the Rim, he describes how the Grand Canyon became an internationally renowned tourist attraction and cultural icon, and delves into the meanings the place holds for the individuals who live, work, and travel there. “In the chasm’s dizzying depths and flamboyant displacement of solid ground, as well as in the perceptions of those drawn there-explorers and day-trippers, employees and outlaws, artists and fast-buck artists-Neumann discovers a context in which to examine cultural and experimental fissures that separate leisure and work, home and away, religion and science, art and life. . . .

It is difficult to think of any aspect of human life that is not potentially sexualized and, hence, potentially raw material for the cultural representation of sexualities.<br>

  Abstract: Saint Augustine′s oft-quoted conundrum about time is recognizable in the quotidian round of everyday life. The clock is not always the best way to tell time′s passage, even though the most universal and convenient.¹ The passage of time is measured not just by the hands of the clock or annually in birthdays, but by registering impressions of seemingly mundane events such as the subtle furrows on one′s brow or on that of another, the unexpected loss of breath on climbing an accustomed stair, and the sudden encounter with long-lost acquaintances who suddenly bring back a flood of memory of our<br>

  Book Title: Labor of Dionysus-A Critique of the State-Form<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Negri Antonio<br>
  Abstract: “Labor is the living, form-giving fire,” Marx wrote. “It is the transitoriness of things, their temporality, as their transformation by living time.” How is it, then, that labor, with all its life-affirming potential, has become the means of capitalist discipline, exploitation, and domination in modern society? The authors expose and pursue this paradox through a systematic analysis of the role of labor in the processes of capitalist production and in the establishment of capitalist legal and social institutions. Critiquing liberal and socialist notions of labor and institutional reform from a radical democratic perspective, Hardt and Negri challenge the state-form itself.<br>

Without Offending Humans reveals a careful and emotionally sensitive thinker who explores the unfolding of humans’ assessments of their relationship to animals—and the consequences for how we define ourselves.<br>

  Abstract: There are certain artists that mean to mark the end of the avantgarde by setting up their studios in laboratories and working with geneticists so as to act on the mechanisms of life. Artistically modified organisms, writes Eduardo Kac, one of these artists to whose work I will be paying particular attention, “are going to become our familiar companions.”¹ He adds that “artists could usefully increase the planet’s biodiversity by inventing new forms of life.” For these artists, it is a question of replacing the representation of life with its modification and of exhibiting the results of these

  Abstract: At least since Benedict Anderson breathed new life into the thought of Walter Benjamin, Ernst Renan, and Victor Turner, nationalism has constituted a prominent conceptual feature of contemporary literary and cultural studies. Following the lead of Perry Anderson, Anthony Giddens, and others, academics in English literary studies, by and large, have restricted their analyses to artifacts produced since the late eighteenth century, when the American and French revolutions launched the processes that gave rise to both a modern state founded on popular sovereignty and the appearance in the lexicon of the word “nationalism” (Anderson,

Bartos’s arresting pictures, juxtaposed to one of Christopher Hitchens’s short essays, represent different rooms, architectural designs, and still-life forms that seek to convey the “spirit of the UN.” The photos are a realist overview of empty rooms and inert objects that appear to be deprived of any signification.

                  1984) to some of the most recent global governance and planetary sustainability utopias (late-twentieth-century environmentalism). Jeremy Bentham first formulated¹ the myth and, later, Michel Foucault theorized it as a panoptic society.²<br>

  Abstract: Boundaries abound. Between humanity and the gods. Between human and animal. Between culture and nature. Between life and death. Between genders, nations, peoples, times, races, classes, and territories. But boundaries have also become problematic today, perhaps more so than before. In a world experienced by many to be without a natural design to which they might conform, the function of boundaries becomes highly ambiguous. Boundaries form indispensable protections against violation and violence; but the divisions they sustain also carry cruelty and violence. Boundaries provide preconditions of identity, individual agency, and collective action; but they also close off possibilities of being<br>

  Book Title: Counter-Archive-Film, the Everyday, and Albert Kahn's Archives de la Planète<br>

  Author(s): AMAD PAULA<br>
  Abstract: Tucked away in a garden on the edge of Paris is a multimedia archive like no other: Albert Kahn's
      Archives de la Planète(1908-1931). Kahn's vast photo-cinematographic experiment preserved world memory through the privileged lens of everyday life, andCounter-Archivesituates this project in its biographic, intellectual, and cinematic contexts. Tracing the archive's key influences, such as the philosopher Henri Bergson, the geographer Jean Brunhes, and the biologist Jean Comandon, Paula Amad maps an alternative landscape of French cultural modernity in which vitalist philosophy cross-pollinated with early film theory, documentary film with the avant-garde, cinematic models of temporality with the early Annales school of history, and film's appropriation of the planet with human geography and colonial ideology. At the heart of the book is an insightful meditation upon the transformed concept of the archive in the age of cinema and an innovative argument about film's counter-archival challenge to history. The first comprehensive study of Kahn's films,Counter-Archivealso offers a vital historical perspective on debates involving archives, media, and memory.<br>

And although Bolaño responded to my queries in the last year and a half of his life, I have no biographical revelations to offer. These opening disclaimers made, I would like to comment briefly on the ways the critical approach adopted here is related—indirectly—to the work of translation and to the life of the author studied.<br>

  2  BOLAÑO’S FICTION-MAKING SYSTEM from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/andr16806">Roberto Bolaño's Fiction</a><br>
  Abstract: The bulk of Bolaño’s massive oeuvre in prose was written in the last ten years of his life. Javier Cercas has remarked: “it is nothing short of astonishing that he wrote what he wrote between 1996, the year of
                     Distant Star, and 2003, the year of his death.”¹ The astonishing thing is not the sheer volume of his production, which is matched by many authors of commercial fiction, but the combination of high productivity and genuine inventiveness. Commenting on this aspect of the Bolaño anomaly, Nora Catelli has written:<br>

  7  A SENSE OF WHAT MATTERS from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/andr16806">Roberto Bolaño's Fiction</a><br>
  Abstract: One of the reasons Bolaño’s fiction matters to so many readers is that it is underpinned by a strong, distinctive, and relatively simple sense of what matters in life. His characters live in ethically and politically oriented worlds. This does not go without saying. Since Western literatures began strongly to affirm and defend their autonomy with respect to political and religious institutions in the mid-nineteenth century, many critics and writers have campaigned to purge literature of didacticism, and some have gone further and argued that literature should be ethically and politically neutral. It is worth distinguishing these two objectives, because<br>

  Abstract: In his first novel,
                  Untouchable (1928), the celebrated Indian writer Mulk Raj Anand follows a day in the life of an untouchable boy named Bakha, whose travails in a small village raise complex questions about the ethical and political dimensions of modernity in latecolonial India. One of the first novels to feature the outcaste as hero,Untouchable documents the conflicts between Bakha’s obligations as a sweeper and his rising ethical awareness, which grows over the course of the novel and infuses its subjective, highly focalized narration. The novel is stunning in its depiction of the corporeality of Bakha’s existence, incorporating the sounds<br>

This spirit oozes up through the very cracks in the floorboards of our triumphal institutions. All the powers of the West have entered into an alliance to exorcise the evident danger of this specter, this genie who seems capable of emerging from any of its bottles.

Could one cross a limit of knowledge and power in order to experiment, and to experiment with new communal forms? If so, has one crossed over a threshold of escape from power, or would such<br>

If so, our own putting into place of imaginary mises-en-scènes for a screenplay Pasolini left behind would immediately set in motion a complex comparative machinery, whirring away to effect an operational wonder about the now-time within which chance occasions and imaginary props afford a chance to bring a screenplay, not to mention an apostle, to life again.

  Book Title: Reclaiming the Enlightenment-Toward a Politics of Radical Engagement<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRONNER STEPHEN ERIC<br>
  Abstract: With its championing of democracy, equality, cosmopolitanism, and reason -- and its vociferous attacks on popular prejudice, religious superstition, and arbitrary abuses of power -- the Enlightenment was once hailed as the foundation of all modern, progressive politics. But in 1947, this perspective was dramatically undermined when Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno published their classic work,
      Dialectic of Enlightenment, which claims that the Enlightenment was the source of totalitarianism and the worst excesses of modernity. Reclaiming the Enlightenment from purely philosophical and cultural interpretations, Bronner shows that its notion of political engagement keeps democracy fresh and alive by providing a practical foundation for fostering institutional accountability, opposing infringements on individual rights, instilling an enduring commitment to social reform, and building a cosmopolitan sensibility. This forceful and timely reinterpretation of the Enlightenment and its powerful influence on contemporary political life is a resounding wake-up call to critics on both the left and the right.<br>

  Abstract: Liberalism was the philosophical expression for the age of democratic revolution and the principal political theory of the Enlightenment. Its method was the critical deployment of “reason” and its goal was bettering the conditions of social life and expanding “freedom.”¹ No less than the Enlightenment itself, however, the liberal heritage is both underestimated and taken for granted. Often seen merely as an ideological veil for capitalist exploitation, this new political worldview legitimated the idea of “resistance” against established authority—which was already implicit within the scientific revolution initiated by Sir Francis Bacon, Galileo, and Descartes—and it gave members of<br>

  Book Title: The Habermas Handbook-  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): LAFONT CRISTINA<br>
  Abstract: Jürgen Habermas is one of the most influential philosophers of our time. His diagnoses of contemporary society and concepts such as the public sphere, communicative rationality, and cosmopolitanism have influenced virtually all academic disciplines, spurred political debates, and shaped intellectual life in Germany and beyond for more than fifty years. In
      The
            Habermas Handbook, leading Habermas scholars elucidate his thought, providing essential insight into his key concepts, the breadth of his work, and his influence across politics, law, the social sciences, and public life.This volume offers a comprehensive overview and an in-depth analysis of Habermas's work in its entirety. After examining his intellectual biography, it goes on to illuminate the social and intellectual context of Habermasian thought, such as the Frankfurt School, speech-act theory, and contending theories of democracy. TheHandbookprovides an extensive account of Habermas's texts, ranging from his dissertation on Schelling to his most recent writing about Europe. It illustrates the development of his thought and its frequently controversial reception while elaborating the central ideas of his work. The book also provides a glossary of key terms and concepts, making the complexity of Habermas's thought accessible to a broad readership.<br>

  Author(s) KETTNER MATTHIAS<br>
  Abstract: Jürgen Habermas’s intellectual itinerary can hardly be understood without considering its critical and constructive interplay with the thought of Karl-Otto Apel—interactions between the two theorists have often marked significant turning points in Habermas’s project. Without the theoretical-architectonic alternatives that Apel’s reflections open, it would be impossible to evaluate the philosophical course Habermas has steered. Apel and Habermas are united by a lifelong professional friendship, which began when they studied together in Bonn in the early 1950s; since then, the liberating encounter with American pragmatism—of which Apel was one of the first German translators (1967, 1970)—has strengthened their<br>

  Author(s) LOHMANN GEORG<br>
  Abstract: From the beginning, Jürgen Habermas has elaborated his theory of discursive ethics by engaging with Hegel’s critique of Kant. He shares both these philosophers’ view that morality, under the conditions of modernity, can no longer be understood—as had been the case for Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas—by way of all-encompassing prescriptions concerning the “good” or “happy” life (

  Abstract: For over forty years Habermas has taken inspiration from and been deeply influenced by the classical American pragmatists, especially Charles S. Peirce, John Dewey, and George Herbert Mead. He has appropriated, reconstructed, and integrated many of the primary themes of these thinkers into his own comprehensive philosophic perspective: a radical critique of Cartesianism and the philosophy of consciousness; a focus on the primacy of social practices and action in understanding everyday life (the lifeworld); a thoroughgoing fallibilism that encompasses both knowledge of the world and moral reasoning; a development of an intersubjective dialogical understanding of action and rationality; and a<br>

  Abstract: The public sphere is the most influential of Jürgen Habermas’s signature concepts. Unlike “communicative action,” “discourse ethics,” and “the colonization of the lifeworld,” which are discussed principally by specialists, this concept has become a major focus of work in fields ranging from history, law, politics, and sociology to literature, philosophy, gender studies, and media studies.

  Abstract: Robert Brandom (2002) describes pragmatism “as a movement centered on the primacy of the practical” (40). This primacy of practice over theory is manifested in Habermas’s writings in two ways. First, it emerges in his lifelong insistence on the primacy of “know how” (what he often calls intuitive knowledge) over “know that.” This is a key Heideggerian distinction, which Habermas uses in his theoretical analyses, in his formal pragmatics, and in developing his social theory. Second, it is manifested in Habermas’s rejection of what he calls the “spectator model” of knowledge and his insistence that action has “cognitive” significance—in<br>

  Book Title: Randall Jarrell and His Age-  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burt Stephen<br>
  Abstract: Burt's book examines all of Jarrell's work, incorporating new research based on previously undiscovered essays and poems. Other books have examined Jarrell's poetry in biographical or formal terms, but none have considered both his aesthetic choices and their social contexts. Beginning with an overview of Jarrell's life and loves, Burt argues that Jarrell's poetry responded to the political questions of the 1930s, the anxieties and social constraints of wartime America, and the apparent prosperity, domestic ideals, and professional ideology that characterized the 1950s. Jarrell's work is peopled by helpless soldiers, anxious suburban children, trapped housewives, and lonely consumers.
      Randall Jarrell and His Agesituates the poet-critic among his peers -- including Bishop, Lowell, and Arendt -- in literature and cultural criticism. Burt considers the ways in which Jarrell's efforts and achievements encompassed the concerns of his time, from teen culture to World War II to the Cuban Missile Crisis; the book asks, too, how those efforts might speak to us now.<br>

  Abstract: “Tomorrow,” Jarrell complained in 1951, “some poet may, like Byron, wake up to find himself famous—for having written a novel, for having killed his wife; it will not be for having written a poem” (
                  Age 15). Jarrell’s poetic contemporaries (Robert Lowell makes the best example) indeed became famous for the high drama of their lives and for their extraliterary deeds: Anthony Hecht even called Lowell, after his death, “le Byron de nous jours” (32). Jarrell himself displayed a striking personality, a demanding intellect, and a need for affection: his life, by his own choice and luck, lacked public drama<br>

                  and a system of age relations” (12). Chapter 5 looked at children and at adolescents in Jarrell’s poems and prose; this chapter will examine women and men, mothers and fathers, the families they constitute, and how children fare within them. We have seen already how Jarrell, like his culture, associated femininity with private life and with sympathy—and how he associated himself and his work with all three.¹ Jarrell’s later poems depict some men and women who long for private connections and sympathies such as those<br>

  ANTECHAPTER: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/burt12594">Randall Jarrell and His Age</a><br>
  Abstract: “Tomorrow,” Jarrell complained in 1951, “some poet may, like Byron, wake up to find himself famous—for having written a novel, for having killed his wife; it will not be for having written a poem” (
                  Age 15). Jarrell’s poetic contemporaries (Robert Lowell makes the best example) indeed became famous for the high drama of their lives and for their extraliterary deeds: Anthony Hecht even called Lowell, after his death, “le Byron de nous jours” (32). Jarrell himself displayed a striking personality, a demanding intellect, and a need for affection: his life, by his own choice and luck, lacked public drama<br>

  Chapter 6  MEN, WOMEN, CHILDREN, FAMILIES from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/burt12594">Randall Jarrell and His Age</a><br>
  Abstract: Every family, John Demos writes, “is (and was) both a system of gender relations 
                  and a system of age relations” (12). Chapter 5 looked at children and at adolescents in Jarrell’s poems and prose; this chapter will examine women and men, mothers and fathers, the families they constitute, and how children fare within them. We have seen already how Jarrell, like his culture, associated femininity with private life and with sympathy—and how he associated himself and his work with all three.¹ Jarrell’s later poems depict some men and women who long for private connections and sympathies such as those<br>

  INTRODUCTION: from:

  Author(s) INGRAM JAMES D.<br>
  Abstract: Utopia, we might think, is nothing if not political. Its best-known examples, from Plato via More, Campanella, and Bacon to Owen, Morris, and Bellamy, present cities, the political form of life par excellence, organized to remedy the defects their authors perceived in their own. To this extent they offer up political solutions to political problems. At the same time, however, utopias are forever being criticized for seeking to escape or eliminate politics, and not without reason. For if utopias present solutions to political problems, by building the common good into the design of the worlds they depict, they do away<br>

  Abstract: Unfortunately, exemplarity in the public realm is not just about the force of the reasonable. Just as crucial, for buttressing the viability of the paradigm of judgment, is the task of making sense of the repulsive force exerted by radical evil when it is identified as such. The flip side of reasonability is 
                  negative exemplarity, that from which we recoil in utter horror—as the hero of Heart of Darknessat the end of his life—or, in other words, evil as the exemplification of the worst we could possibly be. In this chapter the relation of radical evil, judgment, and<br>

  Author(s) Paxton Frederick S.<br>
  Abstract: Hathumoda, first abbess of Gandersheim, could have had a glorious afterlife. Agius, a monk-priest of the nearby abbey of Corvey—her confidant and perhaps a blood relative—was with her when she died.¹ Afterward, so he tells us, Agius consoled her bereaved sisters at Gandersheim, speaking movingly of Hathumoda’s long and painful passing and the significance of her life and death. Over the next two years he transformed those conversations into a consolatory dialogue in verse. At the same time, so that they, who could “no longer hold her or gaze at her in the flesh,” might at least “possess<br>

  Author(s) Mooney Catherine M.<br>
  Abstract: Angela of Foligno as daughter, mother, and wife has a chameleonlike character, to judge by the opinions of her many editors and commentators. She is variously adulterous spouse or mistreated wife, tender or detached mother, daughter overly devoted to her mother or one eager to break free. These multiple representations of Angela are striking because each is based on evidence from a single source, known as the 
                  Liber.⁵ The text lavishly describes Angela’s interior mystical journey along a path of penitence, poverty, and suffering, yet is virtually bereft of the sort of biographical details required to reconstruct her family life.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/fult13368">History in the Comic Mode</a><br>
  Author(s) Jones Anna Trumbore<br>
  Abstract: Discussions of religious reform, or of different forms of religious life, are rare in Aquitanian sources from the tenth and early eleventh centuries.¹ It is particularly striking, therefore, when the chronicler Ademar of Chabannes records that Bishop Hilduin of Limoges (990–1014) reversed the policy of his elder brother and predecessor, Hildegar (ca. 976–990), toward the house of Eymoutiers: “Bishop Hilduin,” Ademar wrote, “with the devil urging him, three years before he died, destroyed the monastery of Saint-Étienne at Eymoutiers, which Hildegar had elegantly arranged with a great crowd of monks, and [Hilduin] returned canons there.”² This is not<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/fult13368">History in the Comic Mode</a><br>
  Author(s) Gragnolati Manuele<br>
  Abstract: One of the reasons Dante’s magnum opus is called a “comedy” is its use of a comic register as the leading one. This choice forms the basis of the poem’s capability to encompass reality in all its spectra and to combine, for instance, myth with fragments of everyday life and chronicle, theoretical speculation with personal issues and political tirades, sublime love poetry with debased language, mystical ardor with spiteful irony. Like life or history, Dante’s 
                  Comedy assembles many disparate and diverse parts; as centuries of scholarship have shown, it is often by attempting to find new combinations of these many<br>

  Abstract: It is easy to say what counts as progress in some endeavors: an economy progresses when it produces more wealth and better jobs, when the standard of living goes up and child mortality goes down. A science progresses when its theories explain more, with fewer anomalies, and it enhances our ability to control phenomena of interest. Medical science progresses when it helps increase the quality of life and eliminates a disease like polio. In all these cases we feel justified in using the word

  Abstract: Our presentist present is by no means uniform or clear-cut, and it is experienced very differently depending on the position we occupy in society. We are caught up in global movement and accelerated flows, or else condemned to the life of casual workers, living from hand to mouth in a stagnant present, with no recognized past, and no real future either (since the temporality of plans and projects is inaccessible). The present is therefore experienced as emancipation or enclosure, and the perspective of the future is no longer reassuring, since it is perceived not as a promise, but as a threat. Hartog's resonant readings show us how the motor of history(-writing) has stalled and help us understand the contradictory qualities of our contemporary presentist relation to time.<br>

  Abstract: If the 1970s seemed to confirm a narrative of biomedical progress due to an explosion of vaccines and novel procedures like in vitro fertilization, the next decade brought one of biomedicine’s most formidable obstacles. The first cases of HIV/AIDS were diagnosed in 1981, and their intractability shook the confidence of epidemiologists and pharmaceutical researchers. Technoscience could not invent the tools to curb, much less eradicate, this emerging infectious disease in time to prevent massive loss of life. Undaunted, countless scientists attempted to tackle all dimensions of HIV/AIDS, from its pathology and epidemiology to treatment and public health policy. One of<br>

  Abstract: In 2008 WWF (formerly World Wildlife Fund for Nature) developed a campaign around two horrors of climate change: devolution and mutation. In the year when “change” became an unavoidable buzzword as part of Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign, the environmental group revised the word’s connotations to include devastation and unsettling alterations to the essence of life. Commissioned by WWF, Belgian advertising firm Germaine offered a commentary on the fate of humanness in the face of unabated climate change (figure 4.1).

  Abstract: Standing in the twenty-first century, it’s clear that the “age of anxiety” that W. H. Auden declared in 1947 is still with us. But some things have changed. In the wake of World War II, writers looked to the inventions of total war, notably to nuclear weaponry, when composing their visions of technological anxiety. In the last decades of the millennium, nuclear worry does not disappear, but it cedes some ground to concerns about techniques for radically altering so-called nature. Biotechnologies that transform life take center stage; they change the world not through the spectacular blast but through gradual reconfiguration<br>

  Book Title: The Specter of Democracy-What Marx and Marxists Haven't Understood and Why<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Howard Dick<br>
  Abstract: Howard uses a critical rereading of Marx as a theorist of democracy to offer his audience a new way to think about this political ideal. He argues that it is democracy, rather than Marxism, that is radical and revolutionary, and that Marx could have seen this but did not. In Part I, Howard explores the attraction Marxism held for intellectuals, particularly French intellectuals, and he demonstrates how the critique of totalitarianism from a Marxist viewpoint allowed these intellectuals to see the radical nature of democracy. Part II examines two hundred years of democratic political life -- comparing America's experience as a democracy to that of France. Part III offers a rethinking of Marx's contribution to democratic politics. Howard concludes that Marx was attempting a "philosophy by other means," and that paradoxically, just because he was such an astute philosopher, Marx was unable to see the radical political implications of his own analyses. The philosophically justified "revolution" turns out to be the basis of an anti-politics whose end was foreshadowed by the fall of European communism in 1989.<br>

  Abstract: Marx called France the political nation par excellence, as compared to economic England and philosophical Germany. But Marx arrived at his mature theory only after a stern critique of a “merely political” view of revolution. And some of his most important insights are developed in analyses of the failures of revolution in France. While Marx’s observation is insightful, the theoretical conclusions he drew from it are problematic. The monarchy in France was not absolute because it was all-powerful or arbitrary; its power came from the means by which it dominated all spheres of life, transforming an administrative and territorial entity<br>

And it has not always been the organized religious congregations that have been leaders in crossing the line that the Constitution tries to establish. Religion touches deeper; it affects the language through which people express themselves as well as their vision of the nation to which they belong.

                  philosophes, the most common use of the term cosmopolitan today is to describe how people live (or aspire to live)—their ethos, culture, worldview, or way of life. The rise of cosmopolitanism in this sense was seized on in the 1990s as one of the most striking facts about the contemporary world, and the<br>

  Abstract: When we talk about globalization, we tend to focus on its social and economic benefits. In
         Governance in the New Global Disorder, the political philosopher Daniel Innerarity considers its unsettling and largely unacknowledged consequences. The "opening" of different societies to new ideas, products, and forms of prosperity has introduced a persistent uncertainty, or disorder, into everyday life. Multinational corporations have weakened sovereignty. We no longer know who is in control or who is responsible. Economies can collapse without sufficient warning, and the effort to rebuild can drag on for years. Piracy is everywhere. Is there any way to balance the interests of state, marketplace, and society in this new construct of power?<br>

  Abstract: Evoking the hot, dust-filled Harmattan winds that blow from the Sahara to the Gulf of Guinea, this book creatively explores what it means to be buffeted by the unforeseen and the unknown. Celebrating the life-giving potential of people, places, and powers that lie beyond our established worlds,
      Harmattanconnects existential vitality to the act of resisting prescribed customs and questioning received notions of truth. At the book's heart is the fictional story of Tom Lannon, a graduate student from Cambridge University, who remains ambivalent about pursuing a conventional life. After traveling to Sierra Leone in the aftermath of its devastating civil war, Tom meets a writer who helps him explore the possibilities of renewal. Illustrating the fact that certain aspects of human existence are common to all people regardless of culture and history,Harmattanremakes the distinction between home and world and the relationship between knowledge and life.<br>

  Author(s) Caputo John<br>
  Abstract: John Caputo is an American philosopher of religion with particular expertise in phenomenology, hermeneutics, and deconstruction. He is widely known for developing Derrida’s deconstruction into “radical hermeneutics,” a philosophy that subverts any essentialist claims and resists arresting the play of interpretation.¹ This radical hermeneutics is closely aligned with Caputo’s interest in theopoetics, a term that is variously defined by practitioners but that entails the notion that both God and life are best described poetically rather than rationalistically. Theopoetics, at least in Caputo’s radical hermeneutics, and also in Kearney’s anatheism, has connotations of

  Abstract: John Caputo is an American philosopher of religion with particular expertise in phenomenology, hermeneutics, and deconstruction.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/khal12476">Civil and Uncivil Violence in Lebanon</a><br>
  Abstract: The brief interlude between the relatively benign civil war of 1958 and the protracted cruelties of 1975 stands out as a perplexing often anomalous epoch in Lebanon’s eventful political history. It is a period marked by sustained political stability, economic prosperity, and swift societal transformations, the closest the country ever got to a “golden age” with all the outward manifestations of stupendous vitality, exuberance, and rising expectations. But these were also times of growing disparities, cleavages, neglect, portends perhaps of a more “gilded age” of misdirected and uneven growth, boisterous political culture, conspicuous consumption, and the trappings of frivolous life-style<br>

  Abstract: For almost two decades, Lebanon was besieged and beleaguered by every possible form of brutality and collective terror known to human history: from the cruelties of factional and religious bigotry to the massive devastations wrought by private militias and state-sponsored armies. They have all generated an endless carnage of innocent victims and an immeasurable toll in human suffering. Even by the most moderate of estimates, the magnitude of such damage to human life and property is staggering. About 170,000 people have perished; twice as many were wounded or disabled; close to two thirds of the population experienced some from of<br>

  Book Title: Prose of the World-Modernism and the Banality of Empire<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Majumdar Saikat<br>
  Abstract: Prose of the Worldexplores the global life of this narrative aesthetic, from late-colonial modernism to the present day, focusing on a writer each from Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, and India. Ranging from James Joyce's deflated epiphanies to Amit Chaudhuri's disavowal of the grand spectacle of postcolonial national allegories, Majumdar foregrounds the banal as a key instinct of modern and contemporary fiction -- one that nevertheless remains submerged because of its antithetical relation to literature's intuitive function to engage or excite.<br>

  CHAPTER 1  James Joyce and the Banality of Refusal from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/maju15694">Prose of the World</a><br>
  Abstract: If the radical aesthetic of the banal thrives at the urgent confluence of modernist innovation and colonial anxiety, it has no greater exponent than James Joyce, who transforms the banality of provincial life into an unprecedented narrative force. If the successful artist, in Joyce’s fiction, charts a troubled arc of migration from the provincial margin to the metropolitan center, his path is littered with bodies that fail to do so. Bodies of Dubliners, almost always male, whose desire for the energetic aesthetic culture of the metropolis is stifled by the paralysis that pervades the colonial periphery like dreary smog. Such<br>

  Book Title: The Highway of Despair-Critical Theory After Hegel<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Marasco Robyn<br>
  Abstract: Hegel's "highway of despair," introduced in his
         Phenomenology of Spirit, represents the tortured path traveled by "natural consciousness" on its way to freedom. Despair, the passionate residue of Hegelian critique, also indicates fugitive opportunities for freedom and preserves the principle of hope against all hope. Analyzing the works of an eclectic cast of thinkers, Robyn Marasco considers the dynamism of despair as a critical passion, reckoning with the forms of historical life forged along Hegel's highway.<br>

  Abstract: Michael Onfray passionately defends the potential of hedonism to resolve the dislocations and disconnections of our melancholy age. In a sweeping survey of history's engagement with and rejection of the body, he exposes the sterile conventions that prevent us from realizing a more immediate, ethical, and embodied life. He then lays the groundwork for both a radical and constructive politics of the body that adds to debates over morality, equality, sexual relations, and social engagement, demonstrating how philosophy, and not just modern scientism, can contribute to a humanistic ethics.<br>

  Abstract: Other powerful lineages populate the history of philosophy. There are other binaries to describe the issues and people at work in the tradition. Of course, there is Idealism and Materialism; the ascetic Ideal and the hedonist Ideal; and transcendence and immanence. But equally, there is denigration of the “I” and writing about the self. On the one hand, the philosophers I have listed did not seem to value autobiographical confession or little details derived from personal experiences. On the other hand, their lives fed their thought and they acknowledged drawing lessons from life. Some are messengers who efface themselves, trying<br>

  Abstract: In the study of religions, we find that certain key texts come to define their interpretive communities, for both the communities themselves and the scholars who study them.¹ Texts are an appealing source for the cultivation of understanding; they seem stable and fixed in a way that a religious community, comprising people who change through time and contexts, simply is not. But a text is not a source unless it is brought to life through reading and interpretation, irrespective of the vicissitudes of time and context. Reading and interpretation necessarily negate, to some extent, the stability or fixedness of a<br>

  Abstract: Popularized by a novel by Henri Murger in 1846,¹ then consecrated by Puccini in his famous opera, the idea of Bohemia, in its current use, implies a lifestyle and a particular attitude toward aesthetics. Rejection of bourgeois conventions, lack (or voluntary renunciation) of a fixed abode and regular work, frequent visits to cafés, cabarets, and popular taverns, a taste for nocturnal life, ostentatious sexual freedom, a keen penchant for alcohol and drugs, the fair communal share of meager available resources, and even, at times, a certain “sectarianism” colored by the use of secret codes shared only by a select brotherhood<br>

  Abstract: Like all classics, Marx both “transcends” his own time and remains a thinker of the nineteenth century. With an incredibly imaginative strength, he was able to grasp tendencies that, still embryonic in his epoch, developed spectacularly during the following century. This astonishing modernity has led many scholars to interpret his works in naïvely anachronistic terms, as if they had been written in our age. Marx contributed to the forging of our lexicon, but many concepts through which we today apprehend the nineteenth century—for instance, imperialism—simply did not exist during his lifetime, or did not have the same meaning<br>

  Book Title: Flight Ways-Life and Loss at the Edge of Extinction<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): van Dooren Thom<br>
  Abstract: Each chapter of
      Flight Waysfocuses on a different species or group of birds: North Pacific albatrosses, Indian vultures, an endangered colony of penguins in Australia, Hawaiian crows, and the iconic whooping cranes of North America. Written in eloquent and moving prose, the book takes stock of what is lost when a life form disappears from the world -- the wide-ranging ramifications that ripple out to implicate a number of human and more-than-human others. Van Dooren intimately explores what life is like for those who must live on the edge of extinction, balanced between life and oblivion, taking care of their young and grieving their dead. He bolsters his studies with real-life accounts from scientists and local communities at the forefront of these developments. No longer abstract entities with Latin names, these species become fully realized characters enmeshed in complex and precarious ways of life, sparking our sense of curiosity, concern, and accountability toward others in a rapidly changing world.<br>

  Abstract: Vattimo's status as a left-wing faculty president paradoxically made him a target of the Red Brigades in the 1970s, causing him to flee Turin for his life. Left-wing terrorism did not deter the philosopher from his quest for social progress, however, and in the 1980s, he introduced a daring formulation called "weak thought," which stripped metaphysics, science, religion, and all other absolute systems of their authority. Vattimo then became notorious both for his renewed commitment to the core values of Christianity (he was trained as a Catholic intellectual) and for the Vatican's denunciation of his views.<br>

  Book Title: Not Being God-A Collaborative Autobiography<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): MCCUAIG WILLIAM<br>
  Abstract: Vattimo's status as a left-wing faculty president paradoxically made him a target of the Red Brigades in the 1970s, causing him to flee Turin for his life. Left-wing terrorism did not deter the philosopher from his quest for social progress, however, and in the 1980s, he introduced a daring formulation called "weak thought," which stripped metaphysics, science, religion, and all other absolute systems of their authority. Vattimo then became notorious both for his renewed commitment to the core values of Christianity (he was trained as a Catholic intellectual) and for the Vatican's denunciation of his views.<br>

  Abstract: One upshot of the contemporary ethical turn is the proliferation of solipsistic philosophical accounts of responsibility. If discussions of political and ethical responsibility historically emphasized social and intersubjective relations, the dominant philosophical formulations of responsibility privilege autonomy and

Modalities of solipsism that engage in Platonic soul-crafting and dwell on the inner life of the subject, her mental reality, over consideration of the predicaments of power she inhabits, or how these are historically constituted, politically sanctioned, and socially reproduced situations that thoroughly mediate that subjectivity. But these modalities of solipsism suggest something<br>

  Abstract: From Yü Ying-shih's perspective, the Dao, or the Way, constitutes the inner core of Chinese civilization. His work explores the unique dynamics between Chinese intellectuals' discourse on the

Volume 1 ofChinese History and Cultureexplores how theDaowas reformulated, expanded, defended, and preserved by Chinese intellectuals up to the seventeenth century, guiding them through history's darkest turns. Essays incorporate the evolving conception of the soul and the afterlife in pre- and post-Buddhist China, the significance of eating practices and social etiquette, the move toward greater individualism, the rise of the Neo-Daoist movement, the spread of Confucian ethics, and the growth of merchant culture and capitalism.

Thus, for example, if we are to know how people construct an awareness of historical processes, we must learn why certain events have become memorable, how they are given explanatory meaning, and how they are integrated into earlier life experiences.

Exploring ancient Maya attitudes toward death expressed at well-known sites such as Tikal, Guatemala, and Copan, Honduras, as well as less-explored archaeological locations, Fitzsimmons reconstructs royal mortuary rites and expands our understanding of key Maya concepts including the afterlife and ancestor veneration.<br>

It was a stigma procured during sex or maize consumption: ingesting maize and participating in sexual activity were ways of consuming death and incorporating it into the body. In eating maize, they brought what was born of the earth—of the realm of death—into their bodies and hence began participation in a larger life cycle.² Knowingin teuhtli, in tlazolli,“the dust, the filth,” of sex was likewise viewed as a<br>

Dead kings occasionally “saw” or “witnessed” the activities of their descendants, overseeing events from celestial or similar positions in the manner of Classic Maya gods. Caracol Stela 6 (Figure 57), for example, mentions the scattering of incense by Knot Ajaw on the Period Ending date of 9.8.10.0.0 4 Ahau 13 Xul (July 4, 603).

  Book Title: The Fate of Earthly Things-Aztec Gods and God-Bodies<br>
  Publisher: University of Texas Press<br>
  Author(s): Bassett Molly H.<br>
  Abstract: Following their first contact in 1519, accounts of Aztecs identifying Spaniards as gods proliferated. But what exactly did the Aztecs mean by a "god" (teotl), and how could human beings become gods or take on godlike properties? This sophisticated, interdisciplinary study analyzes three concepts that are foundational to Aztec religion—teotl (god), teixiptla (localized embodiment of a god), and tlaquimilolli (sacred bundles containing precious objects)—to shed new light on the Aztec understanding of how spiritual beings take on form and agency in the material world. In The Fate of Earthly Things, Molly Bassett draws on ethnographic fieldwork, linguistic analyses, visual culture, and ritual studies to explore what ritual practices such as human sacrifice and the manufacture of deity embodiments (including humans who became gods), material effigies, and sacred bundles meant to the Aztecs. She analyzes the Aztec belief that wearing the flayed skin of a sacrificial victim during a sacred rite could transform a priest into an embodiment of a god or goddess, as well as how figurines and sacred bundles could become localized embodiments of gods. Without arguing for unbroken continuity between the Aztecs and modern speakers of Nahuatl, Bassett also describes contemporary rituals in which indigenous Mexicans who preserve costumbres (traditions) incorporate totiotzin (gods) made from paper into their daily lives. This research allows us to understand a religious imagination that found life in death and believed that deity embodiments became animate through the ritual binding of blood, skin, and bone.<br>

  Abstract: Writing about writing is a particularly vexed example of the general relationship, experienced by humans in all cultures, between acting, on the one hand, and commenting on that action, on the other hand. There are not, in fact, many examples of the parallelism between “doing the thing that we are commenting on” in the performance of, and commentary on, most other forms of human activities. Another such example is the closely related activity of talking; that is, we

The most influential lesson of Marx—the one which ranges him alongside Freud and Nietzsche as one of the great negative diagnosticians of contemporary culture and social life—has, of course, rightly been taken to be the lesson of false consciousness, of class bias and ideological<br>

  Book Title: Eating Beauty-The Eucharist and the Spiritual Arts of the Middle Ages<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): ASTELL ANN W.<br>
  Abstract: In a remarkable book that is at once learned, startlingly original, and highly personal, Ann W. Astell explores the ambiguity of the phrase "eating beauty." The phrase evokes the destruction of beauty, the devouring mouth of the grave, the mouth of hell. To eat beauty is to destroy it. Yet in the case of the Eucharist the person of faith who eats the Host is transformed into beauty itself, literally incorporated into Christ. In this sense, Astell explains, the Eucharist was "productive of an entire 'way' of life, a virtuous life-form, an artwork, with Christ himself as the principal artist." The Eucharist established for the people of the Middle Ages distinctive schools of sanctity-Cistercian, Franciscan, Dominican, and Ignatian-whose members were united by the eucharistic sacrament that they received.<br>

  Abstract: Depending on which virtue is brought to the fore, a different Christian form of life appears, and the beauty of the church as a whole is thus variegated and enhanced. The early Dominicans found in the book of the prophet Zachariah a metaphoric and allegorical verse that foretells the establishment of the mendicant orders and characterizes the difference between the Franciscans and the Dominicans. Speaking as a shepherd who guides his flock by means of sweetness and strictness, the Lord declares: "And I will feed the flock…. And I took unto me two rods; one I called Beauty, and the<br>

  Abstract: When Simone Weil died in England in August 1943, Edith Stein (1891–1942) was already dead, a Jewish victim of the Nazis in Auschwitz. Stein, one of Edmund Husserl’s most brilliant students, had become Catholic in 1922. For ten years she had lived a devout life as a teacher and scholar, practicing an intense, eucharistic piety. In 1933 she entered the Carmelite cloister in Cologne, choosing for herself a name, “Sister Teresa Benedicta of the Cross,” that evoked the names of Carmel’s two great sixteenth-century reformers, Saints John of the Cross (1542–1591) and Teresa of Ávila (1515–1582), whose<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter, I begin to sketch out in more detail the constitutive aspects of what I am calling the democratic work of mourning. The democratic work of mourning involves the public spaces and practices by which the traumas of collective life are publicly worked through in ways that enliven social struggles for recognition while mitigating denial, disavowal, and distrust. In articulating this concept, I lean heavily on the work of object relations psychoanalysis and, in particular, the approach to mourning found in Melanie Klein and D. W. Winnicott.

It is a decision that cannot be answered by reference to rights—or without them. finally, it is a decision about patterns and qualities of relationships beyond that one family.² Babies who in earlier times would have died may now be rescued through surgery and other medical intervention, but the intervention<br>

It brought together a remarkable judge who felt unusually connected to the people in the litigation, a developmentally disabled youngster, and two volunteers who offered him a better life. What’s more, the unfolding of the case can be described, retrospectively, as a series of challenges to the unstated assumptions common to other cases about mentally retarded persons and about the role of the courts. For example, Judge Fernandez compared the Beckers’ assumption that Phillip’s differences were intrinsic and immutable with the Heaths’ view that Phillip is more like than unlike “normal” people and<br>

  Abstract: While the nondiscursive, frequently digressive character of the
      Mnemosyne-Atlascomplicates any linear narrative of its themes and contents, Christopher D. Johnson traces several thematic sequences in the panels. By drawing on Warburg's published and unpublished writings and by attending to Warburg's cardinal idea that "pathos formulas" structure the West's cultural memory, Johnson maps numerous tensions between word and image in theMnemosyne-Atlas. In addition to examining the work itself, he considers the literary, philosophical, and intellectual-historical implications of theMnemosyne-Atlas. As Johnson demonstrates, theMnemosyne-Atlasis not simply the culmination of Warburg's lifelong study of Renaissance culture but the ultimate expression of his now literal, now metaphoric search for syncretic solutions to the urgent problems posed by the history of art and culture.<br>

Its brevity makes it an ideal point of entry for readers daunted by the sheer bulk of Blumenberg's later writings, or distracted by their profusion of historical detail.Paradigmsexpresses many of Blumenberg's key ideas with a directness, concision, and clarity he would rarely match elsewhere. What is more, because it served as a beginner's guide for its author as well, allowing him to undertake an initial survey of problems that would preoccupy him for the remainder of his life, it has the additional advantage that it can offer us a glimpse into what might be called the 'genesis of the Blumenbergian world.'"-from the Afterword by Robert Savage<br>

  Abstract: Although most Americans no longer live in small towns, images of small-town life, and particularly of the mutual support and neighborliness to be found in such places, remain powerful in our culture. In

Macgregor lived in Viroqua for nearly two years. During that time she gathered data in public places, attended meetings, volunteered for civic organizations, talked to residents in their workplaces and homes, and worked as a bartender at the local American Legion post.<br>

The bull advertised what was, at the time of my first visit in December 2000, a restaurant called Ricky’s. Passing the bull and heading into the downtown proper, I passed the VFW hall on the right, the Century 21 real estate office on the left and, shortly after that, the Latter-day Saints church, the optometry office, the Vernon County Historical Society Museum, and Vernon Memorial Hospital,<br>

  Abstract: What did the existence of these three groups of people and their distinctive styles of community making mean for life in Viroqua? How permeable were these group boundaries? Could members of these groups get along well enough to get things done together if they needed to? In this chapter I examine how Viroquans’ tastes for different cultures of community played out in their interactions with one another. In general, these cultures of community did not hamper forming cross-group ties as individuals, but it sometimes made it hard for Viroquans to get things done together as groups.<br>

  Abstract: In their classic study of small-town life in the 1950s, Vidich and Bensman discovered that in the face of increasing competition from larger retailers, the local businessmen of “Springdale, New York,” attempted to remain solvent by ratcheting up their individual performances. The way to stay in business, they believed, was to work harder. In so doing, Springdale’s small-business owners became fiercely competitive with one another, increasingly unwilling to attempt innovations that seemed at all risky, and increasingly isolated from the community as a whole:<br>

  Book Title: The Aesthetics of Antichrist-From Christian Drama to Christopher Marlowe<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): PARKER JOHN<br>
  Abstract: The Antichrist myth in particular tells of an impostor turned prophet: performing Christ's life, he reduces the godhead to a special effect yet in so doing foretells the real second coming. Medieval audiences, as well as Marlowe's, could evidently enjoy the constant confusion between true Christianity and its empty look-alikes for that very reason: mimetic degradation anticipated some final, as yet deferred revelation. Mere theater was a necessary prelude to redemption. The versions of the myth we find in Marlowe and earlier drama actually approximate, John Parker argues, a premodern theory of the redemptive effect of dramatic representation itself. Crossing the divide between medieval and Renaissance theater while drawing heavily on New Testament scholarship, Patristics, and research into the apocrypha,

  Abstract: Prior to Christian scripture redemption in Greek meant to free by cash payment. The way we might redeem an old heirloom from hock, money back then could purchase human life. It freed prisoners of war, for example, or convicts. In the case of temple slaves, you had to pay the gods—or, what comes down to the same, the temple priests. Redemption meant you bought the person

  Abstract: The present volume tries to convey a comprehensive picture of the life and works of Johann Gottfried Herder. The nineteen authors of the following seventeen articles provide an overview of the diverse aspects of Herder’s contributions to eighteenth-century culture and beyond. It is no coincidence that this volume is the first collaborative attempt ever to compile a

  Author(s) Koepke Wulf<br>
  Abstract: The condition of German literature and its place and function in society was one of Herder’s major concerns. He thought of “literature” in an older, more comprehensive sense: It included, in addition to poetry, all types of prose writing, not only drama and fiction, but also biographies and memoirs, historiography, essays on all topics of general interest including science, and last but not least writings in the area of theology and religion, from church hymns and sermons to edifying and scholarly treatises.

  Author(s) Koepke Wulf<br>
  Abstract: In histories of German lyric poetry, Herder has no place. Also, his narrative and dramatic works are rarely mentioned in histories of German literature. It is true that he contributed in an extraordinary way to the evolution of a “new” poetry in the 1770s, but through theoretical stimulation rather than in his own creative practice. Herder started early to write poems, and cultivated the genre his entire life. The fact that he did not publish volumes of his own poetry seems to indicate his own doubts about its quality. Only toward the end of his life did he plan to<br>

  Author(s) Norton Robert E.<br>
  Abstract: To an extraordinary and perhaps even singular degree, Herder’s life and work are defined by the practice, function, and meaning of criticism. Despite the numerous other roles he occupied — and there were many: theologian, philosopher, linguist, historian, ethnographer, to name only a few — it was in his activity as a critic that Herder revealed his greatest strengths and arguably produced his most lasting achievements. Indeed, one might reasonably argue that Herder approached virtually everything he did

  Book Title: A Companion to Julian of Norwich-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): McAvoy Liz Herbert<br>
  Abstract: Julian of Norwich, the fourteenth/early fifteenth-century anchoress and mystic, is one of the most important and best-known figures of the Middle Ages. Her Revelations, intense visions of the divine, have been widely studied and read; the first known writings of an English woman, their influence extends over theology and literature. However, many aspects of both her life and thought remain enigmatic. This exciting new collection offers a comprehensive, accessible coverage of the key aspects of debate surrounding Julian. It places the author within a wide range of contemporary literary, social, historical and religious contexts, and also provides a wealth of new insights into manuscript traditions, perspectives on her writing and ways of interpreting it, building on the work of many of the most active and influential researchers within Julian studies, and including the fruits of the most recent, ground-breaking findings. It will therefore be a vital companion for all of Julian's readers in the twenty-first century. Dr LIZ HERBERT MCAVOY is Senior Lecturer in Gender in English and Medieval Studies at Swansea University. CONTRIBUTORS: KIM M. PHILLIPS, CATE GUNN, ALEXANDRA BARRATT, DENISE M. BAKER, DIANE WATT, E.

  Abstract: The above quotation, taken from a 1934 novel by Enid Dinnis, the main character of which is based loosely on the figure of Julian of Norwich, speaks volumes for the ‘industry’ of imaginative projection which Julian has become during the course of the last century or so. The very fact that this now obscure novel reached its sixth imprint in 1934 attests to its contemporary popularity and to a burgeoning fascination with Julian and the anchoritic life which she embraced. Since that time, Julian has become an increasingly familiar figure within both literary and non-literary circles, and both religious and<br>

  Author(s) PHILLIPS KIM M.<br>
  Abstract: In present-day Norwich one can visit a version of the church where the recluse who called herself Julian spent perhaps forty years of her life. I say ‘version’ because although St Julian’s Church, off Rouen Road in the south-east corner of the city, looks medieval it was largely reconstructed following severe damage suffered during bombing raids in 1942.¹ ‘Mother Julian’s Cell’ is an entirely modern structure built from scratch in the early 1950s.

He then adds that there is a higher reflectiveness that divides that inner world into two parts: a self and its realm, or the creator and his world. While such statements are intended to describe the inner lives of Romantic geniuses, they are also indicative of an overall understanding of the life of the mind as it was discussed among the German Romantics.

  Book Title: God and the Gawain-Poet-Theology and Genre in Pearl, Cleanness, Patience and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Hatt Cecilia A.<br>
  Abstract: Pearl, Cleanness, Patience and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight are accomplished examples of four different literary genres and represent some of the finest poetry in Middle English. They are, by turns, fast and funny, powerfully dramatic, gentle and ironic, telling of painful bereavement and the terror of victims of disaster and violence, as well as the comic bewilderment of people entangled in alarmingly mysterious situations. The anonymous poet's evident delight in the pleasures and artistry of courtly life has led some readers to suggest that he was a gifted but complacent frequenter of courts, his attention dedicated to the wealthy and his sympathies to the powerful, and moreover, that his poems pay the merest lipservice to religious observance. God and the Gawain-poet argues that, on the contrary, the poet's wide-ranging engagement with all human life explicitly acknowledges all material creation as God's gift, revelling in its physicality, in bodily senses and movement and the ways a community celebrates itself. Dr Hatt shows how, in exhorting readers to recognize and respond to the narrative of divine gift, he appears as an energetic Christian poet and a humane and compassionate observer.

  Book Title: Engaging Heritage, Engaging Communities-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Whitehead Chris<br>
  Abstract: Across the global networks of heritage sites, museums, and galleries, the importance of communities to the interpretation and conservation of heritage is increasingly being recognised. Yet the very term "meaningful community engagement" betrays a myriad of contrary approaches and understandings. Who is a community? How can they engage with heritage and why would they want to? How do communities and heritage professionals perceive one another? What does it mean to "engage"? These questions unsettle the very foundations of community engagement and indicate a need to unpick this important but complex trend. Engaging Heritage, Engaging Communities critically explores the latest debates and practices surrounding community collaboration. By examining the different ways in which communities participate in heritage projects, the book questions the benefits, costs and limitations of community engagement. Whether communities are engaging through innovative initiatives or in response to economic, political or social factors, there is a need to understand how such engagements are conceptualised, facilitated and experienced by both the organisations and the communities involved.BR> Bryony Onciul is Lecturer in History at the University of Exeter; Michelle Stefano is the Co-Director of Maryland Traditions, the folklife program for the state of Maryland and Visiting Assistant Professor in American Studies at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County; Stephanie Hawke is a project manager and fundraiser, working on a range of projects aiming to engage communities with cultural heritage.

  Book Title: Secret Police Files from the Eastern Bloc-Between Surveillance and Life Writing<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Petrescu Corina L.<br>
  Abstract: The communist secret police services of Central and Eastern Europe kept detailed records not only of their victims but also of the vast networks of informants and collaborators upon whom their totalitarian systems depended. These records, now open to the public in many former Eastern Bloc countries, reflect a textually mediated reality that has defined and shaped the lives of former victims and informers, creating a tension between official records and personal memories. Exploring this tension between a textually and technically mediated past and the subject/victim's reclaiming and retrospective interpretation of that past in biography is the goal of this volume. While victims' secret police files have often been examined as a type of unauthorized archival life writing, the contributors to this volume are among the first to analyze the fragmentary and sometimes remedial nature of these biographies and to examine the subject/victims' rewriting and remediation of them in various creative forms. Essays focus, variously, on the files of the East German Stasi, the Romanian Securitate (in relation to Transylvanian Germans in Romania), and the Hungarian State Security Agency.

While these notes and reports resemble particular snapshots of a person’s life, often taken from different angles and through various lenses, confirmed and reconfirmed by numerous Securitate sources, they typically resist attempts to assemble them into a coherent plot.

  Abstract: In 1953 a political crisis threatened to break up colonial Nigeria and terminate the possibility of common political independence for the country. This crisis was partly instigated, elaborately reported, and, ultimately, profoundly shaped by newspaper narratives. Anthony Enahoro, the anticolonial activist and leading member of the Action Group, one of the major political parties in late colonial Nigeria, whose motion at the federal parliament provoked this crisis, had been a journalist most of his adult life. Enahoro became the editor of the

  Abstract: The social sciences have been concerned for many decades with fundamental questions concerning the nature of social life and its investigation.

For Góngora in these ludic and occasionally vulgarletrillas, the space between signifier and signified is where play is king, where, amid the disguises and misdirections, truths<br>

  Book Title: Twenty Years On-Competing Memories of the GDR in Postunification German Culture<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Tate Dennis<br>
  Abstract: Twenty years on from the dramatic events that led to the opening of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the GDR, the subjective dimension of German unification is still far from complete. The nature of the East German state remains a matter of cultural as well as political debate. This volume of new research focuses on competing memories of the GDR and the ways they have evolved in the mass media, literature, and film since 1989-90. Taking as its point of departure the impact of iconic visual images of the fall of the Wall on our understanding of the historical GDR, the volume first considers the decade of cultural conflict that followed unification and then the emergence of a more complex and diverse "textual memory" of the GDR since the Berlin Republic was established in 1999. It highlights competing generational perspectives on the GDR era and the unexpected "afterlife" of the GDR in recent publications. The volume as a whole shows the vitality of eastern German culture two decades after the demise of the GDR and the centrality of these memory debates to the success of Germany's unification process.

  Book Title: The World as Metaphor in Robert Musil's 'The Man without Qualities'-Possibility as Reality<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Grill Genese<br>
  Abstract: Robert Musil, known to be a scientific and philosophical thinker, was committed to aesthetics as a process of experimental creation of an ever-shifting reality. Musil wanted, above all, to be a creative writer, and obsessively engaged in almost endless deferral via variations and metaphoric possibilities in his novel project, 'The Man without Qualities.' This lifelong process of writing is embodied in the unfinished novel by a recurring metaphor of self-generating de-centered circle worlds. The present study analyzes this structure with reference to Musil's concepts of the utopia of the Other Condition, Living and Dead Words, Specific and Non-Specific Emotions, Word Magic, and the Still Life. In contrast to most recent studies of Musil, it concludes that the extratemporal metaphoric experience of the Other Condition does not fail, but rather constitutes the formal and ethical core of Musil's novel. The first study to utilize the newly published Klagenfurt Edition of Musil's literary remains (a searchable annotated text), 'The World as Metaphor' offers a close reading of variations and text genesis, shedding light not only on Musil's novel, but also on larger questions about the modernist artist's role and responsibility in consciously re-creating the world. Genese Grill holds a PhD in Germanic Literatures and Languages from the Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York.<br>

  Abstract: In exile in Switzerland, having returned in the last years of his life to working on sections of the novel he had begun decades before, Musil told an inquiring friend that he was not, it was true, moving forward with his work, but that he was, he hoped, moving deeper.¹ This paradoxical deepening is attained by a circular, doubling-back motion that does not move the reader or writer toward a conclusion but rather calls attention to an experience of presence, an aesthetic resistant to progress. This resistance to forward-progression also reflects an ethical imperative based upon the complex analysis of<br>

  Book Title: Cultural Capital, Language and National Identity in Imperial Spain-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): BINOTTI LUCIA<br>
  Abstract: This innovative study examines the cultural mechanisms in early modern Spain that led to the translation, imitation and selective adoption of the values embodied by the Italian Renaissance. These mechanisms served to delineate a national tradition that addressed the needs of a changing society and gave a "Spanish" physiognomy to the Italian experience, which ultimately led to the Golden Age. By examining such important texts as the sentimental fictions of Diego de San Pedro and Juan de Flores, the Spanish translation of Orlando Furioso, Don Quixote, and the Polifemo, Binotti first describes the conditions imposed on book production by both the expectations of an elite audience and the limitations of the printing market while outlining the process of the creation of an expressive poetic language and the quest for literary models. She then looks at Ambrosio de Morales' chronicles and Bernardo de Aldrete's Del Origen, showing how a cultural discourse founded on foreign scholarship paved the way for the establishment of innovative-and autochtonous-methods of historical and scientific analysis in the early seventeenth-century. LUCIA BINOTTI is an associate professor in the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.<br>

  Book Title: Medieval Hispanic Studies in Memory of Alan Deyermond-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Weiss Julian<br>
  Abstract: Professor Alan Deyermond was one of the leading British Hispanists of the last fifty years, whose work had a formative influence on medieval Hispanic studies around the world. There were several tributes to his work published during his lifetime, and it is fitting that this one, in his memory, should be produced by Tamesis, the publishing house that he helped establish and to which he contributed so much as author and editor right up to his death. The contributors to this volume are some of Professor Deyermond's former colleagues, doctoral students, and members of the Medieval Hispanic Research Seminar. Given Professor Deyermond's breadth of expertise, the span of the essays is appropriately wide, ranging chronologically from the thirteenth to the sixteenth century, and covering lyric, hagiography, clerical verse narrative, frontier balladry, historical and codicological studies. The volume opens with a personal memoir of her father by Ruth Deyermond, and closes with the draft of an unpublished essay found amongst Professor Deyermond's papers, and edited by his literary executor, Professor David Hook. Andrew M. Beresford is Reader and Head of Hispanic Studies at the University of Durham. Louise M. Haywood is Reader in Medieval Iberian Literary and Cultural Studies, and Head of the Department of Spanish and Portuguese at the University of Cambridge. Julian Weiss is Professor of Medieval & Early Modern Hispanic Studies at King's College London.<br>

  Abstract: The legend of the black saint, Moses the Ethiopian (

Characterized by an overarching impression of duality, Moses stands partly as one of the many who followed in the footsteps of St Antony of Egypt, forsaking the corruption of society to lead a life of ascetic isolation in the desert, but partly also as an exception, remarkable not for his achievements in piety, but for<br>

  Abstract: Only a few reliable sources corroborate the identity of the historical Faustus, the person behind the legend. Faustus was an astrologer, but he also gained a reputation for dabbling in magic. Renaissance magic seemed to be a magnet, which possessed an extraordinary power to draw into its orbit a whole range of associations. Many feared magic as a dangerous adventure of curiosity into the realm of the devil. Faustus’s bold claims in these areas made him sensational, provocative, and, in his lifetime, admired at certain times, condemned at others. The condemnation of Faustian curiosity in combination with the devil pact,<br>

  Book Title: Rethinking Hanslick-Music, Formalism, and Expression<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Marx Wolfgang<br>
  Abstract: Rethinking Hanslick: Music, Formalism, and Expression' is the first extensive English-language study devoted to Eduard Hanslick--a seminal figure in nineteenth-century musical life. Bringing together eminent scholars from several disciplines, this volume examines Hanslick's contribution to the aesthetics and philosophy of music and looks anew at his literary interests. The essays embrace ways of thinking about Hanslick's writings that go beyond the polarities that have long marked discussion of his work such as form/expression, absolute/program music, objectivity/subjectivity, and formalist/hermeneutic criticism. This approach takes into consideration both Hanslick's important 'On the Musically Beautiful' and his critical and autobiographical writings, demonstrating Hanslick's rich insights into the context in which a musical work is composed, performed, and received. 'Rethinking Hanslick' serves as an invaluable companion to Hanslick's prodigious scholarship and criticism, deepening our understanding of the major themes and ideas of one of the most influential music critics of the nineteenth century. Dr Nicole Grimes is a Marie Curie Fellow at University College Dublin (UCD), and the University of California, Irvine. Dr Siobhán Donovan is a College Lecturer at the School of Languages and Literatures, UCD. Dr Wolfgang Marx is a Senior Lecturer at the School of Music, UCD.<br>

  Author(s) Grimes Nicole<br>
  Abstract: Eduard Hanslick is celebrated today primarily for his seminal publication in the field of music aesthetics—
                     Vom Musikalisch-Schönen: Ein Beitrag zur Revision der Ästhetik der Tonkunst. Upon its initial publication in Leipzig in 1854, this small book elicited controversy and heated debate. The nine subsequent editions published throughout Hanslick’s lifetime—between 1858 and 1902¹—ensured that the text remained the focus of debate on musical aesthetics well into the twentieth century.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt2jbm3b">Rethinking Hanslick</a><br>
  Author(s) Grimes Nicole<br>
  Abstract: Most of the reactions to Eduard Hanslick’s monograph 
                  Vom Musikalisch-Schönen during the author’s lifetime have either a decidedly polemical or a flattering ring to them. The result is that Hanslick’s theories on musical aesthetics are often abbreviated to handy catch-phrases, a practice that attests to the ideological prejudice of many of his contemporaries, and that has subsequently prevented an objective and substantive dialogue with his aesthetic theory. Despite avoiding such a polemical tone, Das Musikalisch-Schöne und das Gesammtkunstwerk vom Standpunkte der formalen Ästhetik,¹ published by Otakar Hostinský (1847–1910) in 1877, was poorly received and is largely forgotten today.

                  Wiener Salonblatt in 1884–87 before achieving lasting success as a composer of lieder provide fascinating glimpses into the concert life and musical politics of contemporary Vienna; they also provide rich insight into the relationship between composer and critic. By promoting the music of the New German School, Wolf placed himself squarely in opposition to Eduard Hanslick and Viennese cultural conservatism, thus joining in a larger struggle between proponents of traditionalism who championed Brahms and a stridently progressive faction that elevated Wagner to<br>

  Author(s) Larkin David<br>
  Abstract: As an observer of late nineteenth-century Viennese cultural life, Eduard Hanslick towers above all other journalists and writers who attempted to map the changing face of music in this period.¹ He has been typecast as the archenemy of musical progress, a foe to any who questioned the sacred tenets of “absolute” music, of which he was alleged to be a seminal theorist and tireless propagandist.² His championing of Brahms, as guardian of what he considered the legitimate compositional tradition, is as celebrated as his opposition to Liszt, Wagner, and their ilk, is notorious.

  Author(s) Cooke Maeve<br>
  Abstract: Shining a light on the ethical depravity of the Third Reich and the ethical disorientation of its aftermath, the figure of the “good German” invites us to imagine alternative, genuinely ethical forms of individual and collective life. As such it has a utopian moment, pointing towards a society in which people would live their lives in truly ethical ways.¹ Moreover, it has exemplary force. By the power of example, it opens up an imaginative space in which the possibility of an ethical life is momentarily present.<br>

  Author(s) Uecker Matthias<br>
  Abstract: The inclusion of a novel by Heinrich Böll in a volume on the topic of the “good German” should come as no surprise — indeed, the author himself could have been proposed as a worthy topic for this volume, as he acquired during his lifetime a reputation as the “conscience of the nation” and representative of an alternative, better Germany. Böll’s friend, the critic Heinrich Vormweg, chose the label “der andere Deutsche” (the other German) as the title of his biography of Böll — sidestepping the notion of the “good German,” but still suggesting a particular moral quality that distinguished the author<br>

  Author(s) Mackie Catriona<br>
  Abstract: What is widely believed to be the world’s first open-air folk museum was opened at Skansen in Sweden in 1891. It was the brainchild of Artur Hazelius who, in 1873, had founded the Nordiska Museet in Stockholm, which exhibited examples of folklife from around the country. It was Hazelius’s desire that the Nordiska Museet be ‘of benefit to science and at the same time arouse and fuel feelings of patriotism’, as well as ‘contribute to the strengthening of national feeling generation after generation, infusing love of one’s country … among young and old’.¹ This was a nationalism not of politics,<br>

  Abstract: Prestongrange is an open air colliery museum managed by East Lothian Council and located between Musselburgh and Prestonpans (Fig. 3.1) in East Lothian, Scotland. It has a lengthy and highly significant social and economic past. Standing remains of the 19th-century colliery and 20th-century brickworks dominate the site but it also had a historically-attested earlier life associated with the pottery and glass-making industries, which had taken place here adjacent to a thriving harbour.¹<br>

  Abstract: Dramatic developments in manufacturing, mining and transportation precipitated by the Industrial Revolution brought irreversible cultural and socio-economic change to Britain. Thousands of ordinary people experienced profound changes, their life experiences and personal stories etched into their physical remains and threaded through the trappings of their death. The pressures of modern development mean that many recent burials are disinterred from their ‘final’ resting place and reburied elsewhere. The research value of post-medieval burial assemblages was recognised only relatively recently,² and this has undoubtedly influenced the strategic approach to planning and excavation.

  Abstract: Francisco de Quevedo’s remarkable love poetry has finally begun to speak to us on its own terms: as poetry. For too long its voice struggled to be heard under the considerable weight of alternative critical displacement activity; that is, engagement with the still unresolved issues of chronology, dating, and corpus definition that are inevitably dominant when a poet does not publish his work in his own lifetime. However, there are some things that we do know for certain: the first posthumous edition of Quevedo’s poetry was compiled and edited by his friend, José Antonio González de Salas, in 1648, under<br>

  Book Title: Expressing Identities in the Basque Arena-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Allen N.J.<br>
  Abstract: Everyday nationalism, the human and cultural aspects of identity, is a neglected subject in the literature on nationalism in Europe. Jeremy MacClancy redresses the balance in this unusual and sharp book on the human and cultural aspects of the idea of being Basque in the modern world. The style is fresh and colloquial, dealing with several of the kinds of issues that usually appear in popular magazines - cuisine, football, art and graffiti - but the treatment is serious and illustrative of underlying currents in social life. MacClancy argues that the ethnographic understanding of nationalisms, rather than the orthodox studies of ideology, political parties, social classes and centre-periphery clashes - offers a more nuanced comprehension of the lived reality of people in areas where nationalism is a significant force. This is very much nationalism from the bottom up. JEREMY MACCLANCY is Professor of Social Anthropology at Oxford Brookes University. Series editors: Wendy James & Nick Allen<br>

  Abstract: Johan Huizinga was right: play is central to life. In his seminal and much-praised 
                  Homo Ludens, first published in 1938, Huizinga argued that play had an essential role in the development of civilization. To understand humanity in any rounded sense, it had to be taken into account. And of course, one key latter-day manifestation of play was the rise of organized sports from the nineteenth century on.¹ It is thus surprising that until relatively recently mass sport was not thought an appropriate topic of research for serious social scientists.

  Book Title: Narratives of Identity in Alban Berg's "Lulu"-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): dos Santos Silvio J.<br>
  Abstract: Exploring the crossroads between autobiographical narrative and musical composition, this book examines Berg's transformation of Frank Wedekind's Erdgeist (1895) and Die Büchse der Pandora/ (1904) -- the plays used in the formation of the libretto for Lulu -- according to notions of gender identity, social customs, and the aesthetics of modernity in Vienna of the 1920s and 1930s. While Berg modernized several aspects of the plays by Wedekind and incorporated serial techniques of composition from Arnold Schoenberg, he never let go of the idealistic Wagnerian perspectives of his youth. In fact, he went as far as reconfiguring aspects of Richard Wagner's life as an ideal identity to be played out in the compositional process. In the process of composing the opera, Berg also reflected on the most important cultural figures in fin-de-siècle Vienna that affected his worldview, including Karl Kraus, Emil Lucka, Otto Weininger, and others. Adopting an approach that combines a systematic analysis of Berg's numerous sketches for Lulu, correspondence, and the finished work with interpretive models drawn from cultural studies and philosophy, this book elucidates the ways in which Berg grappled with his self-image as an "incorrigible romantic" (unverbesserliche Romantiker) at the end of his life, explaining aspects of his musical language that have been considered strange or anomalous in the scholarship.

  Abstract: In its most basic terms, war depends upon getting men to risk their bodies, to override the instinct to flee danger so as to preserve life, and instead to stand and fight, and if necessary, to fight to the death. The means by which this is achieved can be understood variously as the effects of the noble virtue of courage at one end of the spectrum, and the despicable hardening of men into beasts at the other. The Middle Ages has not shaken off its reputation as a violent, conflict-ridden age (a view not without some justification), nor has it<br>

  Abstract: How does the role of public speech evolve in an age of technological transformation?

In the first, Richard Caton Woodville’s

This most iconic of genre paintings records a foundational scene of US imperialism, and captures the public drama of national expansion.

  Abstract: W. H.

In the present essay, I show that Auden’s ‘Journal of an Airman’, which is Book II of
                  The Orators(1932), reflects the legacy of the Great War for interwar English writers and ‘the guilt that every noncombatant feels’,² as he calls it. This guilt is a manifestation of a larger cultural turn that military historians have traced back to the Enlightenment, in which<br>

Following Schopenhauer, he takes music—and not literary genre, historical ideas, philosophical concepts, actual suffering, or even pure storytelling—to be what originates, shapes, and carries tragedy’s expressive force. According to Nietzsche, the spontaneous appeal of rhythm and melody evoke a primal sense of unity with life and with the greater whole in which life is imbedded. First the music and then the words, insofar as words too are musical, well up out of these depths as specific, merely individual instances of a deeper, never-quite-articulated knowledge and, generally,<br>

  Book Title: Arno Schmidt's 'Zettel's Traum'-An Analysis<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Langbehn Volker Max<br>
  Abstract: Arno Schmidt (1914-1979) is considered one of the most daring and influential writers of postwar Germany; the Germanist Jeremy Adler has called him a "giant of postwar German literature." Schmidt was awarded the Fontane Prize in 1964 and the Goethe Prize in 1973, and his early fiction has been translated into English to high critical acclaim, but he is not a well-known figure in the English-speaking world, where his complex work remains at the margins of critical inquiry. Volker Langbehn's book introduces Schmidt to the English-speaking audience, with primary emphasis on his most famous novel, 'Zettel's Traum'. One reviewer called the book an "elephantine monster" because of its unconventional size (folio format), length (1334 pages and over 10 million characters), and unique presentation of text in the form of notes, typewritten pages, parallel columns, and collages. The novel narrates the life of the main characters, Daniel Pagenstecher, Paul Jacobi and his wife Wilma, and their teenage daughter Franziska. In discussing the life and works of Edgar Allan Poe, the four engage in the problems connected with a translation of Poe. Langbehn's study investigates how literary language can mediate or account for the world of experiences and for concepts. Schmidt's use of unconventional presentation formats challenges us to analyze how we think about reading and writing literary texts. Instead of viewing such texts as a representation of reality, Schmidt's novel destabilizes this unquestioned mode of representation, posing a radical challenge to what contemporary literary criticism defines as literature. No comprehensive study of 'Zettel's Traum' exists in English. Volker Langbehn is associate professor of German at San Francisco State University.<br>

  Abstract: As in the preceding decades, the development of the French-Canadian novel after 1918 was closely connected to the nationalism of Quebec’s Catholic intelligentsia: In 1866 Abbé Henri-Raymond Casgrain demanded that the novel should advocate the French language and Catholicism, as well as concentrate on regional themes, country life, and the memory of Nouvelle-France. Camille Roy’s speech “La nationalisation de la littérature canadienne,” held in 1904 in the Société du parler français, built upon Casgrain’s theses and led the way for virtually all novels produced until 1930.

  Author(s) Nothof Anne<br>
  Abstract: Contemporary English-Canadian playwrights articulate a diversity of voices and give expression to the country’s many particular social and psychological spaces. They map its physical and mental terrain by dramatizing specific communities in terms of their histories, internal conflicts, and psychic landscapes. Since the 1960s regional history has continued to stimulate playwriting, providing local stories that inform the life of the community and the nation. These plays often revisit an apparently benign Canadian history from a critical perspective, and expose moral and political travesties. More recently, English-Canadian playwrights have been engaged in mapping specific communities in terms of ethnicity and ideology.<br>

  Abstract: Identity is an all-pervasive and fundamental aspect of human life, and yet identity as a concept is one of the most hotly debated — contested and defended — concepts of our time. The term identity has its roots in developmental psychology and has only been the subject of critical debates since modernism. The notion of identity as a psycho-social entity only dates back about 100 years to the psychology of William James who differentiated an outer perspective, the “social self” (me) as the self recognized by others, from an inner perspective, the “continuous, inner self” (I) that denoted the self as experienced<br>

  Abstract: As the title 
                  Intertidal Life suggests, Audrey Thomas’s 1984 novel depicts the story of a woman who is caught in-between the erratic tides of convention and difference. In an attempt to construct a new identity for herself after a severe rupture in her life story, Thomas’s protagonist, Alice Hoyle, oscillates between traditional, socially accepted positions for women and new identities she imagines for herself. The title not only points to the plot but also to the textual devices of Thomas’s narrative that moves back and forth between fixture and fluidity, fact and fiction.¹ The laws and features of the intertidal<br>

  Abstract: Like the two Canadian writers discussed in the previous chapters, Erdrich disrupts stereotypical representations of women and creates other potential life stories. However, Erdrich’s approach as well as her narrative technique distinctly differ from the other texts. As a writer of mixed ancestry, part Chippewa and part German-American, Louise Erdrich writes from a vantage point in-between two cultures. In interviews, she has emphasized that both her German as well as her Native backgrounds have influenced her writing and kindled her need for storytelling. For Erdrich, storytelling is a tool for coming to terms with her mixed ethnic background: “One of<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt81ph2">Goethe Yearbook 19</a><br>
  Author(s) MARKX FRANCIEN<br>
  Abstract: In the midst of the political turmoil of the Napoleonic wars, the force of nature took its toll on the French-occupied lower Rhine region. On January 13, 1809, the dam near Cleve (lying today in Germany near the Dutch border) collapsed, and the icy waters of the Rhine devastated the village of Brienen and flooded several other villages nearby. A seventeen-year-old village girl, Johanna Sebus, saved her mother’s life but died herself trying to rescue her neighbors. Three months later, her body was found, and she was buried with honor near the old Gothic church in Rindern.¹ Her selfless deed<br>

  Abstract: Much has been written about Goethe’s earlier didactic and polemical works on color.¹ However, little attention has been paid to his late essays titled 
                  Entoptische Farben (1817–20) and Chromatik (1822), on which I shall focus in this essay.² Goethe’s experiments with colors and his writings on the visual occupied him almost for his entire life. Whereas one group of scholars argues for continuity and consistency in Goethe’s works, a second group argues that his oeuvre displays gaps and discontinuities, yet that these various parts represent different voices dialogically responding to each other while in the process also forming a<br>

  Abstract: Some may still find it customary or convenient to distinguish Chaucer on the basis of his good humor from the sententiousness of Gower, but the distinction overestimates the difference between their respective accomplishments. As Derek Brewer reminds us, Chaucer’s early reception was as a poet who wrote “serious and nourishing subject-matter.”¹ During Chaucer’s own lifetime Eustache Deschamps eulogized him as 
                  Seneque en meurs, and observed that drinking from Chaucer’s font had quenched ma soif ethique.² Thomas Usk extolled Chaucer as “the noble philosophical poete / in Englissh,”³ and Henry Scogan took Chaucer to be a moral philosopher of “vertuous noblesse.”⁴<br>

  Book Title: Charles d'Orléans in England, 1415-1440-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Arn Mary-Jo<br>
  Abstract: Charles, duc d'Orléans, prince and poet, was a captive in England for twenty-five years following the battle of Agincourt. The studies in this volume, by European and American scholars, focus on his life and actions during that time, and show him as a serious and learned reader, a cunning political figure (accomplished in the skills that would impress the English nobility around him), and a masterful poet, innovative, witty, and intensely self-aware. Discussion of his manuscripts, his social and political relationships, his extensive library, and his poetry in two languages reveal him as a shrewd observer of life, which in his poetry he describes in ways not seen again until the Renaissance.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt9qdmdt">German Women's Writing in the Twenty-First Century</a><br>
  Author(s) Lawton Lindsay<br>
  Abstract: Women’s memoirs that share common themes of forced marriage, honor killing, or “crimes of honor” and detail the cruelty and violence to which the protagonist is subjected during her quest to pursue a “Western” lifestyle have been a part of the German-language literary landscape for decades. As they are increasingly tied to Islam, however, these memoirs have become especially visible in the twenty-first century.¹ The similarity of these works is reinforced by marketing conventions, including sensational titles like

  Author(s) Stehle Maria<br>
  Abstract: Since the mid-2000s there has been a marked uptick across the Western world of discussions surrounding the validity and effectiveness of feminism today.¹ Terms such as “postfeminism” or “lifestyle feminism” are increasingly used to characterize a popular interest in making feminism palatable through depoliticization, even as political actions are publicly evaluated as successes or failures on the basis of criteria more appropriate for their second-wave forebears. These discussions either brand feminist cultural production as successful activism against a sexist, mainstream, and consumerist culture, or condemn it as mere media sensation that points to the failure or ineffectuality of feminism today.<br>

  Abstract: Leftist cultural critic Jeffrey Nealon argues that “we’ve experienced an intensification of postmodern capitalism over the past decades, an increasing saturation of the economic sphere into formerly independent segments of everyday cultural life.”¹ The new global economy elevates competitiveness to its guiding principle, mandating a national quest to maintain “Konkurrenzfähigkeit des Standorts Deutschland” (competitiveness of Germany as a business hub).² At the same time, since the rise of neoliberalism in the 1990s, intensified technologies of the self, widely promoted by popular culture and the advertising industry, insinuate that individuals should take a functionalist approach toward themselves as sites of experience,<br>

  Book Title: A Companion to Friedrich Nietzsche-Life and Works<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Bishop Paul<br>
  Abstract: Nietzsche looms over modern literature and thought; according to Gottfried Benn, "everything my generation discussed, thought through innerly; one could say: suffered; or one could even say: took to the point of exhaustion - all of it had already been said . . . by Nietzsche; all the rest was just exegesis." Nietzsche's influence on intellectual life today is arguably as great; witness the various societies, journals, and websites and the steady stream of papers, collections, and monographs. This ‘Companion’ offers new essays from the best Nietzsche scholars, emphasizing the interrelatedness of his life and thought, eschewing a superficial biographical method but taking seriously his claim that great philosophy is “the self-confession of its author and a kind of unintended and unremarked ‘memoir’.” Each essay examines a major work by Nietzsche; together, they offer an advanced introduction for students of German Studies, philosophy, and comparative literature as well as for the lay reader. Re-establishing the links between Nietzsche's philosophical texts and their biographical background, the volume alerts Nietzsche scholars and intellectual historians to the internal development of his thought and the aesthetic construction of his identity as a philosopher.

Here Nietzsche read Spinoza,¹ went for walks by the lake—noting, in particular, the existence of a large, pyramid-shaped rock by the water, close to Surlei—and wondered about whether to buy a typewriter. Externally, Nietzsche’s life looked dull, even boring: he stayed in a small house near the woods, ate a cheap lunch from<br>

  Abstract: The catastrophic breakdown in relations with family and friends alike after the débâcle with Lou von Salomé and Paul Rée left Nietzsche isolated from almost everyone in his life. After his mother accused him of having besmirched the name of his father, Nietzsche packed his bags and left Naumburg for Leipzig in September 1882 (cf. KSB 6, 256 and 326); his sister, Elisabeth, was seemingly unable to understand why Nietzsche was so upset by this remark, but we should remember Nietzsche’s identification with his father, following his early death.

                  Twilight of the Idols (Götzen- Dämmerung) Nietzsche tells us: “Formula of my happiness: a Yes, a No, a straight line, a ,goal…” (Formel meines Glücks: ein Ja, ein Nein, eine gerade Linie, ein Ziel…; TI “Sayings and Arrows” §44; KSA 6, 66). How Nietzsche chose his path through life, abandoning the zig-zag of his academic, Wagnerian, decadent path for the straight line of his philosophy, which says “yes” (and hence also says “no”: by affirming one thing, it also “renounces” another), and how he did so in an exemplary fashion, is<br>

  Abstract: In his notebooks for the period from the end of 1876 to the summer of 1877, we find the following sketch for a section in the first volume of 
                  Menschliches, Allzumenschliches(Human, All Too Human) (MA I §292; KSA 2, 235–37). Where, in the published version of this passage, which is entitled “Forward” (“Vorwärts”), Nietzsche casts his observations in the form of recommendations for the reader, in this draft he states them as his personal ambition. So it seems appropriate, as a conclusion to this Companion to Friedrich Nietzsche, to his life and his works, to this Companion to Friedrich<br>

  Author(s) Whitelaw Anne<br>
  Abstract: In the opening pages of 
                  Biography: A Very Short Introduction, Hermione Lee describes the genre of biography through the striking metaphors of the autopsy and the portrait. A biography is like an autopsy because it literally opens up the individual to ‘investigate, understand, describe, and explain what may have seemed obscure, strange, or inexplicable’ (Lee 2009, 1). Conversely, the metaphor of the portrait suggests that biographies can capture the character of a subject, bringing a person to life through ‘attention to detail and skill in representation’ (Lee 2009, 2). Taken together, these metaphors underscore both the analytical and representational operations<br>

  Abstract: This paper explores the potential of biography as a strategy for generating histories of museum buildings and provides a rationale for why this would be an important addition to the architectural history of museums and galleries and museum studies more broadly. Drawing on recent academic research in museum studies, architectural history and theory, as well as biography, autobiography and life writing, the chapter explores aspects of the subjects, methods and outcomes of architectural history. It asks questions about what such an approach might tell us about architecture and what histories it might reveal of museums, galleries and the people who<br>

  Abstract: The story of architecture museums in Berlin is, in one sense, a short one.¹ Although Berlin’s collection of archives dedicated to architecture is quite deep, it was only in 2007, when the Technical University renamed its archive and exhibition space after its historic Architekturmuseum, that the architecture museum as a type of institution re-established itself in the city’s cultural landscape.² Before this, the last time there was an architecture museum in Berlin was from 1931 to 1933. It was called the Schinkel Museum, and its short lifespan is surprising, given that Karl Friedrich Schinkel (1781–1841) was – and still<br>

  Abstract: Alexandre Lenoir’s Museum of French Monuments in Paris (1795–1816) began life as a temporary depot during the French Revolution, sheltering artefacts salvaged from nationalised church, royal and aristocratic property. Following Lenoir’s dogged pursuit of his cause, the depot was eventually turned into a public museum that fused emerging ideas about art, history and personality, enhanced with the flair of Lenoir’s creative curation, to produce a unique representation of France. Unlike the model of the great museums, which was developing nearby in the high-profile Louvre and was to become the norm in the 19th century, the Museum of Monuments presented<br>

  Book Title: Fighting For Time-Shifting Boundaries of Work and Social Life<br>
  Publisher: Russell Sage Foundation<br>
  Author(s): Kalleberg Arne L.<br>
  Abstract: Though there are still just twenty-four hours in a day, society’s idea of who should be doing what and when has shifted. Time, the ultimate scarce resource, has become an increasingly contested battle zone in American life, with work, family, and personal obligations pulling individuals in conflicting directions. In Fighting for Time, editors Cynthia Fuchs Epstein and Arne Kalleberg bring together a team of distinguished sociologists and management analysts to examine the social construction of time and its importance in American culture. Fighting for Time opens with an exploration of changes in time spent at work—both when people are on the job and the number of hours they spend there—and the consequences of those changes for individuals and families. Contributors Jerry Jacobs and Kathleen Gerson find that the relative constancy of the average workweek in America over the last thirty years hides the fact that blue-collar workers are putting in fewer hours while more educated white-collar workers are putting in more. Rudy Fenwick and Mark Tausig look at the effect of nonstandard schedules on workers’ health and family life. They find that working unconventional hours can increase family stress, but that control over one’s work schedule improves family, social, and health outcomes for workers. The book then turns to an examination of how time influences the organization and control of work. The British insurance company studied by David Collinson and Margaret Collinson is an example of a culture where employees are judged on the number of hours they work rather than on their productivity. There, managers are under intense pressure not to take legally guaranteed parental leave, and clocks are banned from the office walls so that employees will work without regard to the time. In the book’s final section, the contributors examine how time can have different meanings for men and women. Cynthia Fuchs Epstein points out that professional women and stay-at-home fathers face social disapproval for spending too much time on activities that do not conform to socially prescribed gender roles—men are mocked by coworkers for taking paternity leave, while working mothers are chastised for leaving their children to the care of others. Fighting for Time challenges assumptions about the relationship between time and work, revealing that time is a fluid concept that derives its importance from cultural attitudes, social psychological processes, and the exercise of power. Its insight will be of interest to sociologists, economists, social psychologists, business leaders, and anyone interested in the work-life balance.<br>

  Abstract: Time on the job is a central and increasingly contested terrain in the lives of Americans. Working time sets the framework for both work and family life, and since time is not an expandable resource, long hours at the workplace must inevitably take time away from the rest of life. Long schedules of sixty hours a week or more mean that a worker is forced to scramble for time at home, inevitably missing even simple daily rituals such as breakfast or dinner with family and friends. Yet short workweeks of thirty hours or less, which offer more time for private<br>

  Abstract: The analytical significance of time has long been recognized in the natural science writings of Galileo, Newton, and Einstein and in the philosophical tracts of Heidegger, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche, among others. Indeed an awareness of a past, a present, and a future, and of the finiteness of life are central features of human existence (Berger and Luckmann 1967). Human beings find meaning and identity in the temporal character of existence (Urry 1991, Collinson 2003). Yet it is only relatively recently that the importance of time has been acknowledged in theories of society (Giddens 1979, 1984, 1987; Adam 1990; Harvey 1990;<br>

  Book Title: After Parsons-A Theory of Social Action for the Twenty-First Century<br>
  Publisher: Russell Sage Foundation<br>
  Author(s): Bershady Harold J.<br>
  Abstract: After Parsonsis a fresh examination of Parsons' theoretical undertaking, its significance for social scientific thought, and its implications for present-day empirical research. The book is divided into four parts: Social Institutions and Social Processes; Societal Community and Modernization; Sociology and Culture; and the Human Condition. The chapters deal with Parsons' notions of societal community, societal evolution, and modernization and modernity.After Parsonsaddresses major themes of enduring relevance, including social differentiation and cultural diversity, social solidarity, universalism and particularism, and trust and affect in social life. The contributors explore these topics in a wide range of social institutions-family and kinship, economy, polity, the law, medicine, art, and religion-and within the context of contemporary developments such as globalization, the power of the United States as an "empireless empire," the emergence of forms of fundamentalism, the upsurge of racial, tribal, and ethnic conflicts, and the increasing occurence of deterministic and positivistic thought.<br>

In this chapter I can give adequate treatment neither to Parsons’s view of American society nor to my own.

  Abstract: The purpose of the chapter is threefold. The first is methodological: to call attention to the reductionist manner in which interpreters of Talcott Parsons typically connect the events of his life with the content of his ideas and to urge, instead, a more developmental—or life-course—approach. The second goal is to furnish a partial illustration of this approach through a brief intellectual-historical examination of the early phases in the development on Parsons’s concept of culture. I take culture as the focus because, although it is one of the central concepts throughout Parsons’s work, not only have Parsons scholars misunderstood<br>

  Book Title: Bones of Contention-The living archive of Vasil Levski and the making of Bulgaria's national hero<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Todorova Maria<br>
  Abstract: This book is about documenting and analyzing the living archive around the figure of Vasil Levski (1837–1873), arguably the major and only uncontested hero of the Bulgarian national pantheon. The processes described, although with a chronological depth of almost two centuries, are still very much in the making, and the living archive expands not only in size but constantly adding surprising new forms. The monograph is a historical study, taking as its narrative focus the life, death and posthumous fate of Levski. By exploring the vicissitudes of his heroicization, glorification, appropriations, reinterpretation, commemoration and, finally, canonization, it seeks to engage in several broad theoretical debates, and provide the basis for subsequent regional comparative research. The analysis of Levski's consecutive and simultaneous appropriations by different social platforms, political parties, secular and religious institutions, ideologies, professional groups, and individuals, demonstrates how boundaries within the framework of the nation are negotiated around accepted national symbols.<br>

  Abstract: This book has been an argument for the relevance of microhistory, an attempt to demonstrate the significance of local knowledge in approaching the big issues of the profession and of life in general. It is taken for granted that a narrative, written in a few big languages and using examples of a few big countries, has universal connotations. Other examples in other languages (even large languages as Mandarin, Arabic or Hindi) are, at most, allowed to be footnotes in this universal sweep. It is this book’s attempt to demonstrate the general meaning and worth of examples from very small places,<br>

  Abstract: That sensual pleasure in this world is praised and, indeed, enjoined in Muslim tradition when it occurs within the bounds of legitimate union, requires no demonstration.

  Book Title: Where Currents Meet-Frontiers of Memory in Post-Soviet Fiction of Kharkiv, Ukraine<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Zaharchenko Tanya<br>
  Abstract: Where Currents Meet treats the Ukrainian and Russian components of cultural experience in Ukraine’s East as elements of a complex continuum. This study of cultural memory in post-Soviet space shows how its inhabitants negotiate the historical legacy they have inherited. Tanya Zaharchenko approaches contemporary Ukrainian literature at the intersection of memory studies and border studies, and her analysis adds a new voice to an ongoing exploration of cultural and historical discourses in Ukraine. This scholarly journey through storylines explores the ways in which younger writers in Kharkiv (Kharkov in Russian), a diverse, dynamic, but understudied border city in east Ukraine today come to grips with a traumatized post-Soviet cultural landscape. Zaharchenko’s book examines the works of Serhiy Zhadan, Andrei Krasniashchikh, Yuri Tsaplin, Oleh Kotsarev and others, introducing them as a “doubletake" generation who came of age during the Soviet Union’s collapse and as adults revisited this experience in their novels. Filling the space between society and the state, local literary texts have turned into forms of historical memory and agents of political life.<br>

  Chapter Two  FRONTIERS OF EMPTINESS from:

  Abstract: In December 2010, the BBC Ukrainian Book of the Year prize was awarded to writer Serhiy Zhadan for his novel
                     Voroshylovhrad. Four years later, in December 2014,Voroshylovhradwas named the BBC Book of the Decade. This literary work interlaces black humor and uncensored language (peoplespeak) with the harsh realities of post-Soviet life. The result is a collection of adroitly forthright reflections on today’s Ukraine, in all its complexities and contradictions. Among these complexities, the country’s past plays a key role.<br>

  Abstract: In
                  Park kul’tury i otdykha(Park of culture and leisure, 2008), a collection of short stories by Kharkiv writer Andrei Krasniashchikh (b. 1970), most events take place in the gap between life and death. This deep, inhabitable abyss is far from being a mere border between two separate worlds. As the book’s description explains, “this rift (prosvet) is not always clearly tangible on a daily basis, but it is quite noticeable when ghosts and corpses emerge from it. Or when our dreams and fantasies leak into it.”¹ In an interesting parallel, Zhadan observes in a separate piece of writing: “Literature<br>

  Book Title: Imperfection and Defeat-The Role of Aesthetic Imagination in Human Society<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Nemoianu Virgil<br>
  Abstract: Literature is defined in a challenging way as the "science" of imperfection and defeat, or else as a type of discourse that deals with defeat, loss, uncertainty in social life, by contrast with virtually all disciplines (hard sciences or social sciences) that affirm certainties and wish to convince us of truths. If in real history most constructive attempts end up in failure, it follows that we ought to have also a field of research that examines this diversity of failures and disappointments, as well as the alternative options to historical evolution and progress. Thus literature serves an indispensable role: that of gleaning the abundance of past existence, the gratuitous and the rejected being placed here on an equal level with the useful and the successful. This provocative and unusual approach is illustrated in chapters that deal with the dialectics between literary writing and such fields as historical writing, or religious discourses, and is also illustrated by the socio-historical development of East-Central Europe.<br>

  Abstract: Polish philosopher Leszek Kołakowski left Poland in 1968 after his expulsion from Warsaw University, and therefore hardly warrants being categorized as a “dissident” in terms of the time frame of this study. However, as a revisionist Marxist who goes beyond revisionism, as a mentor to the generation of Michnik, and as the author of arguably the most important theoretical text of the Polish opposition of the 1970s, he must be included.¹ The influence of his life, his work, and the changing nature of his own philosophical positions was enormous.

  Abstract: The overall impact of transitology on Russian political and economic life cannot be compared with its effects in other postsocialist countries and republics of the former USSR. This country's former status as superpower and the suspicious attitudes of the "reformed" elites toward every foreign project or initiative, as well as the resistance to Westernization traditional for this culture are among many factors that have imposed limits both theoretical and practical (or policy-making) on the neoliberal paradigm of democratization and modernization.

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: ajs.2000.106.issue-2<br>
Date: 09 2000<br>
Author(s): Lara Maria Pia<br>
Abstract: Lara’s book is thick with references and interwoven arguments and is sometimes hard to follow for this reason. She is concerned with showing the possibilities for a recognition of the importance of self‐fashioning narrative in Habermas’s own work, especially in his early analysis in
   The Structural Transformation of the Public. She takes up discussions of deliberative democracy to show how they are enriched by a recognition of the place of narrative; she takes up postmodern accounts of identity; and she pursues her argument through the work of Paul Ricoeur, Albrecht Wellmer, and Wayne Booth, as well as a host of others. Despite the density of the work, Lara succeeds in illuminating the relation between narrative, identity, and morality. If the question of how we should live is bound up with ideas of who we are, and if we shape who we are with the help of narratives of other lives, these ideas would seem to be an integral part of the normative question that Habermas asks as to how we should live with others. Lara’s book is not only a welcome addition to recent work on Habermas, but also an important participant in current discussions of the relationship between literature and morality.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: et.2001.112.issue-1<br>
Date: 10 2001<br>
Author(s): Young, Jeffrey T.<br>
Abstract: Young’s new book on Adam Smith provides a careful textual analysis of Smith’s two major works:
      The Theory of Moral SentimentsandThe Wealth of Nations. Young argues, with good textual evidence, that Smith did not divide economics from moral theory and that, indeed, Smith thought of economics as a moral science. Young traces Smith’s economic and moral philosophy to Aristotle and Hume, and he points out, correctly, that “self‐interest itself had a significant moral dimension in Smith” (p. 173). Thus Smith’s alleged focus on self‐interest inThe Wealth of Nationshas normative dimensions not always recognized by all Smith scholars. Young uses Smith’s notions of the impartial spectator and benevolence as well as his theory of justice to link the two texts. This is a controversial conclusion since neither the impartial spectator nor benevolence is evident as an important concept inThe Wealth of Nations. Young also argues that Smith divides the economic sphere from the political sphere (see his matrix on p. 158), a questionable conclusion in light of Smith’s focus on political economy inThe Wealth of Nations. Young’s book also suffers from his apparently not having read Amartya Sen’s or my works on Smith, both of which make many of the same arguments Young develops. Still, Young has added further to the growing literature that reads Smith as a serious moral philosopher whose theory of self‐interest is far from libertarian and who neither divided economics from ethics nor politics from either.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: The necessity of both solidarity and proceduralism thus holds for both distributive and criminal justice. In the end, Ricoeur remains committed to notions that ground the just polity in community and mutual sharing without thinking that these notions require us to dispense with the formalism of procedures of justice. While the latter are not sufficient on their own to create or sustain a just society, while, indeed, formal procedures always presuppose some conception of the good, procedural conceptions allow us to recognize each other as subjects of rights. Although it is not always clear that Ricoeur succeeds in reconciling Rawls and Walzer or Habermas and Gadamer, he does provide a fresh perspective on current debates within his own interesting account of the structure of moral action.<br>

Author(s): Duranti Alessandro<br>
Abstract: Ahearn, always a perceptive writer, brings out a fear that many linguistic anthropologists have but rarely expressthe fear of being assimilated to sociocultural anthropology and thus losing their identity through the forfeiting of their specificity. This is the flip side of William Labovs original wish that sociolinguistics might disappear once linguistics agreed to see language as a social phenomenon (that this has not happened is both an indictment of linguistics narrowmindedness and a validation of Labovs and other sociolinguists efforts to develop sociolinguistics into a vibrant independent field). The question then arises why we should worry about being assimilated. Shouldnt we, on the contrary, welcome such a possibility, to be seen as a validation of our work or as the mainstreaming of our concerns? The problem is not in the future, which cannot be predicted, but in the past. Everything we know from our earlier experiences warns us that an anthropology without a distinct group of language specialists is likely to be an anthropology with a nave understanding of communication. We have seen it happen already. When anthropology departments decide not to have a linguistic subfield, thinking that they dont need one, their students tend to take language for granted, identifying it with a vague notion of discourse. It is for this reason that we need to sharpen our historical, theoretical, and methodological understanding of what it means to study language as culture. We owe it first to our students.<br>

Abstract: In the course of the book, no real convergence is achieved; each one ends where he started, asserting his own beliefs, visions, and concerns. Has anything been gained in the process? The intense and occasionally pointed dialogues bring forth an incremental, but substantial clarification of the issues at hand, the issues at stake, and their potential (but not actual) interaction. The fact of the matter is that neuroscience has no privileged bearing on human affairs simply because it deals with the brain. Why push it to realms in which it does not belong?<br>

Abstract: This idea of the deliberate recovery of theological tensions by crossing religious boundaries can be understood in terms of the ecumenical concept of the complementarity of conflicting doctrinal formulations. Opposing doctrinal formulations are regarded as complementary expressions of a theological truth so profound as to be irreducible to any single formulation. For the ecumenical use of the complementarity concept, see, e.g., Avery Dulles, “Paths to Doctrinal Agreement: Ten Theses,”
            Theological Studies47 (1986): 44–45.<br>

Author(s): Woodall Christopher <br>
Abstract: Scholars and their students interested in the field would do well to begin with these studies, despite some unevenness in period, place, and theme. Developments in the twentieth century, for example, are not well served, especially as their globalization bursts all traditional boundaries in the discipline, making a historical perspective essential to an understanding of ongoing transformations in literate life everywhere, not just in the West. Similarly, the absence of illustrations undermines the potential value of these books as introductions to the history of reading. Much of the work here depends on the material objects that readers actually had; without images of them, the reader develops less of a sense of the field. Finally, the exclusion of the essays on correspondence from the original collection is deeply regrettable; Chartier’s summary of their implications in the introduction hardly does justice to them, especially to the important study of the 1847 postal survey by Dauphin and two other colleagues. The translations are generally accurate, but the indexes are barely adequate.<br>

Author(s): Robbins,  Jeffrey W.<br>
Abstract: While sharing the aim of relating philosophy and theology, I do not think the project is best accomplished by thinking ontotheologically (at least, not in its Heideggerian sense). What is needed is to insist on a sharper distinction between ontotheological philosophy and religious theology so that we can better understand how they might relate. And here again, I agree with Robbins for different reasons: Ricoeur, Lévinas, and Marion are key sources in this project, for their work maintains the distinction that it calls into question.<br>

Abstract: Hence, our choice of philosophies should not be limited to the two main philosophies identified by Budd but rather could take up ideas from process thinking, which is a quieter but nevertheless relevant philosophy to which LIS should attend. By valuing the processes and articulating this with better abstractions more congruent with our action, we not only further our own project; we also sustain a vital engagement with the projects of individuals. We more clearly articulate the library in the life of the user, to use the words of Wiegand [

            queer(Somerville2000, 136) and the insistence that compulsory heterosexuality is “integral” to the logic of racial segregation (137).<br>

Abstract: For the notion of strategic essentialism, see Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, “Subaltern Studies: Deconstructing Historiography,” in her
            The Spivak Reader, 214–21. Serene Jones has drawn attention to the fact that the poststructuralist theoretical assumptions about the always oppressive nature of binarisms do not necessarily hold up under the pressures of concrete political struggles and that, in order to strengthen the bond of solidarity for a coalition of diverse social and cultural identities, what is called for is some kind of grand narrative that clearly defines the powers to be resisted and dismantled. I think this applies to a coalition of different religious identities as well.

Abstract: Nevertheless, empiricism does not have the last word—it perhaps never has the last word, not even in what might be called “positivist empiricism,” and certainly not in practical theology, as this discipline is characterized by the interaction between empiricism and normativeness. We both share this conviction—the fifth characteristic. Therefore human rights—no matter how contested they are, which is neither surprising nor extraordinary—offer an important perspective, as the normative criteria they embody always require critical and constructive reflection. In the last part of the article I have even presented them as regulative principles of truth and justice, as a result of which they offer a kind of worldview‐related and morality‐related infrastructure for the social institutions that determine human actions in societal and personal life—the sixth characteristic. After all, for both Browning and me the ultimate issue is—the seventh characteristic—the vitality of the Christian tradition in terms of relevance and identity in the context of a multicivilization society.<br>

Abstract: Whatever normative conclusions may be drawn in the end, theological ethicists ignore the unique situation of children and childhood at their own peril. Neglecting such marginalized groups as women and minorities weakened the voice of theological ethics in the past, both by silently playing into larger social wrongs and by failing to learn and grow from those silenced. Childhood in the United States and the world presents theological ethics today with a new and different but just as acute social challenge. Methodologically, since children cannot speak up as fully as can adults for themselves, theological ethicists should engage as deeply as possible with children’s actual social experiences, including through the sophisticated observational work of the human sciences, in order more creatively to understand and respond. Substantively, childhood demands at the very least renewed attention to the asymmetrical tensions of human moral responsibility, the senses in which others demand of those around them creative self‐transformation. This childist gesture of responsiveness and self‐critique has already begun to animate the human sciences. How much more, then, should it be welcomed and deepened further by Christian ethicists, who in one way or another trace a transformed world to the possibilities incarnated in an infant’s birth.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: In a first reading of the book, I was critical of this emphasis on moral motivations, since it seemed to be overburdened by a psychological approach. But, on a second reading, I had to refrain from my critique. Ricoeur makes the point that he has no intention to “take the place of a resolution for the perplexities raised by the very concept of a struggle, still less of a resolution of the conflicts” (218). In other words, Ricoeur is proposing a well‐needed complement to the institutional design trend that has invaded contemporary political philosophy. Contrary to many, he stands before the most perplexing issue of recognition with eyes wide open: indeed, demands of recognition may never end and take the form of an “unhappy consciousness” (218). One can try to resolve this potential inflation of claims by sorting out political and substantive issues. But a solution that takes only this path could create vast areas of frustration that canny elites have learned to fuel, or come to neglect recognition claims on the grounds that they hide a Pandora's box waiting to be opened. I suspect that this neglect mechanism is one of the reasons why so many legitimate recognition claims still languish in limbo as we speak. The course taken by Ricoeur may be difficult to square with the mainstream approach in contemporary political philosophy—political liberalism, to name it—but it nonetheless deserves careful attention.<br>

Abstract: Three general features of this method can be noted in advance. First, this method must be immanent or internal to its subject matter. Dialectical theorists reject outright the idea that the thinker can occupy some privileged Archimedean point outside the subject of investigation. … A second feature of dialectical method is its dialogical character. Theorizing is an activity taking place not simply within the mind but between minds. Thinking is dialogical because it always takes the form of an exchange or a conversation between ourselves, our contemporaries, and our predecessors. … Third, the dialogical element is related to the historical dimension of theory.

Author(s): Popkin Jeremy D. <br>
Abstract: Instructive as his book is, Popkin could also have explored in greater depth yet the relationship between historical scholarship and expressions of the self. By focusing on autobiographies alone, he misses an opportunity to examine how such texts and scholarly publications related to (and possibly affected) one another, most notably in their divergent or convergent patterns of self‐representation. The boundary between autobiographical and scholarly writings may be more porous than Popkin intimates. Paul Hollander’s recent study of academic acknowledgments arrives, for instance, at conclusions that mirror Popkin’s regarding self‐representation and professional norms (“Acknowledgments: An Academic Ritual,”
   Academic Questions15, no. 1 [2001–2]: 63–76). Likewise, one could question why Popkin limited himself to the discursive analysis of published sources and “the motives that historian‐autobiographers acknowledge in their texts” (78). Autobiographies are also social practices that call for systematic research outside the text, in archival and published sources (and, perhaps, interviews as well). But Popkin is too good a historian not to know this. His book is by and about historians; it is dedicated to historians, but it is not only for historians. Its chief objective may well be to show how much the historian’s autobiography has contributed “to the literature of personal life writing” (8). In this respect as in many others,History, Historians, and Autobiographyis a success.<br>

Author(s): Browning,  Don S.<br>
Abstract: While this book will be of great interest to Christian ethicists as well as to religious and moral educators, it should also be read by social scientists, philosophers, and evolutionary psychologists. Browning’s view that nontheological disciplines depend on images of the human that play a guiding role for their research, as well as for the interpretation of their results, points to the continued need for more interdisciplinary work. According to this point of view, theology should play a public role in identifying such prescientific or preempirical images as well as in describing and advancing refined and responsible images based on the Christian tradition. The present volume goes a long way in either direction.<br>

Abstract: My encounter with this student suggests another way of thinking about the political value of rewriting. Countering all the more blasé signals my students were giving me that it was most naive to think the retelling of stories from another point of view could have any political impact, it is evidence that women’s rewritings of classic texts can still affect young women, still make them think and make them want to contribute to the discussions, the debates that shape the public sphere. Although we need, of course, to factor in serendipity—the student was on holiday and thought she had discovered a little‐known book when in fact it was a
      New York Timesbest seller—there is definitely a sense in which her discovery marked a moment in her life and signals the development of a feminist consciousness (broadly defined as a certain awareness of gender identity combined with a critical position in respect to misogyny and patriarchy and a conviction that things can be changed). There is no denying that increasing individualization at all levels of society has caused the loss of a sense of collective action and political projects. This is equally true for ideas of improvement, emancipation, and modernization, the responsibility of which has largely been shifted to the individual, whose “human rights,” as Bauman argues, are redefined as “the right of individuals to stay different and to pick and choose at will their own models of happiness and fitting life‐style” (2000;2005, 29). In this deregulated and privatized sociopolitical context that knows no common cause, re‐vision can only fail to formulate enabling fictions for a better future for all. Yet in its capacity to speak to individuals, it can still draw them into visions of community and collectivity. Re‐vision may thus not be the lifeline that is to haul us out of patriarchy any more, but as a structure of address that engages readers into contemplating differences, it remains one of the ways in which we keep sane and critical and thinking, moved by the stories of long‐forgotten lives into participating in an open public sphere.<br>

Abstract: In this article, we have argued that the application of library practice requires a suspension of truth. We support this by introducing a new theory of truth that is rooted in historicism. One of the overarching missions of library practice is to acquire, manage, preserve, and make accessible human knowledge. While there are pragmatic and sociopolitical considerations that often constrict fulfillment of this mission, the public purpose of librarianship in a free and open society nonetheless dictates that materials be made accessible regardless of what the society at the current time or the majority of people within a culturally defined place consider as true.<br>

Abstract: [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility. This volume is every bit as persuasive as its prede- cessors and, perhaps because it is as much recit as the others were peintures, it is also rather more compelling a read. More than the first two volumes of his work, volume three of Barbarism and Religion leaves one hanging; like Gibbon and his first readers, we are only at the Milvian Bridge, pondering what will follow with Constantine. One hopes that, unlike those readers, we will not have to wait five years for the next episode. DANIEL WOOLF University of Alberta [[END 06A00080]] [[START 06A00090]] LAWRENCE W. MCBRIDE, editor. Reading Irish Histories: Texts, Contexts, and Memory in Modem Ireland. Port- land, Oreg.: Four Courts Press. 2003. Pp. 233. $55.00. The final essay of this collection closes with the following sentiment from Sean Farrell Moran: "Like Socrates and Plato who stood firmly against the influ- ence of myth in Athenian democracy, academic histo- rians will step in to attempt to correct the misconcep- tions of Irish citizens" (p. 218). In the previous essay, one such "academic historian," Ben Novick, stepped into the breach in the following fashion: "Writing, as discussed throughout this book, is a primary means of disseminating information" (p. 211). Socrates and Plato have indeed met their match. It is perhaps unfortunate that this collection, edited by Lawrence W. McBride, closes with one of the most arrogant pieces of scholarship that I have ever had the displeasure of reading. The conceit of the comparison quoted above, and the condescension of statements such as "Perhaps we should pity the peasants. They made the mistake of remembering their past incor- rectly" and "The common Irish man and woman must then be re-educated about Ireland's past and abandon their memories" (p. 218), make it difficult to commend the essay as a fine conclusion to an exceptional book. One can only hope that Moran is trying to be ironic. But it would be unfair to condemn this book on the basis of one author's misguided faith in the powers of the "academic historian." Indeed, the book, although most worthy at times, has enough problems without that. The intention of the collection is clearly estab- lished in the editor's preface: to "examine how a variety of historical narratives were delivered through the written word, but with special attention paid to how readers might have reacted to these texts" (p. 13). The difficulty is that the reader is the one consistent absentee from the essays that follow. From Paul Townend's chapter on the reading rooms of the na- tional movements of the late nineteenth century to Novick's chapter on the newspaper of the Irish Volun- teers, the reader is little more than a shadowy figure. Even the most basic details are ignored; there is no attempt to estimate circulation figures for books or newspapers. Anne Kane's attempts at "reconstructing" (p. 46) what a newspaper reader during the land war might have felt amounts to little more than an essay in speculative sociology. Paul Ricoeur and Clifford Geertz seem to get more attention than the actual people who "may have" (p. 46) and "could well have" (p. 56) responded to the newspapers examined. It also seems unlikely that any farmer facing eviction could have conceived of the land war as a "ritual process" (p. 45). But Kane's essay is not the only one at fault in this fashion. The extent of the readers' absence almost begs one to question why the editor made such a particular point of drawing "special attention" to the reader at all. This is not a fault particular to this book or to these essays. Beyond specific accounts by a reader reacting to a text, which in turn have all the inherent linguistic and interpretative pitfalls of any other text, there are very few ways to interpret the readers' response to any type of narrative. Timothy McMahon is one of the few authors in this collection who actually quotes from the men and women who attended the Gaelic Summer Colleges that he examines. His essay is one of the collection's most valuable as a result. Colin Barr's piece on university education, again valuable in its factual content, has nothing to say about the students or how the changes in the universities effected them AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 471 APRIL 2004 [[END 06A00090]] [[START 06A00090]] Reviews of Books and Films and their learning. The academic career of one Galway student, H. Fitzwalter Kirker, is traced in its entirety, but only in a footnote. The reader gets at least something approximating a lifeline in the piece by McBride on the young reader and the teaching and learning of Irish history. That "young people are by nature curious" (p. 114), however, seems an inade- quate point on which to hang a conclusion. The book is at its strongest in the essays by Jose Lanters and Gregory Castle, which focus on the work of T. W. Rolleston and Standish O'Grady, respectively. Both historians are examined in the context of their contemporaries; both essays actually attempt to fulfill the claims they make for themselves in their opening pages. The same cannot be said, however, for Eileen Reilly's piece on J. A. Froude. Its bland rehearsal of his life is punctuated with references to his visits to Ireland and quotations from some of his more offen- sive diatribes on the Irish people. She offers little or no comment on the bigotry that billowed forth from his pen. For example, one is told of Froude's dislike for Daniel O'Connell but not the reason why. Novick's piece on the military education of the Irish Volunteers begins with an interesting description, but it is rather disappointing thereafter. Although the material is fascinating, the author's conclusions are not. At one point, he deduces that "The pattern of military education seen in the Irish Volunteer and the Workers' Republic lends weight to the idea of the Rising as blood sacrifice, since the key strategist, Joseph Plunkett, never wrote military columns for the Irish Volunteer" (p. 198). At no point does it occur to Novick that the rebels might not have printed their plans in the paper because letting the authorities in Dublin Castle know in advance was not really part of the plan. How useful, indeed, is an examination of the Irish Volunteer's role in the training of the rebels when even the author concedes that details of training on urban insurrection were "left to the writers of the Workers' Republic" (p. 210); when the author gives approximately nine lines of consideration to what he adjudges to be the more important source? Through- out there is little sense of the eye of Dublin Castle watching over what was published and curtailing what could be written. This is a worthy but a frustrating book. There is a lot of value in each essay in terms of the material that is brought to light, but there is also the crushing weight of the artificial framework under which the essays are forced to labor. Like Froude, it is perhaps this book's "portion in life to please no one faction" (p. 140). ANNE DOLAN Trinity College Dublin [[END 06A00090]] [[START 06A00100]] COLIN NEWBURY. Patrons, Clients, and Empire: Chief- taincy and Over-Rule in Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. New York: Oxford University Press. 2003. Pp. xii, 328. $72.00. It is a brave historian nowadays who admits that his or her current academic preoccupations began in the 1950s, but an unrepentant Colin Newbury tells us that imperial history at Oxford University is peculiarly marked by continuity. He says that literary theory has dominated the study of discourse for too long (al- though presumably not at Oxford), and it is time to get back to the study of political discourse using the time-honored model of patron-client relations. Drawing on his extensive knowledge of African and Pacific imperial history, with the addition of material on South and Southeast Asia, Newbury presents a well researched and cogently argued case for the persis- tence of precolonial clientage networks in certain British and French colonies. Patron-client modeling was refined by social scientists in the 1960s and 1970s, when it became a useful way of explaining why inde- pendence had brought relatively little change to the administrative systems of former colonies. That polit- ical and economic relations in some colonies can be analyzed effectively using this theory is clear; whether the exercise speaks to wider debates about empire is another question. The omission of colonies of settle- ment, along with almost all of the Portuguese, Dutch, and German empires, weakens the case considerably. Newbury draws on a wide, although extremely selec- tive, range of secondary literature to supplement his own research, wisely conceding that authors may not like the use he makes of their material. He feels no need to address the epistemological and methodolog- ical concerns raised by authors whose work he mines for empirical detail. He excludes pioneering cross- disciplinary studies, such as Jean and John Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution (1991) and Nicholas Thomas, Colonialism's Culture: Anthropology, Travel and Government (1994), which have done so much to shape current debates in postcolonial anthropology. Newbury calls for more interaction between social scientists and historians, but he does surprisingly little to encourage it. If patron-client brokerage really is the best model, Newbury should be able to tackle other theories with confidence, demonstrating their inade- quacies through constructive engagement. Instead he revives battles won long ago, such as the critique of "collaboration" and "indirect rule" analysis. There are still some historians who work with these terms, but far more interesting is the much larger number of scholars tackling more recent debates. This book's contribution to imperial historiography is therefore difficult to assess. Newbury hopes that it will help to determine whether imperial rule suc- ceeded or failed "in 'preparing' [its colonies] for the exigencies and responsibilities of devolved govern- ment" (p. viii). One wonders whether this is still a pressing question, however. It has been a long time since independence for many of the countries Newbury discusses. Scholars posing broader questions about colonialism's legacy will wonder about the cost of Newbury's ruthlessly exclusive approach.

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] I wish to thank the editors of the AHR, first, for inviting me to consider the issues in this essay, second, for the helpful comments of Acting Editor Jeffrey Wasserstrom, and, third, for the quite stimulating commentary of several anonymous reviewers. 1 See Eric Foner, ed., The New American History (Philadelphia, 1990); Foner, ed., The New American History, rev. and expanded edn.

Beard.4 But during the 1970s, the claims being made for a national mind or culture were challenged by social historians. Intellectual history was chastened and transformed by the confrontation with social history. Eschewing their former embrace of synthesis, intellectual historians pulled back to study more precisely defined themes and thinkers.5 Not only intellectual history but other subfields accommodated social history's provocation to rethink conventional gen- eralizations. In addition, a professional, even "social-scientific," concern for precision and specificity of reference collaborated-sometimes with forethought, often not-with a sharpened awareness of difference and conflict that came from social movements outside the academy to undermine older composite narratives. Neither the frame supplied by Charles and Mary Beard in The Rise of American Civilization (1927), with its dramatic narrative of conflict between the "people" and the "interests," nor the consensual pluralism that succeeded that interpretation in the 1950s survived.6 If the consensus historians underplayed conflict, the Beards' approach, for all of its sympathy for the dispossessed, was found to be inadequate as well. Their narrative revealed little feel for the diversity of Americans, and it paid scant attention to non-whites. Most important of all, while their narrative voice was sympathetic, one did not discover the quotidian life or hear the voices of those groups that have found voice in more recent historiography. Judged by newer historiographical expectations, The Rise of American Civilization seemed "thin," compared with the increasingly popular "thick" description that was built, in part, on the enormously influential anthropological work of Clifford Geertz.7 In the past quarter century, there has been a proliferation of exciting new research, much of it bringing previously overlooked or explicitly excluded groups and events into the light of history. The number and variety of American stories multiplied. Suddenly, there were histories where there had been none or where the available histories had not been attended to by professional historians: histories of African Americans in the era of slavery and beyond; of Native Americans; of workers at home in their communities, at work, and at play; of women at home and outside of the home and of gender relations more generally; of consumption as well as production; of ethnic minorities and "borderlands"; of popular culture and other "marginal" forms of cultural production; of objects and material culture; of whites and whiteness as historical subjects; of non-state international and intercultural relations; and much more. [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 4Frederick Jackson Turner never completed a major synthesis, but one can see how he might have done that work in his posthumously published The United States, 1830-1850 (New York, 1935); Charles A. Beard and Mary R. Beard, The Rise of American Civilization (1927; 2 volumes in 1, New York, 1930).. In fact, the Beards participated in this shift with the publication of The American Spirit: A Study of the Idea of Civilization in the United States (New York, 1942). 5 For an early anticipation of this development-from the point of view of intellectual history-see Lawrence Veysey, "Intellectual History and the New Social History," in Paul K. Conkin and John Higham, eds., New Directions in American Intellectual History (Baltimore, Md., 1979), 3-26. See also, in the same volume, David A.

These developments were occurring at a moment when the number of American historians was expanding to an unprecedented degree. Disciplinary expansion both allowed and prompted increased specialization. And that worried some, who began to speak of hyperspecialization and fragmentation. The structure of specialization derived in large part from the impact of a social history that often fused the group-based particularity of focus with ideological commitments to class and identity-based social movements. This pattern of work discouraged the integration of particular histories into some kind of synthesis.8 Traditionalists, perhaps not surprisingly, were unnerved by these develop- ments.9 But even some proponents of the newer history worried. Early on, Herbert G. Gutman, one of the leading figures in the movement to write a history that included all Americans and that recognized differences-class, ethnic, racial, gender-was concerned that instead of enriching and enlarging the usable history of the United States, the new scholarship was failing to do that, perhaps making it in fact less usable. The "new social history," he wrote in the introduction to his collection of pioneering essays in the field, "suffers from a very limiting overspe- cialization." Take an Irish-born Catholic female textile worker and union organizer in Fall River involved in a disorderly strike in 1875. She might be the subject of nearly a dozen sub-specializations, which would, he feared, "wash out the wholeness that is essential to understanding human behavior."10 Later, in the wake of a national meeting of writers at which historians and history seemed to be largely ignored in discussions of the political and cultural situation in the aftermath of Richard Nixon, Gutman mused aloud in the pages of The Nation over whether the failure of historians to incorporate social history's findings into a new synthesis had seriously diminished, even evacuated, history's possible contribution to public debate."1 In the mid-1980s, in what turned out to be a controversial pair of articles, I raised a related question: how might one construct the (to my mind) needed synthesis of recent historiography on the United States.12 There was considerable negative reaction to those articles, coming from two different positions.

These arguments were equated with a carelessness about scholarly rigor.13 The other, and more widespread position, focused on the risks of a national narrative itself. It was evidently feared that such a narrative would, by definition, re-exclude those groups and themes that had so recently been brought under the umbrella of history and would re-inscribe a "master narrative" dominated by white, elite males.14 By the end of the 1980s, however, the question of synthesis had become less controversial. The issue became more practical, more professional in some sense: how to do it and how to do it within the parameters of inclusion that had been central to the discussion from the beginning. It was on this note that Alice Kessler-Harris, the author of the chapter on social history in The New American History (1990 edition), addressed the question. In the last section of her essay, with the section title of "The Problem of Synthesis," she acknowledged the problem and explored various possible ways to overcome "fragmentation" and move toward synthesis.15 A different issue emerged in the 1990s. Poststructuralist literary and cultural theory, sometimes broadly and even more vaguely characterized as postmodernism, was and is suspicious of any aspiration toward a comprehensive narrative. It is to this body of theory that we owe the commonplace use and misuse of the epithet "master narrative."16 These theories have been rather slow to penetrate workaday historical practice among American historians. Levels and types of awareness of them vary: from shocked indignation at the whole idea, to vague awareness and thoughtless dismissal, to intellectual fascination largely in isolation from the making of one's own histories. In his recent book, Beyond the Great Story: History as Text and Discourse (1995), Robert Berkhofer seeks to force more attention to these issues. Insistently, but not always consistently, he urges historians to recognize the dimensions of the postmodern crisis that surrounds them. He seems more interested in sounding the alarm about the quicksand before us than in guiding us [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 13 Eric H.

But either way, he intends to challenge the very possibility of narrative synthesis.17 While these worries, proposals, and polemics were being fashioned, the daily work of historians proceeded. Among the products of that work have been a good number of explicitly synthetic volumes. There is, of course, no clear or settled notion of what defines a work of synthesis. I have used a rather generous definition. Some of the books I am calling synthetic might alternatively be designated as monographs-archivally based but exceptionally ambitious books that tackle big questions and seek to frame a large field or to provide an interpretation for an audience well beyond specialists. Others are more obviously synthetic, relying heavily on secondary literature to establish the state of the art in a broad field for a wide audience, including, often, students and the general public. With this diversity of form, purpose, and audience in mind-as well as a concern for a reasonable distribution of fields and periods-I have, with the help of the editors of the American Historical Review, selected a few recent synthetic works for examina- tion.18 The very existence of these books mutes the question of whether we need synthetic works or whether, under the constraints of present historiographical practice, synthesis is possible. In fact, the seeming proliferation of syntheses at present-and their variousness-suggests that the field of American history is at a formative (or reformative) moment that invites synthesis: the quest for new understandings that has undermined established narratives has now, perhaps, prompted new efforts at crystallizing a very unstable body of historical writing into new syntheses. A different question, however, provides the focus of this essay. What strategies for narrative synthesis are available to historians today? How might we think about the relation between a particular structure of narrative synthesis and the author's purpose or interpretation? How do these different strategies relate to current historiography? What particular work do they do, within the profession and beyond it? And finally I want to ask some questions about the firmness of the boundaries (mostly geographical) that define what is and is not captured in synthetic narratives of U.S. history. These works do not, of course, cover the whole field of synthetic works. More and other books could have been chosen, but these eleven books (and several others mentioned along the way) at least represent different kinds of history, different [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 17 Robert F.

Hine and John Mack Faragher (TheAmerican West). In fact, I have recommended each to non-historians asking for a literate one-volume history of the United States.

Together, the eleven total nearly 6,000 pages of outstanding historical writing. If nothing else, I can conclude that synthetic narrative invites long books. Because I cannot claim special knowledge in any of the fields being synthesized in these books, I do not propose to do the kind of analysis one would find in specialized reviews. Such criticisms that I have will be framed from the position of my interest in synthetic narrative. I say that in part to be honest about my own limitations in appraising these books but also for another, more positive reason. I want to insist that narrative synthesis is a form of knowledge, indeed, a particularly powerful form of creating, not simply summarizing, knowledge. I hope to get past or under the story enough to probe the implications of different modes of structuring a narrative synthesis. The way different narrative strategies construct that knowledge is important. While inclusion is one of the tests our generation will rightly ask of synthesis, there are other important historiographical issues that are embedded in the question of narrative synthesis.19 The more seriously we consider possible narratives of American history, the more we may be prepared to ask questions that press beyond inclusion. We may even be both bold enough and hopeful enough to worry a little about the language of inclusion, if not the principle. Is there perhaps more than a hint of dominant culture noblesse oblige in the language of inclusion? Might not a more sophisticated notion of the temporal and geographical boundaries of American history, including an awareness of the diasporic stories within American history, complicate and enrich the notion of inclusion?20 Can the historical and historiographical terrain be opened a bit more in a way that enables a deeper, denser, and more complex historiographical exploration of justice and difference at the center of American history? Might democracy be the word, the concept, the commitment that will move us in that direction? As I examine the stack of books before me, I propose to keep these issues in mind and to return to them at the end of this essay. JON BUTLER'S Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776 (2000) covers the whole mainland British colonial space and history, and it addresses a wide range of themes. In fact, themes, not time or chronology, organize his story. His brief, often one-word, chapter titles reveal a very distinctive type of synthesis, one immediately accessible to the reader, whether professional or lay: Peoples, Economy, Politics, Things Material, Things Spiritual. It is a reasonable progression, and in each case he brings together a good deal of material. Although his theme is transformation, Butler also claims (following recent historiography) a more inclusive geography, making more of the middle colonies than would have been the case a generation ago. In some ways, his manner of organizing the material topically bears a relation to [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 19 I do not propose to go into theories of narrative or even my own notions, but I will here indicate that my understanding has been greatly influenced by the work of Paul Ricoeur, Time and Narrative, Kathleen McLaughlin and David Pellauer, trans., 3 vols. (Chicago, 1984-88). 20 Such thinking is not restricted to specialists in the profession exploring the theme of diaspora. The novelist Russell Banks has recently argued that the focus for a synthesis of American history ought to be the African diaspora. See "The Star-Spangled Novel," Los Angeles Times, July 2, 2000.

If Hofstadter's book was intended to provide a snapshot that would serve as a starting point, Butler's title ("Becoming America") and his stated intentions announce change as his theme. He means to persuade the reader of a broad pattern of transformation that produced a distinctive and modern society in advance of 1776 and that in turn spawned the first modern revolution. Such an argument demands more complex and careful attention to process and cause than his framing of the book seems to allow. While he has surely gathered together a considerable body of material (his notes run to fifty pages), he has not produced a synthetic narrative of change over time, one that sketches a develop- mental sequence that integrates disparate elements in the interest of a causal interpretation. By bounding each unit of synthesis, Butler is stuck with a structural isolation of topics that undercuts narrative explanation. Given that Butler's theme is transformation, this narrative structure is crippling. For reasons related to structure and style of argument, Butler's claims for American modernity are quite vulnerable. While there are doubtless some specific ways in which the British North American colonies became "modern" before independence, they were not uniformly modern-over space or in all aspects of life. Many historians would readily grant numerous anticipations of modernity by the middle of the eighteenth century, but few would insist, with Butler, that so much modernity had been achieved so soon, implying that only a few pre-modern anomalies remained on the eve of revolution.22 Most give a significant role to the revolution.23 But the most serious problem is not with the phenomena he notices or does not notice, even if there is some real unevenness on this point. Rather, it is Butler's teleology of the modern, combined with his exceedingly loose, elusive, and, as is so often said today, undertheorized definition of modernity. Add to this an unneces- sary but apparently irresistible tendency to claim American uniqueness and "firsts" for nearly everything he identifies as modern in America. He names a number of phenomena that he considers evidences of the modern-polyglot, slaves, cities, market economy, refined crafts and trades, religious pluralism, and "sophisticated politics." Without further historical specification and theoretical precision, one can indulge in reductio ad absurdum. With the exception of religious pluralism, all of these qualities probably described Athens in the age of Aristotle at least as well as the British colonies. In fact, I suspect that Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker, relying on their recent book The Many-Headed Hydra: Sailors, Slaves, Commoners, and the Hidden History of the Revolutionary Atlantic (2000), would argue that the [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 21 Richard Hofstadter, America at 1750: A Social Portrait (New York, 1971). 22 Jon Butler, Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776 (Cambridge, Mass., 2000), 1. 23 See, for example, Gordon S.

In the end, however, it is diversity, which he tends to equate with multiculturalism, that for Butler makes Americans modern. But if we look around, we cannot but wonder about his claims for a uniquely polyglot society. This assertion may be quite vulnerable from any sight line approaching a global perspective. Can he fairly claim that New York City harbored a level of diversity "never before gathered together"?25 Might not this be as plausibly said of Constantinople during the period covered by Butler's book? And did not the Ottoman Empire-of which Constantinople was the capital-far exceed the religious and ethnic diversity of the British colonies? My point here is partly one of fact, of care in making comparative statements without comparison. More important, however, are the criteria of the modern. Few, if any, major political bodies in the past half millennium more successfully accommodated diversity than the Ottomans, yet that achievement has never brought them recognition for a precocious modernity. One needs greater defini- tional and descriptive specificity to make the argument he claims. Because of the breadth and generality of synthetic narratives, it is especially important to be clear about key concepts. Similarly, he tends to claim the realization of "Americanness"-here equated with some vague notion of modernity-for events that, however interesting in themselves, hardly sustain his assertion that they designated "the American future."26 For example, writing of the French Huguenots, a group he knows well, he notes their assimilation, and he calls this "American."27 Well, of course it is, but so are the endogenous marriages that continue for various groups well into the twentieth century-sometimes because of racial difference and even legislation (as in the case of African Americans) or out of choice, as in the case of Scandinavians in the upper Midwest. Or to take a more ominous subject, it seems a bit fatalistic to say that colonial encroachment on Indian land "predicted" nineteenth-century relations with the Indians.28 Oddly, such a claim, while taking the moral high ground, nonetheless erases the postcolonial history of the United States by denying contingency and thus diminishing both the capacity and moral responsibility of all later actors or potential actors. The twin and linked teleologies of "modern" and "American" produce a distorting and de-historicizing synthesis. If there is a problem with the sort of synthesis Butler has written, what precisely is it? He makes historical claims about patterns and meanings of development on the basis of a narrative structure that effectively isolates and de-historicizes his themes. By not constructing a developmental narrative that integrates the various themes now separated in distinct chapters, the process and complexity of develop- ment is obscured.

In the absence of a narrative of change to explain and interpret, he resorts for a theme to repeated assertions of "modernity." The issue is not so much the claim for an eighteenth-century American modernity-although I am myself drawn to much more complex, nuanced, and contradictory discussions of that theme-as it is the incapacity of the particular model of synthesis he deploys to advance that theme or argument. Philip D. Morgan's Slave Counterpoint: Black Culture in the Eighteenth-Century Chesapeake and Lowcountry (1998) is at once similar to Butler's and quite different. Both focus tightly in each chapter on a particular topic or theme; there is little play among the different themes in both cases. While Butler's themes propose a reorganization of material, thus giving an impression of freshness, Morgan's quite important questions are phrased in well-established ways. While Butler's structure works against his theme of transformation, Morgan's similar structure better fits his goals for the book, partly because transformation plays a smaller role in his analysis than one might expect. Slave Counterpoint addresses nearly all the issues raised by a half century of vigorous scholarship on the beginnings of slavery, the practices of racial slavery as a labor and social system, and the nature of African-American culture in early America. It is a book of enviable learning: with a seeming total command of the historiography and an impressive knowledge of a substantial archival base, Morgan proceeds to pose (or re-pose) difficult historiographical issues. Again and again, he offers compelling answers. Want to know what scholarship has disclosed about slavery and African-American culture in the eighteenth-century Chesapeake and Lowcountry? Look to Morgan's synthesis of a generation of scholarship. To have done that is to have done a great deal, and he has done it magnificently. Yet one gets the sense of a summary volume, a volume driven by the past, by past questions. Synthesis can either cap a phase of scholarship or initiate another. I think Morgan's book falls into the former category, while Ira Berlin's new book, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (1998), which also relies on a generation of scholarship and addresses many of the same issues, has the potential to become a new starting point. Berlin has captured the shift to an Atlantic perspective that has increasingly characterized scholarship by early modern Europeanists, Africanists, Latin Americanists, and historians of British North America. In this sense, his work, at least the early parts that sketch out and populate the Atlantic littoral, points forward.29 In a dramatic opening section, Berlin, relying more on secondary literatures than does Morgan, locates his story in very broad understandings of time (periodization) and space (the Atlantic world), the dimensions of which are shadowy, almost invisible, in Morgan's account. He locates Africans in an Atlantic history connecting four continents and in a rich and growing historiography reaching out from Europe, Africa, Latin America, and North America.30 One [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 29 Ira Berlin, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (Cambridge, Mass., 1998). 30 Berlin's powerful evocation of the Atlantic builds on many predecessors. At minimum, mention should be made of Philip D. Curtin's The Atlantic Slave Trade: A Census (Madison, Wis., 1969); and The AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 138 Thomas Bender [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] wishes Berlin had sustained this perspective in the later sections. But even if he narrows the story to the territory that later became the United States and loses the multiple histories implied by his portrait of the Atlantic world, the beginnings of stories, whether novels or histories, are heavy with intention and implication that can, I hope, be built upon.31 In fact, the four Atlantic continents remain an always changing aspect of American and African histories. Attending to, or at least recognizing, that larger and continuing extended terrain of American history would enrich the story of the making of African Americans and America, a historiography that is at present too much captured by an implicit and too simple assimilation or "Americanization" model. Nonetheless, Berlin has provided a powerful image of the creation of the Atlantic world and of the origin of modern slavery within it. Morgan has a quite different strategy. His domain is not the Atlantic but the South, or two regions of the South, which he is anxious to reveal as differentiated. Thus his is a comparative history, comparing two regions within the South. Suggesting a certain scientific aspiration, he refers to his delimited space as a kind of laboratory, a site for an "indirect experiment."32 This approach offers him much. He is able to focus tightly on his questions and generally achieves sharply phrased answers. Yet, like any good scientific laboratory, his field of inquiry is almost hermetically sealed. A two-hundred-page part of the book titled "The Black World" begins with a fifteen-page section on "Africans." Yet it is in only one paragraph at the beginning and a few other scattered references that one reads anything about Africa. His story rarely strays east (or south or north or west) of the Maryland/ Virginia and South Carolina boundaries. His comparative method has impressive rigor. Yet one senses that not only does his approach trap him within a particular place, he is also caught within a very confining net woven from the existing historiography. As Walter Johnson pointed out in a review of the book in this journal, his questions are smaller than the stories he has unearthed.33 Much like another important book on African-American history, Herbert G. Gutman's The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom (1976), this book, for all its synthetic aspirations, cannot capture some of its best material within the tightly bounded historiographical questions and issues that frame it.34 As in the case of Berlin's book, Morgan's is quite explicit about time and space. There is a well-thought-out chronology of change, and one of his major arguments is that the South, and thus the black as well as white experience, was not uniform over space. He shows real and important distinctions between the experience of [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] Rise and Fall of the Plantation Complex (New York, 1990; 2d edn., 1998); and John K.

Yet by treating both the temporal and spatial aspects of the story as sites (and very limited ones) rather than as processes of historical making, he weakens the capacity of his local analyses to explain change over time and, to a lesser extent, space. His major explanatory claims appear in the introduction. They are not only brief but also separate from the rich stories he tells and the analyses he makes of historiographical questions.35 The expansiveness of Many Thousands Gone, by contrast, evokes a strong sense of change, of process. It achieves a narrative synthesis of the movement of Africans onto the Atlantic and into the Western hemisphere. The difference between this approach and the tightly controlled analysis crafted by Morgan is striking. Like Morgan's, Michael Schudson's book, The Good Citizen: A History of American Civic Life (1998), is organized around fairly established questions- especially one big question. Has American civic life deteriorated over the course of the past three centuries? Naturally, the question is of a different order than those driving Morgan's analysis. It has not been generated by disciplinary scholarship. It arose out of American public life. Schudson thus draws on history and other disciplines to address directly a public question, one endlessly repeated today and, as he shows, in the past. Schudson himself, we should note, is not a historian. He was trained as a sociologist, and he teaches in a Department of Communication. While he reveals an impressive command of the relevant historiography, historians are not his primary reference group or audience.36 Although I am sure specialists will find some of his formulations to be of considerable historiographical significance and likely to encourage new lines of research, his intention, again, is different: his audience is a general one, and he seeks to bring historical knowledge to bear on a civic issue. What he is doing points toward the most important work that one kind of successful narrative synthesis can do, for the profession and for the public. By openly declaring his address to a public issue and for a public audience, Schudson participates in a very important tradition of historical writing. Some of the very best professional historians of the United States in this century have done precisely that: Frederick Jackson Turner, W. E. B. Du Bois, Charles Beard, and Richard Hofstadter all focused on issues, worries, or preoccupations of fairly general interest to write synthetic works that importantly rephrased fundamental themes in American history. This mutual enrichment of public and professional discourse is perhaps the ideal cultural work of narrative synthesis. Let us hope that historians can do this more often and more effectively. Yet as I make this point, I realize that all of the historians just named, including Schudson himself, were either trained as social scientists or did not recognize a significant boundary between history and the [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 35Morgan, Slave Counterpoint, xv-xxiv. I should note that my concerns about boundary setting in Morgan's book do not apply nearly so much to Philip D. Morgan, "The Black Experience in the British Empire, 1680-1810," in The Oxford History of the British Empire, Vol. 2: The Eighteenth Century, P. J. Marshall, ed. (Oxford, 1998), 465-86. 36 This command is at once impressive and sometimes puzzling. In discussing the Founding and the Constitution, he does not mention Gordon Wood's The Creation of the American Republic, 1776-1787 (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1969). Nor, in writing about the first decades of the nineteenth century, does he mention either of two key books by Robert H. Wiebe, The Opening of American Society: From the Adoption of the Constitution to the Eve of Disunion (New York, 1984); and Self-Rule: A Cultural History of American Democracy (Chicago, 1995). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 140 Thomas Bender [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] (other?) once more expansive social sciences. Is this a mere coincidence, or is it an issue to be addressed by the profession? While I would not place Schudson's book in the same class as the scholarship produced by the short list of great historians, he has written a fine book. It is a book about change over time, and he establishes three eras of citizenship and participa- tion, each clearly defined. He does not devote much attention to how each configuration changes into the next, but he effectively characterizes their differ- ences, even in some very brief summaries, as in the following paragraph from early in the book: Another way to characterize the past three hundred years of political change is to say that the type of authority by which society is governed shifted from personal authority (gentlemen) to interpersonal authority (parties, coalitions, and majorities), to impersonal authority (science, expertise, legal rights, and information) ... The geographical center of politics has shifted from the countryside to the cities to the suburbs and perhaps, today, to "technoburbs," "postsuburbs," or "edge cities," or whatever we name our newer habitations. Correspondingly, the kind of knowledge a good citizen requires has changed: in an age of gentlemen, the citizen's relatively rare entrances into public discussion or controversy could be guided by his knowledge of social position; in the era of rule by majorities, the citizen's voting could be led by the enthusiasm and rhetoric of parties and their most active partisans; in the era of expertise and bureaucracies, the citizens had increasingly to learn to trust their own canvass of newspapers, interest groups, parties, and other sources of knowledge, only occasionally supported by the immediacy of human contact; and in the emerging age of rights, citizens learn to catalog what entitlements they may have and what forms of victimization they may knowingly or unknowingly have experienced.37 This paragraph reveals the argument and the narrative strategy that Schudson uses to undercut the widespread notion of civic decline: rather than a story of decline, it is one of restructuring, one that recalibrates citizenship and civic practice in relation to changing values and social experiences. What some, including me, see as the erosion of our public life and the thinning of American political culture, he presents as a complex rearticulation of expectations and institutions. Whether one fully agrees with Schudson or not, the book and the point of view it ingeniously argues constitutes an important contribution of contemporary civic life. And a narrative strategy of restructuring (as opposed to the usual rise or fall scenarios) deserves a place in the historian's menu of narrative types. "Presentist" purposes may, however, carry the danger of anachronistic readings. Schudson is vulnerable on this score, especially in his consideration of the colonial period. He too easily asks how democratic any phase of political life was. A commitment to explore the fate of democracy in our past-something I endorse- surely includes recognizing when democracy is not an available concept. He might better have asked how the legitimation and exercise of power worked. Indeed, such a deeper historicism would complement his anti-anti-Whig approach. Similarly, while a then-and-now binary invites sometimes interesting questions and offers some illumination of past and present, it also invites problems. Again, one sees this risk in Schudson's work. False categories of judgment are explicitly or implicitly brought to bear.

Voters then were expected to have "local knowledge-not of laws or principles, but of men."38 The binary obscures the role of principles in the past and knowledge of men in the present. Most important of all, it diverts our attention from the principles that it was thought would aid voters in judging character.39 Sometimes, by focusing so much on the party system that we worry about today, he overlooks those important issues that eluded the parties or that parties avoided. Substantive issues-the reason citizenship and civic life are important-are marginalized in his account of the different concepts and patterns of public life. The result, whether intended or not, is a form of consensus history.40 "Progress or decline is not the real question," Schudson concludes.41 He converts that question into one of restructuring that points to his core argument: there must be a fit between forms of citizenship and forms of everyday life, between values and institutions, between aspirations and commitments. It is that historically informed understanding that allows him in his conclusion to speculate in quite promising ways about an evolving pattern of citizenship that may yet serve our collective hopes and needs. Still, his conclusion leaves me uneasy. Like the journalistic coverage of politics today, the substance of political conflict is subordinated to discussion of the "health" of the system, of the institutions and practices. By contrast, the tensions, conflicts, and substantive issues that made politics so important in the development of the United States and in the lives of individuals are at the center of Eric Foner's The Story of American Freedom (1998). Foner's book has an uncanny resemblance to one that at first glance might seem utterly unrelated: Richard Hofstadter's The American Political Tradition and the Men Who Made It.42 Of course, Foner inverts the point Hofstadter sought to make. If Hofstadter famously played down conflict and (less remarked upon) paid little attention to the social making of political ideologies, Foner emphasizes conflict and the changing historical construction and reconstruction of the idea and ideology of freedom. Foner's work is much more explicitly sensitive to social history, even if it parallels Hofstadter's in its interest in ideology and the limits and possibilities of American political culture. While Hofstadter was alternately comic and ironic, bitterly so at times, in The American Political Tradition, Foner's Story of American Freedom is strikingly fair and straightforward. Yet the underlying hope is similar. As James Oakes has perceptively noted, Foner's narrative is undergirded by an unstated but firm liberal ideal of freedom- one that at once shares in an Enlightenment universalism and [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 38 Schudson, Good Citizen, 81. 39 See Joyce Appleby, Inheriting the Revolution: The First Generation of Americans (Cambridge, Mass., 2000). 40 See, for example, his summary judgment of the party system at Schudson, Good Citizen, 132.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 142 Thomas Bender [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] accommodates current concerns for inclusion and regard for difference.43 I would even argue that Hofstadter's own liberal position was closer to Foner's than one might at first suspect. Both appraised American political culture and its prospects from the position of a richer, more textured liberalism than we usually recognize in current debates.44 In thinking about the core issue in Foner's narrative, therefore, it seems fair to consider it to be the quest for a democratic liberalism, insisting on the relevance and indispensability of the modifier inserted before liberalism. One might thus characterize Foner's as a democratic synthesis, which, as I suggested above, offers a stronger and more egalitarian standard of judgment than commonplace invoca- tions of inclusion. It offers as well the implication of voice and empowerment. To Foner, as he indicates in his introduction, "abstract definitions" of freedom are not the focus. His concern is "with the debates and struggles through which freedom acquires concrete meanings, and how understandings of freedom are shaped by, and in turn help to shape, social movements and political and economic events."45 The result is a narrative that is at once focused yet always open to an examination of larger issues, structures, and events that intersect with and often drive his story. It is a dynamic story, filled with actors, with agents making freedom and using freedom. He selects key events or controversies of different eras, events that are widely contested (slavery, labor and property, the role of the state, social movements). Of course, coverage is selective; the gain is the richness deriving from a series of concentrated focal points. In each case, he examines the conflict, the parties contending, and the stakes. He does not hesitate to declare justices and injustices, to name winners and losers, and he does so from a consistently democratic perspective. Foner thus achieves inclusion without the dilution conse- quent with the faux openness characteristic of talk radio and without the postmod- ern hesitations that undermine moral judgment.46 The American West: A New Interpretive History (2000) by Robert V. Hine and John Mack Faragher spans the whole of American history, from "the European invasion" until the present.47 The book is written in the spirit of Frederick Jackson Turner. Instead of lamenting the ambiguity of Turner's conception of the frontier, which after Turner got reduced by rigorous historians to a place, the West, Hine and Faragher embrace its fullness.

That openness allows them to tell the history of the United States as a story of successive frontiers, including a fascinating rethinking of American regionalism as urban-centered at the end of the twentieth century.48 In fact, the chapter on the postwar era is a tour de force-imaginative, original, and quite compelling. In Turnerian fashion, they argue that "westering defined America's unique heritage."49 To a very impressive degree, they give substance to this claim, but recent historiography makes that claim, even for western history, problematic. As Hine and Faragher show, in the nineteenth century as well as today, the West (and the United States) was formed by migrations from west to east and south to north, and even in a limited way north to south, as well as east to west. The notion of westering is so strong in American and European history and culture, it is difficult to construct an alternative narrative structure, though no less important for the difficulty.50 This worry does not, however, undercut another summary point they make: the "frontier is our common past."51 The book is grounded in social history. Of all the books under consideration here, The American West is probably the most sensitive to the categories of experience and groups previously excluded from mainstream narratives of Ameri- can history. Their work goes well beyond mere representation of such groups and categories; previously invisible groups, whether Native Americans, migrating women, African-American settlers, working people, or the people of the border- lands, are actors who contributed to the shaping of history. But there are limits to this achievement. While there are multiple positions and voices represented in their narrative, only rarely does their narrative bring the reader inside group life. There is not much inquiry into the interior experience and subjective meanings shared by the various groups identified and recognized.52 While the story could have been situated in a wider context, one that revealed the global reach of the empires or, later, the importance of global markets, in its particular geographical focus the book consistently avoids privileging the English line of settlement. Other settler efforts are considered and sometimes compared. As is often the case with synthetic histories, however, there is a tendency to do the work of inclusion at a particular moment, and then lose the group at issue.

At times, the transnational themes they develop are extremely illuminating. They refer to what would later be characterized by theorists of the global cities as a "dual economy" in describing the role of foreign migrants, especially Chinese, in the nineteenth-century California agricultural economy.53 Likewise the interplay of national and international in their discussion of the Zimmerman telegram inviting Mexico to ally with Germany in World War I and in their discussion of San Francisco's "commercial hinterland."54 But, as in the case of Butler's book, there is a bit of parochialism in making claims of distinction. Perhaps such assertions can be demonstrated, but more rigorous definitions and empirical research than we have here are required to establish, for example, that the United States is today the world's most multicultural society.55 How would it compare with Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, whose citizens speak more than 100 languages and live on almost numberless islands? The social-history approach, whatever its success in representing difference, has in this instance under-represented national political institutions and policies. The development of the West, as Richard White and other historians of the West have pointed out, was profoundly indebted to what western Republicans now call "big government," for water, transportation, Indian removal, and, more recently, direct investment, as in defense contracts and installations and aerospace industries.56 The political economy and the role of markets, as has already been suggested, do not get the attention they deserve. We often overlook how much industry was in the West, and how much western industries-from milling and meatpacking to mining-were integral to the industrial system of the United States. And we forget how much the astonishing productivity of western agriculture enabled the formation of a large urban industrial labor supply. More of these dimensions of western history might have been included if only in the interest in enabling the story better to tell the national experience. If Hine and Faragher encompass both the full geographical and temporal dimensions of western history, Linda Gordon's microhistory builds out from a very delimited western space, the Sonoran highlands of Arizona, to develop a highly innovative narrative synthesis that locates itself at the various and causally interrelated scales of town, region, nation, and the transnational. Her work reminds us that there is a difference between a mere local study and a microhistory. The local histories of villages, towns, and cities, so common in the 1970s, tended to use global concepts but within artificially bounded fields of inquiry. One of the most famous of them all, Kenneth Lockridge's study of Dedham, Massachusetts, offered an isolated inwardness as a principal finding, although it was a finding that derived [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 53Hine and Faragher, American West, 358-60. 54 Hine and Faragher, American West, 395-97, 414.

Mostly, her account is the story of the arrival and fate of Catholic orphans from New York who were to be placed in Catholic homes. The homes were Mexican as well as Catholic, and that was the problem and the focus of conflict. The conflict played out along class, ethnic, religious, and gender lines, and it eventually reached the Supreme Court. It is a compelling and very human narrative, but one that also addresses a whole range of analytical and interpretive issues of broader interest to historians. Bringing the issues of gender, class, and race into relation with each other allows for an appraisal of their relative importance in this particular historical explanation. I think that her story reveals class to be more important than her conclusion argues, but the real point to be made is that only a narrative synthesis that brings diverse threads together will enable the historian and the reader to make this kind of judgment. These complex ends are achieved in part by her adoption of an imaginative literary strategy. Gordon's book is constructed of two types of chapters. One is quite often a broad frame for local events. In these chapters, her perspective as narrator is exterior to the action. The issues addressed are frequently structural and, as often as not, extend beyond the community. Here, one gets an analytical explanation of the relation of local experience to larger national and international cultural, political, and economic developments. Between these chapters, she has crafted others that get inside the culture of the community, providing wonderfully rich, thick descriptions of daily life and the development of the conflict. With oral histories as well as fragmentary documentary evidence, she brings the reader very close to the experience and voices of the community. The play between these accounts and the more conventional chapters produces an unusual but powerful synthesis. Whether a microhistory qualifies as a synthesis, even by my generous definition, may be debated. But the singular relevance of this book for the discussion of synthesis concerns not scale but its literary ambition, the literary experiment that gives structure to the book. Those who would write other syntheses-at various scales-will, I hope, be encouraged, even inspired, to experiment with novel narrative strategies in the interest of more powerful representations of the past. Quintard Taylor presents a third version of western history, In Search of the Racial Frontier: African Americans in the American West, 1528-1990 (1998). He offers a broad synthetic account that characterizes the experiences of African Americans over a very long period of time.

Drawing on a substantial body of scholarship, most of it published in the past quarter century, he aims to "reconstruct the history of African American women and men" in the West over five centuries, although mostly his focus is the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Taylor's central themes are the quest for community by blacks and the relative degrees of freedom and opportunity they find in different times and places. The conjuncture of the map of African-American presence and the conventional history of the West that his story brings out compels rethinking of both African-American and western history. He makes the point, for example, that the issue of Texas independence in 1836 was not simply, as myth, even the more recent multicultural version, would have it: Anglos and Tejanos in Texas confronting a despotic government in Mexico. It was also an Anglo effort to preserve slavery.60 More broadly, the map literally reveals that African Americans in the West were overwhelmingly city and town dwellers, and it is that fact that unifies their experience. The kind of synthetic narrative that he has constructed provides an invaluable service at a particular moment, crystallizing a generation of scholarship, making generalization possible. His work not only informs the public of the dimensions of previously unrecognized histories, it also provides a base for the next generation of scholarship. In a similar way, another recent synthesis, one that focuses on a more narrowly defined but also more developed area of scholarship, reveals the harvest of recent scholarship on work and workers. American Work: Four Centuries of Black and Vhite Labor (1998) by Jacqueline Jones at once brings this rich scholarship to a wider audience and proffers a fresh way of framing the field.61 If The American West, In Search of the Racial Frontier, and American Work cover very long chronological spans, books by David M. Kennedy and Fred Anderson address short periods. Their focus is also quite different, since both concentrate on political and military history. Kennedy's Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945 (1999) addresses what might well be called "high politics," while Anderson's The Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754-1766 (2000) brings social history and high politics into fruitful play, finding in that interaction the terms of his central argument about the nature of power in the British Empire. At the outset, both books locate their stories in a broad international context. Kennedy's book begins at the close of World War I, and the first character introduced is Lance Corporal Adolf Hitler, who was in a military hospital recovering from a poison gas attack when he heard the news of Germany's surrender.

The geography of Washington, D.C., even that of the White House, and the biographies of three men-Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Hitler-are more important to Kennedy's story than the world beyond the borders of the United States or, for that matter, than the American people of his subtitle. One of Kennedy's aims is evidently to urge upon Americans a greater attention to and sense of responsibility in the larger world, yet with the exception of the excellent discussion of the differing explanations of the economic crisis offered by Herbert Hoover and Roosevelt, there is surprisingly little incorporation of inter- national elements into the dynamic of the story. For all the importance of the larger world, for Kennedy, as for many Americans, whether professional historians or not, the international is a sort of "other," something "over there," if I may reverse the title of one of Kennedy's earlier books.62 Kennedy- also pays little attention to social history, not even to social histories that have sought to better explain the politics of the interwar years.63 Nor does the book address intellectual history, the history of science and technology (except briefly in connection with war production), the states, education, urban history, and much more. In fact, the book would have been more accurately described by the title of William E. Leuchtenburg's classic, F.D.R. and the New Deal, 1932-1940, which is here superseded and extended into the war years.64 So titled, adding the war to the New Deal, one could have no objection to this extraordinarily well-written, deeply researched, and compellingly argued book. But is it a history of "the American people"? Freedom from Fear is a masterful narrative on the terms it has assumed for itself. Yet having said that, historiographical questions remain. Kennedy apparently assumes that three voices are the important ones; not many other voices are heard, even though each of a small clutch of additional figures is presented very effectively as a full human being: Lorena Hickok, Eleanor Roosevelt, Harry Hopkins, Raymond Moley, Herbert Hoover, John L. Lewis, and A. Philip Randolph, among a few others. History for Kennedy, unlike for the other authors of these syntheses, is made by select leaders, not by ordinary people. What is remarkable, therefore, is the illusion of synthesis that is achieved. The book was published in a series that promises narrative syntheses of the defining periods of American national history. Most so far published accept traditional definitions of periods, and they are framed as political history, but none is so severely restricted as this one, which won the Pulitzer Prize in part because it was recognized as a work of grand synthesis. Dramatic changes in the historiography of the American field make it seem anachronistic. Yet its success makes the point that political history in the grand [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 62 David M. Kennedy, Over Here: The First World War and American Society (New York, 1980).

Fred Anderson's Crucible of War again engages us with the question of elites and ordinary people, and it provides -a promising approach. While Kennedy seems quite confident of the importance of a few leaders, Anderson seems to be ambivalent, and that ambivalence enriches his history. Although I think the principal contribution of Crucible of War to our understanding of the British Empire is grounded in the social history of the political and military experience of ordinary Americans, the dramatic focus, as with Francis Parkman's great nineteenth-century narrative, is on two great leaders of the French and Indian War, the marquis de Montcalm and James Wolfe.65 Yet, as Alan Taylor has insightfully insisted, Anderson has rewritten the story of their confrontation in a way that diminishes these actors, especially Wolfe.66 To be sure, Anderson's book goes beyond Parkman in its respect for Native Americans, their agency, and their role in the empire (and the role of the empire and war for them). He also modifies Parkman on a point that is central to the book's contribution to imperial history: unlike Parkman, Anderson not only notices but makes much of the division between English colonials and English metropolitans. These differences in expectation and experience make the war in his view a "theatre of intercultural interaction."67 Like Butler, Anderson seeks to diminish the role of 1776 in understanding the development of what became the United States. Historians, he argues, will better understand the creation of the United States by closely examining the Seven Years' War and, more generally, by challenging the usual tendency to "take as our point of reference the thirteen rebelling colonies, not the empire as a whole."68 Yet, even as he argues the importance of getting behind the Revolution of 1776 so that one can discover the eighteenth century as it was experienced, the revolution remains a touchstone for him. More than anything else, he wants the reader to recognize that the shots fired in the Seven Years' War were the ones with implications around the world. But he keeps de-historicizing his story to use it to diminish the shot of lesser implication (in his view) heard 'round the world in 1775. When one begins the book, there is a sense of excitement. Here is a history of the United States ready to take the globe as its context. Before the narrative even begins, the reader is presented with a portfolio of maps. Only two of eight describe the British colonies; no more than four of them consider North America at all. The portfolio begins with a world map, revealing the global distribution of the battles that marked the Seven Years' War. There are also maps of the Indian subcontinent, Central Europe, and the Caribbean. The introduction promises a book that will make the world, or at least the full extent of the British Empire, its context and subject. We are told that "if viewed from Montreal or Vincennes, St. Augustine, Havana, Paris or Madrid-or, for that matter Calcutta or Berlin-the Seven Years' War was far more significant than the War of American Independence."69 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 65 Francis Parkman, Montcalm and Wolfe, 6th edn., 2 vols.

We get very little of Asia (although Manila makes a brief but important comparative appearance), the Caribbean, Africa, and continental Europe. Of course, other European powers are part of the narrative, but they only have walk-on roles. We learn little of them at home or about the ways leaders or ordinary citizens interpret events, while we are, by contrast, led through elaborate accounts of high British politics. The preface, presumably written last, sketches an extraordinary agenda for what would be a stunning book. Unfortunately, Anderson did not write the book he there described. Still, judged in terms of what it did rather than what it proposed to do, it is an outstanding work of craft. It will no doubt be our generation's account of the Seven Years' War. As military history, it is superb, and it contributes importantly-but not so grandly as some of the opening rhetoric promises-to the non-controversial but still unclear issue of the causal relations that connect the Seven Years' War to the coming of the revolution. Anderson in fact offers a rich Anglo-centric narrative that explores and explains the different meaning of the war both as strategic event and as experience for the British of the metropole and in the colonies. It is written with verve and confidence-and a seemingly complete command of the materials, primary and secondary. One of its themes is the misperception of events by political elites; with the exception of William Pitt, surely Anderson's hero in this story, they fail to understand the different meaning of the war and empire for ordinary soldiers and colonial subjects. He thus makes cultural issues the heart of the book. Military and political elites play a dramatic role in the narrative, but causation for Anderson- and here he points to important newer developments in military and diplomatic history-is to be found in the culture of everyday life.70 In making this point, he not only offers an important interpretation of the war (building in part on his previous book on Massachusetts soldiers), he also reveals the empire to be less solid, more a matter of continuous negotiation, than historians often consider such entities, whether empires or nations or states.71 MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN ANDERSON, Ira Berlin, referring to the earliest history of Afro-European North America, and Daniel T. Rodgers, addressing the early twentieth century, incorporate the Atlantic, or at least the North Atlantic, into their narratives of American history. Berlin and Rodgers write very different kinds of history and focus on different periods. Berlin's is a social history, while Rodgers has written an intellectual history, or, perhaps, a history of political culture. Yet both Berlin and Rodgers recognize the complex webs that route movements-of people, of ideas, of money, of things-in the Atlantic world. The transnational terrains that Berlin and Rodgers evoke establish larger and truer frames for national histories than do notions of bounded and self-contained regions or nations. The first section of Berlin's Many Thousands Gone, a portrait of the Atlantic littoral, describes a world framed by cities and the sea, little divided by national [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 70 Anderson, Crucible of War, 453-54. 71 See Fred Anderson, A Peoples' Army: Massachusetts Soldiers and Society in the Seven Years' War (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1984).

Berlin's opening tableau describes the emergence of the Atlantic world as an ever- expanding historical terrain, where the African presence is pervasive on the sea and in the cities, including Lisbon, where they made up 10 percent of the population in the sixteenth century. He evokes a world defined by a network of cosmopolitan cities populated by creolized peoples. African people were not only omnipresent, they were often crucial cultural and economic brokers, helping to knit this new world together. Berlin lets go of this powerful frame and image in his later chapters, where he narrows the focus to regional difference within the bounds of British North America. Still, the book's protean beginning remains in the reader's mind, inviting others to realize its narrative logic and moral meaning.72 In Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age (1998), Daniel T. Rodgers also achieves a richer historicism by expanding the space of analysis. One small indication is in the subtitle. He refers to "social politics," not the more usual "welfare state." His approach, examining relations in space as well as over time as fields of contingency, makes the welfare state a problematic common term. When he uses the more general and more mobile term "social politics," he effectively historicizes the concept, lineage, and practice of the welfare state. The development of a social politics has other possible paths and outcomes besides evolution into the national welfare state.73 The national welfare state thus becomes a historically and place-specific invention rather than a universal or, worse, the teleological endpoint of American liberal narratives-an endpoint surely upended by the politics of the last quarter of the twentieth century. Following the pioneering work of James T. Kloppenberg, who also assumed a Euro-American context for progressivism and social democracy, Rodgers ap- proaches this age of reform as at once a transnational and national issue.74 A variety of reforms-from urban planning to social insurance to regulation of capitalism- are examined as products both of general, transnational ideas and of particular, national political cultures. The complex narratives thus developed by Rodgers and Kloppenberg-ones that recognize, especially in the case of Rodgers, the historicity of the balance between national and transnational-are a major advance in the narrative synthesis of a national history. Both Rodgers and Kloppenberg impress on the reader that ideas could cross the Atlantic in either direction. This is salutary; American intellectual history is too often thought by Europeans and Americans as well to be either insignificant or derivative, not quite up to equal participation in an international world of ideas. This common point is handled differently in each book. While Kloppenberg notes [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 72 One hopes this extension of the historiographical terrain will continue and that connections as well as comparisons will be made between the North Atlantic and the South Atlantic and between the Atlantic slave trade and the slave trade that turned to the east, to the Muslim empires of the Mediterranean and today's Middle East. Big as it is, the Atlantic does not capture the logic and dimensions of slavery in this era. 73 See, for example, the argument (somewhat dependent on Rodgers's work) in Thomas Bender, "Cities, Intellectuals, and Citizenship in the United States: The 1890s and 1990s," Citizenship Studies 3 (1999): 203-20. 74 Daniel T. Rodgers, Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age (Cambridge, Mass., 1998); James T.

Rodgers, by contrast, focuses on the specific transit of ideas and emphasizes the way intellectuals and reformers on either side of the Atlantic drew selectively on these ideas, depending on personal taste and local circumstance. The result is a fundamental and valuable reorientation of the way we might understand intellectual history. The conceptual opening they have created invites a yet more radical under- standing of the territory and movement of ideas. Let me go back to the title of Rodgers's book. I think that "Atlantic Crossings" projects too narrow an under- standing of the implications of the book. It emphasizes the movement of people and ideas back and forth across the Atlantic. To that extent, it recalls a much older Anglo-American historiography of "trans-Atlantic influences."75 Rodgers goes well beyond this historiography in showing that, in important respects, Europe was partly Americanized and the United States was partly Europeanized by the phenomena he describes. But his really important accomplishment is to get away from the "influence" model, to displace the linear A to B notion of intellectual history. But he could have gone farther yet. There is more to the circulation of ideas than this framing recognizes. It is more than an Atlantic crossing, more than a link between Western Europe and the United States. The whole Atlantic, South Atlantic as well as North Atlantic, and, indeed, increasingly, parts of the Pacific world better describe the extent of the intellectual network his book evokes. In regard to urban development and reform, an important theme in Rodgers's book, it is clear that there is a global conversation at work. Rather than the linearity of steamship crossings (the dustjacket illustration) between the port cities of Western Europe and New York, I imagine a Great Bazaar of urban ideas, technology, and aesthetics hovering over the Atlantic, with many traders and buyers. This exchange is not, of course, symmetrical, and that itself is an issue, but participation was nearly global in 1900. Progressive ideas, especially those dealing with urban reform and technologies, traveled through many circuits and with different voltage, but nearly the whole world was connected, not only Western Europe and the United States. Simply look at the cities of Eastern Europe, Latin America, parts of Africa, Central and East Asia. Surely, they were part of an international conception of urbanism-and of urban commercial culture. The remnants of the era make it clear that New York and Chicago, no less than Lyons, Cairo, Buenos Aires, or Shanghai, were local instances of a global process of city-making. THESE LAST COMMENTS SUGGEST what I take to be the next challenge of narrative synthesis. But before I conclude, let me briefly review what has been accomplished by the cohort of synthetic histories considered here. These books reveal, even verify, the capacity of narrative synthesis to achieve inclusion and to respect issues of identity. Moreover, it seems possible in synthetic narratives to combine structure [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 75 See Frank Thistlethwaite, The Anglo-American Connection in the Early Nineteenth Century (Philadelphia, 1959). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 152 Thomas Bender [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] and agency and to consider causal explanation without sacrificing the explication of subjective meaning-and vice versa. The volumes here examined reveal many narrative strategies and quite different relations to a wider reading public. There is no single model, and no one volume (yet) does all the things we might fairly expect in a realized synthesis. In addition, these books, both in what they do and do not do, suggest to me the value of embracing a narrative core that is a more explicit and deeper exploration of democracy and difference, freedom and empowerment, contest and justice. Such a focus promises a sharper analytical history, one more historical and less susceptible to teleology, whether of modernity or anything else. It seems plausible to propose that a wider canvas, a supranational context, may in fact enhance the examination of these issues. The work of Hine and Faragher, Berlin, Gordon, and Rodgers in particular enables one to imagine an even more radical synthesis of national history, one that operates on multiple geographical scales, from narratives smaller than the nation to supra-national ones-thus identifying the nation as a product of history as well as an object of historical inquiry. Such a framing of national history will increase awareness of the complexity of the multiple axes of historical interaction, causation, and identity formation. While I mean these concluding comments to suggest an ambitious new agenda for the discipline, we must not overlook an already existing and compelling example. Decades ago, David Brion Davis embarked on a multivolume history that considered all these issues. He brought them together in his majestic synthesis that explores slavery and freedom in the Atlantic world, a history of nearly global reach that is also-and I emphasize this fact-a history of the United States.76 My point, then, is that such histories can be written, have been written, and I trust that more will yet be written. The present moment seems especially propitious for such histories. The relation of the nation to both subnational and transnational solidarities is very much in question. It is a public concern as well as an object of interdisciplinary scholarly inquiry. Historians surely have an open invitation to rethink the boundaries of national histories.77 Colonial historians have been moving in this direction for some time, redefining their field as the Atlantic world long before the globalization talk. Likewise, Rodgers and Ian Tyrrell, both of whom work on the modern period, moved in this direction fairly early and for a different reason: their concern about the claims of American exceptionalism.78 With these various concerns at work, we may fairly expect a movement of American historians and other historians as well toward a wider sense of their fields. National histories will not be so firmly bounded, and the assumption of their national autarky will be softened by the recognition that national histories are [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 76 David Brion Davis, The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture (Ithaca, N.Y., 1966); The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Revolution, 1770-1823 (Ithaca, 1975), with the final installment yet to come. 77 See Bender, Rethinking American History in a Global Age; and Thomas Bender, The La Pietra Report (Bloomington, Ind., 2000), also available on the World Wide Web at www.oah.org/activities/ lapietra/index.html. 78 Ian Tyrrell, "American Exceptionalism in an Age of International History," AHR 96 (October 1991): 1031-55; Daniel T.

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important proponents, is thus linked by the Comaroffs forward to colonialism and to contemporary globalization, and backward in time to Part of this article was presented in a much earlier version at the Twentieth Anniversary Conference of the Journal of Southern African Studies, York, 1994; I would like to thank the participants as well as those who subsequently commented helpfully, including David Maxwell, Norman Etherington, Ed Wilmsen, and Paul Landau.

Missionaries were, in effect, agents of a first wave of globalization. The missionary movement was an early exemplar of a transnational global movement, while the intellectual claims of missionaries to universality paralleled the modernist claims of a globalizing colonialism. The struggles over the texture and composition of everyday life that took place on the frontiers of colonial society in nineteenth-century southern Africa therefore tell us something not only about the nature of colonialism but also about modernity and its considerable discontents, as well as about the resistance of the colonized to the European colonial project. In this sense, a quest for origins informs the narrative structure of both books.2 Indeed, one of the reasons that this seminal text engages us so closely is its concern with the narrative of dispossession and resistance, with a beginning and therefore, implicitly, some hope for an end-an only ambivalently postmodern narrative, in fact, despite some alarm in southern Africanist circles over Of Revelation and Revolution as a postmodern nail in the coffin of materialist history.3 This focus lends moral urgency to the Comaroffs' consideration of the distant initial encounters between white missionaries and the southern Tswana in the early nineteenth century. Volume 2, for example, opens with a striking vignette: Tswana soldiers refuse to defend the white regime in 1994, as Afrikaner patriots launch a last-ditch raid on Bophuthatswana. As homeland structures crumble around them as they write, the Comaroffs acknowledge that endings and beginnings are never entirely neat. "And yet in many respects, the narrative of Tswana colonization had completed itself, finally running its course from Revelation to Revolution."4 Doubtless the authors would now adopt a less utopian position, but their enthusiasm for revolution and for endings is important, and typical of South African historical writing from the decades before the end of apartheid.5 2 Catherine Desbarats, "Essais sur quelques elements de l'6criture de l'histoire am6rindienne," Revue d'histoire de l'Ameriquefranqaise 53, no. 4 (Spring 2000): 491-520, provides an interesting model, inspired among others by Paul Ricoeur, Hayden White, and Kerwin Lee Klein, for the reading of various historical approaches to the colonial encounter as forms of narrative romance, given the inescapable narrativity of the historical text. Susan Newton-King, also drawing on Ricoeur, similarly reflects on the inescapable imposition of an artificial order on colonial encounters by the historian of colonialism.

These authors take a variety of positions on the issues of whether or not the Comaroffs are postmodern and whether or not the rise of postmodernism in post-apartheid South African academic historical scholarship has been a positive development in a field that was previously (and in many ways still is) passionately materialist in approach. 4 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: xiii. 5 The original title of the series was reportedly From Revelation to Revolution, planned at a time before the release of Nelson Mandela. In a recent conversation with Homi Bhabha, however, John Comaroff is considerably less sanguine about the end of apartheid in South Africa and popular enthusiasm for Mandela outside South Africa, which he sees as a last gasp of modernist optimism in AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 436 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh In a similar vein, at the heart of Volume 1 is a crucial chapter, "Through the Looking Glass: Heroic Journeys, First Encounters." This chapter sets out to explore "the initial meeting of two worlds, one imperial and expansive, the other local and defensive."6 In marvelously evocative detail, the authors describe the initial entry of envoys of the London Missionary Society (LMS) in 1816 into the Tswana capital, Dithakong (seen by the missionaries themselves as a sacred journey into the land of Satan), a subsequent meeting, and the complex negotiations that took place throughout over the terms of the mission. A key metaphor is furnished by the mirror that the LMS envoy John Campbell presented as a gift to the Tswana chief, Mothibi, symbolizing the Western effort to reconfigure Tswana consciousness and the Tswana notion of the self. These initial encounters prefigured the colonial encounter to come: "the square enclosure and all that 'took place' at the center of the most public of Tswana spaces was ominous, foreshadowing a methodical reconstruction of their symbolic map."7 The Christian missionary project, this chapter further suggests, was from the start central to the creation of the dialectical oppositions of colonialism, ironic in view of its claim to erase difference. For the Comaroffs, the colonization of the Tswana thus began (although it certainly did not end) with the word, in the sense both of Bible and of cultural text, with the advent of white Protestant missionaries and their claims to possess the revealed divine word-albeit a word made flesh, clothed in material power. The roots of colonization were in a series of knowledge claims and a set of hegemonic cultural discourses, which would bolster the later seizure of land and of labor. Many scholars have explored the linkage between knowledge claims and colonial power, an issue that has long lain at the heart of postcolonial scholarship and that occupies an increasingly central place in the study of imperialism from a diversity of perspectives.8 Nonetheless, Of Revelation and Revolution furnishes a particularly influential and important statement of the position, in part because it provides a great deal of flesh on the bones of a theoretical model of cultural colonialism. The work moves from the field of discourse alone to examine in great detail concrete material struggles over the remaking of everyday life, including Tswana efforts to resist cultural colonialism. More controversially, perhaps, Of Revelation and Revolution also attempts to make explicit the links in southern Africa between a postcolonial setting.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 437 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne political, economic, and cultural colonialism-fields the authors argue are in any case impossible to disaggregate.9 The programmatic claims that lend Of Revelation and Revolution its force also, however, cause some interesting tensions in the book. The need to make linkages and the Comaroffs' explicit commitment to the exploration of large-scale processes lead the authors to oversimplify in places. Not only that, but the imperatives of a dialectical method push the Comaroffs at times (despite their parallel stress on indeterminacy and their very explicit engagement with the costs and benefits of a dialectical analysis, especially in Volume 2) into tighter methodological corners than they might themselves like. The links between early nineteenth-century cultural colonialism and late nineteenth-century political colonialism are not as direct or as ontologically indissoluble as the Comaroffs assume they are, while the relationship of "modernity" to colonialism furnishes matter for debate, with considerable contemporary implications. The very boldness of the Comaroffs' arguments has indeed contributed to a mixed reception among scholars of southern African history and of religion in Africa, with some enthusiastically welcoming the methodological innovation of the Comaroffs and others casting doubt in a number of ways. In the second volume of the series, the Comaroffs seem to me to have backed down somewhat from some of their bolder claims, despite their spirited engagement with the critics. This in itself provides an interesting case study of the evolution of ideas during a turbulent decade in South African history. In what follows, I would like to engage with this important work in several ways. First, I want to lay out my understanding of the theoretical guidelines in the opening volume, with particular attention to the issue of hegemony and power. Second, I want to provide an alternate reading of the opening encounters between Tswana and missionary, focusing on other intermediaries and on the fact that, even before the advent of European missionaries, the region was already affected by colonialism. I shall use this example to ask whether a dialectic model does not in some ways oversimplify complicated situations and make it hard to account for fudging across the fault lines. I shall further ask whether the result is not a rather muted account of individual agency and an attenuated depiction of the multiple uses of mission Christianity, both as language and as practice. This is not, however, to deny the latent authoritarian potential of much missionary activity, particularly in a colonial context. Third, I also want to gesture, albeit sketchily, toward some issues associated with narrative and chronology, suggesting that the schematic narrative about "modernity," industrialization, and globalization that undergirds both volumes, though provocative and important, also offers a number of hostages to fortune. These include an undue stress on the capacity of missionaries to induct converts into the global economy by changing their consciousness; rather, I see converts struggling to adapt to an overpowering global economy, among other things by trying to use Christianity in a variety of ways, with greater or lesser degrees of success. Having said all that, does this fact-mongering matter?-What are the Comaroffs doing that might go beyond reading the content of particular 9 Colonialism was simultaneously a "process in political economy and culture," and these dimensions were "indissoluble aspects of the same reality, whose fragmentation into discrete spheres hides their ontological unity."

Throughout, I want to take up some concerns of African historians and anthropologists with questions of narrative, voice, and agency in Of Revelation and Revolution. THE INITIAL CHAPTER OF THE FIRST VOLUME is a careful theoretical exposition. Although the authors rather cheerfully direct those with little stomach for theoretical discussions to skip theirs and, en bon bricoleur, to pick up the narrative at a later point, the opening discussion of anthropological concepts is in fact crucial for an understanding of what both this book and its later companion seek to accomplish. I would accordingly like to pause upon it. The stated goal of the work is to present an anthropology of the "colonial encounter," in this case between British Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana, with the larger implication that the missionaries acted as the cultural arm of colonialism, while the dilemmas of the Tswana in their confrontations with colonialism mirrored, if they obviously did not precisely reproduce, the experience of other colonized African groups in South Africa. The Comaroffs state that they hope that their discussion of this particular mission will accomplish three other things: to anticipate later modes of consciousness and struggle in South Africa; to look at an example of historical processes that were happening across Africa and indeed much of the non-Western world; and to examine analytic issues to do with the "nature of power and resistance." With reference to this latter objective: How, precisely, were structures of inequality fashioned during the colonial encounter, often in the absence of more conventional, more coercive tools of domination? How was consciousness made and remade in this process? ... How were new hegemonies established and the "ground prepared," in [Antonio] Gramsci's phrase, for formal European political control? ... Even more fundamentally, how are we to understand the dialectics of culture and power, ideology and consciousness that shape such historical processes?'1 From the vantage point of 1991, the Comaroffs placed their project into a historiographical framework that has since changed considerably, in no small part due to their own work."1 At the time, the Comaroffs castigated anthropologists for 10 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 6. 11 Among many possibilities, some works of particular importance to southern Africa include Paul Stuart Landau, The Realm of the Word: Language, Gender and Christianity in a Southern African Kingdom (London, 1995); Henry Bredekamp and Robert Ross, eds., Missions and Christianity in South African History (Johannesburg, 1995); Pier M. Larson, "'Capacities and Modes of Thinking': Intellectual Engagements and Subaltern Hegemony in the Early History of Malagasy Christianity," AHR 102 (October 1997): 969-1002; Richard Elphick and Rodney Davenport, eds., Christianity in South Africa: A Political, Social, and Cultural History (Berkeley, Calif., 1997); and many other works discussed in David Chidester, Judy Tobler, and Darrel Wratten, Christianity in South Africa: An Annotated Bibliography (Westport, Conn., 1997). The sheer diversity of recent approaches to the history of mission Christianity, a growth field, is impossible to capture in a footnote but is suggested by works such as David Maxwell and Ingrid Lawrie, eds., Christianity and the African Imagination: Essays in Honour of Adrian Hastings (Leiden, 2001); Nicholas Thomas, "Colonial Conversions: Difference, Hierarchy and History in Early Twentieth-Century Evangelical Propaganda," in Hall, Cultures of Empire; Susan Thorne, Congregational Missions and the Making of an Imperial Culture in Nineteenth- Century England (Stanford, Calif., 1999); Peter van der Veer, ed., Conversion to Moderities: The Globalization of Christianity (London, 1996); Robert W.

Historians paid more attention to missions but in the 1960s and 1970s often focused on the theoretically crude question of "whose side were the missionaries really on?" By the 1980s, mission history had been more fruitfully incorporated into work on such long-term processes as colonial conquest, capitalist expansion, state formation, and proletarianization. The methodological innovation of the Comaroffs in the early 1990s was, however, to underscore how much this new approach was itself limited by its "preoccupation with political economy at the expense of culture, symbolism, and ideology."12 They echoed the 1986 claim of Terence Ranger that most of the historiography of early missions to that point had overestimated the political and economic factors in its expansion-in a manner, according to the Comaroffs, stemming ultimately from oppositions between mind and matter at the ontological roots of our social thought.13 In rejecting a narrowly political-economic approach, the authors believed they could better answer the questions of why it was that missionaries succeeded in effecting broad social, political, and economic changes without substantial material resources (a question that, of course, assumes that this was accomplished by missionaries). What was needed, the Comaroffs claimed, was a study of consciousness: of why people articulated belief in certain things, why they took others for granted, how colonialism and consciousness were inextricably intertwined. It is in this sense that missionaries were most clearly colonial agents: they sought to remake the lifeworld of the Tswana, indeed, to colonize their consciousness. They did not necessarily seek directly and simplistically to incorpo- rate the Tswana into an unequal colonial world: they had dreamed instead of a "global democracy of material well-being and moral merit," in the Comaroffs' phrase.14 Nonetheless, their actions contributed to building an empire of inequality. This claim rests on the additional argument that the missionaries were the products of post-Enlightenment modernity, creations and agents of rationalization in the Weberian sense. Similarly, Tswana interlocutors made a variety of unexpected uses of the evangelical message, and of evangelical attempts to remake their world, again with unpredictable results. In sum, the encounter between colonial evangelism and the southern Tswana can best be described as a "long conversation," a continuing process in the course of which "signifiers were set afloat, fought over, and recaptured on both sides of the colonial encounter."15 Over the course of this conversation, the Tswana came to conceive of themselves as constituting a separate, Translating the Message: The Missionary Impact on Culture (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1989); and V. Y. Mudimbe, The Invention of Africa: Gnosis, Philosophy, and the Order of Knowledge (Bloomington, Ind., 1988). The Currents in World Christianity Project, at the University of Cambridge, has also since 1996 lent considerable impetus to the scholarly study of missions. A longstanding African literature reconsiders missions and the truth claims of missionaries, often from a theological perspective: for example, J. N. K. Mugambi, From Liberation to Reconstruction: African Christian Theology after the Cold War (Nairobi, 1996). Many works by African scholars are less well distributed in the West than they might be, given material constraints. From a wide variety of directions, missionary activity has become a newly invigorated area of research since the 1990s, although some of the more difficult underlying issues are perhaps not adequately discussed in all the literature. 12 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 8. 13 Terence Ranger, "Religious Movements and Politics in Sub-Saharan Africa," African Studies Review 29 (1986): 1-69. 14 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 12. 15 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17-18.

At the same time, the "forms" of the "European worldview" became inscribed on the "African land- scape": "not only did colonialism produce reified cultural orders, it gave rise to a new hegemony amidst-and despite-cultural contestation."16 Throughout this discussion, the Comaroffs reject the poststructuralist claim that all meanings are equally tenuous and open to contestation, regretting the episte- mological hypochondria and consequent intellectual immobility to which postmod- ern critiques have given rise in academia-even as the authors uphold some of the central insights of such critiques, notably their insistence that the indeterminacies of meaning and action be addressed by scholars.17 What poststructuralists cannot address is the basic question of how some meanings get widely accepted over significant periods of time by those against whose interest it is to believe them. This is the problem of hegemony, raised by Gramsci (however sketchy his discussion in the Prison Notebooks) and developed by many social theorists.18 The Comaroffs offer a solution, though over-schematic in the literal sense of the word. They see human consciousness as existing on a spectrum from "hegemony" to "ideology." At the hegemony end of the spectrum, one finds the taken-for-granted inscribed in everyday life-those beliefs that are not questioned because they are not even noticed as beliefs. At the other end, one finds articulated ideology, which is available for debate and which often tries to bring into consciousness the hegemonic beliefs of earlier stages. Culture in general is the "space of signifying practice, the semantic ground on which human beings seek to construct and represent themselves and others-and hence, society and history."l9 Somewhat oddly, hegemonic concepts are described as "constructs and conventions that have come to be shared and naturalized through a political community," while ideology is "the expression and ultimately the possession of a particular social group, although it may be widely peddled beyond."20 This psychological structure seems artificial and unwieldy; it is unclear why the province of the hegemonic idea should be the political community (a tricky concept to define in any case), while ideology is described not only as the product of communities (rather than at least sometimes of individuals) but as the province of the social rather than, say, political or even self-consciously intellectual groupings. The definition of the political is murky here, as it is throughout the book, despite (even sometimes because of) the painstaking effort of the authors to demonstrate the deeply political nature of the everyday stuff of life; what is lacking here and elsewhere is a willingness to limit and define the nature of the political in such a manner as to make it meaningful to call something political in the first place. Be that as it may, this construction of group political psychology permits the Comaroffs to draw conclusions that are critically important for their overall project. Indeed, the reconstruction of struggles over the stuff of everyday life that takes pride of place in the second volume depends ultimately on this theoretical 16 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 18. 17 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17. 18 Antonio Gramsci, Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci, Quentin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith, trans.

Given the place of hegemony and ideology on an ever-changing spectrum, the two are constantly fluid; meanings are always being made and remade, as ideology challenges hegemony to reveal itself, and it is in the inchoate, fluid space between hegemony and ideology that human consciousness is at its most creative. Given that hegemony is constructed largely through the "assertion of control over various modes of symbolic production: over such things as educational and ritual processes, patterns of socialization, political and legal procedures, canons of style and self-representation, public communication, health and bodily discipline and so on," the realm of "symbolic production" is (presumably) political because it is a site for power struggles. This means both that the "symbolic production" is political and that resistance to modes of symbolic production that generate hegemony is political. Modes of resistance run across as wide a spectrum as modes of control, with at one end organized protest and other movements readily recognized as political by the West; at the other end are "gestures of tacit refusal and iconoclasms, gestures that sullenly and silently contest the forms of an existing hegemony."21 It is thus in this light that missions must be seen. They sought to extend hegemonic control over indigenous peoples by changing their worldviews to a point that new ways of behaving and seeing the world were completely internalized. Resistance to the specific forms of Christianity was also resistance to the message behind the signs. In the purest sense, resistance to Christian forms was resistance to the content of capitalism and to the global capitalist system; this is indeed a critical plank of Jean Comaroff's fascinating (if not uncontroversial) reading of African independent churches as quintessentially subversive because they appropriated and yet subverted Christian forms, in her important 1985 study Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance.22 Christian missions must also be re-read. Their gestures and ritual must be analyzed in order to see how missionaries were attempting to change far more than religious allegiance, acting as emissaries of modernity and economic transfor- mation. Finally, conversion was inextricably political, and as such a suitable site for political competition between colonizers and the colonized. The extremely rich remainder of this book and its successor volume work out the implications of these theoretical positions through a quite brilliant analysis of the nineteenth-century "colonial exchange" between the southern Tswana and the Nonconformist missions to them run first by the London Missionary Society (pioneers in the field) and then by their later-arriving brethren, the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society. An additional important project of the authors throughout this study is to demonstrate the importance of an imagined Africa to the British sense of themselves and more broadly to the construction of modernity. As the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2, as part of a series of seven propositions about colonialism, "colonialism was as much involved in making the metropole, and the identities and ideologies of colonizers, as it was in (re)making peripheries and colonial sub- 21 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 31. 22 Jean Comaroff, Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance: The Culture and History of a South African People (Chicago, 1985).

A final critical point is that the authors see the interaction between missionary and Tswana as a form of dialectic between two key groups of interlocutors, dependent on the notion of difference. In the second volume, the Comaroffs acknowledge with more force than in Volume 1 the existence of overlap on the ground, and they reemphasize that the idea of difference was created by the dialectical process, despite some merging of lifeways on the ground and the mutual influence of Tswana and British. Note their comment that "neither 'the colonizer' nor 'the colonized' represented an undifferentiated sociological or political reality, save in exceptional circumstances."25 Since the end product of the colonial encounter was so clearly the production of difference and a series of deeply embedded dialectical oppositions, the Comaroffs nonetheless argue that this is the most productive optic through which to view the early nineteenth-century encounter between European mission- aries and Africans. This model is furthermore essential to their theoretical account of the formation of hegemony. ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE FOUND MOST PERPLEXING about the work of the Comaroffs is, nevertheless, the question of the extent to which it is appropriate to describe the Tswana encounter with Christianity as a form of dialectic. This question implies the ancillary question of who the agents of the dialectic were at given moments. On the face of it, these are tendentious concerns, since colonialism was so clearly in many ways a dialectic between colonized and colonizer, just as colonialism clearly generated reified views of colonizer and colonized alike. Missionaries themselves usually understood their activities in dialectical terms. Yet I think one can ask whether a dialectical approach to the history of Christianity in colonial contexts 23 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 22. 24 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 86.

This is above all because of the rapidity with which Christianity was out of the hands of the missionaries and settlers who brought it, the corresponding importance of non- Europeans in the spread of Christianity, the multiplicity of uses to which diverse interest groups of all ethnicities put Christianity as both a language and a practice, and the political and cultural complications of regions with multiple power players. These issues are brought out by a re-reading of the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana that occupy so key a role in the first volume of Of Revelation and Revolution. I should add that I made similar comments about the opening phases of the mission in an unpublished conference paper after the publication of Volume 1. The Comaroffs respond generously to this paper in Volume 2, as they do to a number of other critics, using the occasion to clarify and amplify their understanding of a dialectical approach. I do not want to beat a dead horse. Nonetheless, I think there are some useful differences of interpretation at stake, and so will abuse the Comaroffs' patience by briefly recapitulating a potential alternate reading of these opening gambits, before returning to the wider issue of different approaches to mission history.26 Let me first make a comment about regional issues. The lands of the southern Tswana were disrupted by colonialism, drought, hunger, and regional conflict well before the formal advent of missions. Furthermore, as Johannes du Bruyn has underscored, the lands inhabited by the southern Tswana were so profoundly affected by the Cape Colony to the south that it is problematic to frame a discussion of cultural colonialism primarily in terms of Europe and the Transvaal. In particular, the colonial firearms frontier moved with great speed, was highly destructive, and was arguably more important earlier than the Comaroffs suggest. Many different armed bands, some of them ethnically mixed, decimated peaceful groups in conflict situations exacerbated by hunger.27 Arguments about the regional context for evangelical missions to the Tswana are also implicit in a much wider body of literature about the so-called mfecane (or difaqane)-terms that have been much disputed by historians. Traditionally, the mfecane was a term given to the widespread wars, famines, and refugee movements that shook (and temporarily depopulated) much of the interior of southern Africa in the early nineteenth century, the impact of which on the Tswana the Comaroffs date from 1822. There is no space here to explore that debate, although it will be helpful to know that a 26 My re-reading of the opening encounter is based on my own work on LMS archives, which I consulted primarily with the aim of writing about contestation over the uses of Christianity within the Cape Colony and with a focus on Khoesan not Tswana uses of Christianity. It seems to me fruitful, however, to unite diverse perspectives on a very complex subject.

There were four LMS delegations to the Tswana to establish a mission, not two as the Comaroffs have it. 27 Johannes du Bruyn, "Of Muffled Tswana and Overwhelming Missionaries: The Comaroffs and the Colonial Encounter," South African Historical Journal, no. 31 (1994): 294-309; Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 275-76.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 444 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh critical issue is whether or not covert slave trading from the Cape Colony and Portuguese territories was at the root of disruptions that have more traditionally been ascribed to the many conquests of the Zulu kingdom in the region of what is now Natal. The point I want to emphasize here is not only the great disruption in the region but also the plausibility of historian Neil Parsons's argument that Tswana territory had already been subject since the seventeenth century to political unrest and the large-scale movement of populations. Parsons in fact suggests that the roots of disruption and state formation in the area may well lie in destabilization that considerably antedated the 1820s and may in turn be linked in at least some way to eighteenth-century slave trading to the north and the rise of the predatory Cape Colony to the south.28 Scholars also tend to see later Afrikaner settler colonialism in the region as part of the same broad processes. All this calls into question the determinative impact of mission Christianity in an already destabilized region. Maybe political colonialism did precede cultural colonialism after all? How might we need to reconceptualize the Christian/Tswana encounter if we think of it as taking place in some sense in a frontier zone, or even a borderland, with multiple players, already characterized by cultural admixture, politically influenced uses of Christianity, and political turbulence? The Comaroffs are of course sensitive to these hugely important issues. I think nonetheless that they could emphasize regional complexity more and the power of missionary Christianity somewhat less in their discussion of the roots of material change (at both ends of the nineteenth century), as well as pay more attention to the implications for their overall theoretical argument of the fact that Africans tried to experiment in response to very difficult local conditions. It is also important that the missionaries entered as potential power brokers in a turbulent environment but were initially weak, able to manipulate power if and only if they could make the right alliances. With these types of broad issues in mind, the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana, so well described by the Comaroffs, might be re-read as conversations between a number of actors. Four LMS delegations traveled between 1813 and 1817 to the southern Tswana settlement known to the missionaries as Lattakoo (later Dithakong) to try to persuade the Tswana to accept missionaries. It is perhaps symbolically appropriate that none of these delegations was exclusively white. In addition to the delegations' African members, even the missionaries themselves included a black West Indian man and a Welsh speaker. Neither, come to that, was the Tswana polity entirely "Tswana." The Thlaping polity was relatively multi-ethnic; the chief Mothibi, for example, was half !Kora (a Khoekhoe-speaking group) and (like others of the chiefly lineage) married a !Kora woman. More significantly, the Europeans were not the only, or even the most important, players promoting an evangelical mission. Key from a Tswana perspective were regional actors, the Griqua (as they 28 Julian Cobbing, "The Mfecane as Alibi: Thoughts on Dithakong and Mbolompo," Journal of African History 29, no. 3 (1988): 487-519; Caroline Hamilton, ed., Mfecane Aftermath (Johannesburg, 1996), including Neil Parsons, "Prelude to Difaqane in the Interior of Southern Africa c. 1600-1822," 323-49; Neil Parsons, "Kicking the Hornets' Nest: A Third View of the Cobbing Controversy on the Mfecane/Difaqane," address to the University of Botswana History Society, Gabarone, Botswana, March 16, 1999 (available online through the University of Botswana History Department web page, at http://ubh.tripod.com/ub/np.htm).

The Griqua were clusters of settlers in the region of Khoekhoe descent, some of whom had white fathers and Khoesan mothers, and many of whom had migrated from the Cape Colony, epitomizing the remaking of identity in the wake of colonialism. Groups spearheaded by Griqua had established regional hegemony through their access to arms and horses. They provided important trade links with the Cape Colony and were sources of trade goods for the Tswana. The Griqua were already using Christianity in a variety of complicated ways, as a token of equality with white settlers, as justification for what Robert Ross has termed "sub-imperialism" with regard to the unconverted Tswana, and indeed as a basis for their reconstituted polities. Alliances with missionaries gave these emergent polities potential access to diplomacy and markets, including the arms trade, in addition to spiritual concerns. Indeed, on the way to Mothibi's settlement, British LMS inspector Campbell had helped compose a formal written constitution for a Griqua group, reflecting the symbolic uses of the language of law. The language of Christianity was already on the loose in the interior, in other words, and subject to interpretation in Griqualand as much as in the seminaries of Europe.29 The (Khoekhoe) !Kora had also been exposed to Christianity and were also competing by the 1820s to obtain guns and horses from the Cape Colony. The decision of Mothibi and his counselors about whether to accept an LMS mission was thus complicated by the fact that the LMS came under the protection of the powerful Griqua Kok clan. During a second LMS delegation to the Tswana (overlooked by the Comaroffs), for example, Adam Kok presented newly arrived missionaries to Mothibi and acted as their translator. Mothibi was anxious not to offend the powerful Kok family, but worried because his own people had since turned against the mission. In fact, he eventually sent these missionaries away altogether. When two missionaries told Mothibi that one of them "wrought in wood, and one that was to come wrought in Iron, that we would do all the work for him in that way that he wanted," Mothibi was pleased and told Kok "he could not think of rejecting those that came with or through the medium of him." When the missionaries pursued the issue of teaching, however, Mothibi worriedly told Kok that "he would not be instructed, and if A. Kok should endeavour to press it sharply upon him, and his refusal cause a variance between them, he said that he would rather take the flight from Lattakoo, with people." Kok had to reassure Mothibi that the Griqua leader would not force the Tswana chief to relocate if the Thlaping 29 This discussion both here and below draws on Robert Ross, Adam Kok's Griquas: A Study in the Development of Stratification in South Africa (Cambridge, 1976); Elizabeth Elbourne and Robert Ross, "Combating Spiritual and Social Bondage: Early Missions in the Cape Colony," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa; Alan Barnard, Hunters and Herders of Southern Africa: A Comparative Ethnography of the Khoisan Peoples (Cambridge, 1992), 156-75, 193-94; Martin Legassick, "The Northern Frontier to c. 1840: The Rise and Decline of the Griqua People," in Richard Elphick and Hermann Giliomee, eds., The Shaping of South African Society, 1652-1840 (Middletown, Conn., 1988), 358-420; Nigel Penn, "The Orange River Frontier Zone, c. 1700-1805," in Andrew B.

If missionaries were initially dependent on Griqua intermediaries, they were also materially dependent for travel and translation on Khoesan hired in the colony. The Khoekhoe and San had long borne the brunt of brutal colonial subjugation and were in many cases more receptive to conversion than groups beyond the Cape Colony. The Comaroffs indeed have a wonderful discussion of the occlusion of such intermediary figures from missionary accounts of putatively solitary heroic jour- neys.31 I would go further than the Comaroffs, however, and suggest that at least some of these companions saw themselves as fellow missionaries. On the first delegation, Campbell was accompanied by a number of Khoesan Christians from the Cape. Their prayers and preaching had made a pilgrimage route of their journey through a country of which they saw themselves as taking spiritual possession. They were active in trying to persuade Tswana individuals to accept missionaries.32 In 1814, a synod of the southern African LMS missionaries had "set aside" in a religious ceremony several men of Khoesan descent to act as LMS agents in the interior, several of whom, including Griqua leader Andries Waterboer, subse- quently played important roles in the politics of Transorangia. Cupido Kakkerlak, a product of Eastern Cape mission schools whose letters reveal a passionate spirituality, also itinerated in the region, attempting, albeit with little success, to evangelize among the !Kora. These men were employed by the LMS. As the Comaroffs point out, the society would devote much energy to reining in and controlling "native agents" after the earliest years of the mission. Nonetheless, evidence from the Cape suggests that there was also considerable evangelical activity by converts who were not formally paid by missionary societies, including elephant hunters such as Hendrik Boesak or long-range wagon drivers. In addition, as mission stations became more like churches and congregations fought for independence from missionary control around the mid-century mark, congregations had more authority, not less. My point is that evidence from elsewhere in southern Africa suggests that Christianity was spread by people with long-range contacts other than missionaries, presumably not necessarily in orthodox form. The central- ity of Khoesan people (and later other Africans) to European-led missions to the Tswana suggests a wider oral evangelical culture that the written records would not completely reflect.33 Be that as it may, the importance of Khoesan agents to the Tswana mission is most clearly exemplified by the fourth delegation to Lattakoo, led by a former 30 Robert Hamilton to LMS Directors, Griquatown, April 28, 1816, London Missionary Society Papers, South Africa Correspondence-Incoming, 6/3/C, Council for World Mission Archives, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (hereafter, LMS-SA).

Read brought with him an unusually large group of people of varied ethnic origins, mostly Khoesan, including, more problematically, his own Khoekhoe wife, Elizabeth Valentyn, and his pregnant former mistress, a San woman, Sabina Pretorius, whom he claimed to have met by accident on the road. At least ten Khoesan men and six Khoesan women accompanied Read, all of whom were church members and some of whom were "zealous persons."34 It is indeed possible that the Khoesan of the Cape Colony saw this as a Khoesan mission to the Tswana, brokered by their kin among the Griqua. In any case, once Robert Moffat took over the Lattakoo station in 1821 from Read (disgraced for his adultery), he would fight successfully to diminish the influence of the Khoesan group from the Cape Colony, whom he then firmly wrote out of the history of the station. He dismissed several for immorality, despite the resistance, in which women played prominent roles, of members of the group. Moffat also found himself opposed by Griqua factions, many of whom resented his power-mongering presence.35 Before the late 1810s, the earliest LMS agents in southern Africa were not particularly good or even very enthusiastic apostles of capitalist cultural practices, mostly because they were so poor themselves and so looked-down-upon by many respectable members of colonial society. More than a few also tended to believe in dreams, to hear the personal voice of God, or to look for the imminent end of the world. Those missionaries who were closest in time to the Enlightenment, in sum, acted least like the bourgeois agents of respectability described by the Comaroffs as quintessential exemplars of the rationalizing project of modernity. The colonial unrespectability of early missionaries was compounded by the fact that perhaps a third of them married African women before 1817, while several were involved in sexual scandals. Others took high-profile political positions that were unpopular among settlers. The Comaroffs pick up the story as Moffat, in common with many of his fellows, was urgently trying to reclaim the moral high ground and to reinvent the mission as visibly respectable and as focused on "civilization." A lot of this is more about the internal history of the LMS than about African Christianity; we certainly in general need more of the latter and perhaps less of the former. Nonetheless, it argues for the importance of local detail, and for the centrality of fractures within as well as between groups. It also points forward to ways in which converts would later need to perform "civilization" and "respectability" in order to maneuver on the colonial stage, not solely because their consciousnesses had been colonized. From the start, tensions among evangelicals themselves were fueled by anxiety over the rapid removal of Christianity from the control of white missionaries. This tension was arguably innate to a type of evangelical Christianity based on textual interpretation and the notion of divine inspiration, as well as being the product of Tswana reconstruction of Christian forms. Certainly, missionaries soon lost control even of "orthodox" Christianity. Among the northern Tswana, Paul Landau has brilliantly documented the use of Christianity by junior royals to challenge existing authority in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in ways that escaped 34 LMS-SA, 6/4/A: James Read to Joseph Hardcastle, Bethelsdorp, August 7, 1816. 35 See Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman. AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 448 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh a series of rather peripheral white missionaries. Among the southern Tswana, Thlaping elites also exploited divisions among missionaries to their own political ends. In 1842, for example, Tswana elite men successfully appealed to LMS superintendent John Philip to fire missionary Holloway Helmore for excessive interference in congregational affairs, including deposing Mothibi's son as a deacon.36 Missionaries to the Tswana experienced other humiliations. The coherent Tswana group targeted by the mission decamped, to be replaced by a more motley group of refugees. The mission was battered by raids from various groups, could not protect its members, and was not successful at all until it started picking up displaced persons in the 1830s. A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS arise from this type of re-reading. At a macro level, the region was already turbulent and populations were mobile, so Christianity scarcely arrived as the harbinger of globalization in anything other than an ideological sense. This raises in turn the thorny and ultimately unanswerable question of whether Christianity would have had the capacity to colonize minds without the prior disruption of material conditions. We are back at the difficult issue of how determinative "culture" is by itself. Perhaps in the end, this rejigging of chronology strengthens the Comaroffs' fundamental argument about the inextricability of "culture" and material struggle. It does nonetheless pose all the more sharply the question of how Christianity-and religious innovation, more broadly defined- functioned in a frontier zone in a manner that was independent of the machinations of white missionaries.37 Also at the "macro" level, the Tswana were not entirely "local," nor were they unused to cultural difference. In a multi-lingual, multi-religious environment, were missionaries really needed to contextualize "Tswana custom"? Missionary papers record Mothibi making distinctions between !Kora, Tswana, and colonial Khoekhoe customs, for example. I would not want to deny the importance of local identity, or to exaggerate the degree of long-range contacts of the southern Tswana, in contrast to the remarkable global reach and global identity claims of the early missionary movement. There are issues of tremendous importance raised by that contrast. But it also seems important that there were other regional interlocutors who were of greater material importance initially to the Tswana than the Europeans, and with whom they already had the kind of cultural interchanges that might have permitted the type of self-consciousness about "Tswana" identity that the Comaroffs see as the fruit of the "long conversation." This is also a way of asking about what the southern African interior looked like before formal European colonialism and whether the communities of the region were really as settled as they appeared. There are echoes here of an older debate about whether the encounter with the "macrocosmic" claims of the "world religions" Christianity and Islam shattered the 36 Landau, Realm of the Word; Elbourne, Blood Ground. On Helmore's dismissal, see LMS-SA, 19/2/A: James Read to LMS Directors, Philipton, June 3, 1843. The LMS Directors overturned the dismissal and censured Philip. 37 An interesting point of contrast is provided by Janet Hodgson, "A Battle for Sacred Power: Christian Beginnings among the Xhosa," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa.

As Terence Ranger has argued, whatever the intellectual issues at stake, African societies, at least in the southern African interior, have to be recognized as also "macrocosmic" in the sense that they had long-range contacts, exchanged ideas over large swathes of territory (as the rapid spread of prophetic movements suggests), and rubbed up against a wide variety of different groups.38 The relative mobility of different communities was also a factor in breaking down localism. This type of approach, to my mind, decenters the European missionary-at least until the missionary came backed up by a colonial economy and a colonial army. The power exerted by the conditions of the "frontier zone" of the region is represented by the fact that even missionaries were compelled by material circumstances to take on features of African polities. The Comaroffs highlight the vision of Kuruman mission head and former gardener Robert Moffat, and his wife Mary, like that of many early nineteenth-century Nonconformist missionaries, as one of an unrealistic rural idyll, in which they sought to remake Africa in the image of a vanishing and imagined rural utopian Britain. One could, however, go further in considering the contradictions of Kuruman. Robert Moffat acted in many ways like an African leader as well as like a nostalgic Scot, and he needed to do so because of the material conditions of the frontier. In the 1820s, he proved unable to retain the allegiance of existing chiefs, for whom he was too clearly a competitor. As the refugee crisis accelerated, however, Moffat was able to gather together dispossessed people. The price of their admission was allegiance to the religion of the leader, since religion was used to rebuild communities. The currency of power was people. In similar ways, the control of women and their reproduction was important to the maintenance of the power of the patriarch, whether African chief or mission station head-Moffat even went so far, for example, as to attempt to discipline publicly Ann Hamilton, the wife of his colleague Robert Hamilton, for refusing to sleep with her husband.39 Moffat was more a part of the African frontier world than he might have liked to admit. A further critical point raised by this case study is that Africans transmitted Christianity more effectively than missionaries did. The centrality of Africans to the spread of Christianity means that much of the early history of the mission is unrecoverable. It is often unclear what kinds of Christianity were spread orally, for example. In other parts of southern Africa, prophetic figures emerged from time to time to use aspects of the Christian message in a context that suggests how quickly its language became unhinged from missionary guardianship. For example, Xhosa prophet and war hero Makanda Nxele (Makana), who led a Xhosa attack on the colony in 1819, had an earlier flirtation with the LMS; he was refused the right to work as a native agent when he insisted that there was a god for the white man and a god for the black man, and that he himself was related to Jesus Christ. The examples could be multiplied, as the Comaroffs would certainly agree. The lines 38 Terence Ranger, "The Local and the Global in Southern African Religious History," in Hefner, Conversion to Christianity, 65-98. 39 Karel Schoeman, A Thorn Bush That Grows in the Path: The Missionary Career of Ann Hamilton, 1815-1823 (Cape Town, 1995); LMS-SA, 8/3/B: Robert Moffat to LMS, Lattakoo, July 12, 1821. AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 450 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh between orthodoxy as the missionaries perceived it and African prophetic innova- tion were fluid and could be crossed in both directions, explaining the anxiety of white missionaries to bring Christianity back under control. In contrast to the Comaroffs, who emphasize the orthodoxy of the Nonconformists (whom they see in rather stereotypical, indeed Victorianist, terms), I would contend that this anxiety was familiar from debates within the European churches as well; after all, Methodism had once been perceived from within the citadels of Anglican orthodoxy in ways similar to Nonconformist views of African ecstatic innovation.40 If in the early days of missionary activity, Christianity was never fully in the control of the white missionaries who had brought it and only became popular once it was spread mostly by Africans and then transformed in the process, what does this imply about how we might conceptualize the study of colonial missions? I have suggested in the past that the messy scenario I outline above, with its complications and its fudging across the fault lines, calls into question the utility at the micro level of a strict dialectical approach to the history of colonial Christianity. The ghost of French structuralist understandings of G. W. Hegel's master-slave dialectic seems to me to hover over and to constrain the first volume. In response, however, the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2 that I have too conventional an understanding of their view of dialectical processes. A dialectic is not a "formal, abstract, or strictly teleological movement through time and space," in a Hegelian sense. Rather, it is a "process of reciprocal determination; a process of material, social and cultural articulation-involving sentient human beings rather than abstract forces or structures."41 Colonialism is dialectical because it creates binary understandings of difference and depends on the idea of opposites; it is also presumably dialectical because colonial interaction shapes both the colonized and the colonizer in new ways. Returning to the issue at the end of Volume 2, the Comaroffs reiterate (although this seems to me a somewhat different take) that by "dialectics" they mean "the mutually transforming play of social forces whose outcome is neither linear nor simply overdetermined." Defined thus, they add, "it is hard to imagine how colonial history could be regarded as anything else."42 In a weak sense, this is undeniable. Furthermore, on this model, it may not matter that the early encounter between missionaries and Tswana was so much messier than a "dialectical" account would suggest. The Comaroffs' point is precisely that out of difference and mess colonialism created binary opposites. At the same time, the exact nature of this process is often hard to capture. It is interesting to hear John Comaroff raise, in a recently published transcribed conversation with Homi Bhabha, what he terms the question of theory related to "the old Manichean opposition between colonizer and colonized, those 'iteratively marked,' positionally conflated points of reference around which the human geography of empire is so widely imagined. How, other than purely by descriptive insistence, does one displace the crushing logic of binarism in terms of which 40 Among many possibilities, see Deborah Valenze, Prophetic Sons and Daughters: Female Preaching and Popular Religion in Industrial England (Princeton, N.J., 1985). 41 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 29. 42 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 410. AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 451 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne colonial worlds are apprehended and narrated?"43 I think this is a genuine point of tension for the Comaroffs, and quite rightly for many others. Perhaps my own discomfort arises from the difficulty of defining who the agents of dialectic are. In the end, the Comaroffs are interested in doing a historical anthropology of colonialism, more than of religion in colonial contexts. In this optic, the fault line of interest is that between colonized and colonizer. Religious belief did not, however, adhere to that fault line, even though both colonized and colonizers mobilized religion to the ends of power struggle. Nor of course was Christianity itself static. At the same time, the very notion of ethnic difference was still in the process of being worked out more broadly well past the early era of industrialization; therefore it was incorporated differently into the views of colonial evangelists at different times. From the point of view of the Comaroffs' overall narrative structure, this leads us away from the Enlightenment and onto the terrain of more immediately nineteenth-century colonial concerns. On this model, colonial conquest and the need to maintain and justify white rule shaped the mid- nineteenth-century culture of white Christianity. The end was not contained in the beginning but formed by colonial processes. Be that as it may, it is instructive that the Khoesan themselves were not able indefinitely to maintain the interstitial status to which Christianity gave them some access. By the early 1850s, many living in the Cape Colony were forced to choose between the colonial binaries of "black" and "white," in the 1850-1853 frontier war in which many people of Khoesan descent rebelled to fight against the "white" colony, as "race" became the determinant of colonial identity.44 The example also underscores the importance of "black" and "white" as colonial binaries arguably of more importance than "English" and "Tswana." All this should not, however, lead us to read the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in terms of the mid-nineteenth. There is a basic problem here that dogs the Comaroffs throughout the books. Christianity is both text and practice, and therefore difficult to pin down. Not only that, it also permits and contains a wide variety both of practices and of different interpretations of its central themes. As text, Christianity became a free-floating signifier. As a practice, it was fought over bitterly by those who wanted to benefit from it. It is therefore difficult to identify Christianity clearly with one side of a dialectical or even dialogic model. This is all the more problematic because it is hard to define Christianity clearly, other than by appeals to authority. There was considerable scope for Africans to reinvent Christianity even from the beginning of the mission described by the Comaroffs. In some ways, this is precisely the Comaroffs' point: the signs of Christianity were fought over by competing ethnic groups. The Comaroffs nonetheless cannot bring themselves to see acceptance of Christianity in its unadulterated mission form as anything other than a defeat for 43 Bhabha and Comaroff, "Speaking of Postcoloniality," 22. 44 Elbourne, Blood Ground, 345-76; Robert Ross, "The Kat River Rebellion and Khoikhoi Nationalism: The Fate of an Ethnic Identification," Kronos: Journal of Cape History/Tydskrif vir Kaaplandse Geskiedenis 24 (November 1997): 91-105.

This position ultimately obscures complexity. EVENTUALLY, ONE MUST CONFRONT the type of question raised by Leon de Kock, about disciplinary conventions and the fetishization of the archive.45 De Kock argues that historians have spent too much time in their reaction to this wonderful book looking for factual flaws. To put the question in its boldest form, are the details really that essential to the overall project? Perhaps less tendentiously, what are the Comaroffs doing that goes beyond the reading of the words of colonists? The Comaroffs are important precisely because they move beyond words to decipher the gestures of people in the past. They put an anthropologist's emphasis on ritual and performance. They add thereby a crucial dimension to our reading of culture-bound historical archives. The Comaroffs' understanding of performance goes well beyond the staged performances of religious rites (although they acknowledge at the same time that people used the framework of religious ritual as a springboard for their own acting out of emotions and ideas). The missionaries are described as performing civilization, in the hope of educating the Tswana to adopt Western cultural practices through the power of display. In response, the Tswana performed noncompliance or acted out cultural bricolage. The tangible display of the body interests the Comaroffs, just as the material suffering of the colonized body that we readers know is to come provides a moral template for our reading of the early nineteenth century. The authors are particularly interested in space and the disposition of the body in space: their analyses frequently return, like the apartheid state itself, to issues of the control of the movement of African bodies.46 The Comaroffs are in some ways mistrustful of the self-interested and one-sided colonial text and find more solidity in the unspoken exchanges of bodily perfor- mance. It is this approach that both furnishes the greatest richness of the books and yet at the same time has excited unease in some interlocutors. If the evidence that remains of Tswana actions is mostly accounts of their physical activity, does that not place the reporter (the anthropologist, the historian, or even the reader) in the privileged position of interpreting Tswana actions, leaving the Tswana themselves rarely free to speak directly in their own voice? Is this even an accurate assessment of the nature of the historical record, or are there more extensive Tswana records? J. D. Y. Peel and Terence Ranger have both queried the absence of Tswana 45 De Kock, "For and Against the Comaroffs." 46 For example, Volume 2 tellingly argues that integral to the late nineteenth-century struggle over African labor was a further struggle over the "distribution of people in space and, concomitantly, their passage across the social landscape." This is a typical discussion of space that appropriately reflects the struggle of the apartheid state to control the physical body, just as slavery had earlier lent mastery of the body to the slaveowner.

The Comaroffs have responded that community historical narrative was not a genre espoused by the Tswana. They argue, furthermore, that the quest for "narrative" is elitist: it is "a short step from the stress on narrative to the history of elites, thence to elitist history."48 The issue remains uneasily unresolved. For Paul Landau, the Comaroffs themselves have a culturally constrained view of what constitutes "genuine narrative." They pay "little attention to genealogy, song, Tswana conversation, letters, political speech, tales, myth or church charters- because they are not 'genuine' narratives. Consequently Tswana people's ideas of fulfillment and transcendence do not show themselves in either volume."49 Even the Tswana intellectual and politician Sol Plaatje's great novel Mhudi, which draws on Tswana traditions about the difaqane, has been brought into the fray: for the Comaroffs, the fact that Plaatje himself claims that he could only gather material in fragments suggests that the southern Tswana indeed did not have a tradition of sustained historical narrative as late as the early twentieth century, even though Mhudi is more conventionally seen as a reflection at least to some extent of more sustained Tswana oral tradition.50 There is another critical debate at work in these discussions of agency and voice. The Comaroffs are very clear that missionary activity was part of the victimization of Africans. Much recent scholarship on southern African Christianity emphasizes instead the agency of Africans in using and reshaping Christianity to their own ends, as the focus has shifted away from missionaries and onto African Christians. In some ways, the Comaroffs want to restore a sense of moral indignation at the ways in which colonial missions did change the consciousness of Africans in a damaging fashion. Ironically, this may involve seeing people as victims who did not necessarily see themselves that way at the time-another issue of authorial voice. The Comaroffs' anger represents nonetheless an important strand of longstanding protest across the colonized world at the "colonization of the mind."51 It is impossible to deny that many Christian missionaries had a profoundly negative 47 J.

Furthermore, as Peggy Brock has persuasively argued, missionary institutional structures affected the degree of control missionaries could exert over congregations, and these structures were affected by indigenous social arrangements as well as by state power.53 I would further contend, in ways there is not space to elaborate on fully here, that shame was a key element of colonial control. Mission education could and did reinforce this. At the same time, Christianity could also provide a language through which to reclaim dignity and deny the shaming process. I think it is important in sum to see Christianity as a language with many possible uses. Conversion, for example, fulfilled a wider and more flexible range of functions than is suggested by the Comaroffs' reduction of it to a symbolic field of struggle over capitalism. A reading that focuses too exclusively on Christianity as a language of cultural domination rather than a language with a multiplicity of possible meanings pays too much attention to the Western roots of Christianity and not enough to the multiple uses to which Africans very quickly put it. I make this comment in awareness of the extent to which the Comaroffs emphasize the need to explore African perspectives through every possible means, and the extent to which they clearly do this. However, conversion was even more of an empty signifier than the Comaroffs suggest, and some of these significations did not have a lot to do with rational capitalism. On the other hand, conversion was also an act, with attached rituals and beliefs, and this is important for understanding what the act meant in the immediate rather than long-term sense. Even if I am not completely at ease with a victimization model, I would want to add that these were and are enormously complicated processes. They had deep and often painful implications for many. This demands humility from any historian. Undergirding much of the above has been a historian's concern with chronology, which, while justified, cannot do full justice to the rich ferment of ideas in these remarkable books. The Comaroffs in fact comment on what they see as different disciplinary conventions and their inherent costs and benefits. They see real and longstanding differences, as they remark at the end of Volume 2, between the ideal type of a more conventional historian and the archetypal historical anthropologist: "differences between the ideographic and the nomothetic, between the effort to arrive at the fullest possible description of events in their infinite particularity and the desire to pick out general principles across time and space." The latter approach, they underscore, "demands a certain boldness of abstraction" and is "inherently risky."54 Although one would hope that historians are not as painstak- ingly antiquarian and abstraction-averse as this implies, there is some justice to the 52 A wonderfully instructive example of the ambiguities of Christian liberal control of the education system in South Africa, just before apartheid, is furnished by Shula Marks, ed., Not Either an Experimental Doll: The Separate Worlds of Three South African Women (London, 1985). 53 Peggy Brock, "Mission Encounters in the Colonial World: British Columbia and South-West Australia," Journal of Religious History 24, no. 2 (June 2000): 159-79. 54 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 411.

The very manner in which they offer up a multitude of bold ideas, fizzing with possibility, also ensures that they offer a number of hostages to fortune. The Comaroffs are, for example, probably the most influential of recent scholars to argue for tight linkage between missionary activity, "modernity," "Enlighten- ment," and globalization. As Brian Stanley points out, this is also a question that has been much debated in the past few years by Christian theologians and mission theorists, with theologians paying particular attention to the damage done by the universalist truth claims of mission Christianity.55 More broadly, the Comaroffs are participating in a vast debate about modernity and postmodernity among social, political, and cultural theorists that it would be foolhardy to venture upon here. Their contribution is both important and vexed: important because they show the culturally constrained nature of claims to "modernity," vexed because despite everything they reify the truth claims of modernity and have too neat a view of the "Enlightenment," despite substantial historical debate on the utility of the concept. In so doing, they exaggerate the long-term influence of mission Christianity on the material subjugation of the Tswana, particularly by minimizing the impact of illiberal forces and overemphasizing cultural change. This could be true, however, and the significance of the Comaroffs' analysis of practice still be undimmed. The Comaroffs see "modernity" as "always historically constructed." It is in their view "an ideological formation in terms of which societies valorize their own practices by contrast to the specter of barbarism and other marks of negation."56 The Comaroffs link modernity to a view of the self as a rights-bearing atomistic individual, ultimately the "fully fledged bourgeois subject." They further associate modernity with a wide-ranging series of cultural and economic practices, including but not limited to dependence on a worldwide market, industrialization, the use of money, the use of "advanced" agricultural practices, the promotion of individuated space, and a sense of the body as private.57 It is part of the great richness of the Comaroffs' approach that they so fruitfully link cultural and economic practices, refusing to prioritize one over the other. At the same time, this view of modernity is slippery-and this is both its richness and an occasional source of frustration. The Comaroffs move between presenting the truth claims of modernity-its "text," if one likes-and the concrete material practices that advocates saw as characterizing the modern. The authors' desire not to take the truth claims of missionaries at face value make it difficult for them to spell out what, if any, were the irreducible material practices that defined modernity. If there weren't any, however, what was the material force behind the cultural claims and practices of missionaries? Yet it is arguable that at least some of what the Comaroffs identify as the 55 Brian Stanley, "Christian Missions and the Enlightenment: A Reevaluation," in Stanley, ed., Christian Missions and the Enlightenment (Grand Rapids, Mich., 2001), 1-2. Stanley points to David Bosch's Transforming Mission: Paradigm Shifts in Theology of Mission (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1991) as a seminal text for Christian theologians of mission in a postmodern context. 56 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 32. 57 A particularly influential figure for the Comaroffs' reading of the creation of the modern self in Volume 2 is Charles Taylor, whose Sources of the Self is a seminal text for their work. Taylor is of course a Christian Hegelian, whose view of the emergence of the modern self is certainly influenced by Hegelian dialectics, in however inexplicit a fashion.

There are echoes here of the great debates between radical and liberal historians in 1970s and 1980s South Africa, split over the origins of apartheid.58 For the "radical" school, liberalism, in both its ideological and economic sense, contributed to the economic domination that was at the root of apartheid. Radical historians argued that late nineteenth-century British capitalism precipitated and anticipated many features of South African society under apartheid, just as the Comaroffs here blame nine- teenth-century British liberal ideas about such things as money, markets, the individuated self, and the primacy of certain gender roles for the mental prepara- tion of the Tswana for labor oppression. Indeed, in their 2000 article "Millennial Capitalism: First Thoughts on a Second Coming," the Comaroffs explicitly link what they term the "Age of Revolution" (1789-1848) to the current "Age of Millennial Capitalism" with their similar anxieties and ontological challenges.59 This article makes explicit the magical, mystical elements of neoliberalism, and its culturally constrained forms, in contrast to neoliberals' claims to rationality and access to universal truth, just as Of Revelation and Revolution describes culturally constructed views of "modernity" and a "modern" economy. This is very helpful. Nonetheless, I think it would also be useful in Of Revelation and Revolution to be more explicit about actual intellectual debates among and between people: to have more ideology in places and less hegemony. The argument made by many, that early twentieth-century white liberals in practice came to support racist segregationist policies, while in ideological terms liberalism's support of the free market economy and nonviolent political action left it with little space to mobilize opposition to apartheid, all adds up to a trenchant and at least partially justified critique. By leaving out of the picture the intellectual shifts in liberalism (and among the opponents of liberalism) on the ground in the nineteenth century (and implicitly in the twentieth), however, the Comaroffs, like other authors, conflate several ills into one. Disciplinary specialists might want to throw further darts at the Comaroffs' narrative superstructure. Must industrialization and by implication modernity really begin in 1789? This is very French. What might be the impact of the questioning by economists of the linearity and suddenness of industrialization in Britain, which now looks more like an extended messy process than a "revolution" within neat chronological parameters? What difference does it make that the evangelical movement had many roots in seventeenth and eighteenth-century continental pietism? If Protestantism is the necessary condition of capitalism, where does this leave Catholic countries (not least France)? The point I want to close on is, however, that of tragedy. If there is, as I have suggested, an implicit narrative of origins that runs throughout Of Revelation and Revolution and lends the work its moral passion, this is not, for all that, a straightforward linear narrative of beginnings and ends. Rather, it is marked by 58 Christopher Saunders, The Making of the South African Past: Major Historians on Race and Class (Cape Town, 1988), describes the liberal/radical split. 59 Jean Comaroff and John L.

The Nonconformist missionaries who labored so intensely to change the daily lives of Africans in order to induct them into the "modern" economy did not foresee the devastating consequences of that economy for the Tswana peasantry (as might be said of some of the missionaries' modern counterparts, development workers). At the same time, the Comaroffs write as though missionaries inducted the Tswana into the global market and colonized their consciousness in a way that made their engagement more likely. It seems to me just as possible that the global market and related economic coercion came crashing into the lives and consciousness of the Tswana in a way about which they could do little, particularly as their contact was frequently mediated by coercive legislation on the part of the colonial state.60 Missionaries reflected the efforts of other Westerners to moralize the market: to see it as a force for moral good. In this, they shared the ambiguities (and guilty conscience?) of nineteenth-century liberalism. It does not take a great leap of the imagination to find contemporary parallels in the neoliberal discourse, and of course the Comaroffs are right that this putatively universalist creed contains deeply embedded culturally specific assumptions, as did nineteenth-century Anglo- American liberalism itself.61 If nonetheless market expansion is relatively inevita- ble, then is it not appropriate to ask on what terms this expansion might be the most moral? Or is the most appropriate response full-fledged resistance? Must the global marketplace necessarily be bad, on average, for Africa? From a somewhat different point on the ideological spectrum, one might also ask whether in fact Africa is incorporated into the global market on the equal terms supposedly demanded by neoliberal economics. These are clearly issues beyond the scope of this article, but not without historical parallels. In late nineteenth and early twentieth-century terms, the Tswana, it could be argued, were crowded out of an agricultural market in which many were making profits and farming more effectively than whites, in fact, in order to favor white farmers artificially and in order to bolster labor for the mines, again through "artificial" restraints on movement, through the theft of land, through racially targeted taxation, and through coercive legislation. This antici- pated many of the later strategies of apartheid.62 It is not as clear to me as it is to the Comaroffs that the questions some missionaries and Africans were asking about the possibility of a just economy were not the right ones, even if the culturally constrained answers they gave were so obviously, hopelessly wrong. I do not have answers to these questions either-merely some sympathy with the misguided quest for certainty in a rapidly changing, brutal, and deeply uncertain economic universe. 60 This is a point also made by Landau, "Hegemony and History." 61 Uday Mehta, Liberalism and Empire: A Study in Nineteenth-Century British Liberal Thought (Chicago, 1999); Mehta, "Liberal Strategies of Exclusion," in Stoler and Cooper, Tensions of Empire, 59-86. 62 Ted Matsetela, "The Life Story of Mma-Pooe: Aspects of Sharecropping and Proletarianization in the Northern Orange Free State 1890-1930," in Shula Marks and Richard Rathbone, eds., Industrialization and Social Change in South Africa (New York, 1982), 212-37; Charles Van Onselen, The Seed Is Mine: The Life of Kas Maine, a South African Sharecropper, 1894-1985 (Cape Town, 1996). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh I HAVE SUGGESTED THROUGHOUT THIS ESSAY that the Comaroffs present nineteenth- century missionaries as fairly powerful figures, able to effect changes in the consciousness of Tswana interlocutors, despite the resistance of many. In contrast, I see Christianity as important but, with some important exceptions, not necessarily white missionaries themselves. I also suggest that the linkages between political and cultural colonialism are often unclear in Of Revelation and Revolution, and that the role of "cultural colonialism" is overdetermined. If it is possible to guess about such counterfactuals, I suspect that at least some of the missionaries whose work has been scrutinized by the Comaroffs would ironically have preferred the Comaroffs' account of their activities to mine, however doubtless upset they would have been at the implication that their preaching laid the groundwork for the Tswana's entrapment within enslaving capitalist systems. But the Comaroffs do give the missionaries credit for a coherent, rationalizing, globalizing system that taught one universal truth. They also recognize the missionaries' own belief that they might instill into their converts the necessary principles of "civilization" to transform totally their supposedly primitive economies and to move them rapidly up the scale of human development toward settled commercial societies. My own interpretation, while recognizing the tremendous importance of the universalizing project as a mode of domination, calls into question the capacity of Christianity to convey as effectively as it would have liked a message of unifying orthodoxy, or indeed the overall ability of missionaries to accomplish their objectives. From the very beginning of the activity of Christians in Africa, as elsewhere in the world, Christianity was out of control, unorthodox, and an available subject for reinter- pretation in light of the needs of its interlocutors. Ironically, in sum, it is not always wise to take missionaries at their word.

Abstract: I conclude, then, that the task of theological ethics and, more broadly, the humanities and, if I can be bold, more broadly still the university itself is to examine carefully and critically and from multiple perspectives—including the religions—what it means to be and to live as responsible human beings within the vulnerabilities and complexities of forms of life. When we within our several disciplines respond to this task with all the vitality and resources at our disposal, then, I believe, knowledge will indeed grow from more to more, and life will be increased without the illusions of power or servitude to the tyranny of idols.<br>

Abstract: Excavating Victoriansbrings out very clearly the discomfort the newly discovered vast expanse of geological time gave the Victorians and examines some of the writings that helped shape responses to it. Though the book may not be of particular relevance to the historian focusing closely on Victorian geology or archaeology, for the historian of science who examines wider cultural or literary phenomena it is an important guide to the stimulus that the writings of geologists and archaeologists gave other mid-Victorian writers. Nevertheless, the specialist or narrowly focused historian of science will probably find it frustrating rather than helpful, since the overviews of Victorian geology and archaeology are brief and there are distracting errors, such as the attribution of theNinth Bridgewater Treatiseto William Buckland rather than to Charles Babbage (p. 18). The chapters on Tennyson and Dickens are both interesting and illuminating, although a reader accustomed to historical argument and with limited knowledge of the techniques of literary criticism may find them faintly bewildering in places. Nonetheless, it is in this part of the analysis that the work provides valuable guidance to the historian of science.<br>

Author(s): Franke,  William<br>
Abstract: Franke’s book has considerable merit, but I have a theoretical and a practical concern with his appropriation of negative theology. First, negative theology is never entirely negative, and while Franke recognizes that poetic language is both deconstructive and open, he nevertheless insists that our various theologies—literary or religious—finally have no positive content. Perhaps this is the postmodernism in his negative theology because this is not entirely consistent with the theological tradition. A good counterexample is Pseudo‐Dionysius, whose mystical theology seeks finally to overcome the limitations of both positive and negative speaking. Dionysius insists that God is love in a way that is both negative and positive. On this, Franke should consider the work of Jean‐Luc Marion and especially his response to Jacques Derrida on the subject of negative theology, and this omission is a considerable oversight. Second, many people of various faiths will never accept that their understanding of the transcendent has no positive content, and if this is a precondition for dialogue, then it is unlikely to occur. On this, the practical dimension of Franke’s study needs more development, as well as more traditional examples of poetic and theological openness from contemporary religious life.<br>

            Theodramatik(Einselden: Johannes, 1980), 3:363–78. Von Balthasar’s use of dramatic conceptuality seems to satisfy these demands by offering the Eucharist as a phenomenon that is surprising and free yet deeply imbedded within the economy of creation as a drama. Also of significance would be Bernd Wannenwetsch,Political Worship: Ethics for Christian Citizens, trans. Margaret Kohl (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004).<br>

Abstract: Michaël Lévinas refers here to Blanchot's political activities relating to the Algerian war. Unlike Lévinas who always considered De Gaulle a war hero, Blanchot saw in him the reappearance of fascist leadership. In September 1960 Blanchot was one of the initial drafters and signers of the “Manifeste de 121,” a document articulating its support of those who were being prosecuted for aiding and abbetting the FLN (Le Front de Libération Nationale).<br>

Abstract: It is true, of course, that we have a much harder time postulating an author for
            Adaptation—that is, working out what an “ideal” Kaufman would have wanted the overall effect of his film to be—than postulating an author for the average Hollywood movie. Still, it is surely not the case thatAdaptation“undermines the concept of the author as a unifying origin and legitimation,” as Karen Diehl claims (Karen Diehl, “Once upon an Adaptation: Traces of the Authorial on Film,” inBooks in Motion: Adaptation, Intertextuality, Authorship, ed. Mireia Aragay [Amsterdam, 2005], p. 100). It may be harder to know what Kaufman is up to than what James Cameron (say) is up to, but Kaufman is clearly up tosomething, and the film bears if anything a more powerful stamp of an original vision than that average movie we find easier to read. In fact,Adaptationhas only solidified Kaufman's reputation as a filmmaker with an idiosyncratic and internally consistent way of seeing the world. (Although cinema is a collaborative enterprise, it is reasonable to imagine Spike Jonze and company collectively seeking to realize Kaufman's design.) Far from putting inherited notions of authorship into question, then, it has comfortably positioned Kaufman as the “unifying origin” of his various works.<br>

Abstract: In sum, this is one of the most important books on selves or the practical side of personhood in the last decade. It is also well written; the particular arguments are virtually always clear, and it is not too hard to keep track of their role within in the larger argument of the book. Some portions rise to an almost literary style and provide a rich survey of key ideas in twentieth-century French philosophy, while others engage quite originally with scholarship in moral psychology and theories of self-knowledge that will be more familiar to analytic readers. This work also complements the more detailed ethical theory on Larmore’s other books. Despite its relative inattention to volitional aspects of practical identity, and some questionable moves in the critique of authenticity, then, this work is still highly recommended.<br>

Author(s): LaCocque André<br>
Abstract: The Captivity of Innocencesuccessfully concludes an innovative study of primeval myth in J’s Genesis. Its argument about exilic authorship serves as a springboard for a free and erudite exploration of biblical concerns with name, exile, and the paradoxes of divine-human relations. Very few biblical scholars today can compass this range of biblical, literary, and philosophical literature with such finesse. At a time when biblical studies incorporate a wider range of methods than ever, LaCocque, like Roland Barthes (whom he cites), powerfully combines traditional and more contemporary intellectual paradigms. Advanced students and scholars will find inThe Captivity of Innocencea far-reaching and engaging reading of Genesis 11 by a virtuoso of biblical studies.<br>

Abstract: The text covers a lot of ground, delving into many of the touch points between theology and human rights and endeavoring to demonstrate how those points can be sources of mutual enrichment rather than conflict. At times the comprehensive scope of the text, which draws on the insights of so many, makes it a challenging read and leaves the reader wanting more development and illustration of the fruits of the author’s argument. Overall, the text is an important contribution to the constructive engagement between theology and human rights discourse and is a serious challenge to those in either camp who would peremptorily reject the insights of the other.<br>

Abstract: In sum: while it has it flaws, this book is one of the most comprehensive and up-to-date surveys of the field of theories of religion around. It is worth the cover price for that alone, which makes it definitely recommendable. Those who want to learn about the current state of theory, especially if they tend in the realist direction, will find this book very useful. Constructivists acquainted with theory will likely find it less so.<br>

Abstract: Pablo Wright observes that while I leave behind Geertz’s concept of a cultural system with respect to morality, I retain the Geertzian concern with symbols and meaning. I would not dispute Wright’s statement that meaning is the master concept on a methodological level prior to the substantive issue of evil but would stress that in addition to idiom, code, practice, and symbol, experience must figure into a comprehensive account. Wright’s evocative references to “moral installation in the world” (one might consider terms like investment, suffusion, and tonality, as well as installation) and morality as a “practiced ontology in the micropolitics of social life” deserve further elaboration. Wright endorses a pluralized notion of moralities, but I reiterate that even more important is an adjectival sense of moral rather than the nominal morality. Like Parkin, Wright poses the question of how to reintroduce the ethnographically salient notions of cosmological and radical evil once evil is first construed as a human and intersubjective phenomenon. The answer is to ask how these dimensions come into play in the experiential immediacy of social life, for example, how a cosmological battle between angels and devils is experienced concretely on the human scale. Finally, he suggests that concepts of power from Otto and the shadow from Jung may be alternatives to the notion of evil, though I rejoin that they are just as much in need of critique with respect to Christian overtones. They may be valuable for the study of morality but are not suitable replacements for evil in the sense for which I have argued.<br>

Author(s): Fisher Cass<br>
Abstract: Despite these caveats,
   Contemplative Nationis highly recommended for scholars of Jewish studies, religious studies, philosophy, and theology. The book is an excellent example of how to apply hermeneutical theories to the study of Judaism, how to bridge the gap between continental philosophy and analytic philosophy, and how to expand the scope of Jewish studies by appreciating the nature of theological discourse. While Judaica scholars could use the book in university-level courses, and rabbis could apply its approach to synagogue life, the claim that “Israel” is a “contemplative nation” will hardly resonate with most Jews today. It is very doubtful that the book could “guide the way for [the] future” of the Jewish people’s survival (226), precisely because Jews today are overwhelmingly secular, and the culture in which Jews live, both in Israel and in the Diaspora, is anti-intellectual and antitheological. Furthermore, if Fisher is so keen on Philo, he should have also reminded his readers of the fate of Philo’s enterprise: it was no coincidence that Philo became one of the Church Fathers and that his exegetical/hermeneutical project was not adopted by the tradition that became normative Judaism. When “Israel” denotes a nation of divine contemplators, “carnal Israel” (namely “Israel” as a historical, cultural, and ethnic entity) is marginalized, denigrated, and persecuted. It is true that Jewish religious life is theological, but being Jewish cannot be reduced to contemplating God.<br>

Abstract: Critchley uses the term in a discussion of Levinas and politics. Noting that government tends to become tyrannical when left to itself, Critchley commends the way Levinas’s ethical ideas can cultivate forms of “dissensual emancipatory praxis” that “work against the consensual idyll of the state, not in order to do away with the state or consensus, but to bring about its endless betterment” (“Five Problems in Levinas’s View of Politics,” 183).<br>

Author(s): Peperzak Adriaan T.<br>
Abstract: Peperzak in this book also offers continental thinkers an appealing alternative to the theological turn of phenomenology as practiced by Jean-Luc Marion and others. While Peperzak takes seriously the idea that “God cannot be investigated or explained … because God is not given as a describable phenomenon,” this realization does not turn his phenomenology away from the investigation of rational thinking because for Peperzak reason itself has to be rethought in terms of the intersubjective encounters between nonthematizable—human and divine—sayers (121). Consequently, much more than some of the thinkers of the theological turn, Peperzak’s work maintains a broadly humanist sensibility and a conviction that theological thinking and philosophy can be integrated quite well, provided the latter does not close itself off in autarky. In his humanism, Peperzak echoes the best elements in the philosophical style both of his teacher Paul Ricoeur and the philosophical tradition of his own Catholic faith, although he implicitly critiques the former for insisting too vehemently on the autonomy of philosophy (128) and calls out the latter for separating “natural reason” from faith (182–86). For his own part, Peperzak hopes to maintain an open space between faith and reason: “I do not see any valid argument against the integration of philosophical insights into a faith-inspired theology … neither would I protest if an integrated reflection of the Christian community about its faith would call itself
   philosophia” (160). For the many who share similar sentiments today,Thinking about Thinkingwill make a valuable guide to the conversation of philosophy.<br>

Author(s): Gutterman David S.<br>
Abstract: Ultimately it is at times unclear what is gained in making these comparisons or if such analysis “enhances our understanding of the relationship between religious narratives and politics” (p. 92). What precisely is revealed in grouping these movements together, other than that political crisis invites prophetic criticism? Gutterman carefully unpacks the readings of shared Biblical texts, and he skillfully details contextual and interpretative differences. But one wishes he had gone beyond these descriptive endeavors to construct a more nuanced account of the relationship between religion and politics and, more importantly, of the specifically religious grounds of the activism he examines. While Gutterman can be theoretically deft—in exploring the relation between narrative and politics (p. 21) or garden/wilderness metaphors (p. 47)—he is not fully engaged with the literature on political religion, often citing unrepresentative figures like William Connolly or Stephen Carter. He is a sharp writer with an eye for interesting problems and material. I applaud his engagement with important issues and also the ambition of his thinking. But his central categories require further explication, and this book speaks to the need for more conversations across disciplines.<br>

Abstract: Benjamin also notes: “Every present day is determined by the images that are synchronic with it: each ‘now’ is the now of a particular recognizability. In it, truth is charged to the bursting point with time. (This point of explosion, and nothing else, is the death of the
            intentio, which thus coincides with the birth of authentic historical time, the time of truth.) It is not that what is past casts its light on what is present, or what is present its light on what is past; rather, image is that wherein what has been comes together in a flash with the now to form a constellation” (2002, N3,1). The two great related demands made by T. S. Eliot in “Tradition and the Individual Talent” will also be recalled here: his call for the exercise of the “historical sense” as a juxtaposition of significant events from discontinuous times, which in turn produces an “impersonal” (nonintentional) effect. These demands define the representation of history in works such asThe Waste Landand Pound’s early cantos.<br>

Abstract: Review of Robert D. Romanyshyn's The Wounded Researcher: Research with Soul in Mind, New Orleans, Louisiana: Spring Journal Books, 2007. Robert Romanyshyn has written a treatise on the question of understanding that brings together the fields of phenomenology and depth psychology. Following the thought of C. G. Jung, Romanyshyn has presented an archetypal view of the dilemma of psychological research that he sees as a story of loss, mourning, descent, re-search and homecoming expressed in the mythical image of Orpheus. Going deeper into the actual process of psychological research, Romanyshyn looks to the ancient art of alchemy as providing a model of the attitude and action of imagination that most closely suits psychological life.<br>

Abstract: Christina Rossetti's "Goblin Market" (1862) has garnered seemingly limitless critical interpretation — the goblins' remarkable fruit inviting allegorical readings of the poem that reference, most popularly, Christianity, sexuality, and capitalism. In this essay I read fruit simply as food, situating the poem within the context of food adulteration contemporary with its 1859 composition. Food adulteration was a widespread problem in Victorian England, as increasing numbers of merchants cut flour with alum, doctored curry with mercury, and enhanced the appearance of potted fruits and vegetables with copper and lead. Public alarm regarding this form of fraud reached its height in the 1850s, largely due to the work of an independent Analytical Sanitary Commission, which published its findings in
         The Lancetbetween 1851 and 1854. While Parliament responded to these reports with the formation of a Select Committee in 1855, the popular press responded with articles, tracts, and ballads addressing this pandemic problem. Manuals that instructed consumers how to protect themselves by acquiring the accoutrements of home laboratories proliferated, as did references to adulteration in popular literature. In this essay I read Rossetti's poem as an example of this type of reference. The market of the poem's title, I argue, references a literally contaminated marketplace in which the numbers of people who ate ostensibly nutritious food, only to wither and die in consequence, provoked both governmental and popular alarm.<br>

Abstract: The
         Left Behindnovels by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins have become a major publishing phenomenon in recent years. The novels have succeeded in part because they address the anxieties of their readers, using apocalyptic language to depict a future world in which evildoers are punished, and the faithful reverse the tables on their cultural marginality. The novels, however, also speak to the "here and now," articulating in narrative form the beliefs and actions that place one among either the saved or the damned. The novels accomplish this through the issuance of marks. Both believers and the followers of Antichrist have distinctive marks, which prove less than reliable. At stake, ultimately, is an evangelicalism open to the ambiguity and uncertainty of contemporary life, and a reactive fundamentalism that insists, metaphorically, on the rigidity of marks—a quest for certainty ill-advised in a world characterized by relentless change.*<br>

Abstract: The L.D.S Church's use of commemorative rituals and narrative history to simultaneously adapt and maintain identity is not unique, but it is uniquely available to analysis because of the immediacy of the change and the Saints' devotion to record-keeping. Thus, the drama of LDS survival during the Progressive Era illuminates age-old religious strategies for adaptation to social norms, which strategies preserve the faithful's confidence in the timelessness of their god's moral and ecclesiastical order. More narrowly, these events in American church history are critical for understanding how the civilly disobedient Saints finally accepted the rule of federal law without losing their religion.<br>

Abstract: Using data from an ethnographic study of
         tarot divination, occult claims to knowledge are analyzed and interpreted. Attention is focused on theproceduresparties to occult divination employ to claim and sustain what they regard as extraordinary knowledge. This view of occult knowledge stands opposed to efforts to discredit occult claims as unscientific or the result of psychosocial conditions like deprivation and marginality. Like knowledge in general, occult knowledge is a product of sociohistorical influences, interactional negotiation, and interpretation. The challenge for sociology therefore is the pursuit of the social interactional and historical processes whereby knowledge and interpretation are accomplished in everyday life.<br>

Abstract: It is argued that autobiographical texts, such as life-historical interviews, provide the richest possible source of information about a person's temporality and a culture's historical past. It is proposed that time-consciousness can be inferred from such texts. To this end, ethnographic and other studies of Australian Aboriginal time-consciousness were used to construct a seven-part model of patterned-cyclical time-consciousness. Turning these seven attributes of patterned-cyclical time-consciousness into their opposites yields seven features of one-dimensional, ordinary-linear time-consciousness, thereby establishing a structured temporal polarity. A lexical-level, content-analytic methodology, Neurocognitive Hierarchical Categorization Analysis (NHCA), is introduced, in which folk-concepts of time from
         Roget's International Thesauruswere used to construct wordlist indicators for 9 of the 14 definitional components. Then, using NHCA for a comparative analysis of texts consisting of life-historical interviews, earlier results of an empirical study were brieflv re-presented. Australian Aborigines, compared to Euro-Australian controls, used a significantly smaller proportion of words for an index of ordinary-linear time but a higher proportion of words for an index of patterned-cyclical time, indicating a time-consciousness that is primarily patterned-cyclical rather than linear. Females were less linear and more patterned-cyclical than males in both cultures. These cross-cultural results contribute predictive validity to the proposed polarity of time-consciousness. Implications for the culture-and-cognition paradox and its resolution in dual-brain theory are addressed.<br>

Abstract: This article combines a narrative approach on life histories, inspired by Paul Ricoeur, with the symbolic interactionist approaches of George Herbert Mead and Erving Goffman. It focuses on "negotiations" in qualitative interviews with alcoholics, that is, narrative sequences in which the interviewee's line comes into conflict with the line of the interviewer. From a larger study of drinking careers among alcoholics in Copenhagen, two interviews are singled out for a more detailed analysis. The two interviewees did not live up to the (implicit) expectations of the study: the presumptions (a) that persons contacted at institutions for heavily addicted alcoholics do indeed identify themselves as alcoholics and (b) that alcoholics are interested in structuring their life histories according to the development of their drinking problems. By struggling to defend an alternative identity for themselves than the one the interviewer had in readiness for them, the interviewees laid bare the (problematic) therapeutic framework of the study.<br>

Abstract: Sociology and neighboring disciplines have produced different analytic tools to examine the dialogical relationship between individuals and society ("narrative work," "identity work," "moral career," "moral breakdown"). However, the question of how individuals negotiate the interpretation of personal experience over their lifetimes in a changing cultural context remains unexplored. This article introduces narrative elasticity as a feature of narrative work and as a time-sensitive analytic tool for conducting inquiries into processes of temporal retraction and expansion of what storytellers conceive as the normal order of significance. The application of this tool to the analysis of mature and elderly Chileans' life stories shows how cultural change occurs at the individual level, considers factors that motivate and inhibit processes of reinterpretation of personal experience, and identifies different levels at which it operates.<br>

Abstract: The numerous changes and improvements which have been wrought in teacher education courses in the last two decades have not, apparently, satisfied the critics. Ironically, the reverse seems to have occurred, as recent events on both sides of the Atlantic testify. This essay argues that the developments of the last two decades in educational research and teacher education, which have yielded a wealth of new ideas and procedures, have also yielded a confusing proliferation of educational ideologies. In short, it suggests that the ascendancy of a diffuse, unselfcritical, and often combative discourse within educational studies has effectively eclipsed the more important question which must first be tackled if educational studies are to have a coherent, robust focus. This question, which is pursued in the second section of the paper, asks: is the educational enterprise, properly conceived, a distinctive, autonomous or sui generis enterprise with purposes of its own which are universal, or is it essentially a subservient enterprise, a vehicle for one or other currently prevailing ideology (cultural, technological, political, religious, etc.)? In exploring this question the essay puts to work some enduring insights from contemporary European philosophy, arguing that education as a 'practical hermeneutic discipline' holds a singular promise. Some important consequences of this promise for educational studies and teacher education are then considered.<br>

Abstract: Buell's view in The Environmental Imagination can serve to epitomize the prevailing
consensus: "Thoreau is often thought of as Emerson's earthy opposite. But it would be
truer to imagine him as moving gradually, partially, and self-conflictedly beyond the pro-
gram Emerson outlined in Nature, which sacralized nature as humankind's mystic coun-
terpart .... Thoreau became increasingly interested in defining nature's structure, both
spiritual and material, for its own sake, as against how nature might subserve humanity,
which was Emerson's primary consideration" (117)<br>

Abstract: This article discusses how T. S. Eliot's long poem, Four Quartets, employs the thematics of time, self, and history in an autobiographical work of literature. The article approaches autobiography primarily as an intellectual concern, rather than as a factual account of the author's life, in examining a work that is difficult to subsume under available interpretive paradigms. The first part of the article emphasizes how Augustine's Confessions, when considered as a meditation on time and religious experience, illuminates the hermeneutics of Four Quartets. The second and central part of the article provides close readings of key passages in this poem, which inscribes Greek cosmology and medieval epic in a narrative of literary development and spiritual change. The third and concluding part of the article explores how the author's later poetry and criticism highlight major tendencies in twentieth-century literature and anticipate the postmodern interpretation of history. / تعالج هذه المقالة قصيدة ﺇﻟﻴﻮﺕ الطويلة أربع رباعيات من منطلق جديد وبالرجوع إلى تيمات الزمن والذات والتاريخ في السيرة الذاتية الأدبية٠ وتتعامل المقالة مع السيرة الذاتية لا باعتبارها سجلاﹰ لما جرى في حياة صاحبها من أحداث، بل ابعتبارها سجلاﹰ مضمراﹰ للتطور الذهني لكاتبها٠ يقوم الجزء الأول من المقالة بتوظيف البعد ﺍﻟﺘﺄﻣﻠﻲ في الزمن وفي التجربة الدينية كما ورد عند القديس أوغسطين في سيرته الذاتية الاعترافات، لإضاءة المدار التأويلي لقصيدة أربع رباعيات٠ ويقوم الجزء الثاني بتحليل مقاطع رئيسية في القصيدة، مبرزاﹰ ما تتضمنه وما تلوّح به من معتقدات كونية إغريقية وملاحم وسيطية٠ أما الجزء الثالث والأخير فيتوصل إلى أن ذهنية إليوت، بالإضافة إلى كونها تعكس التوجه العام للأدب في القرن العشرين، تمهد للتفسير ما بعد الحداثي للتاريخ٠<br>

Abstract: This article is concerned with the ways in which women narrate a move from a 'working-class' position to a position marked (in however fragmentary and complex a way) as 'middle class'. While such a move might be seen in terms of a straightforward escape from a disadvantaged social position, I argue here that what has to be analysed is the pain and the sense of estrangement associated with this class movement. Drawing on the class narratives of a group of seven white British women, the article uses Bourdieu's concepts of symbolic capital and habitus to explore the cultural and symbolic configurations of class. These configurations may be inscribed into the self, so that the self, itself, is class marked. Since working-class selves are frequently marked in pathological terms, this raises particular difficulties for the idea of an 'escape' from such a position. Class in this sense is embedded in people's history and so cannot be so easily 'escaped'. The usual conventions of life-narratives - in which the self remains the same entity from birth to death and later events are a culmination of earlier ones - are also disrupted in this case. But if a working-class position is marked as pathological, so too is taking on the markers of middle-class existence. to do so is not only to risk 'getting it wrong', but it is also to risk the scorn attached to 'pretentiousness'. There is a particular jeopardy here for women, since it is women who have been especially associated with desires for artefacts associated with bourgeois existence. The article argues for a focus for classed desires and class envy, not in pathological terms, but in terms of a coherent response to political and social exclusions.<br>

Abstract: Considered rhetorically, or by phenomenological-literary analysis, the saying about finding one's life by losing it intends to break up the continuity of existence of the hearer to the extent that he or she is left without a frame of reference. Considered from a historical-literary point of view, however, the saying occurs in an environment and presupposes a context which gives meaning to the response. A Whiteheadian or process perspective of interpretation offers an approach which can relate these two types of understanding of the saying, and can also cast light on contemporary styles of interpretation with their ontological presuppositions, either to set the saying in a framework of "rightness" or in one of "creativity."<br>

Abstract: In recent years, the need for a critique of "reader" as rigorous as that which has been developed for "text" and for "author" has become increasingly acute. Whether in the study of religion as story and biography or in interpretative reading in general, a critical notion of reader is essential if the act of reading is to be anything other than mere consumption of texts. Some new way of understanding the hermeneutical circle is required to avert the narcissism latent in the Anselmian model. The notion of "genre" as developed by four recent theorists is helpful in the task of constructing a critique of "reader." E. D. Hirsch, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Tzvetán Todorov, and Paul Ricoeur have each surpassed the idealist notion of genre as a classificatory device and developed in its place the notion of genre as a generative pinciple. Todorov, for example, illustrates how "form" is a theoretical, as distinct from a descriptive or explanatory, issue. According to both Hirsch and Todorov, somewhere between empirical details and metaphysical thematizations lie generic formulations which can assist the reader to organize his/her response to the text and to recognize the probable understanding toward which the conventions of the text are directed. In Gadamer's theory of interpretation, the notion of genre acquires historicity. After Gadamer, genres can no longer be regarded as timeless a priori categories. Rather, because they are constituted by historical reflections, their rise and decline are intrinsic to text-interpretation. Finally, in Ricoeur's theory that generic considerations are correlative principles of production and interpretation, we find a basis for understanding genre as praxis. If we understand reading to be isomorphic to authoring, it becomes clear that the reader can no longer be regarded as the self-evident recipient of text-signification. Genre, in Ricoeur's theory, transforms "speech" into a "work" and points toward a new notion of "reader" as one whose reconstruction of the text is the condition for the possibility of its being a story that "gives life." This notion of "reader" makes possible a new model of the hermeneutical circle-one which signifies the essential roles of critical thought which follows naive reading and of informed understanding which follows after thought.<br>

Abstract: The focus of contemporary studies in religion on methodology can be explored as the recognition of a fundamental epistemological problem. This paper is first an acknowledgment that we do not have an adequate conceptuality to render intelligible inward turning and then an experiment with the meaning of intelligibility. The dispossession of consciousness as the sole place and origin of meaning constituting an intellectual aporia is presented as an experience of the subversion of the subject by the discovery of the unconscious in depth psychologies and the discovery of the transcendence of the subject in foundational theologies. Taking account of this duplex expression of what lingers in disguise behind the scripts of ordinary life is defined as a fundamental exigency in the further development of human understanding and theological reflection.<br>

Abstract: Recent study of the nature of textuality as such opens new insights for the study of the Bible. Although individual parts of the Bible have oral antecedents, the Bible as a whole has existed only as a text, and a unique kind of text, folded back on itself out of communal memory as no other book has been. A text is a monument. Textuality establishes a special relationship between discourse and death. Spoken words are exchanges between living persons. The text presents its message as well if its author is dead as it does if he or she is alive. Print is even more bound to death than writing is. In comparison with oral performance-delivery of an oration, song-a text physically has certain special alliances with past time. All texts come out of the past. Literature as text is psychologically retrospective: its effects typically include an element of nostalgia. Because of its future orientation, culminating in the closing words of Revelation, "Come, Lord Jesus" (as against typical narrative closes such as "They lived happily ever after"), the Bible has an unusual relationship to textuality: it is not literature in the way other texts are. Typical narrative plot structures existence retrospectively: the story is organized back from the conclusion. This retrospective organization is maximized by writing, which tightens plot and makes more of re-cognition, a kind of return to the beginning (the past) and hence a cyclic pattern. In addition to being related intimately to death, writing and print are also limitlessly fecund, the central forces in the evolution of consciousness, once they appear. The fecundity of writing and print, like other fecundity in human existence, is achieved by passage through death. "Unless the grain of wheat dies." The Word of God in the Person of Jesus Christ is conceived of by analogy with the spoken word. The Father speaks the Word, the Son (eo verbum quo filius); he does not write the Word, who would then by biblical attestation be not life but death: "The letter kills, but the spirit [pneuma, breath, producer of speech] gives life." The Son passes through death to resurrected life. The written text, also God's word, must also be resurrected-by interpretation, by being inserted into the lifeworld of living persons. Hermeneutics is resurrection and in common Christian teaching demands faith. Study of the textuality of the Bible-which presumes but is not the same as study of the text of the Bible-opens many new theological questions and / or gives new contours to old questions.<br>

Abstract: The legend is, as custum, the place were the principle of reality is suspended: "the place were day-dreaming is allowed". Actually, in the current practice, the use of this fabulous space/instrument crosses ambits officially destinated to the reverie. Fragments of legend impregnate the entire experience allowing us the most shameless alchemy. If we consider the "legendary" in its pragmatic implications and pass through the question: "what do we do, in the every day life, when we evoke in a more or less explicit way the semantic constellation linked with the notion of legend?", then the "legendary" is not so much the "projective place" where we live for a moment our phantasies, but rather an operation that allows to reconcile concrete interests and ideal values, playing on the demarcation line and mixing up cards skilfully.<br>

Abstract: Creativity is seen as inherent in the developmental potential of the individual and of society as well. This "yen for becoming" is felt at all ages, and is in fact recognized as associated with the realization of the profoundest aspirations of man. Its origin is detected in early childhood. It is deeply rooted in the associative trend of thought and action, a trend which tends to perpetuate itself in the direction of unending abundance and novelty. The process assumes passage from awareness to memory, and even to the subconscious. The thought of the moment dips into the past, awakens memories, even those seemingly forgotten, reactivates all that is pertinent for the creation of new structures. It is believed that this tendency is essentially dynamic, endowed with energy which drives toward endless realizations. Nothing dies in the subconscious, as Freud pointed out. Each past experience is apt to return into consciousness and engage in a double process of homogenization and heterogenization, of convergent and divergent currents. Here the combinations, or commutations and permutations, are indefinite, an array which defies any computer. Creativity calls into play all energized experiences, present and stored, cognitive and affective, perceptual and conceptual, sensory and motoric, verbal and non-verbal, taxonomic and functional, real and symbolic; it constantly provokes new patterns. The richer the content of experience, the greater the possibility of innovation. The creative construction starts with the activation of readily available knowledge, the elements of which trigger related material in the memory and the subconscious. The movement is derived from active associations that continue to connect the units, and is oriented toward specific goals, leading to eventual syntheses, which may be expressed in either action or discourse. Here we face an unfurling, which coincides with interpretation, the unlocking of the new meaning built from the past upon the first meaning. This event, really never-ending, is a basic condition of life; it stimulates the spirit in a posture of perpetual emergence.<br>

Abstract: À une époque où l'on dit des jeunes qu'ils sont dépolitisés, nous nous sommes interrogés sur l'éducation politique des jeunes Québécois. Cet aspect de leur éducation est analysé à partir de la documentation du ministère de l'Éducation et à partir d'entrevues et de questionnaires distribués dans des écoles primaires, secondaires et des Cégeps de la région de Québec. La grande majorité des étudiants du collégial et du secondaire que nous avons interrogés disent s'intéresser à la politique. Par contre, leurs professeurs soutiennent que ces derniers ne s'y intéressent pas d'une façon soutenue. Quoiqu'il en soit, les étudiants ne semblent pas très bien connaître le système politique canadien. Les auteurs de cet article suggèrent d'améliorer l'apprentissage du civisme par des activités de sensibilisation et d'implication dans la vie de l'école. /// Many believe contemporary youth are apolitical. We have chosen to assess this belief by studying the political education of Quebec youth. Ministry of Education documents, and interviews and questionnaires from elementary and secondary schools and CEGEPS of the Quebec City region, showed the great majority of CEGEP and secondary school students claimed to be interested in politics. Their teachers, however, say that student interest is not always sustained. Certainly students do not know the Canadian political system very well. Improved civic education requires that schools introduce pupils to political life and involve them in school life.<br>

Abstract: Anecdotal evidence suggests that many qualitative researchers have had the experience of discovering that their informants had told them lies. This is quite different to those instances where faulty memory, subjective perception, partial or erroneous knowledge, a desire to give the researcher what they think they want, or even where a 'personal myth' comes in to play, because a lie is a conscious and deliberate intention to deceive. What should researchers do when they discover that they have been misled? What are the implications for qualitative methodology and its practitioners in the light of the criteria for good practice outlined in the Tooley Report? This article draws on two examples of informants who lied, in order to explore some of the questions and issues that can arise. It suggests, tentatively, that generic criteria may not always be sufficiently sensitive to cope with complexities of social life.<br>

Abstract: The article describes and analyses the recruitment and training of young Zambians in the 1990s for Catholic religious Brotherhood. The consequences of the missionary employment of Euro-American concepts of personhood and self that involve particular understandings of narrative and the use of psychological testing are explored. The author argues that Zambian understandings of personhood and of individual experience of evil and suffering are silenced in the process of religious formation. This discussion raises salient issues about training for Catholic religious or priestly life in Africa because similar techniques have been commonly employed throughout the continent.<br>

Abstract: This paper is a reflection on the boundaries of academic discourse as I came to be acutely aware of them while attempting to teach a graduate seminar in qualitative research methods. The purpose of the readings in Husserl and Schutz and the writing exercises was to assist students trained in quantitative methods and steeped in positivistic assumptions about research to write phenomenological descriptions of lived experience. "Paul" could not write the assigned papers due to a diagnosed writing "disability" but he did submit fictional stories and sketches which beautifully illustrated the concepts of Husserl and Schutz. Paul's disability presented a natural "bracketing" experiment which brought the positivistic assumptions surrounding academic research and writing to the forefront. I engaged in verbal dialogues with Paul, in which he discussed the philosophical ideas. My work with Paul highlighted the extent to which the academic lifeworld marginalizes those who seek to write from the heart, disguising even the work of those philosophers who wish to uncover direct experiences.<br>

Abstract: Two philosophical traditions with much in common, (classical) pragmatism and (Heidegger's) hermeneutic philosophy, are here compared with respect to their approach to the philosophy of science. Both emphasize action as a mode of interpreting experience. Both have developed important categories -- inquiry, meaning, theory, praxis, coping, historicity, life-world -- and each has offered an alternative to the more traditional philosophies of science stemming from Descartes, Hume, and Comte. Pragmatism's "abduction" works with the dual perspectives of theory (as explanation) and praxis (as culture). The hermeneutical circle depends in addition on the lifeworld as background source of ontological meaning and resource for strategies of inquiry. Thus a hermeneutical philosophy of research involves three components: lifeworld (as ontological and strategic), theory (as explanatory), and praxis (as constitutive of culture).<br>

Abstract: Working-class people perform class identities. These performances are marked with ironies in which working class symbolizes power and powerlessness. Such performances elide linear meaning-making in favor of poetic paradox and help us understand the contradictions of working-class life. "The New Deal," a chapbook by my great-grandfather, represents an occasion for understanding how one working-class person used language to consider his life's contradictions. The chapbook articulates a unique "working-class poetics" and suggests why rhetoricians ought to locate representations of the paradoxes of working-class life.<br>

Abstract: This article offers an anti-naturalist philosophical critique of the naturalist tendencies within qualitative concept formation as developed most prominently by Giovanni Sartori and David Collier. We begin by articulating the philosophical distinction between naturalism and anti-naturalism. Whereas naturalism assumes that the study of human life is not essentially different from the study of natural phenomena, anti-naturalism highlights the meaningful and contingent nature of social life, the situatedness of the scholar, and so the dialogical nature of social science. These two contrasting philosophical approaches inspire, in turn, different strategies of concept formation. Naturalism encourages concept formation that involves reification, essentialism, and an instrumentalist view of language. Anti-naturalism, conversely, challenges reified concepts for eliding the place of meanings, essentialist concepts for eliding the place of contingency, and linguistic instrumentalism for eliding the situatedness of the scholar and the dialogical nature of social science. Based on this philosophical framework, we subject qualitative concept formation to a philosophical critique. We show how the conceptual strategies developed by Sartori and Collier embody a reification, essentialism, and instrumentalist view of language associated with naturalism. Although Collier's work on concept formation is much more flexible and nuanced than Sartori's, it too remains attached to a discredited naturalism.<br>

Abstract: This article offers an alternative to classical hermeneutics, which focuses on discursive products and grasps meaning as the play of difference between linguistic signs. Pragmatist hermeneutics reconstructs meaning through an indefinite triangulation, which brings symbols, icons, and indices to bear on each other and considers a meaningful occasion as an embodied semiotic process. To illuminate the word-body-action nexus, the discussion identifies three basic types of signifying media: (1) the symbolic-discursive, (2) the somatic-affective, and (3) the behavioral-performative, each one marked by a special relationship between signs and their objects. An argument is made that the tension between various type-signifying media is unavoidable, that the pragmatic-discursive misalignment is an ontological condition, and that bridging the gap between our discursive, affective, and behavioral outputs is at the heart of ethical life.<br>

Abstract: In Sumatra's Angkola Batak culture, rituals celebrating major kinship-related events such as marriage have many layers of social and symbolic meaning; they have political, kinship, musical, mythic, and philosophical dimensions as lengthy, oratory-filled ceremonies that unite wife-giving lineages with wife-receivers. This article examines several ways that the interpretive approach that is discussed in the introduction can help students of Indonesian ritual grasp diverse aspects of Batak marriage rituals such as their hidden symbolic organization and their practical political implications. The article deals with a short sequence of adat dance staged for anthropological research purposes. (Adat, once translated as customary law, roughly means Angkola ceremonial life, kinship norms, and political thought; adat is eminently flexible, redefined by each Batak generation.) The choreography of the dance (wife-receivers dancing with wife-givers), songs, clothing, the political biographies of the participants, and the fact that the event was staged render the ceremony open to both structural and social contextual inquiry.<br>

Abstract: In "The Magic Mountain," the only literary text by Thomas Mann in which German anti-Semitism is an object of satire, it remains uncertain whether a number of individuals are to be considered Jewish, or not. These uncertainties are symptomatic of the novel's protracted genesis, and especially of Thomas Mann's lifelong, historically and biographically conditioned efforts to distance himself from the anti-Semitic typologies evident in his early work. The most prominent of the relevant individuals in "The Magic Mountain," Dr. Krokowski, exemplifies this phenomenon. The various characteristics attributed to Krokowski evoke the continuing memory of a literary figure through whom Thomas Mann had previously only intended to relieve his anti-Semitic resentments. Thus Krokowski has a dual significance, representing Thomas Mann's early anti-Semitism and his later and vigorous, but nevertheless not entirely successful, attempts to overcome it.<br>

Abstract: In this paper I try to show what kind of theory Giddens' theory of structuration is. I do so by first listing what Giddens accepts and what he rejects in his assessments of functionalism, hermeneutics, structuralism, and the writings of Marx. For what I think are good reasons, most of this part is given over to the use Giddens makes of Gadamer's hermeneutic philosophy. Next I set out my understanding of Giddens' view of theory as primarily concerned "with reworking conceptions of human being and human doing, social reproduction and social transformation" (Giddens 1984:xx). I seek to show the crucial implications of this for the way that theory enters directly into and helps to consitute social life. Taken together, these two steps lead to the conclusion that Giddens' theory is neither an attempt at an over-arching "Grand Theory," nor an imposition of new orthodoxy in place of the old. Instead I suggest that his avowed eclecticism is closely akin to the hermeneutic goal contained in Gadamer's concept of the "fusion of horizons." This notion recognizes the never-to-be-completed, but basic, human activity of creatively questioning what has been handed down from the past. It is questioned so that it may be applied — incomplete as it is — to the changed situation of the present with its different interests and problems. That those who can and do question it are themselves the products of past tradition, calls for a kind of social theory that is in some ways different from that modeled on the explanatory "laws" of natural science. I contend that Giddens' theory of structuration is such a theory. (For an introductory overview of the theory itself, see Dickie-Clark, 1984).<br>

Abstract: In recent years, sociologists and anthropologists have conducted significant studies of modern life using concepts and perspectives derived from symbolic anthropology. This paper discusses the theoretical and methodological problems entailed, including the distinction between symbolic and nonsymbolic actions. Research on three major areas of behavior is reviewed: (a) studies of institutions, especially politics, law, and social control; (b) studies of ceremonial events, including life-cycle rituals, sports, and festivals; and (c) studies of everyday life, including consumer goods and food, and popular culture. We conclude with a discussion of the methodological issues of location and dimensionality and the different forms of symbolic analysis.<br>

Abstract: In many parts of the world, excavations of British military sites have unearthed material reflecting lifeways in the British Empire. Specifically, studies of historical ceramics and glass have greatly advanced our understanding of status and material expression. This study highlights the current body of knowledge on British military crested ceramics, contrasting the rarity of archaeological finds with their abundance in documentary sources. An elemental stylistic analysis reveals that these crests expressed regimental affiliation as the fundamental unit of self-identification. Symbolic interpretation of these crests stresses their active role in the socialization of officers and structuring collective memory, particularly through the mess institution.<br>

Abstract: This paper suggests Charles Reznikoff's poetry should be assessed in its relation to the Jewish hermeneutical tradition. Philosopher Paul Ricœur's quotation in the title, "the very deciphering of life in the mirror of the text," sums up Reznikoff's poetical strategy. He decontextualizes his writing by displacing it towards its hypotextual origin, Jewish and non-Jewish. Reading destabilizes the reader who embraces the poetical text in the mirror of its hypotexts. This move metaphorically takes reading and writing away from their familiar American grounds and paves the way for an ethics of perambulation.<br>

Abstract: This essay is a comparative study of the tributes paid to the American philosopher John Rawls, in France and the United States, after his death in November 2010. Whereas in the U.S. tributes to Rawls appeared in scholarly journals, in France they did in political magazines and general interest media. Besides, the focus in U.S. journals on Rawls's philosophical commitments is at odds with the emphasis placed by the French media on the political interpretations of his theory of justice. The contrast between Rawls's French and U.S. "funerals" is a consequence of the way intellectual fields in France and the U.S. differ in their relation to politics. While Rawls conformed with what was expected of him in the American academia by staying away from politics almost all his life, he was seen in France as an intellectuel engagé, the typical figure of intellectual life since the Dreyfus case. The contrast between the French and American reactions to Rawls's death is also related to the fact that those who first got interested in his theory of justice in France were supporters of the anti-totalitarian left or center-right, rather than academic philosophers.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur distills this point well: "When we discover that there are
several cultures instead of just one and consequently at the time when we acknowledge
the end of a sort of cultural monopoly, be it illusory or real, we are threatened with the
destruction of our own discovery. Suddenly it becomes possible that there are just
others, that we ourselves are an 'other' among others" (History and Truth [Evanston,
Ill., 1965], p. 278).

Abstract: The work of literary structuralists, particularly Roland Barthes, provides sharper insights into ethnomethodology than symbolic interactionism, labeling theory, or phenomenology. Further, it suggests that the metaphor of text may be fruitful for analysts of everyday life. Greater theoretical benefits derive from that metaphor, however, if one applies it using the ideas of literary theorists outside the structuralist tradition.<br>

Abstract: The first part of the article discusses the usefulness of the biographical method in order to solve some epistemological crucial issues: the integration between comprehension and explanation, the possibility of an objective (or at least intersubjective) knowledge, the overcoming of the micro-macro dicothomy. The second part holds the utility of such a method in order to study the reflexive post-modern society and especially the contribution intellectuals can offer to the post-modern culture. Results from recent empirical research are discussed. The last part-though recognizing some methodological problems linked with life stories — stresses flexibility and openess as the main virtues of this method.<br>

Abstract: The article identifies a paradox in the concept of person and in its use. Modernity, and the liberation from the logic of status, should have brought about the ultimate consolidation of the idea of personal value. On the contrary it caused such a drastic functional differentiation within society that the individual has come to be defined by his/her function (citizen, economic actor, etc.) rather than as the single bearer of different roles. The concept of person has thus become an expression to identify only the communicative aspect of social life. That is the reason why in our complex society the concept of person cannot find a proper location and comes to the fore only when the other codes fail.<br>

Abstract: This article draws on ethnographic examples to examine how rural Maya-speakers in the Mexican state of Yucatán ground the experience of identity politics in quotidian engagements with pre-Hispanic objects and utterances in the Maya language. My argument is intended as a revision of models of critical scholarship that have been influenced by poststructuralism and that place an overwhelming emphasis on discourse as a modality through which politically viable identities are created and performed. Specific examples show how vernacular multiculturalism is shaped by the agency of forms of language use and physical objects that have been a part of local life-worlds long before the popularization of Mayan identity politics. This offers some potentials for collaborative work that have not been fully explored in poststructural critiques of representation. L'auteur s'appuie sur des exemples ethnographiques pour étudier la manière dont les locuteurs du maya vivant dans les zones rurales de l'état mexicain du Yucatán fondent leur expérience de la politique identitaire sur une interaction quotidienne avec les objets et énoncés préhispaniques de la langue maya. Son argumentation se veut une remise en cause des modèles universitaires critiques influencés par le poststructuralisme, qui mettent lourdement l'accent sur le discours en tant que modalité permettant de créer et de réaliser des identités politiquement viables. Des exemples concrets montrent comme un multiculturalisme vernaculaire se constitue par l'action des formes d'usage du langage et des objets matériels qui faisaient partie de la vie locale longtemps avant que la politique identitaire maya se popularise. Cette approche offre un potentiel de travail en collaboration qui n'a pas été complètement exploré par les critiques poststructuralistes de la représentation.<br>

Abstract: Death and futility are among a cluster of themes that closely track discussions of life's meaning. Moreover, futility is thought to supervene on naturalistic meta-narratives because of how they will end. While the nature of naturalistic meta-narrative endings is part of the explanation for concluding that such meta-narratives are cosmically or deeply futile, this explanation is truncated. I argue that the reason the nature of the ending is thought to be normatively important is first anchored in the fact that narrative ending qua ending is thought to be normatively important. Indeed, I think futility is often thought to characterize naturalistic meta-narratives because a narrative's ending has significant proleptic power to elicit a wide range of broadly normative human responses on, possibly, emotional, aesthetic, and moral levels towards the narrative as a whole.<br>

Abstract: This paper offers a discussion of contemporary theories of moral development. At present, these theories are at odds regarding the origins of morality. One camp has proposed a cognitive basis, while the other claims that morality consists in affectivity. Both these positions are discussed, and a third alternative is proposed for their resolution, based upon the model of the subject within communicative relations, whose life involves constructing reality through social procedures with others. This model is described and contrasted with the model of the self-reflecting individual which seems to underlie most current theories. In addition, a number of studies are reviewed in order to show more clearly how this third alternative provides insight into the social basis of moral judgment. Throughout the paper, two themes remain central: (a) that rationality can be considered to result from consensual validation which is obtained through communication; and (b) that sense of community, the grounds for moral action, is not incompatible with establishing or maintaining one's own individual identity.<br>

Abstract: Building on 25 months of fieldwork in eastern Germany from 1991 to 2003, this article explores the interpenetration of aesthetics and politics, and questions them as theoretical categories. A multilayered description depicts aesthetic perception and action, guided by an imagery of façade, as constituted and reproduced by state policies, positioned experiences, and subversive responses. Moving beyond the Cold War legacy, aesthetics' potency and politicization is dated back to early nation building and Protestant and Romantic influences. Being essential to and controlled by shifting, largely authoritarian regimes, aesthetics simultaneously provided a 'shadow life' and a 'lingua franca', cross-cutting verbal and non-verbal mediums and everyday and high culture, as people juggled with, distrusted, and decoded surfaces, expressing and in search of deeper, hidden truths. I argue that historically generated aesthetic perceptions and praxis not only mark east German political culture but also emerge in Habermas's public sphere theory and, moreover, offer arguments to revise it.<br>

Abstract: This article proposes using the theoretical discussions of Deleuze and Guattari as a means of comprehending the various ways in which individuals speak about their ethnic identity. This is done through a case study of a state-run educational boarding school offered to subjects identified as 'ethnic' in Israel. The findings expose two ways of talking about ethnic identity: 'minor language' and 'major language'. What I term the 'major language of ethnicity' makes substantial use of state language and offers two hierarchical categories that serve as an archetype for classifying groups. The 'minor language of ethnicity', on the other hand, offers multiple local identifications and potential identity alternatives. The article suggests using dynamics at the foundation of these concepts to consider the position of the researcher and to expose existential 'lines of flight' and life inventions of subjects in everyday life.<br>

Abstract: This article explores socio-cultural practices with regard to aging women in Vārāṇāsī, a city in North India. It is based on 17 months of field research carried out in 1999—2000 among marginalized Hindu women. I argue that aging is a continuous process that is characterized by the specific psychological patterns that form throughout a woman's life history. These patterns are demonstrated by women's particular types of behaviors and demeanors and, in turn, permit others to ascribe to them—in varying combinations and ratios—specific cultural values or qualities. I argue that these attributes are the critical ones that inform the cultural construction and designation of being 'middle-aged' and 'older' as it pertains to Hindu women of Vārāṇāsī.<br>

Abstract: This essay suggests Friedrich Nietzsche has a contribution to make to the theoretical enterprise of social science. Contemporary theorizing, reflecting an increased attention to language, has been focusing on the dialogical mode of production and, of course, on hermeneutics. This has led to a renewal of interest in Friedrich Nietzsche. In this essay, two alternative models of the hermeneutic circle are examined: one arising out of the work of the school of Konstanz; the other associated primarily with the work of Juergen Habermas. The former presents a circular image of the "conversational" situation; the latter portrays a time schedule of the process based on the psychoanalytic process of therapy. Nietzsche's contributions are suggested to be significant, in the first model, in regard to the mode of production and, in the second, the stage of the quasi-naturalistic turn. Nietzsche's way to truth is through constant and relentless criticizing. In contrast to the rationalistic practices of Western philosophy, Nietzsche exercised an art of interpreting based on the use of metaphor and aphorism. This practice seems to reflect Nietzsche's concern to communicate truth in a world he saw as inherently ambiguous and dynamic, thus, rendering propositional truth impossible. Nietzsche radically challenges the rational foundations on which we stand. Thus he presents us with a mode of knowledge production that reclaims traditions lost to science. In addition, Nietzsche shows, by word and example, that his existential approach offers a way to see life as a text and source for quasi-naturalistic forays toward understanding. In this way Nietzsche shows that the traditional concept of knowledge is a pseudo-concept by revealing the intimate and inseparable connection between life and knowledge. Knowledge is rooted in life; it is a manifestation of concrete psychological and political realities. Consequently, it makes sense not to ignore life as a source for explanation when examining resources for re-establishing communication when the hermeneutic circle breaks down in a moment of misunderstanding.<br>

Abstract: Jaspers' thesis (while rejecting the claim of philosophers of the Western tradition to universal validity and Truth, yet conceding that their metaphysical systems express an awareness of Being) is as follows: "Reality is neither the object nor the subject, but that which encompasses both, the Encompassing which is illuminated in the division between subject and object"; He — the One God — is Encompassing and the greatest closeness which has its place within the inwardness of man". The whole inquiry leads Jaspers to claim that the existential self is rooted in Transcendence and the ground of all things lies in the real ization of the existential self in freedom in which eternity and time coalesce. In this freedom time — far from being the "moving image of eternity" — becomes the actual scene of the existential self's moral striving with the forces of this world, and by seizing the cipher (= the language of Transcendence) as the symbol of Transcendence, the existential self achieves authentic existence, thus endowing the historical process of time with unique and ultimate meaning. 1) Reason: It is because of reason with which God has endowed man that any content of a pretended revelation possesses any self-evidencing power: "In diesem Menschwerden durch Vernunft wird das Eine der Transzendenz fühlbar dem Einen der jeweils geschichtlichen Existenz". Yet by abandoning belief in universal Truth we become open for Truth, realised and determined in its concrete historic form for each individual by means of communication. Communication therefore becomes "the universal condition of man's being". It follows that Truth cannot be separated from communicability. It only appears in time as a realitythrough-communication so much so "that I can not even become myself alone without emerging out of my being with others". Now the element in which existential communication lives and moves and has its spiritual being is — reason ("reason is what penetrates everything"). 2) Unity of Mankind: The discovery of the unreality of man's existence apart from God, is the discovery at the same time of the fact that God is the ultimate ground of the unity of mankind. According to Jaspers the fact of life are to conform to the principle of that wider order of reality disclosed to us in the experience of communication in which the reality of each person's likeness to the image of God finds its practical application. The development of communication depends on the principle of correlation of Existenz and Transcendenz which is the property of no finite existential self, but manifests itself alike in all. Though we may be confronted with the question "Is it God or the devil who governs the world?", it remains equally true that even "failure is no argument against the truth that is rooted in transcendence". 3) Ultimate Dignity of Man: Jaspers' unequivocal emphasis on freedom, stating that "Freedom and God are inseparable" serves to assure this ideal its place in human society. Thus man's exercise of freedom knits him up into the transcendental design. The claim that certain facts and experiences yield a basis for the recognition of the ultimate dignity of man is justified precisely by this evidence that through God, as inseparable from freedom, we discern the ultimate significance of both man and humanity.<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in confusing motives with causes; irrationalism, which advocates a "liberté d'indifférence", basing itself on the same premise as rationalism, and confusing motives with causes, is wrong in seeing the negation of the very existence of motives as the one way of saving human freedom. Both views disregard the fact that human action is impossible and cannot be understood without motives and that this, in turn, does not mean a determination of man in a mechanical way, for motives are not a part of nature but rather an organic element in a specific human situation—voluntary action. Human freedom is the freedom peculiar to a finite being immersed in time. Both those who stress passivity and receptivity and those who stress the dynamic creating ability of the self are wrong; both those who thought that freedom is possible only on the basis of clear and distinct motives and that action is nothing but the end of deliberation (St. Thomas) and those who thought that freedom is possible only by an irrational emergence of the vital ego (Bergson) or by negating the existence of any previous determination of the self (Sartre) are mistaken. A true human decision is composed of two elements; given motives and values on the one hand, and non-intellectualist spontaneous choice on the other. Duality is peculiar to human action. This is made more explicit in dealing with the more fundamental involuntary elements; character, sub-consciousness and life. Man acts freely from a finite and determined point of view; he acts in a clear and transparent way on the basis of confused and amorphous data; he lives his freedom when thrown into life. Necessity is inherent in man; it is one of his modes of being. There is no "inner freedom" on the one hand and "objective" causal necessity on the other. This conception of human action as both activity and passivity is reminiscent of Merleau-Ponty's statement in his "Philosophie du perception": "Le monde est déjá constitué, mais aussi jamais complètement constitué.... Il n'y a donc jamais déterminisme et jamais choix absolu, jamais je ne suis chose et jamais conscience nue". There is no dilemna between determinism and irrationalism, just as there is none between extended substance and thinking substance; there is dialogue.<br>

Abstract: It has been argued that in higher education academic disciplines can be seen as communities of practices. This implies a focus on what constitutes identities in academic culture. In this article I argue that the transition from newcomer to a full participant in a community of practice of physicists entails a focus on how identities emerge in learning how to highlight certain aspects of personal life histories. The analysis of interviews with 55 physicists shows that physicists often perceive experiences in their childhood as the first step into their professional identities as physicists. These experiences involve recollections of the ability to think scientifically (e.g., 'go beyond the surface'), and the ability to play with toys which can be connected to the practical life of physics. The process of identity formation can be described as developing in a relational zone of proximal development, where old-timers recognize particular playful qualities in newcomers as a legitimate access to a physicist identity. The article discusses how play which physicists connects with a scientific mind can constitute a relational zone of proximal developments in a community of practice as a particular "space of authoring" in a physicist culture, which cut across other cultural differences. Il a été admis que les disciplines de l'éducation supérieure peuvent être considérées comme des communautés de pratique. Cela pose la question de savoir comment se constituent les identités dans la culture académique. Dans cet article, pour mettre en évidence la transition de nouveau venu à participant à part entière dans une communauté de pratique de physiciens, j'examine non seulement la manière dont des identités émergent au travers des pratiques, mais aussi les aspects biographiques que les participants identifient comme ayant facilité leur transition. Une cohorte de 55 physiciens a été interviewée et leurs analyses ont été comparées à des données supplémentaires, notamment tirées d'une observation participante d'étudiants en physique. Les physiciens identifient souvent des expériences de leur enfance comme premiers pas vers leur identité professionnelle de physiciens. Ces expériences requièrent une pensée de type scientifique et une capacité à jouer liée avec les pratiques de la physique. Le processus de formation identitaire peut être décrit comme se développant dans une zone relationnelle de développement proximal, dans laquelle les aînés reconnaissent les qualités ludiques des nouveaux venus comme légitimant leur accès à l'identité de physicien. L'article discute la manière dont le jeu, que les physiciens associent à l'esprit scientifique, constitue une zone de développement proximal dans une communauté de pratique, comme «espace d'auteur» dans la culture des physiciens — laquelle peut par ailleurs dépasser d'autres différences culturelles.<br>

Abstract: The major thesis developed in Sartre's L'imaginaire is that all imaginary acts can be subsumed under the heading of one "image family" and, therefore, that imagination as a whole can be theorized in terms of pictorial representation. Yet this theory fails to meet the objective of Sartre's study, to demonstrate that imaginary activity is not a derivative of perception but an attitude with a character and dignity of its own. The subsidiary account of imagination in terms of neutralization of belief has the advantage of not being constrained by the requirement that imaginary activity serve a purely reproductive function of bringing an absent "original" into a quasi presence and, thus, leaves room for free creativity and fiction. It also points to a concrete lived experience of alterity at the heart of subjective life where the subject stages its life as if it were the life of an other, putting pressure onto Sartre's contention that the cogito defines subjectivity.<br>

Abstract: Because of her "larger-than-lifeness" and her superior qualities, is Camille Maupin of Béatrix an "Io" to Balzac's "Prometheus"? There is no evidence that Balzac either based Camille Maupin on Io or that he who perceived himself as Prometheus saw any relationship between this "femme supérieure" and Io. However, an examination of Camille Maupin and the tragedy of her life vis-à-vis the Io of Greek legend and, particularly, of Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound reveal's many parallels between the nature and fortunes of the two. Further, when one considers both Balzac's views of the "femme supérieure" (and, especially, of the "femme auteur") and the role of Zeus as the hidden protagonist of the Prometheus Bound, one may rightly argue that Balzac is as much Zeus as Prometheus to Maupin's Io.<br>

Abstract: THIS ESSAY EXAMINES THE RELEVANCE FOR RELIGIOUS ETHICS OF BUDDHIST Abhidhamma texts, those dealing with the analysis and systematization of mental states arising in and examined by meditation practice. Developing recent scholarship on the prevalence and significance of interlocking lists in Buddhist canonical texts and commentaries, the Buddhist use of lists in the Abhidhamma constitutes a kind of narrative expression of moral development through the sequential occurrence of carefully defined mental states. Attention to this narrative dimension of the moral life, while related to other recent proposals about the place of narrative in religious ethics, offers a way to employ this underexamined genre of religious literature (lists) drawn from a comparative context (Buddhist and Christian ethics), in service of a more nuanced account of moral development.<br>

Abstract: Present discourses on technology education are taking a positive and value-neutral approach with utilitarian and vocational overtones. The discourses generally lack discussions of human agency and human responsibility for techno-scientific activities and technological literacy. To support the emergence of a collective civic literacy, we argue in this text that technology education needs to take up critical and value-acknowledging aspects with emphasis on building sustainable relationships among human beings, technology, and lifeworld. To understand the relationship between human agency and modern technology, we examine the nature of technology in the dimensions of technology as causality and technology as a relationship of lifeworld. Discussing Martin Heidegger's perspectives on the causalities of technology, we question how the nature of technology situates human beings in power-related relationships to the world. Understanding technology as process and relationship of lifeworld, the paper extends its discussion of the responsibility of a dialectical human-technology-lifeworld relation based on a socio-technical and ethico-moral framework of technology. By recognizing human responsibility of and for modern technology, we outline a critical and reflective approach to technological literacy. The approach challenges the position of current approaches to technology in the attempt to provide a foundation for a contemporary pedagogy of technological awareness and values. Aujourd'hui, les discours en matière d'enseignement de la technologie sont en train de prendre une orientation positive et dépourvue de jugement de valeur comportant des connotations utilitaristes et professionnelles. En général, les discours n'ouvrent pas assez de discussions sur l'action humaine et la responsabilité humaine dans les activités technico-scientifiques et dans l'alphabétisme technologique. Dans ce papier, afin de renforcer l'éclosion de l'alphabétisme civique collectif, nous ouvrons le débat sur le fait que l'enseignement de la technologie a besoin d'aborder des aspects critiques et de valeur reconnue avec un accent mis sur la construction durable des relations chez les êtres humains, dans la technologie et dans la vie mondiale. Dans le but de comprendre les relations entre l'action humaine et la technologie moderne, nous analysons la nature de la technologie en tant que causalité et en tant que relation de la vie mondiale. Nous discutons des perspectives de Martin Heidegger sur les causalités de la technologie. Nous posons des questions sur la manière que la nature de la technologie situe les êtres humains dans les relations basées sur le pouvoir face au monde. Nous assimilons la technologie comme processus et comme relation de la vie mondiale. L'article élargit les propos sur la responsabilité dune relation dialectale humaine technologie/vie mondiale, fondée sur une structure de technologie sociotechnique et éthico morale. En reconnaissant la responsabilité humaine de et pour la technologie moderne, nous soulignons une démarche critique et réfléchie de l'alphabétisme technologique. La démarche remet en question la position des approches actuelles vers le chemin de la technologie afin d'apporter une base à une pédagogie contemporaine de sensibilisation et de valeurs technologiques.<br>

Abstract: The city is a key location of the modern social world, a home of rootlessness and transient everyday encounters between individuals. This essay explores the idea of 'the sanctuary' as a way in which people look for anchorage, and create and re-create images of a society, to cope with and negotiate life in the city. It mainly draws on Durkheim's work on ritual, symbolism and the sacred, together with his account of individual and collective representations. But it also discusses these concerns though other writers, notably Freud and Ricœur, and it draws on Kant's theory of art to introduce how Durkheim sees ritual —especially sacred drama — as at once a symbolism and an aesthetics, complete with the energies of a free creative 'surplus'. Even if in the end 'the sanctuary' is unequal to the marketplace, it is a necessary refuge of the transformative social imagination and a realm, not of everyday economics, but of civitas.<br>

Abstract: This is based on research that has discovered crucial, hitherto unknown biographical information. First, I review the theories of authors who helped to generate the whole 'affair' of Durkheim's two pre-names, most often in seeing it as a way to interrogate his relation with Judaism. Next, I discuss how the issue comes with elements that are incomplete or inexact. It is then to present new evidence of Durkheim's ambivalence and changing attitude towards his first, identifiably Jewish pre-name. The census records during his time at Bordeaux show that he registered himself as 'David' in 1891 and 1896, but abandoned this and switched to 'Émile' in 1901. Accordingly, I examine possible interpretations of the change, in terms of the political context of the Dreyfus Affair, events in his family life, his institutional position, his growing reputation, and a programme of research in which he resolved on a scientific treatment of religion.<br>

Abstract: Albert Camus's interrogation of the ethical and spiritual vacuity of the twentieth century convinced him that authentic political existence requires a vision that embraces while transcending the human condition. He found his ethical model in art. The work of the artist can be analogous to that of the just political actor. The principal components of ethical political being are all present in Camus's aesthetics: a vision of life in human community (lucidity), a grounded sense of justice subject to the limitations of human existence (beauty), a need to redress the defects of political reality (the urge to create), and an understanding that any structural solution is of necessity temporary (the need to rearticulate the initial vision). Camus's vision requires him to reject our positive political categories in the name of creative, grounded human being.<br>

Abstract: This article interprets John Sayles' 1996 film Lone Star as a reflection on how a community whose history is steeped in violence, such as the US, should seek to manage its difficult cultural memory. A conceptual triad of love, justice, and tragedy utilised to interpret the film's last line, 'Forget the Alamo.' It is concluded that the memory of a troubled past can only serve as the basis for responsible public life when we, like the characters in Lone Star, choose to remember with a charity that liberates both our ancestors and our selves from having to play out the roles of hero or villain.<br>

Abstract: This essay outlines an account of 'theological humanism' as a new form of theology of culture. I trace the connection between theological humanism and an ethics of responsibility dedicated to respecting and enhancing the integrity of life. I argue that without a 'theological' humanism we risk the reduction of values to human purposes, and yet without a theological 'humanism' religious conviction is unconstrained by moral purpose. In our age of religious violence and ecological crisis, what is needed in ethics is a renewed vision of the moral vocation of human beings not against but within the wider compass of life on earth.<br>

Abstract: This article argues that Iris Murdoch makes a distinctive contribution to the agenda of theological humanism by formulating a revised theology of culture. Specifically, the article claims that Murdoch provides a compelling apologia for religious life in a secular world in two ways: by defending the significance of individual consciousness, and by retrieving an idea of the religious depth of morality. In doing so, Murdoch's work challenges antihumanist currents in modern and postmodern thought, offers an alternative to confessional forms of religious reflection, and revises previous theologies of culture (such as Tillich's) by giving priority to the ethical dimension of human life.<br>

Abstract: Mandala is a Korean film that follows the careers of two Buddhist monks who pursue antithetical forms of religious practice—meditative selfcultivation, and antinomian pursuit of freedom. Mandala culminates in the enlightenment of both, as they come to realize the limits intrinsic in self-absorption in either form. The paper seeks to explore the larger ethical issues posed in the film in relation to their background in Mahayana Buddhism and to show their applicability in our own cultural setting to the emergence of a 'theological humanism', which articulates various forms of transcendence or depth experienced in the midst of human life.<br>

Abstract: The article uses a reading of Eliot's Middlemarch and a discussion of Levinas and Heidegger to challenge two aspects of the approach to literary texts proposed by Toril Moi. I suggest that we needn't assume that the inner lives of others are inaccessible in the way Moi (following Stanley Cavell) does, nor that literature has a privileged role in helping us come to terms with this alterity. Literature is one practice amongst others with which relations with other people are negotiated more or less honestly. I argue that recent developments in phenomenology and cognitive science, in particular the focus on enactive and participatory models of being in the world, can help to make more concrete Heidegger's concept of being-with (Mitsein) and Levinas' concept of proximité. Heidegger and Levinas' can then take their place in a counter tradition of 20th-century thinkers who engage with human togetherness rather than declare it to be impossible. The question Heidegger and Levinas' raise about the ethical challenge of human togetherness is not, however, answered by more recent research. It is by turning back to Middlemarch and viewing it in the context of its original marketing that we can see one way that this challenge may be confronted in everyday life.<br>

Abstract: In the world of Korean shamanism, there is a particular god, called taegam, which is allegedly famous for its love of money and its abundance of greed for material wealth. During the shamanic ritual of chaesu-kut, the rites for good fortune and luck, this god is popularly worshipped as the Deity of Wealth and is typically symbolized by money placed all over its face and spirit costumes. Nonetheless, as money has the two sides of heads and tails, taegam also has two very different faces—so-taegam and taegam. This article explores the ambiguity of the two taegam gods, focusing on the symbolic action of money-offerings and how its meaning is taken from the perspective of the ritual actors, in the hope of shedding light on the place of Korea's traditional popular religion of shamanism in today's transformed urban landscape. By discussing the semantics of "money is the filial child" (a remark made by so-taegam) and "money is the enemy" (as remarked by taegam), statements I often heard during my fieldwork in Seoul, I suggest that the ambivalent symbolic nature of taegam should be seen as an indispensible vehicle for understanding ritual life, as well as everyday life, of urban Korean people since it is closely related to both normative orientations and the contradictory aspects of the material culture of contemporary urbanites inhabiting the borderless, globalized, and fluctuating modern capitalist market. This conclusion is reached partly with reference to existing sociological theories of money and anthropological inquiries into the ambivalent aspects of taegam.<br>

Abstract: Es wird der Begriff der „Lebensgeschichte“ zur Diskussion gestellt. Am Beispiel ausgewählter Therapie-Konzeptionen (Dührssen, Cremerius, Loch, Kohut, Morgenthaler) wird gezeigt, daß in jeder therapeutischen Richtung verschiedene Segmente des lebensgeschichtlichen Problemfeldes isoliert, ausgearbeitet und zum Ansatzpunkt des therapeutischen Handelns gemacht werden. Die entsprechenden Konsequenzen für Diagnostik, Therapie und Forschung werden im Blick auf aktuelle Strömungen der therapeutischen Psychoanalyse (Ich-Psychologie, Narzißmus-Analyse, Repräsentanzenlehre, hermeneutische Psychoanalyse) verdeutlicht. The concept of „life history“ is the theme of this discussion. Working from a selection of therapy models (Dührssen, Cremerius, Loch, Kohut, Morgenthaler) it can be shown that in every therapeutic approach various segments from the problem area of life histories in general can be isolated, developed and made into the central point of therapeutic activity. The relevant consequences for diagnosis, therapy and research will be clarified with respect to present-day movements in therapeutic psychoanalysis (ego-psychology, the analysis of narcissism, hermeneutic psychoanalysis).<br>

Abstract: Unsere Literaturübersicht diskutiert die Frage, ob und inwieweit eine reife Liebesfähigkeit Erwachsener von entsprechenden Früherfahrungen abhängt bzw. inwieweit Liebe und Partnerschaft eine Korrektur ungünstiger emotionaler Erfahrungen der frühen Kindheit ermöglichen. Bestimmte Partnerschaftsstörungen stehen zu konkreten familiären Gegebenheiten der ersten Lebensjahre in keinem zwingenden Bezug. Sind Partnerschaftsstörungen nach traditioneller psychoanalytischer Auffassung als Folge eines ungelösten infantilen Konfliktes anzusehen, so greifen neuere Ansätze angesichts des weitgehenden Fehlens einer psychoanalytischen Interaktionstheorie bei der Beschreibung und Erklärung interpersoneller Phänomene zunehmend auf systemische Ansätze zurück. Äußerungen psychoanalytischer Autoren zur Entwicklung der Liebesfähigkeit reflektieren im historischen Überblick wesentliche Veränderungen der Theoriebildung. Neuere empirische Arbeiten weisen auf Korrektur- und Kompensationsmöglichkeiten ungünstiger Früherfahrungen von mittlerem Schweregrad hin. Dafür aber dürfte die warme und bedürfnisgerechte Zuwendung durch eine oder mehrere feste Bezugspersonen (möglichst durch die liebevoll und partnerschaftlich aufeinander bezogenen Eltern) in den ersten Lebensjahren eine grundlegende Voraussetzung erwachsener Liebes- und Partnerschaftsfähigkeit sein. In this survey of literature on the subject, we discuss the question of whether or not and if so to what extent a mature, adult ability to love depends on relevant early experience, or whether it functions as a corrective to unfavorable emotional experience in early childhood. There is no compelling connection between certain disturbances of partner relations and concrete family circumstances in the first years of life. Such disturbances are regarded by traditional psychoanalysis as the result of an unresolved infantile conflict; however, since there is no psychoanalytical interaction theory for the description and explanation of interpersonal phenomena, recent discussions have drawn increasingly on a systematic approach. From an historical point of view, psychoanalytical discussions reflect essential changes in theories about the ability to love. More recent empirical studies point to a possible involvement of corrective and compensatory mechanisms for unfavorable early experiences of a medium degree of seriousness. Nevertheless, warm affection based on needs during the first years of life (at best from loving parents with a partner-oriented relationship) provides a basis for the adult's ability to love and form partnerships.<br>

Abstract: This article inquires as to the meaning of nervoso (nerves) among poor, working-class women from Salvador, Brazil. Our aim is to understand nerves as an experience that emerges from the background of a life trajectory and that, in many significant ways, disrupts the taken-for-granted character of that trajectory. From a phenomenological-hermeneutical tradition, we explore the links between experience, embodiment and temporality and then discuss the relevance of this approach for the understanding of women′s nervoso. In order to do so we present the life histories of three middle-aged women who have been afflicted with nerves. The accounts describe significant ways in which culturally inherited possibilities – grounded in a lived context of class and gender – are recovered and come to pre-figure a certain future. As we argue throughout the article, it is only when we situate the experience of nervoso within the temporal frame of life that we can truly understand it – that is, grasp it as part of a movement that involves both recovery and creation of meaning.<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur placed a great deal of importance upon text and the interpretation of text. Bell accepts this by virtue of his extended analysis of the story of Babel, and I hope to offer ways of extending and developing Bell's arguments to incorporate the ethical demands that Ricoeur placed upon text, upon our interpretation of text and upon action as a form of readable text. This will not include a commentary on discourse analysis, which I am not qualified to give. Ricoeur differed from the structuralist tradition in that he saw the relationship between language and life as taking a dialectical form: debate that presumes the possibility of altering one's position by grappling with different views, and often taking inspiration from Hegelian dialectics, with their contrasting polarized views and the eventual attempt at affirmative common ground. The term λογοσ (logos) was first used in a philosophical way by Heraclitus to give us the principle of order and knowledge, and yet for Heraclitus the world was dominated by conflict and change. Ricoeur studied this tension within logos between order and disorder, partly by his writing about language and his work on signs and symbols, partly through metaphor and narrative and also through his insights on translation. For him, all these are facets of the need for both Explaining and Understanding as forms of interpretation of language, ethics and action. Ricoeur's work on logos provides us with an approach that asks whether ethics controls language or vice versa or both and how this fits in with structuralism and later movements. For Ricoeur, signs (words, texts) are not the centres of our perceptual experience. At the heart of our perception are our motivations and our actions, for which we must take responsibility in a sort of provisional affirmation that we will keep trying. In so doing we must doubt (be suspicious of) our own motives just as much as those of others, and see action as a form of readable text.<br>

Abstract: Si comme Foucault lui-même le souligne, la question de la vérité occupe dans
toute sa recherche une place à différents égards cruciale (Foucault 1994 III : 30-
31, IV : 693), ce n'est qu'à partir des années 1980 qu'elle devient ensemble à
la problématique du sujet la préoccupation principale du philosophe. En effet,
déjà dans ses recherches sur la sexualité, Foucault s'est intéressé à une forme
particulière d'assujettissement à l'œuvre dans la pastorale chrétienne et qui sera
par la suite un modèle exemplaire pour les actions disciplinaires (Foucault 1994
III: 256-257, IV: 125-129, 148, 383-385, 783-788). Le sujet est contraint
d'avouer la vérité sur sa vie la plus intime, et notamment celle sexuelle, « pour
mieux renoncer à lui-même et se soumettre à son directeur de conscience » (Granjon
2005 : 42). Il s'agit d'un processus de formation du sujet dans un rapport à soi
aliéné. Selon FOUCAULT (1994 III : 551), ce modèle de formation du sujet est à
l'œuvre également dans « toutes les grandes machines disciplinaires : casernes,
écoles, ateliers et prisons [...] qui permettent de cerner l'individu, de savoir ce
qu'il est, ce qu'il fait, ce qu'on peut en faire, où il faut le placer, comment le
placer parmi les autres ». En 1980 lors d'une leçon au Collège de France pour
le cours intitulé « Du gouvernement des vivants », Foucault (2012 : 80-81) refor-
mule la question de la formation du sujet dans les termes de « régimes de vérité ».
Les années 1980 représentent un tournant dans les orientations analytiques du
philosophe. Dans un article paru en 1981, FOUCAULT (1994 IV : 693) annonce son
projet de recherche à venir, toutefois interrompu par sa mort prématurée. Il
reviendra à plusieurs reprises sur ce changement de thème directeur en essayant
aussi de montrer qu'il était sous-jacent dans ses recherches antérieures.<br>

Abstract: While identity researchers are utilizing a variety of methods, the potential advantages of combinations of qualitative and quantitative methods remain largely unexploited. This article discusses the interplay of methods, theoretical content and meta-theoretical assumptions in identity research and calls for the use of mixed methods. The article applies a symbolic interactionist perspective and discusses what aspects of identification different methodological approaches provide insight into. It is discussed how different methodologies imply different assumptions about identity, particularly regarding the stability of identities, the constitution of identities and the conception of meaning. The influential quantitative Burke–Tully approach is brought into focus and compared to different qualitative approaches, particularly narrative interviews. A quantitative self-report measure neglects the narrative, performative and embodied quality of identification. However, the quantitative approach of Burke and Tully enables the systematic, standardized comparison of individuals making it possible to examine patterns of identification in large populations. Since different methods enable the study of different aspects of identity, while remaining blind to other aspects, mixed methods may contribute to more complete insights into identity processes. Importantly, mixed methods may be used to examine patterns available to the outside observer and the lifeworld of the individual actor and thus to both explain and understand.<br>

Abstract: This article examines the ethical responsibilities of relating and responding to subjects of oppression in the context of collaborative life writing. One well-established ethical response to oppression is the practice of recognition. Drawing on the phenomenological ethics of Emmanuel Levinas and Paul Ricoeur, as well as the related work of Kelly Oliver, I raise some of the limitations of recognition, and delineate the ethical alternative of witnessing, bringing both to bear on my collaborative work with Holocaust survivor Rhodea Shandler.<br>

Abstract: In Colombia, society has come to be organized in terms of a division between those with and those without links to narcotrafficking. This moral boundary recently experienced a symbolic disturbance with the entrance on the country's cultural scene of Andrés López López, a former Colombian drug trafficker, and his El cartel de los sapos (2008). An examination of the discursive and political strategies employed in this book, in which drug trafficking is referred to through the metaphor "bacteria," allows us to understand the construction of a narrator who calls attention to the hypocrisy of the government and society regarding the reincorporation of narcotraffickers into civilian life while provoking a national debate on the difference between history and fiction. En Colombia, la sociedad ha llegado a organizarse en términos de una división entre aquellos que tienen y no vínculos con el narcotráfico. Este límite moral experimentó un reciente disturbio simbólico con la entrada de Andrés López López, un ex-narcotraficante colombiano, y su libro El cartel de los sapos (2008) en la escena cultural del país. Un análisis de las estrategias discursivas y políticas empleadas en este libro, en el que el tráfico de drogas se define a través de la metáfora de la "bacteria," nos permite entender la construcción de un narrador que devela la hipocresía gubernamental y social con respecto a la reincorporación de los narcotraficantes en la vida civil al mismo tiempo que provoca un debate nacional sobre la diferencia entre historia y ficción.<br>

Abstract: Through the analysis of a major religious painting by Botticelli, this article builds on important recent work on Botticelli's sacred art to explore apparent responses on the part of an especially sophisticated artist to the gathering atmosphere of crisis in the city's political and religious life. The artist uses various devices of connection or separation between the viewer/worshiper and the holy image; these devices are not unique to the painting, but their combination is exceptional. First, Botticelli uses a hieratic gold ground to distinguish a scene set in heaven, the coronation of the Virgin, from a more earthly zone; here recent scruples about the representation of transcendence seem to be in play. Second, the figures beneath, four major saints, embody different ways of addressing the viewer and mediating between him/her and the heavenly event. Third, the latter appears to be treated as an apsidal image within an implied architectural setting, in other words, as a representation of a representation. By establishing modes of mediation, then, Botticelli confronts issues emerging as central to the representation of the sacred, in part on the basis of a critical understanding of Albertian picture theory.<br>

Abstract: Ernst Troeltsch distinguished between naive, apologetic and evolutionistic absoluteness.
From the original spontaneity of 'naive absoluteness' and its artificial (partly super-
naturalistic, partly rationalistic) defence as 'apologetic absoluteness' (in the Middle Ages and
in the Enlightenment, respectively) there came forth in Hegel the idea of 'evolutionistic
absoluteness' — an ingenious but untenable attempt to reconcile the solid apologetic
conception of absoluteness of that day with the dynamics of history by presenting it as the
outcome and terminus of historical progression. See Troeltsch, Die Absolutheit des Christen-
tums, 87ff. Cf. J. Klapwijk, Tussen historisme en relativisme, 222-29. At present the belief in
progress and thus also the mix of it with the idea of absoluteness is no longer a subject of
discussion.<br>

Abstract: Interestingly enough it appears that the structural features of reconciliation show a re-
versed version of the structural features of evil. Resolving the evil I do toward the other re-
quires that I am able to say what I have done wrong (the reverse of silence and the
tinspeakable), that I recognize my guilt (which is incompatible with splitting) and that I ask for
forgiveness (which is very shameful, but may résolve shame when penitence is accepted and
forgiveness is given); see Glas (in press); Muφhyand Hampton (1988); Volf (1996).<br>

possible usurpation of divine sovereignty (GB 268).<br>

Abstract: Because they escape precise modal qualification, Troost suggests that insight into disposi-
tions can only be gained in an idea-ruled (idee-matig) understanding, in an idea-regulated 'on
the way' in the transcendental direction of time. For reformational philosophy this raises an
old and prima facie purely theoretical problem: Do the modalities 'continue' right into the
heart? One could paraphrase Troost's view for example such that for him the heart should
primarily be sought 'below' or 'behind' the act structure, and that the dispositions — relative
to this vertical axis — constitute a horizontal layer in which the lower substructures are
interwoven with the act structure. In that case the integration of the lower structures in the act
structure would take place via the dispositions rather than through a direct relationship with
the heart. This notion — for which hints can be found in Dooyeweerd — would in any case
lead to an appreciably more nuanced picture of the 'binding' and 'releasing' of substructures.
If I understand Troost correctly, he would allow this interpretation for the substructures,
though not for the modalities. His caution concerning the 'continuing' of the modalities 'into
the' heart is epistemological: the cosmological concentration of the modal functions in the
heart is a transcendental idea; at best we see dots (the idea-regulated 'on the way' in the
transcendental direction of time), but we should not turn them into lines.<br>

vision or alter the way we perceive the world around us.' (http://christianworldview.net/,

Abstract: In From Beast to the Blonde, Marina Warner studies the status of fairy tales as historical documents which
give an account of women's daily experiences, as they illustrate their particular rites of passage and the relevance
of maternal figures in their lives. The resonance of Mother Goose is taken by Warner "either as a historical source,
or a fantasy of origin" which she can trace into ancient traditions, like the Islamic or the Christian, and which
adds credibility to the stories (1994, xxiii).<br>

Abstract: What is the use of writing poems against war if they reenact rather than alter the binaries and brutalities of the war imagination they claim to protest? Why does so much contemporary war poetry only compound war's depleting effect instead of offering us energy for resistance? In The Life of Poetry (1949), Muriel Rukeyser defines poetry as a vital but underused national resource for a culture dominated by war. As a creative transfer of energy, poetry complicates and resists habits of imagination that sustain war. Using Rukeyser's analysis to contrast a representative poem from the volume Poets Against the War (2003) to several poems by Forche, Celan, James Wright, Blake, Yeats, Oppen, and Levertov, this paper discusses ways in which poetry about war and wartime can provide useful, life-giving energy without replicating the very violences it claims to oppose.<br>

Abstract: This article explores how Gayl Jones's "Corregidora" constructs, through the journey of its main protagonist Ursa Corregidora, a viable model for dealing with the painful legacy of slavery, oppression and haunting by the past. The process of self-redefinition in which Ursa engages is based on the reconfiguration of family and sexuality and the hybridization of her relationship to individual as well as collective narratives. After probing Ursa's complex psychological journey, the article examines the main elements mediating the reinscription of her life narrative into a broader context of métissage involving sexual and historical resistance, anchored in the story of Palmares as a Brazilian maroon community (quilombo). Finally, the article analyzes the implications and resonances of this model of revision/reclamation for Gayl Jones and her theorization of the interconnectedness of struggles against oppression in Brazil and the United States.<br>

Abstract: Recent attempts by geographers to explore the human experience of space have focused on overt behavior and its cognitive foundations. The language and style of our descriptions, however, often fail to speak in categories appropriate for the elucidation of lived experience, and we need to evaluate our modes of knowing in the light of modes of being in the everyday world. Phenomenologists provide some guidelines for this task. They point to the preconsciously given aspects of behavior and perception residing in the "lifeworld"-the culturally defined spatiotemporal setting or horizon of everyday life. Scientific procedures which separate "subjects" and "objects," thought and action, people and environments are inadequate to investigate this lifeworld. The phenomenological approach ideally should allow lifeworld to reveal itself in its own terms. In practice, however, phenomenological descriptions remain opaque to the functional dynamism of spatial systems, just as geographical descriptions of space have neglected many facets of human experience. There are certain avenues for dialogue between these two disciplines in three major research areas: the sense of place, social space, and time-space rhythms. Such a dialogue could contribute to a more humanistic foundation for human geography.<br>

Abstract: It has become commonplace to describe Machado de Assis's characters and narrators as deeper than those of his contemporaries, and his novels as representations more creatively ambiguous than most literary depictions of nineteenth-century Brazil. In this essay I argue that throughout his novels psychological depth is a function of moral imagination; and a troubled moral imagination is a necessary condition for the literary representation of the modern self. Machado's protagonists are able to fashion the public presentation of their selves by imagining alternatives to their origins, desires, and social predicaments. They have in their pasts a burden they need to overcome, and while doing so they find themselves in conditions of freedom and harm. Evil then arises as a consequence of moral dynamism, in so far as it becomes a project for undoing the other. The genesis of a radical conception of free will and evil in Machado's narratives goes back to his translation of Victor Hugo's The Toilers of the Sea (1866). His concern with a more meticulous characterization of inwardness deepens between Iaiá Garcia (1878) and Dom Casmurro (1899), when adopting the structure of a confessional narrative he arrives at a balance between disguised motives (malice), double chronology (nostalgia), and human life as an unfolding, reversible, and self-aware process (metamorphosis). To frame Machado's strategy for depicting moral change, I take from Augustine's Confessions the suggestion that retrospection is the only way of restoring the identity of someone whose self is marked by his or her sense of dissimilarity with the past. Finally, from Kant and Paul Ricoeur I draw the elements for a further consideration of evil as an invitation to think differently about seeing, judging, and narrating human life.<br>

Abstract: This article highlights two features of Qur'anic style and content: duality/opposition and typological figuration, which can be seen as providing a continuous and consistent 'narrative stream' through the Qur'an. It is of some interest that both of these features have been singled out as distinctive of apocalypse as a genre in the study of numerous religious and cultural traditions. As debate on whether or not the Qur'an is a bona fide example of apocalyptic literature quietly continues, the interplay of conceptual and substantive oppositions and dualities is discussed in order to highlight the importance of this prominent feature to both the form and contents of the Book. It is suggested that its function is profoundly related to the typological figuration indispensable to the Qur'anic depiction of, for example, the character of the prophets and therefore prophethood. Whether or not this represents a genuine instance of apocalyptic literature, it nonetheless remains that the prominence of the motif renders the Qur'an susceptible of a reading expressive of something called an apocalyptic imagination. It is hoped that this article succeeds in demonstrating that in fact these apparently familiar subjects are stimulated to new life by considering them as defining, interlocking, structural elements of a distinctive Islamic apocalypse. ‮تبرز هذه الدراسة خاصيتين لأسلوب القرآن ومادته: الثنائية/التقابل وتصنيف النماذج مما قد ينظر إليه على أنه يمثل تيارا مستمرا ثابتا في القرآن. ومن اللافت للنظر أنه قد جرى الترکيز على هاتين الخاصيتين على أنهما يختصان بالحديث عن أحوال الآخرة في کثير من الأديان والتقاليد الثقافية. وفي هذا المقال سندرس التفاعل بين الثنائية والتقابل لکي نبرز الأهمية الأساسية لهذه الخاصية بالنسبة لشکل القرآن ومحتواه. فنحن نرى أن وظيفتها تمت بقوة إلى ظاهرة تصنيف الأنواع في تصوير القرآن لشخصيات الأنبياء ثم النبوة نفسها. والأمل أن ينجح هذا المقال في التدليل على أن هذه الموضوعات المألوفة يمکن رؤيتها على أنها نمط إسلامي فريد في الحديث عن الأخرويات.‬<br>

Abstract: Recent debates in International Relations have seen some of the characteristic dichotomies of the discipline under severe and sophisticated challenge. The proposition, for example, that the study of International Relations, is somehow "independent" of mainstream debates on theory and practice in the social sciences is now widely rejected. The disciplines change in attitude on this issue owes much, in the 1980s, to the influences of an as yet small group of scholars who have infused the "third debate" in International Relations with an appreciation for previously "alien" approaches to knowledge and society, drawn from interdisciplinary sources, which repudiate (meta) theoretical dualism in all its forms. Utilizing the sponge term "postpositivism" Yosef Lapid has concentrated on an important aspect of the "third debate," one which has seen positivist based perspectives repudiated in favor of critical perspectives derived, primarily, from debates on the philosophy of science. This paper takes a broader view of the "third debate" in focusing on some of the broader patterns of dissent in social theory that are now evident in its literature. It argues that for all the differences associated with the new critical social theory approaches, theirs is critique with common purpose. Its purpose: to help us understand more about contemporary global life by opening up for questioning dimensions of inquiry which have been previously closed off and supressed; by listening closely to voices previously unheard; by examining "realities" excluded from consideration under a traditional (realist) regime of unity and singularity. Its purpose, reiterated: the search for "thinking space" within an International Relations discipline produced by and articulated through Western modernist discourse.<br>

Abstract: An existential-phenomenological description of everyday consumer experiences of contemporary married women with children is offered. An idiographic case study provides a thick description of this phenomenon and illustrates the hermeneutic process used in the interpretation. Following the case study, three interpretive themes are presented as mutually related aspects of an experiential gestalt that is shaped by the contextual ground of participants' life-world situations. Viewed holistically, the thematic aspects exhibit several dialectical relations that can be understood in terms of the emergent meaning of free choice. The applicability of this experiential gestalt to other life-world contexts is discussed.<br>

Abstract: Rational choice theory and the critical theory of Jurgen Habermas exclude important social categories from their analyses of strategic interaction. Successful strategic action in many contexts, however, depends upon the irreducibly intersubjective categories of the lifeworld. I defend this claim by analyzing the use of focal points to solve the multiple equilibria problem in coordination games, reconstructing both the generation of the salience behind focal points as well as the strategic rationality of using them. The goal of this reconstruction is to demonstrate the compatibility of what appears to be mutually hostile research traditions, validating the intuition that together they provide a better understanding of politics than either school can on its own.<br>

Abstract: By focusing on hermeneutics and dialogue, this article clarifies the distinctive contribution that pastoral and psychotherapeutic interventions have to make in the healing process. It is shown how the hermeneutical process discloses the meaning of events through the interpretation of texts that arise spontaneously in the lives of individuals and groups. Texts may range from individual fantasies and dreams to sacred histories recorded in scriptures. When the meaning of life events is explored in dialogue through symbolic texts, we term that process "dialogical hermeneutics." Effective dialogical hermeneutics requires the use of three techniques: (1) presence in the caring relationship, (2) dialogue toward meaning, and (3) offering alternative interpretation.<br>

Abstract: Visual sociology has two main interests: picture-making by researchers (or their subjects) in the course of sociological fieldwork, and pictures made by social actors in the context of everyday life. Focusing on the latter interest and based in three social aspects of images—that they are produced in general societal settings and specific institutional settings, and are a kind of discursive practice—three approaches to the sociology of visual material are illustrated.<br>

Abstract: This article pleads for a pragmatic strategy of transcultural understanding as a dialogic concept of insight in social geographic research in the „Islamic Orient“. Transcultural understanding is interpreted as a process of assimilating different systems of meaning, norms, and values of subjects on the one hand, and discourses on how those systems fit together on the other hand (cf. Schwemmer 1996). Understanding is organized by scientifically working out common connections respecting and recognizing foreign codes. As it were, social geographic research needs to generate theoretical frames on a common basis in order to take the differences between cultures as a theme afterwards. In preparation of the argument, the concept of the „gelebten Raum“ (Baier 1996), and the post-modern understanding of space in social geography respectively (Claval 1999) is shortly presented. Additionally, a differentiation of the „Islamic Orient“ is outlined, as are the problems of understanding everyday life and social scientific problems of understanding agency.<br>

Abstract: Muftis are literate scholars who specialise in Muslim legal-religious interpretation. They provide an example of a higher level of systematic indigenous interpretation than the common sense, everyday constructions of reality that have been discussed in anthropological accounts. I discuss the institutional form of the muftiship, and contrast it with the judgeship, with reference to indigenous ideal-types found in several categories of written Muslim social thought. This ideal form is then compared with the identities of historical and contemporary muftis in Yemen. The interpretive method employed by muftis joins a Greek-derived concept of analogy with recitation and hermeneutics. While their method is structurally similar to scriptural interpretation, muftis are worldly interpreters who address practical life problems posed by lay questioners.<br>

Abstract: Ruskin's complex attitude toward women has long been important to feminist and Victorian studies; over a quarter-century ago Kate Millett published Sexual Politics and its famous attack on Ruskin's essay "Of Queens' Gardens." She charged Ruskin with promoting a sugar-coated but perfidious system of separate spheres for men and women. Yet shortly after Ruskin produced that idealized vision of housewife-queens in 1865, he created a new ideal queen in his mythological study The Queen of the Air (1869), this time elaborated from Athena. Through his mythopoesis, Ruskin disrupts both conventional gender categories and his own implication in them. Ruskin presents a series of binary oppositions that he immediately conflates: Athena and Medusa, air and earth, bird and snake, formation and destruction, science and myth, male and female. Ruskin documents the instability of his oppositions through a bizarre "natural language" where real-life creatures such as birds and snakes serve as eternal hieroglyphs, signifying universally recognizable abstractions. That seemingly fixed signs in Athena's hieroglyphic code inevitably change is clear from Ruskin's acknowledgment of Darwin's evolutionary theory. But evolution slips into a wild image of degenerative metamorphosis, where all the divisions that Ruskin has so laboriously noted dissolve. Since Ruskin identifies Athena with each seemingly opposed animal signifier in his language of living hieroglyphs, he subverts all linguistic difference and ultimately feminizes signification itself. Through myth Ruskin creates a mutable language, one where genders as well as signs become mobile rather than fixed.<br>

Abstract: Sigmund Freud's work continues to attract interest from philosophers, analysts and historians, and the earliest formulation of his theory of the unconscious and the 'seduction hypothesis' have recently received particular attention. While Freud's intellectual debt to such figures as Darwin, Nietzsche, Helmholtz and Brücke has been well documented, the influence of Heinrich Schliemann on him and his work is little known. The purpose of this paper is to explore the ways in which Schliemann's work helped Freud fashion himself as an 'archaeologist of the mind' and how, in the crucial year 1896, it enabled him to construct and present his new ideas. The paper also explores Freud's interest in collecting and suggests how and why Freud's debts to archaeology are not, as commonly thought, visible in the so-called 'archaeological metaphor of mind', but present in other areas of his life and writing.<br>

Abstract: Particular problems are posed in the study of lives since the course of life may be less continuous and predictable than sometimes assumed. Further, the most important aspect of developmental study may be the subjectively constructed narrative of development, or life history, which itself changes over personal and historical time. Following the interpretive approach pioneered by Dilthey, Weber, Freud, and, more recently, Ricoeur, Taylor, and others, lives may be considered as texts to be studied in a systematic manner. The concept of empathy as formulated within the clinical situation, and applied most recently to study of biography, may also foster understanding of changes over time in the life history.<br>

Abstract: In order to give an account of the Congolese tragedy since independence, the inhabitants of Haut-Katanga often resort to four different narratives: the abandonment by Belgium; the biblical curse on Africans; the conspiracy of Western capitalism; or the alienation of life powers by Whites. Though these four stories offer different scenarios, they are all constructed with two types of actors - Whites and Congolese people. This article suggests that this racial/national frame finds its origins in colonial and national ideologies, which have left their mark on Haut-Katanga, and that it continues today to structure the narratives through which people remember their post-colonial history. Collective memory and racial/national identity are reciprocally constituted in these stories, but in different terms. They offer, accordingly, different ways of influencing the present.<br>

Abstract: Describing how my way of being in the world hindered or advanced my research, I suggest that a researcher's quality of life and mode of narrative inquiry may be closely related. The outcome seems to hinge on the inquirer's relationship to time and place in life and research. As all human beings, researchers use narrative to structure temporal complexity, only to find that this use contributes a complexity of its own. Efforts to overcome either pervade our lives as well as our forms of inquiry. I specify how such efforts endanger narrative inquiry, both in research and teacher education, and I struggle to find a language that accommodates a contextualized, narrative self as it reaches out to culturally shared conditions.<br>

Abstract: Since contending methodological perspectives and different types of research products are founded on irreconcilable philosophical assumptions, the sharp, recurrent debates over social science research methods are likely to be fruitless and counterproductive. This article begins by exposing some of the philosophical assumptions underlying the most recent calls for a unified social science methodology and seeks to help develop a common appreciation of how different kinds of methods and research products advance our understanding of different aspects of social life at different levels of abstraction. Such commonly posited dichotomies as deductivist/inductivist logic, quantitative/qualitative analysis, and nomothetic/idiographic research products are shown to obscure significant differences along a continuum of strategies through which context-bound information and analytic constructs are combined to produce interpretations of varying degrees of complexity or generality. Durkheim's conception of "organic solidarity" in a social "division of labor" serves as a useful metaphor here to capture the complementary roles performed by various research products as well as the trade-offs arising from the strengths and weaknesses of various methodological approaches (ranging from formal and statistical approaches to various case-based and interpretive approaches). Thus, sharp claims regarding the strengths and limitations of particular methods are transformed into elements of an overarching agnostic understanding of the trade-offs and complementarities among these methods. Finally, a distinctive role is identified for an ideal-typical "middle-range" comparative-historical approach in fostering greater communication among a more inclusively defined community of methodologically diverse social scientists.<br>

Abstract: This paper addresses several problems in experimental ethnographies: the integration of first- and third-person texts, ethnographic authority, and incorporation of dialogue in ethnographies. These problems can be traced to a relationship between discourse and text that hinges on splitting subject/object and process/product. Both splits are antithetical to dialogue in defining relationships between self and social life. A dialogic approach is developed through use of indexing in social distance, and discussed in Japanese usage of register. Implications for intersubjective, reflexive, and pluralistic approaches to social life are traced out.<br>

Abstract: This paper addresses several problems in experimental ethnographies: the integration of first and third person texts, ethnographic authority, and incorporation of dialogue into texts. These problems can be traced to a relationship between discourse and text that focuses on reference, and results in "representing" dialogue. This obscures dialogue in the larger sense of constituting social reality. An indexical, rather than a referential approach to dialogue is developed through examination of indexing of social distance, discussed in Japanese usage of register. Implications are traced out for intersubjective, reflexive, and pluralistic approaches to social life.<br>

Abstract: Social theorists' recent interest in global capitalism is partially driven by their sense of "being behind" in a changed and changing world. It is also part of their larger efforts to critique the present. In this article, I seek to find analogues of this sense of temporal incongruity between knowledge and its objects in the Tokyo financial markets. My focus is on the anxieties and hopes animating some Japanese securities traders' life choices. I argue that these traders' differing anxieties and hopes resulted from their divergent senses of the temporal incongruity among strategies, workplaces, and Japan's national location vis-à-vis the United States. Drawing on a parallel between social theorists' and traders' efforts to generate prospective momentum in their work, I propose that anthropologists investigate the work of temporal incongruity in knowledge formation more generally.<br>

Abstract: Despite the abundance of psychological studies on trauma related ills of descendants of historical trauma, and the extensive scholarly work describing the memory politics of silenced traumatic pasts, there has yet to emerge a critical analysis of the constitutive practices of descendants of historical trauma. This article presents an ethnographic account of a support group for descendants of Holocaust survivors, proposing that the discursive frame of intergenerational transmission of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and support group based narrative practices allow descendants to fashion their sense of self as survivors of the distant traumatic past. The discursive frame of transmitted PTSD acts as both a mnemonic bridge to the past and a mechanism of identity making, as participants narratively reemplot their life stories as having been personally constituted by the distant past. A close ethnographic reading of on-site discursive practices points to how culture ferments to produce narratives, practices and ultimately carriers of memory to both sustain and revitalize historical grand narratives and the cultural scenarios they embed.<br>

Abstract: Using life narrative interviews with Arab students with Israeli citizenship collected in 1997-98, I inquire into the processes and problems in talking about one's collective identity. In particular, I address how Arab students manage multiple identifications and the role of social relationships in shaping identity narratives. First, I argue that identity narratives do not voice a single point of view. Rather, identity narratives articulate multiple affiliations that, often, cohere in an uneasy fashion. Our identities are not incoherent, but such multiplicity provides the opportunity for talking about identity in novel ways. Second, I argue that social relationships are an integral part of identity stories that work to introduce, close off, balance, and rebalance possible self-identifications. In talking about identity, we narrativize our social relationships, and these narrated relationships are key points in the plotline of our identity stories. Drawing on this interpretation, I argue that social policies that equalize power relations and allow for the creation of social relationships based on mutual respect have the potential to shape identities that, without giving up valued affiliations, contain an acceptance of the other at their core.<br>

Abstract: A distinction is drawn between theatricality and dramaturgy as modes for interpreting social and religious life. By means of theatricality scholars tend to analyze life as "theater," as "playacting" or "role-playing." Theater is viewed as a metaphor for what "actually" occurs in life. By contrast, dramaturgists interpret life as essentially dramatic in its interpersonal and collective aspects, whether the drama is significant or trivial, good or poor, "genuine" or "theatrical." But there are certain elements and conditions which must be present in order to increase the possibility of the deeper levels of drama. Religious, social and moral life do not routinely achieve these levels, but when it happens the participants and persons in the active audience can recognize the moment as extraordinary, perhaps as an event of awesome significance. It is within these moments that new religious and moral paradigms may arise. At such time role-playing and theatricality are eclipsed but do not totally disappear.<br>

Abstract: Popular music plays important roles in two related films portraying Brazilian slum life. Based on a 1953 play by Vinícius de Morais, Marcel Camus's 1959 film Orfeu Negro, and a 1999 feature by Brazilian director Carlos Diegues titled Orfeu, augment traditional samba styles with bossa nova and rap, respectively. Interpreting musical style as allegorical texts within fictive landscapes, this paper examines conflation and conflict among musical meanings, Brazilian social histories, and discursive identities marking the twentieth century. Broad aspects of Brazilian political and socio-cultural development are implicated, such as authoritarianism, the politics and sociology of race, technological advances, mass media, and modes of modernisation. Here, bossa nova and rap engage society through reflexive and generative interpretations within a narrative designed to illustrate connections between processes of innovative, trans-national cultural production, myths of national identity, social change, and the powerful role of popular music in film.<br>

Abstract: In this essay I argue that childbearing and various kinds of organ donation are morally analogous activities. I argue, further, that the ethos of giftgiving ought to inform our analyses of both of these forms of bodily life support. This reframing of the abortion and organ donation debates yields new insights into two relatively neglected subtopics. First, though frequently asserted, few have demonstrated why bodily life support--especially in the form of childbearing--cannot be morally required. This comparison yields insights into the reasons for such an axiom. Second, while the giving of bodily life support is sometimes exhorted and almost always respected and admired, its intelligibility and political meaningfulness as a moral choice is rarely explored. This analogical wager reveals why one ought to give another bodily life support. In summary, the analogy yields insights crucial to the development of cogent arguments regarding both the grounds for and limits of the responsibility to give bodily life support. Further, the analogy displays the disparity between what has been demanded traditionally of those who are pregnant and of those men (and women) who by virtue of tissue or blood type can offer other forms of bodily life support. The analogy enables reflection on abortion (and organ donation) to develop in a context free of sexist biases. Finally, efforts are made to assess this giftgiving ethos in light of the feminist "hermeneutics of suspicion" regarding arguments which have and can sacralize victimization.<br>

Abstract: The essay sets forth a historical style in ethics. At the center is the explication of meanings forming the life worlds of representative actors in concrete situations. The sense of life world is sketched in terms of intentionality, intersubjectivity, temporality and embodiment. The essay then delineates the kinds of interpretative activity relevant for understanding life situations: the application of received conventions; suspicion of those conventions as distortions of underlying personal/social dynamics; and a dialectical interplay between a retrieval of one's own traditions, and hospitality to understandings of others differently oriented to the situations in question. The goal is the achievement of common ground which enables us to determine "fitting" action, or at least to keep open the wholeness it promises.<br>

Abstract: Stanley Hauerwas, in developing what he calls "an ethics of character," discusses the importance of vision, imagination, and community for the shaping of character by means of "stories." Hauerwas convincingly argues that if persons are to be Christian disciples, they must allow their own way of life to be shaped by the story of Jesus' life. What Hauerwas does not undertake to explain is how the literary impact of stories (where vision, imagination and community become operative) affects the shaping of character. In this essay, I will demonstrate how the literary impact of one type of story, viz., the parable, can affect the shaping of character.<br>

Abstract: Albert Speer's life offers a paradigm of self-deception, and his autobiography serves to illustrate Fingarette's account of self-deception as a persistent failure to spell out our engagements in the world. Using both Speer and Fingarette, we show how self-deception becomes our lot as the stories we adopt to shape our lives cover up what is destructive in our activity. Had Speer not settled for the neutral label of "architect," he might have found a story substantive enough to allow him to recognize the implications of his engagements with Hitler's Reich. This side of Auschwitz we require a story which allows us to appropriate our own capacities for evil and yet empowers us to go on.<br>

Author(s): Nussbaum Martha<br>
Abstract: In "Upheavals of Thought", Martha Nussbaum offers a theory of the emotions. She argues that emotions are best conceived as thoughts, and she argues that emotion-thoughts can make valuable contributions to the moral life. She develops extensive accounts of compassion and erotic love as thoughts that are of great moral import. This paper seeks to elucidate what it means, for Nussbaum, to say that emotions are forms of thought. It raises critical questions about her conception of the structure of emotion, and about her conception of compassion, in particular. Finally, the paper seeks to show how analyzing the structure, as well as the moral value, of the emotions ultimately requires entering the realm of religious ethics.<br>

Abstract: One way into the question of the relation of ethics and liturgy is to focus on a critical issue facing liturgy today: its impoverishment and inability to nurture Christian faith and life. Three aspects of this problem are: injustice within the worshipping community, disagreement regarding forms of Christian service to the world, and the breakdown of symbols. Ethics must move beyond the articulation of formal principles and assertions regarding the importance of liturgy for the moral agent if it is to fulfill its task vis-à-vis these problems.<br>

Abstract: Vico maintained that metaphor is a fundamental process of human mental life which bridges the gap between emotion and cognition. This Vichian perspective is reflected in areas of critical theory treating metaphor and other tropes, particularly their use in narrative. In psychology too, the significance of metaphor is increasingly recognized despite the Cartesian emphasis on literal thought and language in contemporary psychology's central paradigm, cognitive science. The paper compares the Cartesian and Vichian perspectives and suggests that the former limits the integrated treatment of cognition and emotion. This is illustrated with an example of how a child's feelings about a distressing situation are both revealed and changed in storytelling. The Vichian perspective is more appropriate to understanding this therapeutic interaction of cognition and emotion through metaphoric narrative play. This perspective has significant echoes in psychoanalytic and textual studies suggesting how sensitivity to the latent content of narrative metaphors offers both speaker and hearer a unique insight into the experience of the narrator.<br>

Abstract: In this paper I develop a phenomenology of falling ill by presenting, interpreting and developing the basic model we find in Jean-Paul Sartre's Being and Nothingness (1956). The three steps identified by Sartre in this process are analysed, developed further and brought to a five- step model: (1) pre-reflective experience of discomfort, (2) lived, bodily discomfort, (3) suffered illness, (4) disease pondering, and (5) disease state. To fall ill is to fall victim to a gradual process of alienation, and with each step this alienating process is taken to a new qualitative level. Consequently, the five steps of falling ill have not only a contingent chronological order but also a kind of logical order, in that they typically presuppose each other. I adopt Sartre's focus on embodiment as the core ground of the alienation process, but point out that the alienation of the body in illness is not only the experience of a psychic object, but an experience of the independent life of one's own body. This facticity of the body is the result neither of the gaze of the other person, nor of a reflection adopting the outer perspective of the other in an indirect way, but is a result of the very otherness of one's own body, which addresses and plagues us when we fall ill. I use examples of falling ill and being a patient to show how a phenomenology of falling ill can be helpful in educating health-care personnel (and perhaps also patients) about the ways of the lived body.<br>

Author(s): Fink-Jensen Kirsten<br>
Abstract: In this paper Kirsten Fink-Jensen suggests how a phenomenological-hermeneutic perspective can contribute to the knowledge of learning and teaching processes in music education in school The philosophical frame is Danish philosophy of life, represented by Knud Ejler Løgstrup, and Merleau-Ponty's philosophy of body, both pointing to the wholeness of mind and body in all kinds of actions. Within this framework interpretation is an epistemological, practical-hermeneutic activity based on different analytical methods. Phenomenologically, experiences of music are constituted in an intertwinement of personal, cultural, and local meaning. The challenge facing the teacher is then to understand what becomes meaningful to persons in a given situation. 'Bodily dialogue' is a metaphor of a hermeneutic process of understanding that highlights the importance of bodily aspects in the teacher's answer to a child's musical attuned articulations. This focus can facilitate children's learning processes and change and qualify the teacher's didactic reflections on the impact and progression of music lessons.<br>

Abstract: By focusing on children involved in the ritual practices in Ambonwari village, East Sepik Province, Papua New Guinea, this essay compares two types of ritual: that of healing and that of male initiation. Like other life crisis rituals both deal with two dimensions of the Ambonwari life-world, that is with the living and the dead and, in a broader sense, with people and spirits. Though both are based upon the same cosmology there are fundamental differences between them. First, healers in healing ceremonies treat uninitiated children as 'non-beings'. From the perspective of Ambonwari 'selves' or 'beings', children belong to this domain. They exist as extensions of their parents or carers, from whom they cannot be separated conceptually. Second, by examining the Ambonwari concepts of negation I show that healers do not approach the domain of cosmological non-existence: they are not concerned with the cosmogony of the Ambonwari life-world. The male initiation rituals do just the opposite, however. It is only in the male initiation ritual, seen as a cosmogonic event, that young boys are cut off from their parents and 'thrown' abruptly into a state of becoming. Unlike the healing rites, these rituals treat young boys as both Ambonwari beginnings and Ambonwari beings. I argue that Ambonwari initiation rituals are not concerned with symbolic death followed by rebirth, but with states of being. Initiation means that death becomes possible for a child. The initiated boy will now be able to die as an Ambonwari being.<br>

Abstract: Na la meditação «em que se pretende não falar de valor», o autor esforça-se por manter um discurso linear sobre o interesse humano de pensar e agir relativamente a um tema tão fundamental, que parece quase impossivel evitar a «petitio principii». Pode-se sintetizar a primeira meditação nestas duas alíneas: (a) O desejo de felicidade é o grande motor da busca de meios para uma vida sempre melhor; (b) O ser humano estrutura a sua ideia de felicidade, vida, meios adequados, objectivos de graus diversos, em função dos conhecimentos de que disōpe. A 2 a meditação reconhece que a neutralidade de discurso da 1a meditação não teve éxito. As palavras são extremamente analógicas e pressupōem um «pensamento e discurso ocultos» , coniventes com o conceito de valor, que se pretendia evitar. O desejo de plenitude da qualidade de vida implica o acto, por vezes inconsciente, de valorização. /// The 1.st meditation aims to maintain a discourse independent of the concept of value. Like in an « Impossible mission», we face a project that easily forces the adventurer to return over his lost pathways in a desert. I. e., falling in a «petitio principii». The result of that l. st meditation could be synthesized as it follows: (a) The desire of hapiness is what forces us to search a better and better quality of life; (b) Human beings structure their idea of hapiness. life, adequate means to various kinds of objectives, according to their available knowledge. The 2. nd meditation recognizes the failure of the searched neutral discourse in the l. st meditation: its words and concepts exemplify a very deep analogy and reveal an occult system of thought and discourse, where the notion of value is unmistakably implicated. The desire of a quality of life in all its richness implies, although some times unconsciously, the act of evaluation.<br>

Abstract: Augustine's conversion is considered exemplary for its Christian testimony. However, the psychological aspects are also relevant, for Augustine's conversion to Christianity was as much inspired by personal and cultural ambitions as by religious convictions. For Augustine, the conversion to the Christian faith spelled a life of asceticism— a life of celibacy, a virtuous and chaste existence, which also offered him a means of escape from the threatening ambiguity of parental relations and a chance to realize the cultural ideal of the civilized philosopher who has subjugated the passions of the flesh. In this paper we explore the psychological dynamics of the absent father, the suffering mother and the prodigal son and the role they played in Augustine's conversion to Christianity.<br>

Abstract: J. Robert Oppenheimer was among the most important and enigmatic figures in 20th century science. He is best known for successfully directing the Manhattan Project that produced the first atomic bombs that were dropped on Japan at the end of World War II. Subsequently, he became a scientist and statesman who advised the United States government in the areas of atomic weapons development and public policy. He later became subject to an investigation in 1954 into his previous political affiliations and his personal behavior that ended in the revoking of his security clearance. This essay seeks to chronicle Oppenheimer's coming of age as a public intellectual with a view toward his own psychological history and most especially in relationship to the stages of faith development articulated by James Fowler and colleagues. Moreover, though not conventionally religious, Oppenheimer's life and thought were permeated with themes and ideas of a religious and ethical nature that shaped his adult character and informed his view of the world. This essay was originally presented at The Richardson History of Psychiatry Research Seminar at Weill Cornell Medical College.<br>

Abstract: Memory brings the past into the present. It is a feature of human temporality, contingency, and identity. Attention to memory's psychological and social importance suggests new vistas for work in religious ethics. This essay examines four recent works on memory's importance for self-interpretation, social criticism, and public justice. My focus will be on normative questions about memory. The works under review ask whether, and on what terms, we have an obligation to remember, whether memory is linked to neighbors near and distant, how memory is related to justice and forgiveness, and whether memory sits easily with the kind of relationships that allegedly characterize life in democratic public culture.<br>

Abstract: Although anthropologists have discredited use of the liberal and secular concept of "agency" for explaining Muslim women's behavior, their evidence comes from women who still appear rather agentive to Western readers, hence, muting the necessity and consequences of discovering and applying the women's own ethical and religious terms in their analysis. In Guinea's rural Fouta Djallon, women are not prone to mobilize and make self-interested decisions with immediately observable outcomes. Therefore, understanding them on their own terms requires greater attention to their religious frameworks, namely, to their use of visions of creation and afterlife to define themselves and strategize for redemption.<br>

Abstract: Le sujet est la construction identitaire des lesbiennes qui se perçoivent elles-mêmes comme masculines et qui sont ainsi perçues par leur entourage: par les lesbiennes aussi bien que par les autres personnes. Le "masculin" est envisagé comme une création dans et par la hiérarchie de genre.L'au teure a mené pendant un an une enquête dans une discothèque; 19 histoires de vie apportent leur témoignage. Au terme de ses recherches, la masculinité en question apparaît: 1) comme une manière supportable d'être une femme pour celles qui ne sereconnaissent pas dans le stéréotype féminin; 2) comme un "paysage", c'est-àdire comme quelque chose dontlalesbienne trouve les traits dans le système de genres de la société et dont elle s'empare, faute de mieux ou d'autre chose, pour manifester son refus de la position genrée à quoi la société l'assigne. This article is about the construction of identity among lesbians who perceive themselves and are perceived as "masculine" by others, including other lesbians. The "masculine" is seen by the author as a construction of the gender hierarchy. The author has conducted interviews for a year in a bar and has collected 19 life-stories.Her findings show that the masculinity attributed to lesbians is: 1) a way of making tolerable the fact of being a woman for those women who do not accept the feminine stereotypes; 2) a landscape: an environment made up by lesbians with elements they find in society's gender system, for lack of alternative models, and which they use to express their refusal of the gendered position society wants to assign them.<br>

Abstract: Cet article commente la parution, en 1996, d'un ouvrage édité par la Maison des sciences de l'homme sous la direction de Daniel Fabre : L'Europe entre cultures et nations. Confrontés à une prolifération des études qui se réclament aujourd'hui d'une « ethnologie de l'Europe », les auteurs (qui furent au préalable réunis en colloque à Tours en 1993) s'efforcent d'accomplir une mission limite : consolider les bornes d'un savoir labélisé en exerçant leur puissance de discernement sur les études mises en confrontation. En est-ce ou n'en est-ce pas ? Telle serait, ici, la question. This article comments the publication in 1996 of the book Europe between cultures and nations edited by Daniel Fabre. Confronted today with a proliferation of studies claiming they are concerned with "European ethnology" the authors (who met previously at the Conference in Tours in 1993) try to accomplish a mission : confirm the limits of a labelled knowledge by exerting their capacity of discrimination between the studies confronted. Dieser Artikel kommentiert das Buch Europa zwischen Kulturen und Nationen, das unter der Leitung von Daniel Fabre in 1996 veröffentlicht wurde. Konfrontiert mit der schnellen Zunahme von Studien, die sich heute auf Europäische Ethnologie berufen, versuchen die Autoren (die in 1993 an der Konferenz in Tours zusammentrafen) eine Mission zu erfüllen : die Grenzen eines labellierten Wissens zu sichern, indem sie ihr Unterscheidungsvermögen auf die verschiedenen Studien ausüben.<br>

Abstract: En étudiant les récits de vie des paysans roumains du Banat et d'Olténie déportés dans les années cinquante dans la plaine de Bǎrǎgan, nous avons essayé de mettre en évidence de quelle façon le récit de vie peut être un révélateur d'une réalité ethno-historique et anthropologique. Nous avons souligné le problème d'ordre méthodologique qu'une telle étude pose au chercheur. Dans un premier temps, nous avons discuté le statut discursif du récit de vie comme discours de témoignage, et les conséquences qui en dérivent pour son analyse comme texte narratif et argumentatif qui développe une rhétorique spécifique. Une description du contexte historique auquel font référence les textes, ainsi que des circonstances dans lesquelles l'enquête orale a été menée, nous a semblé nécessaire pour dégager l'importance du thème de l'identité et de la différence dans les récits de nos interlocuteurs. En analysant ce thème, nous avons tenu compte des constellations idéologiques et symboliques qui dominent ces développements dans le texte des critères que les paysans utilisent pour se différencier de l'Autre sous ses différents visages. L'analyse de ces facteurs suggère des pistes intéressantes pour déceler certaines mentalités et pratiques culturelles, surtout celles liées au foyer et à la famille et aux pratiques culinaires. Studiind povesteǎ vieţii a 70 de ţǎrani deporţati între anii 1951-1956 în Bǎrǎgan am pus în evidenţǎ problemele de ordin metodologic şi teoretic cu care se confruntǎ cercetǎorul dornic sǎ reconstituie o realitate istoricǎ, etnograficǎ şi antropologicǎ pornind de la mǎrturiile celor ce povestesc evenimentul deportǎrii. Purtînd mǎrcile subiecti viaţii naratorului şi a unei ideologii personale aceste texte sunt în acelaşţi timp naraţiuni şi o formǎ de a depune mǎrturie. Ele dezvoltǎ deci o retoricǎ specialǎ prin care faptul trǎit se transformǎ în fapt povestit şi se comunicǎ unui interlocutor. Analia acestei retorici necesitǎ cunoaşterea discursurilor prin care evenimentul ne parvine, a condiţiilor în care s-a desfǎşurat ancheta, compararea povestirilor între ele pentru a constata apropierile diferenþele şi mai ales diferitele tipuri de focalizǎri. Acestea din urmǎ ne permit sa sesizǎm ce e mai important pentru cel ce povesteşte şi de ce. Pentru a ilustra aceasta problematicǎ ne-am oprit la tema identitǎţii şi alţeritǎţii, încercînd sǎ urmǎrim constelatiile idéologice şi culturale sub semnul cǎrora stau expansiunile ei in texte, criteriile prin care Celǎlalt este identificat şi prezentat. Through the study of the life stories told by the Romanian peasants of Banat and Oltenie, who were deported during the 1950s to the plain of Baragan, this article attempts to show how such biographical accounts can serve to reveal an ethno-historical and anthropological reality.We begin by underlining the methodological problems that such studies pose for the researcher. We discuss the discursive status of these accounts as a discourse intended to bear witness and the implications of this status for an analysis as a narrative and argumentative text, generating its own specific rhetoric. Along with an account of how this oral enquiry was carried out, it also seemed necessary to give a description of the historical context to which these accounts refer, in order to draw attention to the theme of identity and difference in the accounts given. The analysis of this theme required that due attention be paid do the ideological and symbolic constellations that surround it, in the criteria that the peasants use to differentiate the Other, in his or her multifarious guises. The examination of these factors offers several interesting lines of enquiry on cultural practices and mentalities, and on those in particular which relate to the household, the family and culinary habits. Indem wir die Lebensgeschichten der rumänischen Bauern aus Banat und Oltenie studierten, die in den fünfziger Jahren in die Ebene von Baragan vertrieben wurden, versuchten wir, herauszustellen, wie die Lebensgeschichte eine volksgeschichtliche und anthropologische Wirklichkeit ans Licht stellen kann. Wir haben das methodologische Problem betont, die sich für den Forscher aus derartigen Studie ergibt. Zuerst haben wir den erzählerischen Status der Lebenserzählung als Zeugnisrede erörtert, sowohl als auch die Folgen, die sich daraus ergeben, wenn sie als erzählender und argumentierender Text analysiert werden soll, der eine spezifische Rhetorik entwickelt. Eine Schilderung des historischen Zusammenhangs, worauf sich die Texte beziehen, und der Umstände, unter denen die mündliche Befragung sich abspielte, kam uns als notwendig vor, um die Bedeutung des Themas der Identität und des Unterschieds in den Erzählungen unserer Gesprächspartner hervorzuheben. In der Analyse dieses Themas nahmen wir die ideologischen und symbolischen Konstellationen in Kauf, die in den Textstellen vorherrschend sind, wo die Kriterien dargelegt werden, die die Bauern benutzen, um sich von dem Anderen unter seinen verschiedenen Gesichten zu unterscheiden. Die Analyse dieser Faktoren legt uns interessante Forschungswege nahe, die es erlauben, manche Denkweisen und kulturelle Verhaltensweisen herauszuheben, und zwar insbesondere diejenigen, die mit dem Heim -, Familienleben und Kochsitten verbunden sind.<br>

Abstract: Pour perpétuer des éléments fondateurs de la culture, les communautés des diasporas utilisent leur espace privé comme territoire privilégié de la conservation et de l'expression d'une identité exilée. L'exemple des Arméniens du Québec est, à cet égard, particuliérement révélateur tant dans la composition de sa culture matérielle et immatérielle que dans les pratiques qui la mettent en scène par l'entremise de petits musées domestiques. À partir d'un recueil de récits de vie et de biographies d'objets, l'article propose d'établir le portrait de ces structures muséales et de leurs collections à l'échelle familiale pour ensuite saisir leur oeuvre dans le projet de transmission culturelle. Living in a Diaspora commands an increased vigilance for the perpetuation of the founding elements of a culture. In this perspective, in a host country, the private sphere and its heritage constitute a privileged space for the preservation and expression of the exiled identity. This can be seen in domestic museums, such as those of Quebec's Armenian community, where the composition of material and immaterial culture and the presentation of its contents are particularly revealing. From a collection of life narratives and object biographies, this article proposes to draw a portrait of these family-scale museum structures and their collections to understand how they function in the project of cultural transmission. Um elementare Bestandteile ihrer Kultur zu erhalten, nutzen kulturelle Gemeinschaften in der Diaspora gerne den privaten Raum als Statte des Ausdrucks ihrer Exilidentität. Die Gemeinschaft der in Quebec lebenden Armenier ist hierfür ein sehr gutes Beispiel, sowohl was ihre materielle und immaterielle Kultur angeht als auch im Hinblick auf die Art und Weise wie sie ihre Kultur in kleinen hauslichen Museen inszenieren. An Hand von menschlichen wie auch gegenständlichen Biographien porträtiert die Autorin in diesem Artikel die musealen Strukturen und Familiensammlungen, um das entstandene Werk so in den Prozess der kulturellen Überlieferung einzubetten.<br>

Abstract: Traditional sources of sociohistorical data capture only a narrow sense of past lifeworlds. Ethnographic accounts often preserve greater details of social practice but have less clear guidelines for use as data. We evaluate the use of hermeneutical theory as providing guidelines for a method by which ethnographies may be used as sociohistorical data. Hermeneutical analysis of ethnographic "texts" is used to reconstruct patterns of daily life in early-twentieth-century rural Appalachia. This method involves: (1) concept-critique to separate observations from the theoretical framework of the ethnographic account, and (2) validation through a logic of internal consistency and comparison. Through hermeneutical analysis, ethnographics can be made to yield observations of social relations not otherwise available. Our analysis suggests benefits and drawbacks of hermeneutical analysis of ethnographic texts.<br>

Abstract: Si la personnalité philosophique de Michel Henry est saluée, son œuvre continue, quarante ans apres L'essence de la manifestation, à ne pas être reçue, ou à ne l'être que sur la base de malentendus. Pourquoi ? Les raisons alléguées peuvent sembler faibles (le ton absolu de Michel Henry, l'indifférence politique ou la sensibilité de droite qu'on lui prête, etc.), elles renvoient (la reconnaissance généralement faite de la « puissance » de sa pensée, ce qui est pressenti avec ce terme, plaident en ce sens) à une autre, plus décisive : la réception n'est pas la réception dans le monde mais la reception dans la vie, de la vie par elle-même – ce qui néanmoins serait la condition d'une politique pour notre temps. If Michel Henry's philosophical personality is indeed hailed, his work goes on, forty years after The Essence of Manifestation, not being received but on the basis of misunderstandings. Why ? The alleged reasons may seem rather weak (e.g. Michel Henry's absolute tone, his so-called political indifference, or his right-winged sensitiveness) ; they refer to another, more decisive, one (what is usually acknowledged as a potency of thought) : reception does not mean reception in this very world, but in life, which nonetheless would be the condition of a new politics of our time.<br>

Abstract: Que ce soit à l'IUFM ou à l'Université en Sciences de l'Éducation, les enseignants sont de plus en plus confrontés à la diversité des expériences des parcours de formation des étudiants à qui ils s'adressent. Cette pluralité n'impose-t-elle pas un changement des pratiques de formation et notamment le développement, dans les groupes de travail, d'une communication favorisant la symbiose des divers apports culturels de ces étudiants ? L'utilisation des biographies ou des histoires de vie en formation ne peut-elle pas permettre d'instrumenter ce travail et notamment faciliter la prise en compte des itinéraires individuels de formation ? The students are more specifically invited to meditate on the development of their curriculum. The building of their formative biography creates the mental space that is needed to question the ideas and notions which will allow them to use biography as an instrument to identify the mental representations as well as the events and situations of their life from which the individual, collective, social and cultural dimensions of their activities emerged. In this sense, this research and training shows that formative life history can allow us to distance ourselves from a priori assumptions, as well as introduce students to different methods of research.<br>

Abstract: This article argues for a synthesis of George Herbert Mead's conception of the temporal and intersubjective nature of the self with Paul Ricoeur's hermeneutic theory of narrative identity. Combining the insights of Ricoeur's philosophical analysis with Mead's social-psychological orientation provides a subtle, sophisticated, and potent explanation of self-identity. A narrative conception of identity implies that subjectivity is neither a philosophical illusion nor an impermeable substance. Rather, a narrative identity provides a subjective sense of self-continuity as it symbolically integrates the events of lived experience in the plot of the story a person tells about his or her life. The utility of this conception of identity is illustrated through a rereading of Erving Goffman's study of the experience of mental patients. This example underlines the social sources of the self-concept and the role of power and politics in the construction of narrative identities.<br>

Abstract: In a variety of ways, all ethnographies are politically cast and policy relevant. Each of three recurrent political rhetorics is related to a unique set of fieldwork practices. Ethnographies that report holistically on journeys to "the other side" build policy/political significance by contesting popular stereotypes. Theoretical ethnographies draw on political imagination to fill in for a lack of variation in participant observation data and to model an area of social life without attempting to rule out alternative explanations. Comparative analytic studies build political relevance by revealing social forces that are hidden by local cultures. Each of these three genres of ethnographic methodology faces unique challenges in relating fieldwork data to politically significant explanations. By shaping the ethnographers relations to subjects and readers, each methodology also structures a distinctive class identity for the researchers-as worker, as aristocrat, or as bourgeois professional.<br>

Abstract: A fierce opponent of the historicist approach to literature that dominated French academe during his lifetime, the essayist and poet Charles Péguy (1873–1914) would theorize an alternative literary method that through the act of faithful and participatory reading could transcend the limitations of historicism. Outlined in his dialogue with History, Clio, Péguy's vision of the literary act is that of an intersubjective operation of mutual understanding between reader and author, in which the living relevance of literary works extends beyond their narrow historical origins; a conception that prefigures the formalist and hermeneutic literary approaches that will arise decades later.<br>

Abstract: As oral historians, we devote a great deal of time to painstakingly designing our projects, cognizant of the fact that our research requires us to interact with human beings in often intimate ways. For this same reason, though, our careful methodology and meticulously designed projects are constantly being tested. This article is a reflection on some of the ethical and methodological challenges that the authors faced during their life story interviews with Holocaust survivors in Montreal, Canada. In particular, it explores three major themes: the elaborate process of learning to "share authority" and build trust with interviewees; the limitations of "deep listening" and their implications; and the struggle to deal with contentious politics, such as perceived racism, that emerged out of some interviews. Reflection on these methodological and ethical challenges not only opens up a wider and important discussion among researchers about how practice relates to theory but also teaches us about our interviewees. For example, what does an interviewee's refusal to engage deeply about his or her past tell us about how they formed their identity in the aftermath of mass violence? Challenges, such as this one, are part of the story. They shed light on questions of narrative formation, the identity politics that result from survival, and how individual memory interacts with dominant narratives about atrocity. They force us to recognize that both our interviewees—and ourselves—are human beings, and not just collections of stories.<br>

Abstract: O presente artigo propõe uma interpretação do fenômeno Chico Xavier na cultura e na sociedade brasileira. A partir do reconhecimento da importância cruciai de seu modelo mítico de espírita exemplar, o lugar de absolute destaque ocupado pelo médium mineiro na história do kardecismo brasileiro será interpretado à luz de urn código cultural articulado em sua biografia, que busca sintetizar os personagens paradigmáticos do "santo" e do "caxias". Desdobrado na unidade de sua obra mediúnica e trajetória pública, o tipo de espiritismo construído em Chico Xavier evidencia a proposta kardecista dominante ao longo do século XX, enquanto modelo de cidadania, prática religiosa e projeto nacional. The present article is a reading of the place of the phenomenon Chico Xavier in the Brazilian culture and society. Starting from the recognition of his crucial importance as a mythical model of exemplary spiritualist, the absolute prominence of the medium in the history of the Brazilian spiritualism will be interpreted in the light of a cultural code articulated in his biography, that synthesizes the Brazilian mythical characters of the "saint" and of the "caxias". Unfolded from his life and works the model of spiritualism built by Chico Xavier evidences the kardecismo's dominant religious point of view along the 20th Century, while citizenship model, religious practice and national project.<br>

Author(s): ZookAbstract: "The Budget" is a newspaper which has served Amish communities for over a hundred years by disseminating community news to Amish settlements across North America. The main feature of this newspaper are newsletters written by volunteers from local Amish settlements, called "scribes," who report news and happenings from their church districts. In this study the generic characteristics of the newsletters are identified, as is their role in the reproduction of Amish cultural values. The newsletters display generic consistency demonstrated in the predictable location, form, and content of the components of the newsletter. Scribes' reports of community news report events which are central to maintaining the importance of the interpersonal basis of Amish community life, and serve to maintain those items as reportable and noteworthy topics in the Amish communicative economy.<br>

Abstract: This study employs hermeneutics to illuminate a musical life history. I Made Lebah was a unique individual who lived during a violent and creative time of Bali's history. This paper explores his life through the lens of hermeneutics and identifies music stages through segmented, progressive hermeneutical arcs within his lifelong arc of experience. A consciousness of historical situatedness and an enabling appropriation allowed him to master a number of Balinese music styles and assume the title, "great teacher." The people he worked with, including composers Lotring and Colin McPhee and his lifelong friend, Agung Mandra, all affected him and helped him to acquire a self-awareness, a rapid learning and internalization process, and a sensitivity to reflective hermeneutics.<br>

Abstract: This article explores kwaito's early years by focusing on South African music legend Brenda Fassie. While Fassie is not usually known as a kwaito artist, her "bubblegum" music of the 1980s was hugely influential on later kwaito musicians, and in the early 1990s Fassie recorded several tracks that arguably fall under the category of kwaito. An analysis of Fassie's life and music does not represent a clear break with earlier South African music. I attempt a more nuanced historicization of kwaito in this article, and seek to uncover continuities as well as ruptures in the post-apartheid period.<br>

Abstract: Singing songs in service (kirtan seva) constitutes the primary expression of devotion in the Pushti Marg (Path of Grace) tradition of India. This liturgical practice is singular amongst South Asian, Hindu traditions in its extensive use of rag set to classical poetry. I consider the meaning of this sung liturgy using the ideas of hermeneutic philosophy that concern understanding. I suggest that performing song in service is similar to the act of understanding a work, one in which a self is disclosed in the mode of play. Critically, such continual self-unveilings over a lifetime of service to Krishna afford the practitioner the possibility of the lived liberation promised by founder, Vallabhacharya.<br>

Abstract: Although today much of the Mayo-Yoreme sacred myths and their inherent symbolism is rather esoteric knowledge, known to a few only, the community's performance of the responso (ritual of honoring the dead) is important for the re-establishment of relationships between humans and the supernatural beings and between living persons and the ancestors. The communal experience of the responso and the sense of beingenjoined are characteristic of the spiritual experience and fundamental to the musical experience as well Since life/death of any individual is an experience tied to other individuals, I argue that a philosophical inquiry of selfhood—of both the individual and the community—may help us reason about and make possible an understanding of the responso.<br>

Abstract: Critics have pointed out that in many contemporary cities wasteful modes of consumption, encouraged and facilitated by fantastic developments in technology, have significantly eroded the values of the traditional urban environment. Contemporary cities very often lack the sense of placeness, vibrant public life, and harmonious relationship between man and nature characteristic of the traditional urban environment. This article studies how the configuration of the physical boundary may be used as an important tool to reconstitute these values in contemporary cities. It suggests that the boundary is more than an abstract pattern of lines. Rather, it is integral to life within the city, and should possess greater significance in the design of the built environment.<br>

Abstract: As violence escalates among black males in many sectors of American life, thinkers are forced to seek solutions to this problem from a variety of perspectives. Inspired largely by a 1994 black fraternity hazing death, this article examines violence as a societal construct, not one intrinsic to individuals. The paradigmatic possibilities this approach brings to bear include: (1) the establishment of an unseverable link between race and class when studying marginalization, (2) the societal politicalization of black males in their struggle for identity, and (3) a societal approach to questions of freedom, identity, and violence where the black male is concerned.<br>

Abstract: Valentin Lebedev is a pioneer of space and earth science in Russia. He is also the first ethnographic diarist of outer space. In 1982, while "on orbit" for 211 days as a fieldworking cosmonaut, Lebedev produced a thickly descriptive account of the intimate sociality and technoculture of the Soviet space complex Salyut 7. Crafted to defamiliarize (ostranenie) a spaceworld that publics saw as flawlessly engineered and managed, the diary is an argument for the value of exospheric (exo-) surprise in human experience. But on another level, we learn that the surprise is on humans who would claim to conquer "space-as-itself"—a "zero gravity" environment of force fields both extremely inhospitable to life as we know it and also generative of life in all its expressions.<br>

Abstract: This paper attempts to compare two lives, that of Ramana Maharshi, the beloved cereberal sage of South India, and Sigmund Freud, the founding father of psychoanalysis. Much has been written on both these individuals, so what this paper does is to focus on affliction as a source of insight about life, detachment, pain, existentialism and coping. By taking narratives which delineate a historical plane on which illness can be coded, I try to understand the anthromorphic nature of suffering and its consequences in these two great lives. Individuals reflect the culture of which they are a part, so what we receive through the narratives which tell us about them is significant in terms of their similarities and their differences. Who authors narratives which we analyse is of utmost significance, and both feminism and narrative analyses looks at social anthropology as benefiting from the question of the writing subject. The Nirvana principle works in Ramana Maharshi's case to create a comfort zone for helping us to think of death as dream, in Freud it works as a comfort zone to cope with existence. Human beings work with ideas in order to evaluate the nature of life and survival, or with death as an attribute which too is natural and part of the order of reality. Paul Ricoeur's work helps me to build a bridge between the two thinkers, Ramana Maharshi and Freud, in terms of the application of the concepts of Eros, Thanatos and Ananke.<br>

Abstract: This essay examines the manner in which Peter Singer exceeds the boundaries of ethical reasoning in arguing his position on life ethics. Specifically, it probes a narrative aesthetic that functions as rhetorical proof in his work. Attention is given to demonstrating the presence of ironic aesthetics in this narrative. Thereafter two conceptual structures—consubstantiality and ironic catharsis—are elaborated in order to show how Singer uses irony in an attempt to shape audience attitudes toward the traditional life ethics position.<br>

Abstract: Improvements in treatments for childhood cancers have led to an "epidemic" of survival. Yet we have limited understanding about the overall ramifications of survival and quality of extended life for this growing population of young people. In this paper I consider lived experiences of longterm survival following cancer in childhood from a social science perspective. I explore young people's negotiations of narrative identity and associated processes of coming to terms with their own subjective position as young adult survivors. Discussion is based on qualitative data collected from 57 young adults in 2000. I focus on three concepts that help to discern ways in which cancer becomes enmeshed in personal identity — the Delta factor, narrative dissonance and narrative repair.<br>

Abstract: In this essay, I partake in a self-inventory to textually narrate for you as well as myself the relationship, as I experience it, between stories and theories in my intellectual life. My autobiographical reflections span the period of the 1947 partition in Indian history, as experienced by my family, to my own journey as a scholar. I tell you, in personal narrative and essay form, a family story of resistance to "refugee narratives" as a story of inherited displacements that interrogates the ontology of my intellectual leanings, by showing the various limens (see Turner's The Anthropology of Performance) that I continue to encounter in my struggles to story. In doing so, I articulate my resistance to theory, my leanings toward storying, and the ongoing struggle to reside in the liminal space between stories and theories. I show myself caught in intellectual limens. While I do not propose any way out of them, I believe that explorations such as these are necessary for scholars to reflect, interrogate, and embody to honestly pursue their intellectual endeavors.<br>

Abstract: A theory of the embodiment of action is proposed. Reflections on relations between human intentions, the human body and the notion of agency lead us to argue that phenomenological analysis is not sufficient for such a theory. Our consideration, that the most fundamental level of embodied agency is that of life itself, brings us to the philosophy of biology and the theory of the organism: briefly, certain parts of the natural environment are intrinsic to the constitution of organisms and, in their more sophisticated configuration, as agents. Action is embodied in the sense that certain physiological processes are internal in relation to it and play a constitutive role in its performance. The way in which environment, context and consciousness affect and constitute the nature of agency at personal and sub-personal levels is elaborated. We see that human agents perceive and act upon their world through a complex shifting between those levels. A summary of the ways in which the social sciences can be enriched by this more comprehensive view of human agency provides the basis of justification for claiming Actor-Network Theory (ANT), originally developed by sociologists studying science and technology, as a promising framework for the continuation of this reasoning.<br>

Abstract: The article advances an interpretation of the self as an imaginary object. Focusing on the relationship between selfhood and memory in Sartre's The Transcendence of the Ego, I argue that Sartre offers useful resources for thinking about the self in terms of narratives. Against interpretations that hold that the ego misrepresents consciousness or distorts it, I argue that the constitution of the ego marks a radical transformation of the conscious field. To prove this point, I turn to the role of reflection and memory in the creation of the self. Reflection and memory weave past, present and future into a consistent and meaningful life story. This story is no other than the self. I propose to understand the self as a fictional or imaginary entity, albeit one that has real presence in human life.<br>

Abstract: Recent events indicate that self-interest and technicism today triumph over social consciousness; yet educators naturally turn to the humanities as an antidote to positivism and technical domination, even as humanities scholars are increasingly defensive, struggling to hold on to their enclaves. For those committed to the practice of freedom in education the humanities are of vital interest, particularly when they are defined as works that are articulations of some human consciousness thrusting into the world. After giving examples of works that may be classified as "humanities" according to this definition, the following essay discusses teaching situations and literary works which might free persons for awareness of human possibility, for authentic talk and widening perspectives. The humanities must be presented not as monuments to be revered but as works to be shared by students and applied to their own life situations. Students grounded in their "everydayness" can be awakened by Freiré's dialogical method, awakened to crítical consciousness and to the possibility of praxis in a world they share.<br>

Abstract: People think about health and illness in multifaceted ways, evidencing a conceptual complexity that corresponds to equally complex behaviours in relation to a diversity of healing practices. Stimulated by fieldwork in Lesotho and elsewhere, and engaging principally with Jürgen Habermas, we set out to introduce, explain and develop a conceptual innovation: healthworld. We argue that this notion describes and provides a key analytical tool for the field of health in its social context; a tool that can explain the empirical complexity of health beliefs (importantly, including religion) and behaviours, thereby illuminating possibilities for improving health practice and outcomes. Framed in relation to Habermas's notion of lifeworld, the healthworld is identified as a distinctive 'region' of the lifeworld defined by a particular telos – that of comprehensive well-being, a lifeworld without dysfunction.<br>

Abstract: This article is concerned with the ways in which people who work in and use a cancer genetics clinic in the UK talk about the 'gene for cancer'. By conceptualizing such a gene as a boundary object, and using empirical data derived from clinic consultations, observations in a genetics laboratory and interviews with patients, the author seeks to illustrate how the various parties involved adopt different discursive strategies to appropriate, describe and understand what is apparently the 'same' thing. The consequent focus on the ways in which the rhetorical and syntactical features of lay and professional talk interlink and diverge illustrates not merely how our contemporary knowledge of genes and genetics is structured, but also how different publics position themselves with respect to the biochemistry of life.<br>

Abstract: A lively concern for new instruments of knowledge has led sociology, among other disciplines, to collect life stories in order to explore social phenomena. Dialogue and interpersonal communication thus become crucial tools, as well as loci of knowledge. This paper investigates the epistemological suppositions of 'the biographical approach': the quest for identity in the narrative, the dialogical relationship between the narrating self and the researcher, the fixation of speech into text and more. The overall effort of the investigation is to reach criteria of analysis which are not simply borrowed from other areas, but are the outcome of reflection upon the constituent features of life stories. This investigation, however, does not widen the gap between 'qualitative' and 'quantitative' sociology, but rather it contributes to put this division into question.<br>

Abstract: This paper examines reasoning and rhetoric about economic recession in selected newspapers. This is an interesting topic for discourse analysis because it is a site of argumentation. We begin by asking: (1) epistemological questions (e.g. What evidential basis is drawn on in rhetoric about recession?) and then (2) ontological questions (e.g. How is recession pictured? and How is recession coordinated with the social world?). We examine the management of evidence and definitions concerning whether or not there is a recession. We then examine the entities invoked, showing how (a) a range of metaphors depict the recession as either an uncontrollable agent or as a controllable thing; and (b) rhetorical strategies used by both critics and supporters of the government collude in picturing the economy as a realm abstracted from social life.<br>

Abstract: What distinguishes Woolf's prose is not her famous penchant for simile, but her constant use of the less ostentatious, though more radical, verb metaphor. Combining these figures in strings, in which the verbs are consistent but the implied nouns contradictory, Woolf deliberately unsettles the reader, forcing him or her to consider not only the tenuous relations between the word and the world, but the contingent nature of phenomenal reality itself. Thus the view of life as something at once "very shifting" and "very solid" (expressed in the diaries and dramatized in the novels), pervades the essays, captured in the paradoxical relation "it is and is not" that Paul Ricoeur claims lies at the heart of metaphor. A close study of a paradigmatic essay, "On Not Knowing Greek," and of manuscript drafts in New York and Sussex reveals that this tension between shifting and solid extends to the syntax, which manages to be both extravagant and firmly anchored, and to the developing structure of the essay as a whole, which traces a movement of mind (a strategy James Farrell defines as specifically "feminine"), remaining defiantly heuristic and resisting the inherent closure of the formal essay. Thus, like her novels, Woolf s reviews and essays engage us in the process of perception even while inviting us to explore critically the operations of language in that perception.<br>

Abstract: La personnalité, l'activité et l'œuvre de Gonseth peuvent être interprétés organiquement dans une instructive pédagogie de dialogue. L'auteur évoque a) la structure dialogale intime de Gonseth, b) les dialogues peu fructueux qu'il a entretenus avec le Cercle de Vienne, puis lors des Entretiens de Zurich, c) les dialogues qu'il a imaginés dans Les mathématiques et la réalité entre trois personnages: Parfait, Sceptique et Idoine, auxquels vient s'ajouter à la fin le Nouvel Idoine, d) les rencontres avec les néo-scolastiques à Rome, e) la «doctrine» explicite du dialogue exposée dans La loi du dialogue. L'auteur s'interroge aussi sur les conditions d'un dialogue fécond et sur les obstacles qui peuvent s'y opposer, (en particulier: l'incompatibilité des référentiels). Gonseth the man, his life and his work can be interpreted organically in an instructive account of dialogue. The author treats the following topics: a) Gonseth's intimate dialogical structure, b) the fruitless dialogues he had with the Vienna Circle and then at the Entretiens de Zurich, c) his imaginary dialogues in Les mathématiques et la réalité between the characters Perfect, Sceptic and Appropriate, and finally New Appropriate, d) his contacts with neo-scholastics at Rome, e) the explicit 'doctrine' of dialogue presented in La loi du dialogue. The article is also concerned with conditions for a fruitful dialogue and with obstacles that can stand in the way (in particular, the incompatibility of reference systems). Die Persönlichkeit, die Aktivitäten und das Werk Gonseths können im Rahmen einer lehrreichen Pädagogik des Dialogs einheitlich interpretiert werden. Der Autor erörtert a) die intime Dialogstruktur Gonseths; b) die wenig fruchtbaren Dialoge, die er mit dem Wiener Kreis und während der Zürcher Gespräche führte; c) die Dialoge dreier Figuren, die er in Les mathématiques et la réalité in Szene gesetzt hat: Perfekt, Skeptiker und Geeignet, zu denen sich am Schluss der Neue Geeignete hinzugesellt; d) die Begegnungen mit den Neo-Scholastikern in Rom; e) die explizite «Doktrin» des Dialogs, die in La loi du dialogue dargelegt ist. Der Aufsatz stellt auch die Frage nach den Bedingungen eines befruchtenden Dialogs und nach den Hindernissen, die sich ihm entgegenstellen können (im besonderen: die Inkompatibilität der Bezugsrahmen).<br>

Abstract: Giuseppe Capograssi (1889-1956) was an important legal philosopher and had a lively influence on the development of legal studies. The centre of his reflections lay in his many investigations into the concept of experience, which aimed to supersede the prevalent orientation in Italy, focussed on vertexes, emphasizing instead the importance of practices, both on the theoretical level and in the analysis of legal activity and political reality. Capograssi therefore paid great attention to the relationship between state and society viewed in a dynamic and pluralist perspective. No less illuminating are Capograssi's investigations into the value of the constitution and the principle of legality. During the Fascist period, Capograssi upheld the values of individual liberty and democratic principles, seeing as indispensable the continual involvement of citizens in the development of political action. This perspective played a further, particularly important role in the "ideas of Capograssi", after the war and the advent of the republican legal order. According to Capograssi, more space needed to be given to social life and to the spiritual links on which political community is based. In this sense, Capograssi found the teachings of Catholicism fundamental. His Catholicism placed great emphasis on freedom and solidarity and contained a lively, underlying sense of the cultural and spiritual, inspired by the ideal of "charity".<br>

Abstract: The role of nonhumans in social life has recently generated significant scholarly interest. The two main paradigms for explaining the sociological significance of nonhumans are constructivism and actor-network theory. We propose a pragmatist synthesis inspired by George Herbert Mead, demonstrating how interactions with nonhumans help constitute the social self—that is, the identity one constructs by imaginatively looking upon oneself as others would. Drawing upon observations of humans interacting with objects, animals, and nature, we identify two complementary ways that nonhumans organize the social self and enable people to experience group membership in absentia: (1) by molding how one is perceived by others and constraining alternative presentations of self and (2) by acting as a totem that conjures up awareness of, and feelings of attachment to, a particular social group. This formulation moves beyond constructivist claims that nonhumans reflect people's self-definitions, and it offers a corrective to actor-network theory's neglect of sociality.<br>

Abstract: This article has two concerns. The first is with how rural lifeworlds are understood and conceptualized from outside, usually in terms of normative assumptions predicated on notions of unity, consistency, and totality. The second is with how better to articulate the richness and complexity of such lifeworlds. These concerns are set out in terms of an understanding of the relationship between lifeworlds and a spectrum of experience located between twin poles: position and place. It then refers to a number of creative projects in Ireland seen as indicative of a new way of acknowledging and articulating the richness and complexity of rural lifeworlds. Le présent article a un double objet : d'une part, il traite des différentes compréhensions et conceptualisations des mondes de la vie (Lebenswelt) ruraux tels que vus de l'extérieur, principalement en terme des hypothèses normatives reposant sur des idées d'unité, de constance, et de totalité. Dans un deuxième temps, il tente de mieux déterminer et exprimer la complexité et la richesse de ces mondes de vie. Ces préoccupations sont énoncées dans l'optique de la compréhension des relations entre ces mondes de vie et d'une matrice expérientielle située entre deux pôles : positionnement et emplacement. Suit un survol de différents projets créateurs provenant de part et d'autre de l'Irlande qui font état de ces nouvelles façons de reconnaître et d'exprimer la richesse et la complexité des mondes de vie ruraux.<br>

Abstract: Archaeology assumes itself as a discipline through a practice of boundary-making that merges the past with the present. It is, in this practice, increasingly critiqued for being ethnocentric and separating power from the communities it claims to represent. In response, archaeology is experiencing a turn toward "community". Examining two community archaeology case studies, we assess whether archaeology can be transformed into a discipline that productively participates in the liveliness and messy connectedness of objects, peoples, histories and cultures— in contrast to a conventionally detached practice of objectifying other peoples' lifeways. In both cases, archaeological and descent communities play direct and central decision-making roles in this traditionally "distanced" discipline. They demonstrate means of re-figuring archaeology as a participatory practice. Community-founded archaeology is thus shown to transform methods commonly supporting institutional reproduction into a radically indigenous, emically structured, set of knowledge practices and outcomes. Archeologie suppose elle-même comme une discipline à travers une pratique de fabrication limite qui fusionne le passé au présent. Il est, dans cette pratique, plus en plus critiqué pour avoir été puissance ethnocentrique et séparation des communautés qu'elle prétend représenter. En réponse, archéologie connaît un tournant vers une « communauté ». Examen de deux études de cas communautaires archéologie, nous déterminer si archéologie peut se transformer en une discipline qui productivement participe à la vivacité et la connectivité désordre des objets, des peuples, des histoires et des cultures—contrairement à une pratique conventionnelle détachée d'objectiver les modes de vie des autres peuples. En cas, archéologiques et descente communautés jouent des rôles décisionnels directes et centrales dans ce traditionnellement « distanciés » discipline. Ils montrer les moyens de retrouver l'archéologie comme une pratique participative. Archéologie communauté fondée est ainsi montré à transformer les méthodes communément soutien institutionnelle reproduction en un jeu radicalement indigène, emically structuré, de connaissances pratiques et les résultats.<br>

Abstract: The article analyses the paths formed by the lives of four workers in nineteenth century France as a way of focusing on the problem of the relationship between individual life experience and the surrounding environment. The extremely rich biographical material contained in the main source used makes it possible to bring out the total identification between these two terms, which are usually seen as separate and as polar opposites. Individuals are profoundly shaped by the way they are embedded in a social milieu. And this milieu teems, beats and changes together with the individual.<br>

Abstract: If human beings were empirically shown to be irrational, would this finding destroy the foundations of economic science? We think not because we doubt that this postulate is needed as a foundation of economic science. We examine the laboratory experiments conducted by behavioral economists and experimental psychologists on human judgment and decision-making, using Bayes' Theorem and the Expected Value model We examine a number of issues: Can we base ourselves on experimenters' full rationality for doubting of human rationality? Are rational models anything else than handy tools? Do humans' minds function like rational tools or with rational tools? How an "irrational" human being could create anything "rational"? Should rationality be subordinated to reason? Nature being neither rational nor irrational, is there any point in applying the concept of rationality to one its constituents? If human beings were rational forms of life, would this specie have survived?<br>

Abstract: Nathaniel Hawthorne's stories "The Rejected Blessing" and "Rappaccini's Daughter" dramatize ideological competition among doctors and clergymen from Renaissance Italy to colonial Boston over care of the body. In the context of Hawthorne's life, these stories show his foresighted theorizing of medical hegemony and its dangers to public and individual health.<br>

Abstract: What makes the figure of the passenger distinctive as both a subject and an object of mobility and transportation systems? What distinguishes the passenger from other mobile subjectivities, from nomad, flaneur to consumer? How is the passenger represented, practiced and performed? How has the passenger and their experiences been conceived, imagined, manipulated, regulated and engineered? And what kind of human-technology assemblages do passengers enact? Through four short perspectives, this paper seeks to 'profile' the passenger as a distinctive historical and conceptual figure that can help to add greater precision to the analysis of our mobile ways of life. The passenger is explored as an object of speculative theoretical debate, a figure entangled in a host of identities, practices, performances and contexts, and an important way to illuminate key conceptual problematics, from representation to embodiment.<br>

Abstract: In this essay I argue that Carvers story "A Small, Good Thing" can be read as an illustration of Albert Borgmann's argument that contemporary technological society conceals grace by encouraging the illusion than an individual can exert total control over her environment. The story shows how radical contingency punctures this illusion and offers potential for grace-filled communion with others through humble acts of hospitality. These humble acts—the small, good things of life together—parallel the giving and receiving of grace that takes place during the Eucharist.<br>

Abstract: This article elucidates the personalized, life-centered funeral by analyzing the development of specialized funeral functionaries and their construction of celebratory post-mortem rituals in Aotearoa/New Zealand. Drawing on participant observation and ethnographic interviews, this essay argues that secular celebrants accentuate the significance of individuality and narrative identity, but also link components of the life-centered funeral to memorialization and mourner identity. Celebrants emphasized a need to re-discover ritual in contemporary society and grounded this rediscovery in a late-modern context that not only amalgamated authenticity, intuition, and emotional empression, but incorporated central elements of Pakeha (non-Maori) New Zealand indentity.<br>

Abstract: Literary historians have persistently regarded The Education of Henry Adams as a "paradigmatic" text. While "historical explanations" stress the book's historical achievement, "critical explications" portray it as a failure of historical consciousness that achieves its success in the ahistorical arenas of aesthetic integration and imaginative projection. To relate the products of "explication" with the aims of "historical explanation," I regard the work's true "paradigm achievement" as an inquiry into "historical being." For Adams this achievement embodies disciplinary formulation and professional commitment and thus coordinates historical speculation and self-cultivation. One must assess the ethical density and cultural significance of the text before explaining its historical identity. The Education, despite its origin in epistemological chaos, makes the past eternally relevant to the present; for it is a personal and theoretical discovery of how the narrative structures of history and selfhood create the possibilities of individual and social life.<br>

Abstract: The Hebrew Bible depicts interpretation as a continual process of losing and finding, of forgetting and remembering. Texts are lost and found, and in the Joseph story (Gen. 37-50), Joseph himself is abandoned and recovered, with all memory of him repressed until it is dramatically recalled. His story demonstrates that repression is the condition of interpretation, and that interpretation-not resurrection-holds forth the promise of a future life. Nonetheless, the repeated losses that punctuate the Joseph narrative have inspired the opposite conclusion: that Joseph is a type of Jesus, that his descents and ascents prefigure the final one. Typology, a mode of biblical interpretation that prevailed during the early church, has enjoyed a recent revival in the context of literary studies; but I argue that the typological language of "fulfillment," of shadows and truth, is alien to Hebraic-and postmodern-understandings of textuality.<br>

Abstract: Analysis of a sequence of literary frames suggests that a heightened experience of interactional reality is also anomically constructive of the frame. In each of 16 frames, Durkheimian anomie neither destroys the frame's integrity nor renders its routine grounds unintelligible, as Goffman and Garfinkel would claim it must. Paradoxically, anomie ritually intensifies the frame. The selves in the paper's sequence of highly ritualized frames are not routine selves, however. They are 'strangers to themselves'. The analysis shows how Mead's 'I' can re-emerge from Goffman's ritual thinking - where the 'I' is collapsed into an interactionally-bound 'me' - as an original manifestation of great importance to interactants, and therefore to society as well. (Parenthetically it is also argued that selves need an element of rituality in order to be selflike and that it is interactional rituality which guarantees the evolution of social life beyond given frames, corpora, cultural repertoires, and collective representations.) The idea that interactants can be strangers to themselves is an advance on Goffman's and Garfinkel's accounts of interactional selfhood, but one that problematizes the prosecution of the interaction sociology that Goffman and Garfinkel pioneer, since strangers to themselves disappear in normal sociological appearances.<br>

Abstract: This article investigates identity in two autobiographies and two life-history interviews from North Africa. The autobiographies show the centrality of "key" self-representational symbols which the authors selectively draw from their cultural lexicon but invest with idiosyncratic affective meanings. The life narratives show how the "structured ambiguity" of self-symbols allows them to be reconfigured to articulate contrasting identities, among which the narrators shift. Generative models of musical cognition describe crucial features of this multiplicity. Against both modernist and postmodernist views of culture and self, narrative data argue for a distributed model of culture and for a theory of multiple identities integrated by "key" cultural symbols.<br>

Abstract: Methods and results of the structural study of myth and Old Testament source and textual criticism are applied in this analysis of the myth of Moses. The context of the myth is first traced out through the historical circumstances conditioning the myth's textual development, and the major contradiction underlying the myth is identified. The myth is then shown to have served as a model through which the Israelites could resolve their conflicting political and religious aspirations through the details of Moses' life as presented in the myth.<br>

Abstract: In this article, I use Obeyesekere's concept of the work of culture to examine a case of magical poisoning among the Toraja (South Sulawesi, Indonesia). I argue that episodes of suffering must be situated not only culturally but also within the context of the individual sufferer's life experience, and suggest that we must consider carefully why only certain symbolic transformations of painful emotions may "work" for a given individual, why a symbolic transformation that "works" for one person may not for another, and why even apparently successful transformations of suffering may bring only temporary relief.

Abstract: Résumé. Ce texte démontre le genre de questions qui se présentent aux études sur la condition des personnes handicapées informées par la sociologieen interrogent les interactions qui émergent autour des luttes pour «l'accès» dans un milieu de travail scolaire/ académique. Au cours de mes expériences dans un des plus grands édifices dans une des plus grandes universités au Canada, j'ai amassé des paroles quotidiennes qui justifient l'exclusion des personnes handicapées. J'ai rassemblé des narratifs représentants ce-qui-est possible-de-dire aujourd'hui sur la lutte pour l'accessibilité. En utilisant une approche sociologique interprétativiste, ce texte illustre la façon dont les significations de l'incapacité sont générés par un discours qui rends légitime la construction exclusive ainsi que les structures inaccessible de la vie universitaire. Dans ce texte, je démontre que l'accès n'est pas synonyme de justice mais, par contre, est un point de départ pour la réflexion critique où les relations sociaux entre corps et espace peut être considéré à nouveau. Ce texte contribue aux études sur la condition des personnes handicapées informées par la sociologie en analysant la façon dont la narration ordinaire et quotidienne de l'incapacité peut continuer à, en même temps que l'environnement physique change, agir comme pouvoir social qui reproduit le statuquo.<br>

Abstract: Kurata Hyakuzō’s
         The Priest and His Disciples(Shukke to sono deshi, 1916) contributed to the unprecedented rise of religious literature during the Taishō period. The development of the Japanese religious world and the growing interests in religion by Japanese intellectuals during this period encouraged Kurata to humanize Shinran and paved the way forThe Priest and His Disciplesto become a bestseller. AlthoughThe Priest and His Disciplesis much studied, the role of fiction played in the work based on the life of a medieval Buddhist priest remains unexplored. This study first provides a background toThe Priest and His Disciplesand explains why it aroused such interest at the time. It then treats the image of Shinran at the intersection of history and fiction by referring to the study of Michel de Certeau and investigates how Kurata constructed an image of Shinran as the “other” inThe Priest and His Disciplesand placed it in history and in legends about Shinran.<br>

Abstract: This article examines the connection between state order and selfunderstandings in everyday life through a case study of the “Boarding School for Gifted Disadvantaged” in Israel. It includes content analysis of governmental protocols that documented the establishment of the boarding school (governmental constitution of a new self-concept) and interviews with sixty of its graduates (self-understandings in everyday life). The findings reveal how the new cultural order invented a new selfhood, “gifted disadvantaged,” previously unknown in Israel. This category is based on structural distinctions between being “naturally” gifted versus the governmental constitution of gifted status. Interviews with graduates indicate that they experience selfhood as a philanthropic gift bestowed on them by the state of Israel and voice their gratitude toward the state. The concluding discussion suggests that the graduates experience their selfhood as “public property.” The self, perceived as having been constructed from outside, is in a continuous dialectic between the presence and the absence of certain personal qualities.<br>

Abstract: The longstanding critical refrain that Virginia Woolf's fiction represents a turn ““inward”” to the vagaries of the inner life has more recently been countered with an ““outward”” approach emphasizing Woolf's interest in the material world, its everyday objects and their social and political significance. Yet one of the most curious and pervasive features of Woolf's oeuvre is that characters are so frequently wrong in their perceptions. This essay consolidates the inward and outward approaches by tracing the trope of misperception in Woolf's fiction as well as in her conceptions of the work of author and reader. For Woolf, the modern literary experience derives from the nature of the faculties of perception, the tenuous points of connection —— and disjunction —— between the inner and the outer worlds.<br>

Abstract: Recent scholarship has given considerable attention to lyric poetry as a form of sensuous knowledge. This approach emphasizes the corporeal origins of poetry, its genesis in the body or in language viewed as material. The question of sensuous knowledge is central to the larger theoretical issue of modernity itself, in which lyric holds a central yet ambiguous status. The question of sensuous knowledge is ultimately a question of meaning. However, modern thought — thought pertaining to “modernity” — is fundamentally circular. This would seem to establish an epistemological impasse for aesthetics. But I argue that this circularity offers an important, and necessary, way to limit knowledge and thereby ground an ethical subjectivity. My essay places formalism at the heart of sensuous knowledge. In this essay I develop an account of the importance of abstraction in sensuous knowledge by way of Kant's concept of
         Darstellung, “presentation [of sensory experience].” The “presentation” is the object as it has undergone a structural process of internalization and been made available for psychic use as meaning; that requires a recognition of loss. Where this is important for literature is that twentieth-century American poetry frequently uses very personal images of family life as a way of conveying sincerity about corporeal experience. I use this discussion of circularity in modern aesthetic thought to argue that there is a risk to taking shortcuts to meaning through images of the material bodies of children. In these contemporary poems by Gary Snyder, Sharon Olds and Rita Dove, the poets reject loss in favor of a very modern “affirmation” of the material. But affirmation and the visual image as a sign of affirmation cannot alone bind meaning to us. That meaning must be internalized through theworkof poetic presentation.<br>

Abstract: In his essay “The Style of Autobiography”, Jean Starobinski remarks, “One would hardly have sufficient motive to write an autobiography had not some radical change occurred […] conversion, entry into a new life, the operations of Grace”. From the beginning, the traumatic events of Keller's childhood — her loss of sight and hearing around age two — marked her not only as “outsider” and “other” but also as “autobiographer” even before she acquired language. “I can show so little visible proof of living”, Keller confessed. Perhaps for this reason she filled the “white darkness” she lived in with writing — first with finger spelling traced in the hand, then with Braille, and finally with type. While each medium seemed to bring her closer to the dream — her own and her century's — of transparent communication, so each text she produced threatened to turn into a “black box”, an instrument designed to collect and preserve data for analysis following a catastrophic event, but one that inevitably fails to illumine the inner world of Keller's deaf-blindness. This essay explores Keller's dreaming within the black box of writing, following her impossible desire for an “instrument which will show what takes place in the mind when we think”.<br>

Abstract: The combinatory and ludic polyculturalism, the parodic transmutation of meanings and values, the open, multilingual hybridization [which] are the devices responsible for the constant feeding and refeeding of this “baroquizing” almagest: the carnivalized transencyclopedia of the new barbarians, where everything can coexist with everything. They are the machinery that crushes the material of tradition, like the teeth of a tropical sugarmill, transforming stalks and husks into bagasse and juicy syrup.

Abstract: Fitzgerald's nostalgic style, though, set an example of how a nostalgic narrative could be structured, and in its aftermath it was used by such different authors as Evelyn Waugh in
      Brideshead Revisited(1945), Anthony Burgess inA Clockwork Orange(1962) and the works of Kazuo Ishiguro. The author's own later work employs it as well. The technique of using the reader's textual memory in order to evoke a phenomenological nostalgic experience is very evident in both versions ofTender Is the Night(the 1934 original, and Malcolm Cowley's 1951 restructuring). In the 1951 version, the structure of the narrative closely follows the pattern of happiness and reflection. An early description of a Swiss valley communicates an awe of life and nature: “The sun swam out into a blue sea of sky and suddenly it was a Swiss valley at its best—pleasant sounds and murmurs and a good fresh smell of health and cheer” (9). In the transitory third book, “Casualties: 1925,” the tone has changed from appreciative to melancholic, as in this description of the small town of Amiens: “In the day-time one is deflated by such towns, with their little trolley cars of twenty years ago crossing the great grey cobble-stoned squares in front of the cathedral, and the very weather seems to have a quality of the past, faded weather like that of old photographs” (138). At the end of the novel both Dick and Nicole Diver become obsessed with youth and the past as well as with time: “for Nicole the years slipped away by clock and calendar and birthday, with the added poignance of her perishable beauty” (228). Toward the end of the novel, Nicole's last sight of Dick—“her eyes followed his figure until it became a dot and mingled with the other dots in the summer crowd” (386)—forces the reader to reflect in a reversed movement. Instead of vanishing like Dick, this image suggests a backward recollection of what was a Swiss valley “at its best.”<br>

Abstract: Even in her familial tone, and perhaps because of it, Jabbeh Wesley never forgets that the healing and meaning-making function of grief and mourning, as painful as grief and mourning are, is not to be avoided. Rather, as DuBose argues, based on the painful experience of his wife's miscarriage, as “‘child’ and ‘parent’ disappeared, our bodies and our society
      dys-appeared, and our connections and hopes re-appeared” (374). Jabbeh Wesley attaches the reappearance of the hopes for the healing and reconstruction of her Liberian world to people's ability and willingness to truly experience the painful process of grief and, perhaps informed by that cathartic experience, allow compassion and empathy to guide their relationship to others.<br>

Abstract: Some time ago, Paul Ricoeur pointed out that “the symbol gives rise to thought.”
      
               These diasporic religious communities enable us to find a new beginning for thought that has the possibility of avoiding the exclusivity and elitism that has too often accompanied the objective meaning of thought as a science of the rational. Not only these diasporic religions, but also the very conundrum of the continent of Africa as a whole, to echo Skinner at the beginning of our paper, may serve in the same manner as one of the most important ways that thought might be renewed—and the relationship of thought to action and performance.38<br>

Abstract: In short, it is exposure to the experientially inspired and theoretically casual atmosphere of those early SPEP meetings—where neglected topics and unorthodox modes of thinking and speaking were encouraged in an undisciplined way—to which I owe the most. Of course, SPEP grew up. It has experienced its share of embarrassing upheavals, as the heavy presence of its own versions of the social and political prejudices in the larger culture became too obvious to ignore. But it is now a major event—the four-day anchor for a week-long convention that takes over hotels, runs multiple concurrent sessions, fosters satellite groups, and often follows established lines of discussion. Some even call it the alternative APA. Yet I am sure that as long as lifeworld experience continues to trump whatever it is currently fashionable to say about it, grown-up SPEP will retain enough of its original vitality and intellectual generosity so that another generation of aging academics will have cause to repeat our present thank-yous in another fifty years.<br>

Abstract: Our plight, then, is not simply that we are all in the same boat, let alone on the same ocean. Yet we are still bound by the responsbility of inhabiting the same planet. What would it mean, then, to share the earth with all its inhabitants, not just in terms of occupying the same planet but also in terms of caring and looking after each other in the anachronistic sense of the word
   dutyas plight? Can we risk pledging to solemnly avow our own investments in the very things we so self-rightousely protest against, not in order to stop protesting in the name of justice but, rather, in the hopes of turning the killing machine back against itself and taking another step toward “hunting down” and abolishing death penalities wherever they may be hiding, even in our own disowned fears and desires?<br>

Abstract: The point here is that whoever I am in terms of my personal identity and my capacity or incapacity to identify myself through sortal terms as a being in the world with others, I will have no doubt who is in pain or who will have the pain. Here, again, is a sense of “I” in which I can be aware of myself and refer to myself without it being necessary to employ any nonindexical or third-personal referents.<br>

Abstract: No doubt the rise of religion has not only posed a particular dilemma for critical theory but also provided a curious place to end this reflection. Having started my career doing philosophy of religion it is somewhat surprising to meet religion again as I turn to what surely must be at least a later phase of my career. I am reminded of Antonio's line from the Italian film
            C'eravamo Tanto Amati, translated asWe All Loved Each Other So Much: “We thought we could change the world, but the world changed us.” “Philosophers only interpret the world, the point is to change it,” so said Marx. But in a curious way those who would change the world are changed by it.<br>

Abstract: In 1986, however, SPEP's present mission statement could not have been conceived. Many important issues and questions remained unrecognized or simply ignored. But the opening before the organization was now a “postmodern” one, and a hallmark of what is called postmodern thought is its requirement that it transform in the force of its own lack of founded stability. I believe that 1986 began a series of developments that is turning SPEP toward ways of thought and life that cannot be labeled postmodern. I doubt that this turning constitutes a midlife crisis for SPEP in its fiftieth year. But it does highlight for me the fact that I have been giving a historical narrative that has to do with continuities in the dissolution of continuities, that I have not been—if I may put it this way—postmodern in an orthodox manner, although I have refused to give an unambiguous meaning to the term that has played a major role in organizing this essay. I do not know whether this discussion is postmodern, post-postmodern, or modern, and I do not care. I do care, however, about the openings that SPEP has provided for collegiality, conflict, unresolved differences, transformations, and sites for presentations, discussion, and critique. In my experience, in its own organizational development and travail, it has occasioned changes in the lives of many philosophers (mine among them). I expect that its indeterminate opening now—its continuing transformations in the interaction of many differences—will continue to surprise, irritate, and change those of us who participate in its opportunities. I close with a sense of beginning and an acknowledgment of the strangeness of the continuity that a series of beginnings provides: continuity without substance, continuity coming to pass.<br>

Abstract: I want to conclude with one more argument from my own work. I have very often argued that philosophers of technology, regarding the expectations of society and their own traditions and habits, may come “too late” to technologies. They too often undertake their reflections
            afterthe technologies are in place. Rather, I argue, they should reposition themselves at what I call the “R&D” position where technologies are taking developmental shape, in think tanks, in incubator facilities, in research centers. Only then can truly “new” and emerging technologies be fully philosophically engaged.<br>

Abstract: We at SPEP have never been modern and have made a good living off the critique of modernism and of its binary oppositions. But I think that the business as usual of Continental philosophy will have to be expanded to include a critique of the opposition of the human and the nonhuman, of
            physisandtechne, and of “Continental philosophy” and “science.” For the truth is that we have been a party to the science wars. That is why I think that the work of Catherine Malabou is exactly the sort of work that SPEP and Continental philosophy generally will have to do in the future.
                  We have yet to admit how deeply inscribed the human is in the nonhuman and the technical. We have yet to appreciate that being-in-the-world is not only historicized, gendered, and incarnate but also both a neural and a galactic event, of both microscopic and macroscopic proportions. Can it be of no interest to “philosophy,” can there be nothing to “wonder” about, that our bodies are literally made of stardust? We have yet to realize how deeply interwoven is the imagination of speculative physics with the wonder of the philosophers. If the best we can do is to protect our turf by saying that science does not think, the sciences will steal our thunder, that is, our wonder, right out from under us. Science does think, and science wonders, because wonder is the piety of thought. That is a matter to which SPEP, and Continental philosophers generally, whether they have taken a theological turn or are running in the opposite direction, should give more thought.36

Abstract: For, if phenomenology renounces its search for the absolute and for foundations, then it must give up seeing itself as a single and self-contained discourse. The minimal phenomenologist renounces monolinguism and is no longer the master of only one discourse. Instead, he or she must practice a mixed discourse. To do this is to practice diglossia, to become a code-switcher. In its ordinary sense, the practice of code-switching refers to the passage from one language or dialect to another one in the course of a single conversation, for instance, when the conversation moves from an informal to a formal setting or when it moves from one topic to another. But in the phenomenological context, this would involve the ability to shift from a phenomenological discourse to its “others,” whether they might be Freudian energetics, Deleuzian aspects, Badiouan events, and so on. This practice of translation or code-switching has perhaps always been the role of the phenomenologist, if it is accepted that phenomenological reflection does not begin from itself but is nourished by a life that precedes it and gives rise to it.<br>

Abstract: Second, how do we account for the fact that the processes of public memory are both created by individual choices and nurtured in collective contexts? Many scholars have productively addressed this question by unpacking specific examples in which individuals or groups vie to control public memories. The critical framework I recommend offers a more systematic approach to this issue. To view representations of the past through the nested lenses of rhetoric, public memory, and the agential spiral is to focus on how human beings—individually and in groups—forge connections with people of other times through the medium of public agency. The agential spiral, derived from my reading of Ricoeur's “threefold mimesis,” aims to pinpoint three moments in the construction of narratives in which human action is represented and reinterpreted within a temporal structure. As a critical framework, the agential spiral helps us to view the creation of public memories at three key moments and to see the process as a coiling whole. Using this tool, we can better understand why certain memories persist in certain societies and how those memories powerfully connect people across time as well as space.<br>

Abstract: Moreover, for Shaw and Ricoeur, imaginative works of art have the power to project alternative and potentially redemptive ways of living together harmoniously, which in turn can substantially change hearts, alter beliefs, and reorient behavior in an empathetic direction that promotes vigilant concern for the other. Be they biblical narratives, plays for the stage, fictions for the page, or other forms of literary texts broadly construed, stories can portray freedom and fault reconciled in compassionate beings committed to advancing the common good. In this way, poetic making can and has instilled in us not only faith and hope but magnanimity as well. Thus, the answer to the provocative question Shaw poses at the beginning of his last major treatise,
      Everybody's Political What's What?—“Is Human Nature Incurably Depraved?”
               —is a resounding no: not just for him but for Ricoeur, too. Where there is faith, there is hope; and where there is hope, there is life. Life expectant.55<br>

Abstract: The recent pragmatic-contextual theory of fiction entails the possibility of changes between fact and fiction over the course of time. It is also perhaps commonplace to state that this process can be reversed—that fictional texts may cease to be fictional. The question of generic fiction-to-fact transition, however, is rarely confronted in the theory of fiction. This essay investigates the generic expectations attached to texts that make a full-scale transition from fiction to nonfiction difficult, both culturally and psychologically. “Fiction” is understood here in a limited, pragmatic sense of a work of fiction, a text known and categorized as fiction. The discussion is structured around five interrelated reasons that contribute to the difficulty: (1) the commonness of as-if structures in everyday life; (2) the generic combinations among literature, fiction, factual representation, and narrative; (3) the relative stability of the communal values and ways of checking facts that determine the categories of fiction and fact (the fact convention); (4) the popularity, in fiction, of metalepsis and the theme of transworld travel between different ontological spheres; (5) and the fictionalization of literature in the historical perspective.<br>

Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: What is left unsaid in this article about the relationship between utopia and rhetoric could certainly fill the pages of many books. The range is especially rich when we turn to contemporary rhetorical theorists who specifically address society as a value to be combined with a remembered or imagined better place, as in Nedra Reynolds's
      Geographies of Writingor bell hooks'sBelonging: A Culture of Place.
               Just as constitutive rhetoric (that is, cumulative discourse that contributes to building the structure of human society) has been important in the works of theorists often cited by utopists as crucial to their work, so the utopian impulse continues to be inherent in the way rhetoricians see their subject. To persuade verbally or visually, we must have our own idea of what is socially better, and we must also be able to imagine what our audience believes to be better. The function of utopia, then, may be less philosophical and ideological at its root than it is linguistic in a pragmatic sense. As Kenneth Burke has written of human beings, we are “the symbol-making, symbol-using, symbol-misusing animal … rotten with perfection.”38

Abstract: Milan Kundera has described this kind of comedy as echoing a joyous, life-affirming laughter—“the serious laughter of angels expressing their joy of being.”
      
               But that is not to suggest that there is anything divinely pious in this position: if Joyce is an angel, then he is one, like Stephen Dedalus, who will not blindly or uncritically serve.168
            
               In commenting upon an earlier version of this article, Patrick Parrinder spoke of “the difficult relationship between Utopia and comedy.” This relationship is problematized by the fact that Utopia rarely seems able to laugh at itself or therefore to offer the liberating possibilities of comedy. Joyce's later writing, however, appears to advance the rare chance of a pluralist, ambiguous, and dynamic vision of Utopia: a Utopia that might be sustained into futurity—a Utopia that still has room for dreamers and for democrats. But is it still possible that we can call this realm of radical openness, this flux of possibilities, this resolutely material site, Utopian? And do we really need to? This kind of Utopia is not a category or a frame but a direction, a progress, a confluence of streams of consciousness and of unconsciousness, flowing into the river of life: not just a symbolic river but a real one too, the Liffey, the great Anna Livia Plurabelle herself. Or as Joyce put it, more succinctly (and more joyously), it is simply “Lff!”169

Abstract: It is in this sense that Utopia can be understood as
      lying before us—in both senses of this confounding double phrase. Utopia resides in the past (beforein this instance means “behind us”) inasmuch as any reconsideration of Utopia in the present must inevitably begin with the past. But if the sources of Utopia in the present reside in the past, realization is in the future (beforein this instance means “ahead of us”). It is this double valence that links the articles that make up this special issue. Some deal with historical figures, literature, or places, while others take up analogous considerations that are closer to us now. However, in each case, the future is what is at issue: What shape will it take? How might the circumstances of its emergence be as propitious as possible? These key questions suffuse all of the articles that follow and are of the greatest urgency to all disciplines but in particular for architecture and urbanism, which are burdened with providing the stage upon which we play out the drama of our lives, individually and collectively.<br>

Abstract: Flush with the juices of adolescence, American philosophy declared independence from its European parentage in the work of Ralph Waldo Emerson and his generation. In 1837, Emerson addressed the Harvard Phi Beta Kappa Society on the occasion of its inaugural meeting for the year, which he called a "holiday." Emerson began: I greet you on the recommencement of our literary year. Our anniversary is one of hope, and, perhaps, not enough of labor. We do not meet for games of strength or skill, for the recitation of histories, tragedies, and odes, like the ancient Greeks; for parliaments of love and poesy, like the Troubadours; nor for the advancement of science, like our contemporaries in the British and European capitals. Thus far, our holiday has been simply a friendly sign of the survival of the love of letters amongst a people too busy to give letters any more. Perhaps the time is already come when it ought to be, and will be something else; when the sluggard intellect of this continent will look from under its iron lids and fill the postponed expectations of the world with something better than the expectations of mechanical skill. Our day of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close. The millions that around us are rushing into life, cannot always be fed on the sere remains of foreign harvests. Events, actions arise, that must be sung, that will sing themselves.<br>

Abstract: Medical humanities and ethics are getting more and more important in Europe as essential disciplines of the core curriculum for health-care professionals. The idea of the physician as a technician shows itself to be unbearable because of the global historical changes we daily face in caring settings. We deal with chronic diseases, which require a sensitive physician/patient covenant and a good performance in communication skills1 because a whole life-style transformation is often necessary. Moreover, citizens are more informed about both the technological progress and their civil rights, so that a shared decision has to be prepared and implemented by exploring the emotional reactions to illness, by explaining the effects of different ways of treatment, and by revealing in advance the choices that could be taken.<br>

Abstract: In this paper, we present an analysis of an Iron Age I dwelling at the Phoenician site of Dor, on Israel's Carmel coast. We provide a definition for the architectural mental template for this type of house—a Central Courtyard Hash-Plan House. By combining an analysis of the size and layout of the house, and the distribution of artifacts and ecofacts in it, we define rooms devoted to specialized economic activities such as food production and storage and also attempt to identify gendered spaces. We conclude that the house was a self-contained agrarian unit engaged in complex economic activity. The same conceptual plan, housing similar economic activities, can be identified in other dwellings in the southern Levant, from Late Bronze Age I to Late Iron Age IIA. The gradual disappearance of this house type, vis-à-vis the emergence, on the one hand, of smaller and simpler dwellings such as the ubiquitous Four-Room House and, on the other, that of public facilities for specialized economic tasks, signifies to our minds a fundamental ideological and economic transformation, a change in the
         habitusof Levantine society—namely, the gradual segregation between households and various aspects of economic life.<br>

Abstract: This essay places before the reader four historic texts that raise significant questions for Jews and Christians who choose to enter into post-Holocaust examination of their respective identities and their relationships to their grounding traditions. The Kristallnacht exhibit at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum introduces museum visitors to the defaced Talmudic instruction of R. Eliezer—
         Know before whom you stand-which frames this essay. As with the story the museum recounts, more than texts are at stake in this essay, but the way forward is distinctly framed by their critical presence. In this case, the distinctive texts are faced in reconfiguring ways, asking those who face them to rethink the place of the other in their identities and life-orienting commitments. Early on, Samuel Bak's surrealistic rendering of a crucified, Jewish child provides a refracting image for exploring the questions these texts pose for post-Shoah people of faith who take their place before them, asking in recursive fashion: before whom do you stand?<br>

Abstract: In contemporary Western culture, death is often made separate from life. The dying body is rendered invisible, even though sociocultural performances of death foreshadow and signify death and dying. This article challenges this signifying by arguing that death and dying are constituted performatively through the inscriptive surfaces of living, dying, and dead bodies, rendered visible by breath and breathing. The article begins by reflecting on the experience of witnessing the author's mentor's dying breath. Thinking through the dying breath, it then questions to what extent the separation of death from life is maintained by what is unspoken of the dying and dead body. Finally, the article considers the analytical implications of the argument for those who remain behind to grieve for, and remember, the dying bodies, and those to whom those bodies once belonged<br>Link: <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/culturalcritique.86.2014.0065">http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/culturalcritique.86.2014.0065</a>
