  Abstract: The disruption of their household that the Plunkett family experienced in the years after 1916, and lasting well into the 1920s, inevitably led to some disordering of papers relating to Joseph’s politico-military activities and writings. The distribution of books and papers after his father’s death in 1948 added a further hazard to orderly preservation. It is therefore gratifying that G. N. Plunkett’s archive in the NLI should disclose a small amount of material generated by his eldest son. Mss. 12,009–10 contain two notebooks, the first labeled Philosophy and dating from 1908 to 1909, the second containing literary matter from<br>

  Abstract: I have two purposes in writing this paper. The first and primary objective follows a conventional agenda in historical and critical studies: it is to contribute something to our understanding of Lincoln’s influence on late nineteenth-century American oratory. That influence is so broad and so obvious that it would seem to command attention, but, so far as I know, no one has yet studied the matter in any detail.¹ This paper, then, attempts to help fill a gap in the historical scholarship.<br>

  Abstract: Our globalized world of today brings with it a unity of humankind such as never experienced before. Opportunities to fi ght hunger and poverty on a worldwide level and to act globally against the threats of climate change have come within the reach of humankind. Globalization, however, also brings with it terrorist threats and related apocalyptic dangers. Concerning religion, the world of today faces two important challenges. We need to overcome an all too simple secularism that reduces religion to a solely private matter, and we have to acknowledge the plurality of religions at the local as well as at<br>

  Abstract: I would first like briefly to justify the theme I have chosen, namely: “from word to concept.” The subject matter is a topic belonging both to philosophy and to hermeneutics. In truth, concepts are really one of the distinguishing marks of philosophy. Indeed, philosophy first entered Western culture in this form. For this reason the concept is the first thing I would like to discuss. Of one thing I am sure: the concept, which very often presents itself as something strange and demanding, must begin to speak if it is to be really grasped. For this reason I would first<br>

  Abstract: When Ezra Pound wrote down the first of the three Imagistic principles, as seen in the epigraph, he was of course playing cards at the table of poetry rather than ethnography. What he meant by the “thing” was poetic matter that lives mostly in one’s imagination—an image. It really would be far-fetched to claim that a poem like “In a Station of the Metro” is a semantically ethnographic description of Oriental culture or race:<br>

  Abstract: Leibniz displayed a special alertness to the metaphor of

Far from being something merely mechanistic, the organic body of the monad—which we have seen to be intimately tied to place—is a “living being” or “divine machine.”¹ Since every monad is in effect a world filled with monads at increasingly minuscule levels, organicity extends to everything in the end: “There is a world of creatures, living beings, animals, entelechies, souls, in the smallest particle of matter.”² Hence every bit of matter can be compared to a pond filled with<br>

  Abstract: So ending, it turns out, is much more difficult than it appears. Modern popular psychology to the contrary, closure and resolution are actually quite easy, insofar as they turn the world into a series of problems to be solved, riddles to be unraveled. Ending is difficult, for humans at least, because it entails stopping something without being recognized for doing so, either with the praise of one’s fellows or the spoils of victory in a strategic contest. The modern discomfort with endings can be encapsulated in one concept: the “postapocalyptic.” The postapocalyptic, no matter how horrific, promises us that the<br>

  Book Title: To Make the Hands Impure: Art, Ethical Adventure, the Difficult and the Holy-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): NEWTON ADAM ZACHARY<br>
  Abstract: How can cradling, handling, or rubbing a text be said, ethically, to have made something happen? What, as readers or interpreters, may come off in our hands in as we maculate or mark the books we read? For Adam Zachary Newton, reading is anembodied practice wherein "ethics" becomes a matter of tact in the doubled sense of touch and regard. With the image of the book lying in the hands of its readers as insistent refrain, To Make the Hands Impure cuts a provocative cross-disciplinary swath through classical Jewish texts, modern Jewish philosophy, film and performance, literature, translation, and the material text. Newton explores the ethics of reading through a range of texts, from the Talmud and Midrash to Conrad's Nostromo and Pascal's Le Memorial, from works by Henry Darger and Martin Scorsese to the National September 11 Memorial and a synagogue in Havana, Cuba. In separate chapters, he conducts masterly treatments of Emmanuel Levinas, Mikhail Bakhtin, and Stanley Cavell by emphasizing their performances as readers a trebled orientation to Talmud, novel, and theater/film. To Make the Hands Impure stages the encounter of literary experience and scriptural traditions he difficult and the holy through an ambitious, singular, and innovative approach marked in equal measure by erudition and imaginative daring.<br>

  Author(s) Segal Robert A.<br>
  Abstract: This is a book about how scholars make sense of what we study.¹ As a field of research whose primary focus is a fixed and finite set of data, biblical studies innovates less by discovering new objects of study than by finding fresh ways—or refining old ways—to examine its basic subject matter. Scholars investigate by designing categories of analysis and interpretation to achieve understanding. Regular assessment of the value of these categories—however recondite it may appear to a field’s outsiders—provokes scholarly self-consciousness and thereby strengthens the quality of research and advances knowledge.<br>

  Abstract: While scholars are sometimes confronted with the ignorance of their interlocutors about their field of research, anyone who has ambitions to work on “reality TV” is in exactly the opposite situation. The mere mention of the term conjures up an impression of self-evidence, as reality television does not immediately appear to be complex subject matter. Still, a simple look at the phenomenon already reveals a variety of objects. Starting from a study carried out on reality television in French-speaking Switzerland,¹ this study questions how the term “reality television programming” has come to make sense within social exchange and examines the<br>

  Abstract: Film is always a construction. Film “truth,” whether it be cinéma vérité,
                  kinopravda, or observational cinema, is a misnomer because film is never objective. Even the placing of the camera for a film consisting of a single “take” (uninterrupted shot) is a manipulation. The camera reflects the filmmaker’s view.¹ Most filmmakers believe, however, that their manipulation creates a “greater truth,” what Flaherty’s wife, Frances, called “that high moment of seeing, that flash of penetration into the heart of the matter” (Jacobs 1979:8). The film’s structure is the mark of the filmmaker’s truth and the truth he or she discerns in<br>

  Abstract: "In the Holocaust novel, silence is always a character, and the word is always its subject matter." So writes David Patterson in this profound and original study of more than thirty important writers. Contrary to existing views, he argues, the Holocaust novel is not an attempt to depict an unimaginable reality or an ineffable horror. It is, rather, an endeavor to fetch the word from silence and restore it to meaning, to resurrect the human soul, to regenerate the relation between the self and God, the self and other, the self and itself.<br>

  Abstract: “Material spirit.” “Material!” “Spirit!” These two words taken together, or either word taken separately, are endlessly suggestive. That is especially true if you hear behind or beside them their semantic variants. For “material”: “materiality,” “matter,” “immaterial,” and so on, in all the different ways these words may be used in sentences, such as “It’s immaterial what format you use.” For “spirit”: “spiritual,” “spiritualism,” “spiritualist,” “spirituous,” “spirited,” “dispirited,” “in good spirits,” “out of spirits,” and so on, as in “His indulgence in spirituous liquors kept him in high spirits.” Cavafy’s drinking of spirits embodied those spirits in his emotions and feelings,<br>

  Abstract: Theologians ruminate among inherited concepts and images, seeking to clarify their history and judge it critically. To establish a perspective in which even a single such concept can be brought into question or deconstructed is no easy matter. To bring the entire tradition into perspective and retrieve it in a well-founded way, as Heidegger aimed to retrieve the tradition of Western metaphysics, is a prodigious task. Recently, a larger context for that task has emerged as Christians have learned that their entire tradition is only one fiber in the texture of the human religious quest.

  Book Title: Regard for the Other: Autothanatography in Rousseau, De Quincey, Baudelaire, and Wilde-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burt E. S.<br>
  Abstract: Although much has been written on autobiography, the same cannot be said of autothanatography, the writing of one's death. This study starts from the deconstructive premise that autobiography is aporetic, not or not only a matter of a subject strategizing with language to produce an exemplary identity but a matter also of its responding to an exorbitant call to write its death. The I-dominated representations of particular others and of the privileged other to whom a work is addressed, must therefore be set against an alterity plaguing the I from within or shadowing it from without. This alterity makes itself known in writing as the potential of the text to carry messages that remain secret to the confessing subject. Anticipation of the potential for the confessional text to say what Augustine calls the secret I do not know,the secret of death, engages the autothanatographical subject in a dynamic, inventive, and open-ended process of identification. The subject presented in these texts is not one that has already evolved an interior life that it seeks to reveal to others, but one that speaks to us as still in process. Through its exorbitant response, it gives intimations of an interiority and an ethical existence to come. Baudelaire emerges as a central figure for this understanding of autobiography as autothanatography through his critique of the narcissism of a certain Rousseau, his translation of De Quincey's confessions, with their vertiginously ungrounded subject-in-construction, his artistic practice of self-conscious, thorough-going doubleness, and his service to Wilde as model for an aporetic secrecy. The author discusses the interruption of narrative that must be central to the writing of one's death and addresses the I's dealings with the aporias of such structuring principles as secrecy, Levinasian hospitality, or interiorization as translation. The book makes a strong intervention in the debate over one of the most-read genres of our time.<br>

  Abstract: The Song of Songs offers no single, stable perspective from which to view the amorous scenes unveiled on its pages. Most readers of the Song from antiquity to the present have, however, been inclined to identify with the female figure traditionally known as the Shulammite. But who is the Shulammite, and who, for that matter, is her beloved? The sustained ambiguities of identity and fluid reversals of erotic roles have made this text fertile ground for conceiving and reconceiving the mysteries of desire, in particular, the mysteries of

                  Environmentalhermeneutics focuses on the fact that environments matter to people, too, because environments embody just such contexts.¹ This is most obvious for cultural landscapes, yet it applies to the specifically natural world as well: Nature can function as a larger normative context with its own narrative dimension. However, there are many different placial and temporal dimensions at play in our relation to the landscape, which can give rise to different normative interpretations of the meaning of a<br>

  Book Title: The Experience of God: A Postmodern Response-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: The book provides a series of approaches to the ancient question of whether and how God is a matter of experience,or, alternately, to what extent the notion of experience can be true to itself if it does not include God. On the one hand, it seems impossible to experience God: the deity does not offer Himself to sense experience. On the other hand, there have been mystics who have claimed to have encountered God. The essays in this collection seek to explore the topic again, drawing insights from phenomenology, theology, literature, and feminism. Throughout, this stimulating collection maintains a strong connection with concrete rather than abstract approaches to God.The contributors: Michael F. Andrews, Jeffrey Bloechl, John D.

Would this experience be some very extraordinary and death-defying event, like landing on the moon or being abducted by aliens? Or would it rather be a much calmer, cooler, and more calculating affair, like trying to read extremely complex computer data from the Galileo telescope that only a few highly trained experts can understand?

  Abstract: The very notion of seductive ethics is likely to give us pause, to seem more error than paradox. Ethics is more often than not conceived as the very resistance to seduction, if not in fact to any sort of pleasure (or bliss, which seems to undermine the ethical subject).¹ It is dutiful, we think, a little bit ascetic (provided we don’t overly enjoy our asceticism), rule-bound or abstemiously virtuous. And if seduction is about sustaining the possible, then to prescribe, whether character or behavior, seems contradictory to it.

  Book Title: Reading the Allegorical Intertext: Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: Judith H. Anderson conceives the intertext as a relation between or among texts that encompasses both Kristevan intertextuality and traditional relationships of influence, imitation, allusion, and citation. Like the Internet, the intertext is a state, or place, of potential expressed in ways ranging from deliberate emulation to linguistic free play. Relatedly, the intertext is also a convenient fiction that enables examination of individual agency and sociocultural determinism. Anderson's intertext is allegorical because Spenser's Faerie Queene is pivotal to her study and because allegory, understood as continued or moving metaphor, encapsulates, even as it magnifies, the process of signification. Her title signals the variousness of an intertext extending from Chaucer through Shakespeare to Milton and the breadth of allegory itself. Literary allegory, in Anderson's view, is at once a mimetic form and a psychic one-a process thinking that combines mind with matter, emblem with narrative, abstraction with history. Anderson's first section focuses on relations between Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and Spenser's The Faerie Queene, including the role of the narrator, the nature of the textual source, the dynamics of influence, and the bearing of allegorical narrative on lyric vision. The second centers on agency and cultural influence in a variety of Spenserian and medieval texts. Allegorical form, a recurrent concern throughout, becomes the pressing issue of section three. This section treats plays and poems of Shakespeare and Milton and includes two intertextually relevant essays on Spenser.How Paradise Lost or Shakespeare's plays participate in allegorical form is controversial. Spenser's experiments with allegory revise its form, and this intervention is largely what Shakespeare and Milton find in his poetry and develop. Anderson's book, the result of decades of teaching and writing about allegory, especially Spenserian allegory, will reorient thinking about fundamenta~<br>

  Abstract: The question whether the Greek epic tradition is a matter of truth or of fiction remains a central issue in Homeric scholarship, and any answer to it betrays one’s stance with regard to a host of other issues, such as text, tradition, and authorship. Opinions are divided as to whether the Homeric rendition of the heroic past is wholly traditional and so “objective,” or allows of fictional, “original” admixture by an individual poet.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x1k8c">Value and Values</a><br>

A second insight, and one with powerful contemporary resonances, is that all things arise interdependently. Strongly interpreted, this means that relationality is more basic than “things-related.” Interdependence is not a contingent, external relation among essentially separate entities; it is internal or constitutive. In short, interdependence entails interpenetration. Seeing this is to see that conflicts, troubles,<br>

  Book Title: Muscially Sublime: Indeterminacy, Infinity, Irresolvability-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wurth Kiene Brillenburg<br>
  Abstract: Musically Sublime rewrites musically the history and philosophy of the sublime. Music enables us to reconsider the traditional course of sublime feeling on a track from pain to pleasure. Resisting the notion that there is a single format for sublime feeling, Wurth shows how, from the mid eighteenth century onward, sublime feeling is, instead, constantly rearticulated in a complex interaction with musicality. Wurth takes as her point of departure Immanuel Kant's Critique of Judgment and Jean-Francois Lyotard's aesthetic writings of the 1980s and 1990s. Kant framed the sublime narratively as an epic of self-transcendence. By contrast, Lyotard sought to substitute open immanence for Kantian transcendence, yet he failed to deconstruct the Kantian epic. The book performs this deconstruction by juxtaposing eighteenth- and nineteenth-century conceptions of the infinite, Sehnsucht, the divided self, and unconscious drives with contemporary readings of instrumental music. Critically assessing Edmund Burke, James Usher, E.T.A. Hoffmann, Novalis, Friedrich Holderlin, Arthur Schopenhauer, Richard Wagner, and Friedrich Nietzsche, this book re-presents the sublime as a feeling that defers resolution and hangs suspended between pain and pleasure. Musically Sublime rewrites the mathematical sublime as differance, while it redresses the dynamical sublime as trauma: unending, undetermined, unresolved. Whereas most musicological studies in this area have focused on traces of the Kantian sublime in Handel, Haydn, and Beethoven, this book calls on the nineteenth-century theorist Arthur Seidl to analyze the sublime of, rather than in, music. It does so by invoking Seidl's concept of formwidrigkeit ("form-contrariness") in juxtaposition with Romantic piano music, (post)modernist musical minimalisms, and Lyotard's postmodern sublime. It presents a sublime of matter, rather than form-performative rather than representational. In doing so, Musically Sublime shows that the binary distinction ~<br>

  Book Title: Missing Link-The Evolution of Metaphor and the Metaphor of Evolution<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): DONALDSON JEFFERY<br>
  Abstract: We look for missing links in the sciences and humanities, but the essential missing link - metaphor - is always in front of us. In Missing Link, Jeffery Donaldson unites literary criticism and evolutionary and cognitive science to show how metaphor has been with us since the beginning of time as a seed in the nature of things. With examples from centuries of poets, critics, philosophers, and scientists, he details how metaphor is a chemistry, an exchange of energies forming and dissolving, and an openness in the spaces between things. He considers the ways in which DNA learns how to liken things that have been, how mutation makes errors and then tries them on, and how evolution is hypothesis - nature's way of "thinking more." The mind is a matrix of relations: neural synapses cascade into ever-changing pathways and patterns. Metaphor is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. It is the unbroken thread between matter and spirit. Whether offering analysis of a turn of phrase or chemical reaction, Missing Link presents a vision of literature that is also a vision of the cosmos, and vice versa. It enters the debate between evolution and religion, and challenges scientists, literary theorists, and religious advocates to rethink the relations between their disciplines.<br>

  Book Title: Jonathan Lethem-  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Peacock James<br>
  Abstract: Jonathan Lethem is the first full-length study dedicated to the work of an exciting, genre-busting contemporary writer with an increasingly high profile in American literature. Examining all of Lethem’s novels, as well as a number of his short fictions, essays and critical works, this study shows how the author’s prolific output, his restlessness and his desire always to be subverting literary forms and genres, are consistent with his interest in subcultural identities. The human need to break off into small groupings, subcultures or miniature utopias is mirrored in the critical tendency to enforce generic boundaries. To break down the boundaries between genres, then, is partly to make a nonsense of critical distinctions between 'high' and 'low' literature, and partly to reflect the wider need to recognise difference, to appreciate that other people, no matter how outlandish and alien they may appear, share similar desires, experiences and problems. With this in mind, James Peacock argues that Lethem’s experiments with genre are not merely games or elaborate literary jokes, but ethical necessities, particularly when viewed in the light of the losses and traumas that shadow all of his writing. Jonathan Lethem, therefore, makes an important contribution not just to Lethem studies, but also to debates about genre and its position in postmodern or 'post-postmodern' literature. It will be of interest to all scholars and students of contemporary American writing, as well as those interested in genre fiction and literature’s relationship with subcultures.<br>

  Abstract: The sixth commandment appears a weak commandment no matter from what cultural vantage point you look at it. Not weak because, in private or in war, men continue to kill one another. (They continue to steal, give false testimony, and violate other imperatives of the Decalogue as well.) No: it is weak
                  per sebecause of the inconsistency of its conceptual framework and the contradictions that run through it historically.

                  integrationbecame a catchword, an incontrovertible refrain in political discourse for government intervention, used by nonprofit organizations, social experts, and researchers.1 Though historically a highly charged term, this “notion” has annihilated the possibility of critical distance. Integrationist rhetoric has functioned as a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy, finding its justification in its very enunciation. The sociologist Dominique Schnapper, now a member of the Constitutional Council, wrote the following in 1991: “By definition, no matter the national ideology, the nation constructs itself through a process of continuous integration.

The philosopher saw the painter as a paradigm example of the essence of perception.¹ As he writes, “Cézanne did not think he had to choose between feeling and thought, between order and chaos. He did not want to separate the stable things which we see and the shifting way in which they appear; he wanted to depict matter as it takes on form, the birth of order through spontaneous organization” (Merleau-Ponty 1964 [1945]: 13).<br>

The ubiquitous puns on “matter” do not, alas, mark a rethinking of the key concepts (materiality and signification) and the relationship between them.

  Abstract: In the previous chapter we discussed Charles Taylor’s claim that human beings are self-interpreting animals. As we saw, self-interpretation is a matter of strong evaluation, a second-order evaluation of oneself. Are my desires, goals, and commitments good? Am I living the way I should? Is it good that I “am”? We evaluate ourselves, in this strong sense, within a horizon of significance—i.e., a set of background assumptions regarding what is good, meaningful, and valuable. Moreover, this strong evaluation takes place before some authority. The category of “existence before” is therefore essential to becoming a self. I experience myself as<br>

Even when philosophy has been ignored, degraded, reappropriated, or put into question and even when philosophers have sought to “destroy” it, philosophy has been taken as a given inseparable from Western culture and born of it. Practically speaking, no one from the West or educated under the Western tradition, no matter how critical of it, would put into question the existence of European, French, German, or Italian philosophy.

Bringing ecocriticism closer to the material turn, the contributions to this landmark volume focus on material forces and substances, the agency of things, processes, narratives and stories, and making meaning out of the world. This broad-ranging reflection on contemporary human experience and expression provokes new understandings of the planet to which we are intimately connected.<br>

  Abstract: In anthropology, the notion of creativity has received renewed attention in recent years. Partly in response to the general historicization of the subject matter which took place during the 1980s, anthropologists have turned towards the processes of change inherent in any society. Cultural creativity is investigated as an ever-emergent feature in the world (Wagner 1981), and it is generally acknowledged that the ‘healthy perpetuation of cultural traditions requires invention as well as rote repetition’ (Rosaldo et al. 1993:5).<br>

  Book Title: On the Anarchy of Poetry and Philosophy-A Guide for the Unruly<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRUNS GERALD L.<br>
  Abstract: Marcel Duchamp once asked whether it is possible to make something that is not a work of art. This question returns over and over in modernist culture, where there are no longer any authoritative criteria for what can be identified (or excluded) as a work of art. As William Carlos Williams says, A poem can be made of anything,even newspaper clippings.At this point, art turns into philosophy, all art is now conceptual art, and the manifesto becomes the distinctive genre of modernism. This book takes seriously this transformation of art into philosophy, focusing upon the systematic interest that so many European philosophers take in modernism. Among the philosophers Gerald Bruns discusses are Theodor W. Adorno, Maurice Blanchot, Arthur Danto, Stanley Cavell, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Franois Lyotard, Jean-Luc Nancy, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, and Emmanuel Levinas.As Bruns demonstrates, the difficulty of much modern and contemporary poetry can be summarized in the idea that a poem is made of words, not of any of the things that we use words to produce: meanings, concepts, propositions, narratives, or expressions of feeling. Many modernist poets have argued that in poetry language is no longer a form of mediation but a reality to be explored and experienced in its own right. But what sort of experience, philosophically, might this be? The problem of the materiality or hermetic character of poetic language inevitably leads to questions of how philosophy itself is to be written and what sort of communitydefines the work of art-or, for that matter, the work of philosophy.In this provocative study, Bruns answers that the culture of modernism is a kind of anarchist community, where the work of art is apt to be as much an event or experience-or, indeed, an alternative form of life-as a formal object. In modern writing, philosophy and poetry fold into one another. In this book, Bruns helps us to see how.<br>

  Abstract: In the collection of Napoleonic bon mots that Balzac collected and published in 1838, the French emperor at one point states, “War is above all a matter of tact.”¹ The pithy formulation compresses a whole discourse in philosophy, military theory, pedagogy, and literature into a single concept. What for Napoleon, or at least for Balzac’s Napoleon, is presented as a self-evident truth in need of no further explanation was the subject of a more detailed analysis in various fields that attempted to develop a kind of knowledge that could guide action.

We are often told that our own world and culture are bad guides to what went on in the past, and the desire to avoid ethnocentrism is obvious and understandable. This has, however, regrettable consequences, since it can lead to the creation of very general, if not rather abstract theory. Current interest in agency is a good case in point.

This is the so-called ontological argument first presented by Anselm of Canterbury (c.1033-1109). Here Anselm argues that, from the definition of God – that ‘God is something than which nothing greater can be conceived’ – one may conclude, as a matter of logic, that God exists, his existence being a necessary requirement of his unsurpassable greatness.

  Book Title: Radical Embodiment-  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Nikkel David H.<br>
  Abstract: "Radical embodiment" refers to an anthropology and an epistemology fundamentally rooted in our bodies as always in correlation with our natural and social worlds. All human rationality, meaning, and value arise not only instrumentally but also substantively from this embodiment in the world. Radical embodiment reacts against Enlightenment mind-body dualism, as well as its monistic offshoots, including the physicalism that reduces everything to component matter-energy at the expense of subjectivity and meaning. It also rejects certain forms of postmodernism that reinscribe modern dualisms. David H. Nikkel develops the perspective of "radical embodiment" by examining varieties of modern and postmodern theology, and the nature and role of tradition-in terms of linguistic and non-linguistic experience, the religion and science dialogue on the nature of consciousness, and the immanent and transcendent aspects of God.<br>

There is something invaluable, for instance, in the art of making distinctions, and among the many ways of acquiring such facility, this skill is especially promoted by training in logic, philosophy of nature, and metaphysics. It is not just a matter of avoiding arbitrary distinctions without a basis in real differences but of devising distinctions that make their cuts between diverse natural kinds. Crucial to the theoretical justification for this activity is the notion that things have real natures that can be discovered by human inquiry.<br>

  Abstract: Anthropologists have become increasingly involved as participants on development teams, but their great potential to promote sustainable development is hindered by vestiges of one of cultural anthropology’s founding myths. It is the notion of cultures construed as self-contained symbol systems, conceptually opaque to all but true insiders, with an implied notion of correct translation, which makes it an ‘all or nothing’ matter. This notion is also linked to long-standing concerns in the field with moral relativism, value neutrality and colonialism.

  Abstract: A central figure in the reconception of early Christian history over the last three decades, Wayne A. Meeks offers here a selection of his most influential writings on the New Testament and early Christianity. His essays illustrate recent changes in our thinking about the early Christian movement and pose provocative questions regarding the history of this period.Meeks explores a fascinating range of topics, from the figure of the androgyne in antiquity to the timeless matter of God's reliability, from Paul's ethical rhetoric to New Testament pictures of Christianity's separation from Jewish communities. Meeks' introduction offers a retrospective on New Testament studies of the past thirty years and explains the intersection of these studies with a variety of exploratory and revisionist movements in the humanities, embracing social theory, history, anthropology, and literature. In an epilogue the author reflects on future directions for New Testament scholarship.<br>

  Book Title: Freedom and Time-A Theory of Constitutional Self-Government<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): RUBENFELD JED<br>
  Abstract: Should we try to "live in the present"? Such is the imperative of modernity, Jed Rubenfeld writes in this important and original work of political theory. Since Jefferson proclaimed that "the earth belongs to the living"-since Freud announced that mental health requires people to "get free of their past"-since Nietzsche declared that the happy man is the man who "leaps" into "the moment-modernity has directed its inhabitants to live in the present, as if there alone could they find happiness, authenticity, and above all freedom.But this imperative, Rubenfeld argues, rests on a profoundly inadequate, deforming picture of the relationship between freedom and time. Instead, Rubenfeld suggests, human freedom-human being itself--necessarily extends into both past and future; self-government consists of giving our lives meaning and purpose over time. From this conception of self-government, Rubenfeld derives a new theory of constitutional law's place in democracy. Democracy, he writes, is not a matter of governance by the present "will of the people"; it is a matter of a nation's laying down and living up to enduring political and legal commitments. Constitutionalism is not counter to democracy, as many believe, or a pre-condition of democracy; it is or should be democracy itself--over time. On this basis, Rubenfeld offers a new understanding of constitutional interpretation and of the fundamental right of privacy.<br>

For them, what happens happens in order to be turned into verse or prose. And so literature itself may be understood as sheer ego channeled into print, undertaken with the perfect conviction that experience is concluded only upon being written down.<br>

  Abstract: What Iago’s taunt reveals, if gruesomely, is a second problem with self-congruence and sincerity.¹ Beyond the ”problem of imperfection” lies the ”problem of inexpressibility.” Even if the self were worthy of externalization, externalization is no simple matter. Iago’s villainous example reminds us that appearances (including of sincerity) are often deceptive. In effect, sincerity’s advocates forget the very realization that led them to value that virtue in the first place: people lie. Worse, we cannot tell when people lie.<br>

The satisfaction may result from the new attention history has got in the realm of the humanities.

Yet he is best placed in a transatlantic context, for his failure—and his success—directly stem from his American displacement. Poe not only inaugurates a species of estheticism that modulates into Symbolism, but sounds an abiding inflection of American poetic language, which is heard in the modernism of T. S.

In the field of Holocaust studies, this division is a matter of principle for some scholars, who focus solely on the testimonies and histories of the victims.

  Book Title: In Praise of Heteronomy-Making Room for Revelation<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Westphal Merold<br>
  Abstract: Recognizing the essential heteronomy of postmodern philosophy of religion, Merold Westphal argues against the assumption that human reason is universal, neutral, and devoid of presupposition. Instead, Westphal contends that any philosophy is a matter of faith and the philosophical encounter with theology arises from the very act of thinking. Relying on the work of Spinoza, Kant, and Hegel, Westphal discovers that their theologies render them mutually incompatible and their claims to be the voice of autonomous and universal reason look dubious. Westphal grapples with this plural nature of human thought in the philosophy of religion and he forwards the idea that any appeal to the divine must rest on a historical and phenomenological analysis.<br>

  Abstract: Part religious studies, part feminist theory, part philosophy, part indescribable: such is Numinous Subjects. Described by the author as 'a kaleidoscopic exploration of why three gendered figures of the sacred matter within western culture,' the experience of reading this text truly is akin to gazing through a constantly turning kaleidoscope. Images, concepts, phrases and quotes are continually revisited, recombined, though never repeated in quite the same way. From these tumbling constellations arises a new understanding and wary appreciation of the figures of the virgin, the mother, and the whore. Drawing on the insights of thinkers as diverse as Rudolph Otto, Julia Kristeva, Simone de Beauvoir, and Martin Buber, Numinous Subjects simultaneously expands and focuses our attention on the myth of the sacred and its implications for female subjects in western culture today.<br>

Whatever is affirmed of a period, a people, or a nation, no matter how well-grounded by factual study and reflection, is subject to qualification. Exceptions to broad characterizations may always be found without mitigating the value of the broader insight. We grasp something when an author refers to the Greeks, to Roman civilization, to the Hellenic period, to Christendom, to the Benedictines, to the Renaissance, or to the Enlightenment.

  Abstract: For Erasmus the source of theology is Scripture (and also good literature), and the subject matter of theology is the commonplaces (loci) drawn from the divine wisdom in Scripture (and also from nature). What is more, Christ is the center of Scripture and therefore the central hermeneutical principle of interpretation (even of good literature). But the way Erasmus interpreted Scripture and arranged theology was informed by rhetoric. The present task is, therefore, to explore in detail how interpretation, theology, and rhetoric are intertwined. To begin, it might perhaps help to suggest that Erasmus’s formal principle of interpretation was theological (or<br>

  Abstract: To introduce Herodotus, I made use of the Janus image that represents him gazing into an unspecified and unfocused distance and toward, perhaps, a posterity that looks back at him; to examine Herodotean history, however, I want to look at him from the standpoint of this posterity, or at least its most recent stage.¹ What Herodotus was in the pristine condition of his own experiences is a matter of antiquarian debate, but the reception and interpretation of his work, which was “published” and so separated from its creator more than twenty-four centuries ago, is something for readers, critics, and historians<br>

  Author(s) Stanley Christopher D.<br>
  Abstract: The degree of Paul’s respect for the original context of his Old Testament allusions and quotations is a matter of ongoing debate. In his essay in this volume, Steve Moyise argues that “‘respect’ is not a very precise term” to convey the types of complex and daring interpretations that Paul offers of Old Testament texts. The imprecision of the phrase “respect for context” is a subset of a muddled conception of authorial intention more broadly; Stanley Porter comments rightly that “biblical scholars need a more precise definition of intentionality.”¹<br>

  Abstract: Scholarly analyses of violence, including this study, also constitute a type of mediation and a genre with its own rules, expectations, and pitfalls. Many scholars who have taken violence as their subject of study have been keenly aware that violence is an especially challenging, perhaps even distinctive subject matter (see Nordstrom and Robben 1995; Donham 2006; Lubkemann 2008). Thus Donald Donham argues in his essay “Staring at Suffering”: “violence is a different kind of representational object than market systems or kinship. . . . Violence is red.

  Author(s) Musser Charles<br>
  Abstract: Writing in 1922, flushed with the excitement of seeing Abel Gance’s La Roue, Fernand Léger tried to define something of the radical possibilities of the cinema. The potential of the new art did not lie in “imitating the movements of nature” or in “the mistaken path” of its resemblance to theater. Its unique power was a “matter of
                     making images seen.”¹ It is precisely this harnessing of visibility, this act of showing and exhibition, which I feel cinema before 1906 displays most intensely. [Its] inspiration for the avant-garde of the early decades of this century needs to be re-explored.<br>

  Book Title: The Reparative in Narratives-Works of Mourning in Progress<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROSELLO MIREILLE<br>
  Abstract: The authors studied in this book can be visualized as the islands that constitute an unknown, fragile and trembling literary and cultural Francophone archipelago. The archipelago does not appear on any map, in the middle of an ocean whose name we already know. No Francophone anthology would put these authors together as a matter of course because what connects them is a narrative grammar rather than a national origin or even a language. Yet, their writing techniques and their apprehension of the real (the ways in which they know and name the world) both reflect and actively participate in our evolving perception of what Gayatri Spivak calls the “planet”. The Reparative in Narratives argues that argue that they repair trauma through writing. One description of these awe-inspiring, tender and sometimes horrifying tales is that their narrators are survivors who have experienced and sometimes inflicted unspeakable acts of violence. And yet, ultimately, despair, nihilism, cynicism or silence are never the consequences of their encounter with what some quickly call evil. The traumatic event has not killed them and has not killed their desire to write or perform, although the decidedly altered life that they live in the aftermath of the disaster forces them to become different types of storytellers. They are the first-person narrators of their story, and their narration reinvents them as speaking subjects. In turn, this requires that we accept new reading pacts. That pact is a temporal and geographical signature: the reparative narrative needs readers prepared to accept that healing belongs to the realm of possibilities and that exposure and denunciation do not exhaust the victim’s range of possibilities. Rosello contends that this context-specific yet repeating pattern constitutes a response to the contemporary figuration of both globalized and extremely localized types of traumatic memories.<br>

It is certainly a controversial subject: it was probably one of the main causes for the impact that Modiano’s first novels had on the public, instantly creating a reputation for the young author.¹ We may wonder, however, whether there was more to this reaction than that of simple choice of subject matter.

  Abstract: Within the modern West we have learnt to think of the Enlightenment as a secular project which claims to think of individuals as rational selves. Where faith was positioned within pre-modern societies which were organised around tradition, we learnt within an Enlightenment vision of modernity to find reason. People were no longer expected to accept beliefs as a matter of faith but could confidently expect to have to prove their beliefs according to reason. This helped radically to redefine the relationship between public and private spheres and religious belief became a matter of individual choice alone. So it was that<br>

  Book Title: Commemorating the Irish Famine-Memory and the Monument<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): MARK-FITZGERALD EMILY<br>
  Abstract: Commemorating the Irish Famine: Memory and the Monument presents for the first time a visual cultural history of the 1840s Irish Famine, tracing its representation and commemoration from the 19th century up to its 150th anniversary in the 1990s and beyond. As the watershed event of 19th century Ireland, the Famine’s political and social impacts profoundly shaped modern Ireland and the nations of its diaspora. Yet up until the 1990s, the memory of the Famine remained relatively muted and neglected, attracting little public attention. Thus the Famine commemorative boom of the mid-1990s was unprecedented in scale and output, with close to one hundred monuments newly constructed across Ireland, Britain, the United States, Canada and Australia. Drawing on an extensive global survey of recent community and national responses to the Famine’s anniversary, and by outlining why these memories matter and to whom, this book argues how the phenomenon of Famine commemoration may be understood in the context of a growing memorial culture worldwide. It offers an innovative look at a well-known migration history whilst exploring how a now-global ethnic community redefines itself through acts of public memory and representation.<br>

Until the early decades of the twentieth century what we now call literary and cultural studies was called philology, and all its interpretive procedures were clearly understood to be grounded in textual scholarship. But twentieth-century textual studies shifted their center from philology to hermeneutics, that subset of philological inquiry focused on the specifically literary interpretation of culture.<br>

  Abstract: TO collect a series of essays beneath the terms ʺAmerican Indian,ʺ ʺrhetoric,ʺ and ʺsurvivanceʺ raises significant and potentially vexing questions. The terms of the subject matter are themselves contested. To begin with, why ʺsurvivanceʺ rather than ʺsurvivalʺ? While ʺsurvivalʺ conjures images of a stark minimalist clinging at the edge of existence, survivance goes beyond mere survival to acknowledge the dynamic and creative nature of Indigenous rhetoric. But ʺsurvivanceʺ is the easiest of the three terms to explain. For what is meant by ʺrhetoricʺ? Are there multiple rhetorics? Is rhetoric merely ornamentation: ʺthe embellishment of speech first in tropes and figures,<br>

  Abstract: Intimacy is crucial for autobiography because the force and significance of this kind of text depends primarily on a close relation between the reader and the teller. Intimacy is also a factor in religious self-disclosure because religious identity in American culture is a personal matter and not publicly displayed. This study exposes and explores the convergence of these two kinds of intimacy.<br>

                  L’Hôtel du Bon Plaisir(2009), the spatial approach to multiple (post) colonial histories, both personal and cultural, shapes the way we interpret the intersecting destinies of his protagonists. As a matter of fact the titular hotel turns out to be the most important protagonist of all, showing that shared space creates community and shelters its evolving history. Although Confiant’s novel shares with Chamoiseau’sTexacoa profound thematic and methodological kinship centered on exploring through the category of space the nonhierarchical multiplicity of Créolité, the intertwined narratives inL’Hôtel du Bon Plaisiremerge as part of a vertical<br>

  Abstract: The categorisation of nationalism as an ideology is a matter of some confusion in contemporary political analysis. Textbooks on political ideologies adopt widely different positions. Thus Adams regards nationalism as an ideology, however flawed, observing that “among modern ideologies, nationalism is the simplest, the clearest and the least theoretically sophisticated, but it is also the most widespread and the one with the strongest grip on popular feeling.”¹ On the other hand, Ball and Dagger note that “nationalism and anarchism take so many forms and are so entwined with so many different ideologies that we think it better not to treat<br>

Categories of explanation became available for questions concerning the nature of matter, the mortality or immortality of the soul, and above all, generation and corruption, which the few atomists of the Middle Ages, such as Nicholas of Autrecourt or Nicole Oresme, had had to glean indirectly from the numerical Pythagoreanism of Plato’sTimaeus; the critical commentary of Aristotle, Cicero, or Lanctatius; or the poetry of Virgil.¹<br>

However, whereas Ernest Gellner said of nationalism that it is able to invent nations even where they do not exist, Anderson (1983, 6) asserts that the process of nation-creating is not so much one of false fabrication as it is one of active creation: in a sense there are no “true” communities that can be juxtaposed to “false,” or invented,<br>

  Book Title: What's Happened to the Humanities?-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kernan Alvin<br>
  Abstract: This volume of specially commissioned original essays presents the thoughts of some of the most distinguished commentators within the American academy on the fundamental changes that have taken place in the humanities in the latter part of the twentieth century. In the transformation of American higher education from the university to the "demoversity," the humanities have become a less and less important part of education, a matter established by a statistical appendix and elaborated on in several of the essays. The individual essays offer close observations into how the humanities have been affected by declining academic status, by demographic shifts, by reductions in financial support, and by changing communication technology. They also explore the effect of these forces on books, libraries, and the phenomenology of reading in the age of images. When basic conditions change, theory follows, and several essays trace the appearance and effect of new relativistic epistemologies in the humanities. Social institutions change as well in such circumstances, and the volume concludes with studies of the new social arrangements that have developed in the humanities in recent years: the attack on professionalism and the effort to transform the humanities into the social conscience of academia and even of the nation as a whole.<br>

For, in spite of Yeats’s assertion, in dreams one is responsible primarily to oneself, and no matter how enmeshing the psychological lures, or how fascinating the specular authority of one’s own demons, the chance to awake is always potentially at hand, the movement of a radical deliverance already implicit in the very repressions that had constituted the original terror.<br>

  Abstract: Aristotle knew the answer. For him the matter of the division of labor between historiographer and poet was easily decided: the historiographer relates “what has happened,” and the poet “what might happen.”¹ In contrast to Plato’s devastating criticism of literature, Aristotle considered poetry to be of high value. In Aristotle’s eyes, literature dealt with problems of a more general and thus more significant nature, while the historian had to report about specific, and thus,
                  eo ipso,less important matters. Aristotle’s distinctions notwithstanding, one might assume that Calliope and Clio paid scant attention to whether they were called upon by rhapsodists<br>

  Book Title: Gender and Narrativity-  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): RUTLAND BARRY<br>
  Abstract: It is impossible to imagine a community that is not divided into at least two gender groups. It is equally impossible to imagine a community that does not tell or enact stories. The relationship between these universal aspects of human culture is the mainspring of Gender and Narrativity. From Genesis to Freud, the Western narrative tradition tells the same old story of masculine dominance/feminine subservience as a matter of divine will or natural truth. Here, nine Canadian scholars challenge and interpret this tradition, in effect "re-telling" the story of gender, and themselves intervening in the narrative process. Critical readings from a wide range of literary texts - medieval and modern, European and Canadian - replace abstract theory in these studies, while sociology, anthropology, psychoanalysis, deconstruction and new history are the axes of discussion. This book exemplifies the current range and diversity of Canadian critical writing.<br>

Indeed, the material body of money is seen as less important than the semiotic value attached to certain objects by way of the brain’s ability to invest substance with meaning and purpose. ‘Money’ – suggests Norman O.

It is nevertheless still a matter of dispute whether a civil society has in fact emerged on the level of the European Union or<br>

  Abstract: An artifact is an entity designed and created by an intentional agent who is capable of imagining the world as it might otherwise be, evaluating the alternatives, and devising strategies for realizing them.¹ A living thing is artifactual, not natural, to the extent that it is designed and engineered by an agent. The difference between artifactual organisms and natural organisms is thus in their origins, and it is a matter of degree.<br>

  Abstract: “Children’s literature” is a term used to describe both a set of texts and an academic discipline—and it is often regarded as an oxymoron. If “children” commonly connotes immaturity, and “literature” commonly connotes sophistication in texts and reading, then the two terms may seem to be incompatible. Henry James, in “The Future of the Novel” (1900b), observed that “the literature, as it may be called for convenience, of children, is an industry,” but not one to be taken seriously: “the sort of taste that used to be called ‘good’ has nothing to do with the matter; we are demonstrably<br>

  Book Title: Religious Imaginaries-The Liturgical and Poetic Practices of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Christina Rossetti, and Adelaide Procter<br>
  Publisher: Ohio University Press<br>
  Author(s): DIELEMAN KAREN<br>
  Abstract: Religious Imaginariesexplores liturgical practice as formative for how three Victorian women poets imagined the world and their place in it and, consequently, for how they developed their creative and critical religious poetics. In doing so, this new study rethinks several assumptions in the field: that Victorian women's faith commitments tend to limit creativity; that the contours of church experiences matter little for understanding religious poetry; and that gender is more significant than liturgy in shaping women's religious poetry.Exploring the import of bodily experience for spiritual, emotional, and cognitive forms of knowing, Karen Dieleman explains and clarifies the deep orientations of different strands of nineteenth-century Christianity, such as Congregationalism's high regard for verbal proclamation, Anglicanism and Anglo-Catholicism's valuation of manifestation, and revivalist Roman Catholicism's recuperation of an affective aesthetic. Looking specifically at Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Christina Rossetti, and Adelaide Procter as astute participants in their chosen strands of Christianity, Dieleman reveals the subtle textures of these women's religious poetry: the different voices, genres, and aesthetics they create in response to their worship experiences. Part recuperation, part reinterpretation, Dieleman's readings highlight each poet's innovative religious poetics.Dieleman devotes two chapters to each of the three poets: the first chapter in each pair delineates the poet's denominational practices and commitments; the second reads the corresponding poetry.Religious Imaginarieshas appeal for scholars of Victorian literary criticism and scholars of Victorian religion, supporting its theoretical paradigm by digging deeply into primary sources associated with the actual churches in which the poets worshipped, detailing not only the liturgical practices but also the architectural environments that influenced the worshipper's formation.

  Abstract: It is a widespread convention that the identification of the initial audience is a necessary preliminary to the proper understanding of New Testament texts and so belongs to the introductory matter, for example, of a commentary.

The first is that the letters are addressed to “the Johannine community” (or, less commonly now, the Johannine circle), a conviction that has played an important role in resisting, at least for the Fourth Gospel, the contention that the “Gospels [were] for all Christians”<br>

  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Frisch Andrea<br>
  Abstract: This study argues that the political and legislative process of forgetting internal differences, undertaken in France after the civil wars of the sixteenth century, leads to subtle yet fundamental shifts in the broader conception of the relationship between readers or spectators on the one hand, and the matter of history, on the other. These shifts, occasioned by the desire for communal reconciliation and generally associated with an increasingly modern sensibility, will nonetheless prove useful to the ideologies of cultural and political absolutism.<br>

  Abstract: In the early nineteenth century, Schleiermacher noted that ‘understanding is an unending task’ and ‘the talent for misunderstanding is infinite’.² In more recent times, meaning has been understood as an endless deferral; the more one tries to grasp it, the more it appears ungraspable. This rings especially true if we consider the particular form of understanding that is translation. Since the meaning of a text is closely attached to its ‘letter’ – its sound or signifier – translation can never be a simple transfer of meaning.

Thus, ‘radical democracy’ means to grasp or draw out the root meaning or conditions of democracy that have been obscured in its various historical appropriations. Radical democrats argue that there are two central, intertwined and historically constituted root meanings or conditions of democracy: first, the free and equal participation of ‘the people’ (thedemos) in power (kratos); and,<br>

This event had heavily dislocating effects on Western political thought – no matter whether Marxist or not.

In the biophilosophical tradition of hylomorphism which includes Aristotle and Kant equally, life is isolated from the material it animates, since, as Toscano explains, life ‘cannot organize itself, it can only organize matter’ (Toscano 2006: 36). From the hylomorphic point of view, a self-organising life would be unintelligible, since the forms which organise matter would be indistinguishable from matter itself. Life is thus properly speaking ‘immaterial’ and immortal, the pure formal movement of the concept, while matter is mere lifeless receptivity. Deleuze is critical of this position,¹ and it<br>

  Author(s) Brecher Michael<br>
  Abstract: A forty-year retrospect is a difficult challenge for feminist theory and gender studies. For thirty of those years there was almost total silence on gender issues in international relations (IR); women were barely visible as scholars and foreign policy practitioners, as well as in the subject matter of the discipline. The invisibility in the discipline was not because gender was, and for some still is, irrelevant but because international relations, in both its theory and practice, was so thoroughly gendered that, in Cynthia Enloe’s words, no one noticed that women were missing.¹ So clearly, feminist approaches to IR have come<br>

  Abstract: Moral philosophers have for some time been arguing that global poverty and associated human suffering are universal concerns, and that there is a moral obligation, not just a matter of charity, for wealthier countries to do more to alleviate global poverty. The scope of this moral concern is the topic of considerable debate, and it is unclear to many that this obligation is grounded in justice, rather than in humanitarian duties to foreigners. In this chapter I suggest that if we are serious about addressing the problem of global health inequalities, we need to develop a better conception of global<br>

  Book Title: Visiones de Estereoscopio-Paradigma de hibridación en la ficción y el arte de la vanguardia española<br>
  Publisher: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Department of Romance Studies<br>
  Author(s): UTRERA MARÌA SOLEDAD FERNÁNDEZ<br>
  Abstract: This book, written in Spanish, focuses on the literary and artistic works of such avant-garde figures as Ramon Gomez de la Serna, Benjamin Jarnes, Antonio de Obregon, Juan Chabas, Rosa Chacel, Claudio de la Torre, Almada Negreiros, Maruja Mallo, Mauricio Amster, Manuel Reinoso, Diego Rivera, and Angeles Santos y Victorio Macho. It identifies the attempt to integrate conflicting epistemological, ethical, and sociopolitical categories as the organizational principle driving the avant-garde novel and art. Seen as a means of escaping the Cartesian dualism of mind and matter, the conflict between ethical institutionism and utilitarianism, and the opposition of liberalism by socialism, this "middle path" manifests itself in the avant-garde on various levels: the theory of representation, the development of the protagonist, and the concept of history.<br>

  Abstract: The novel and the theater are two forms of fiction: in both cases, it is a matter of creating an imaginary world, and making characters, whose story constitutes what is called the plot, enter into this world. In order for the impact of the work to surpass that of simple entertainment, the story must also have a signification. Through carefully constructed lies, the book, like the play, strives to communicate a general human truth, but they do not rely on the same devices, and they do not seek the same type of truth.<br>

  Abstract: Group. Art. Text. Genre. Performance. Context. Tradition. Identity. _x000B_No matter where we are--in academic institutions, in cultural agencies, at home, or in a casual conversation--these are words we use when we talk about creative expression in its cultural contexts. Eight Words for the Study of Expressive Culture is a thoughtful, interdisciplinary examination of the keywords that are integral to the formulation of ideas about the diversity of human creativity, presented as a set of essays by leading folklorists. _x000B_Many of us use these eight words every day. We think with them. We teach with them. Much of contemporary scholarship rests on their meanings and implications. They form a significant part of a set of conversations extending through centuries of thought about creativity, meaning, beauty, local knowledge, values, and community. Their natural habitats range across scholarly disciplines from anthropology and folklore to literary and cultural studies and provide the framework for other fields of practice and performance as well. _x000B_Eight Words for the Study of Expressive Culture is a much-needed study of keywords that are frequently used but not easily explained. Anchored by Burt Feintuchs cogent introduction, the book features essays by Dorothy Noyes, Gerald L. Pocius, Jeff Todd Titon, Trudier Harris, Deborah A.

This appropriation is neither by accident nor by fraudulent intent; for some time now, other professionals, engineers, landscape architects, and planners, have performed some of the skills that had traditionally defined the architect’s role, and have done so reliably.<br>

He has said little, in contrast, about ongoing activities in Afghanistan (Habermas 1991, 1999; Habermas and Derrida 2003;

  Abstract: Cosmopolitanism, I have claimed, is, first of all, a moral-ethical matter—the idea that every person, wherever they live and whatever citizen ship they hold (or do not hold), commands our respect and moral concern. This imperative can be formulated in various ways, some of which I explored in the last chapter: that we should recognize the humanity of others as deserving of fully human lives, as having equal moral standing, or as if they had equal say in the rules and institutions that govern our interaction. All these formulations have the effect of expanding the scope of our moral<br>

  Abstract: Jürgen Habermas has argued that “although the assumption toward secularization holds for most of Europe, the explanatory power of the secularization hypothesis is now a matter of dispute because the causal connection between secularization and social modernization is no longer posed only as a diachronic and self-referential issue within western culture.”¹ For that reason, he continues, “the encounter with religion as a contemporary intellectual formation requires secular thought to engage in a reflection of its own origins that takes the form of a genealogy of secular post-metaphysical thought within the horizon of the Axial Age and of the discussion of<br>

Moreover, we’re told that one reigns over the other: the flesh dominates the soul, matter possesses the spirit, and emotions submerge reason—all of which affirm the tenets of the ascetic ideal. On the one hand, we have the evil of incarnation; on the other hand, we have the possibility of salvation in immateriality, which, in a nonsensical paradox, we are told is invisible, impossible to identify or to locate, yet it resides

  Abstract: The return to Kant is in fact the choice of a single path that brings an end to the tension in the critical project. It is a matter of “returning” to the question of representation as an explication of the relation between a subject and an object. Let’s first of all recall that, from 1810 to 1850, Hegel and his disciples were the main figures on the philosophical scene. Henri Dussort points this out, “From 1800 to about 1840, speculative thought, its famous developers and their disciples occupied the center stage.”¹ Friedrich Engels himself noted that this enthusiasm for the<br>

  Abstract: In
      Mourning in America, McIvor addresses significant and urgent questions about how citizens can mourn traumatic events and enduring injustices in their communities. McIvor offers a framework for analyzing the politics of mourning, drawing from psychoanalysis, Greek tragedy, and scholarly discourses on truth and reconciliation.Mourning in Americaconnects these literatures to ongoing activism surrounding racial injustice, and it contextualizes Black Lives Matter in the broader politics of grief and recognition. McIvor also examines recent, grassroots-organized truth and reconciliation processes such as the Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission (2004-2006), which provided a public examination of the Greensboro Massacre of 1979-a deadly incident involving local members of the Communist Workers Party and the Ku Klux Klan.<br>

  Abstract: Many observers have described Western intellectual and legal histories as moving from notions of fixed and assigned status to notions of individual freedom and rights. Sir Henry Maine’s famous dictum defined progress as the movement from status to contract.¹ Such broadly gauged summaries risk oversimplification and insensitivity to the variety and contestability of understandings of the past. Nonetheless, the contrast between legal orders premised upon status and those premised upon state-guaranteed rights helps to locate notions of abnormal persons and rights analysis as ways for dealing with differences.

  Book Title: Twenty Years On-Competing Memories of the GDR in Postunification German Culture<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Tate Dennis<br>
  Abstract: Twenty years on from the dramatic events that led to the opening of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the GDR, the subjective dimension of German unification is still far from complete. The nature of the East German state remains a matter of cultural as well as political debate. This volume of new research focuses on competing memories of the GDR and the ways they have evolved in the mass media, literature, and film since 1989-90. Taking as its point of departure the impact of iconic visual images of the fall of the Wall on our understanding of the historical GDR, the volume first considers the decade of cultural conflict that followed unification and then the emergence of a more complex and diverse "textual memory" of the GDR since the Berlin Republic was established in 1999. It highlights competing generational perspectives on the GDR era and the unexpected "afterlife" of the GDR in recent publications. The volume as a whole shows the vitality of eastern German culture two decades after the demise of the GDR and the centrality of these memory debates to the success of Germany's unification process.

She was also saying something about the literature that was, according to her, most appropriate for the French national–political context of her day.

  Book Title: Spanish Golden Age Poetry in Motion-The Dynamics of Creation and Conversation<br>

  Author(s): TORRES ISABEL<br>
  Abstract: The fourteen essays of this volume engage in distinct ways with the matter of motion in early modern Spanish poetics, without limiting the dialectic of stasis and movement to any single sphere or manifestation. Interrogation of the interdependence of tradition and innovation, poetry, power and politics, shifting signifiers, the intersection of topography and deviant temporalities, the movement between the secular and the sacred, tensions between centres and peripheries, issues of manuscript circulation and reception, poetic calls and echoes across continents and centuries, and between creative writing and reading subjects, all demonstrate that Helgerson's central notion of conspicuous movement is relevant beyond early sixteenth-century secular poetics, By opening it up we approximate a better understanding of poetry's flexible spatio-temporal co-ordinates in a period of extraordinary historical circumstances and conterminous radical cultural transformation. Los catorce ensayos de este volumen conectan de una manera perceptible con el tema del movimiento en la poesía española del siglo de oro, sin limitar la dialéctica de la estasis y movimiento a una sola esfera o manifestación única. Entre los multiples enfoques cabe destacar: el cuestionamiento de la interdependencia de la tradición e inovación, de la poesía, del poder y la política, de los significantes que se transforman, de los espacios que conectan y cruzan con los tiempos 'desviados'; análisis de las tensiones entre lo sagrado y lo secular, del conflicto centro-periferia y del complejo sistema de producción, circulación y recepción de los manuscritos; el diálogo con el eco poético a través de los siglos y de los continentes y la construcción creativa del sujeto escritor y/o lector. Al abrir la noción central de Helgerson del "movimiento conspicuo" más allá de la poesía nueva secular, este libro propone un entendimiento más completo de las coordinadas espacio-temporales de la poesía en un periodo de circunstan~<br>

  Abstract: Once you grant Gary Becker his assumptions, you generally have to agree with his conclusions. So I will quibble with one of his assumptions: that the number of children in each generation is the same as the number of parents. I will take it on in a way that I think is fully consistent with what Becker wants to do. I will assume that the decision as to how many children to have is a matter of parental choice of investments in the next generation and therefore of course in further generations.<br>

  Book Title: Friendship and Love, Ethics and Politics-Studies in Mediaeval and Early Modern History<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Österberg Eva<br>
  Abstract: Today, friendship, love and sexuality are mostly viewed as private, personal and informal relations. In the mediaeval and early modern period, just like in ancient times, this was different. The classical philosophy of friendship (Aristotle) included both friendship and love in the concept of philia. It was also linked to an argument about the virtues needed to become an excellent member of the city state. Thus, close relations were not only thought to be a matter of pleasant gatherings in privacy, but just as much a matter of ethics and politics. What, then, happened to the classical ideas of close relations when they were transmitted to philosophers, clerical and monastic thinkers, state officials or other people in the medieval and early modern period? To what extent did friendship transcend the distinctions between private and public that then existed? How were close relations shaped in practice? Did dialogues with close friends help to contribute to the process of subject-formation in the Renaissance and Enlightenment? To what degree did institutions of power or individual thinkers find it necessary to caution against friendship or love and sexuality?<br>

  Abstract: I am a child of the 1980s. No matter how different my life is now from what could be imagined for a child born and raised in Ceauşescu’s last and craziest decade, I will always know I come from a different world. My academic research so far could be summarized as trying to explain and understand this different world and the people who inhabited it.<br>

  Abstract: In this brief comment I would like to address a problem that arises from a juxtaposition of some of the main concepts of the Europe Paper: how to build and maintain a “common European European culture” despite “cultural differences” dating from the Cold War; how to reconcile the project of “expansion” with the deepening of “European solidarity”? The proposal takes the view that solidarity is a matter of moral positions and positive action, rather than simply a question of the correct redistribution of goods. In this spirit, I would like to suggest a problem and an opportunity for Europeans who<br>

  Book Title: Given World and Time-Temporalities in Context<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Miller Tyrus<br>
  Abstract: The interconnections of time with historical thought and knowledge have come powerfully to the fore since the 1970s. An international group of scholars, from a range of fields including literary theory, history of ideas, cultural anthropology, philosophy, intellectual history and theology, philology, and musicology, address the matter of time and temporalities. The volume’s essays, divided into four main topical groups question critically the key problem of context, connecting it to the problem of time. Contexts, the essays suggest, are not timeless. Time and its contexts are only partly “given” to us: to the primordial donations of time and world correspond our epistemic, moral, and practical modes of receiving what has been granted. The notion of context may have radically different parameters in different historical, cultural, and disciplinary situations. Topics include the deep antiquity, and the timeless time of eternity, as well as formal philosophies of history and the forms of histories implicit in individual and community experience. The medium specific use of time and history are examined with regard to song, image, film, oral narration, and legal discourse.<br>

  Abstract: The next step in this discussion ought to be the interaction between the writing of literature and the writing of history, and, almost inevitably, the contrastive role played by utopia. In a way, of course, utopia combines both of these, while also connecting them with the matter discussed in the previous chapter, namely religion, with or without religion’s occasional involvement with politics.<br>

Abstract: There has been a need for a volume such as this in courses in applied or practical ethics. It can be paired with
      Animal LiberationorThe Case for Animal Rightsor—if the course has a broader, multi‐issue focus—it can serve as a stand‐alone introduction to the topic of the moral status of nonhuman animals. It might also be used as an intermediary between, say,Animal Liberation(setting out a “pro” position) and Peter Carruthers’sThe Animals Issue(setting out a “con” position). However it is used, the book will give students an appreciation for the power, subtlety, and fairness of philosophical analysis and criticism. The book is meticulously edited and elegantly written. Despite the depressing (and sometimes distressing) subject matter, it is a pleasure to read.<br>

Author(s): Vidal Fernando<br>
Abstract: Successive amputations of the body have been accompanied by an increasing precision concerning the part of flesh necessary for personal identity. Initially, there was an indeterminate portion of matter, which early on adopted the form of a seminal particle. Because embryology alone was incapable of accounting for identity, the seminal particle assumed some features of the brain. Endowed with a double function, the “germ” was entirely responsible for the postmortem development of resurrected persons as psychosomatic unities. But why bother with the body? All we need for Judgment Day is an accountable and conscious personality. To the extent that the brain is responsible for it, why not limit resurrection to the brain? And why not go a step further? If only part of the brain is necessary to be a
         person,shall we need it whole to enjoy the beatific vision?126Maybe just a fraction will suffice. This fraction will have to contain the information necessary for defining the self. A computer program might therefore be enough. The resurrectedIneed be nothing other than the computer equivalent of my brain. In this way, thanks to the progress of technology, to resurrect might eventually mean to be emulated by supercomputers; thus resurrected, we shall inhabit a hereafter whose technical name is cyberspace.127But how much can “we” disembody ourselves without becoming simulacra? Are we still “us” in a state of “postorganic” immortality?128<br>

Abstract: Focusing on group style directs us to watch how people draw boundaries in everyday life, and in particular, highlights the boundaries that people draw between different group settings. The symbolic boundaries school could find fuel for new research in the situational boundaries we describe—boundaries between backstage and frontstage, or between groups—such as ACES and their urban protestor allies—that mark the boundaries precisely by enacting different group styles, for example. We argue that individuals might draw evaluative boundaries between people differently in different settings. By following these differences from setting to setting, a researcher might better understand where and how gatekeepers—college admissions staff‐persons, job recruitment personnel, talent scouts—draw the boundaries when they are at
         work, where they matter most for social inequality, even while the same gatekeepers might privately abhor the existence of those boundaries when they are athome. For example, it would help us understand why even the most well‐meaning guidance counselors might consistently steer promising minority students away from good colleges (Mehan1978; Erickson and Schulz1982). Lamont says that her interviewees noticed some boundaries and ignored others; she notes that the absences are as noteworthy as the presences (Lamont1992, p. 4). We agree, adding that people can speak about some boundaries in some settings and not in others, and they can speak about boundaries differently in different settings; here, too, the silences are as noteworthy as the speech.<br>

Abstract: Furthermore, Greenbergs work was seen by some anthropological linguists, among them Sapirs student Mary Haas (
         1978:12122), as providing an alternative to the new paradigm in formal linguistics, Chomskys (transformational) generative grammar. Contrary to Chomsky, who was at the time concentrating mostly on English and advocating the need for students to work only on their native languages (in order to be able to rely on their own native intuitions), Greenberg promoted the study of as many languages as possible and was therefore viewed as an ally by descriptive and field linguists. But the exclusive concentration on grammar, together with the rapid growth of independent linguistics programs and departments in the United States, had a negative impact on those who identified themselves as anthropological linguists. Nonlinguists in anthropology departments started to question the need to have their own linguists in light of the existence of another department on the same campus devoted to the study of language. At the same time, the focus on grammatical description and the commitment to the grammatical and textual documentation of languages that were on the verge of becoming extinct (Moore1999) encouraged the identification of the field of anthropological linguistics with largely atheoretical descriptions of nonIndoEuropean, previously unwritten languages. Before becoming a negative stereotype among those outside the subfield, this narrow view of anthropological linguistics was explicitly articulated by some of its leading scholars. For example, Harry Hoijer (1961:10) defined anthropological linguistics as an area of research which is devoted in the main to studies, synchronic and diachronic, of the languages of the people who have no writing, and Carl Voegelin (1961:680) stated that anthropological linguistics was meant to reveal the subject matter of previously unknown languages and was in general more descriptive than other linguistic fields (pp. 67374).<br>

Abstract: In the course of the book, no real convergence is achieved; each one ends where he started, asserting his own beliefs, visions, and concerns. Has anything been gained in the process? The intense and occasionally pointed dialogues bring forth an incremental, but substantial clarification of the issues at hand, the issues at stake, and their potential (but not actual) interaction. The fact of the matter is that neuroscience has no privileged bearing on human affairs simply because it deals with the brain. Why push it to realms in which it does not belong?<br>

Author(s): Luhmann Niklas <br>
Abstract: The God‐term in Luhmann’s universe is “autopoesis,” essentially the self‐direction of the systems of society, including that of art, toward greater autonomy and complexity. Although Luhmann was a student of Talcott Parsons and his work bears the evolutionary interest of the functionalist paradigm, it is what many partisans of the older version might consider to be a mutant functionalism. As Luhmann avers, he considers “system differentiation” as “the heart of Parsons’s theory” (p. 350, n. 4) yet unlike Parsons’s optimistic sense that differentiation was undergirded by functional imperatives such as adaptive upgrading, Luhmann’s own sense is that the process of societal evolution “does not presuppose central norms, no matter how generalized” (p. 2). Essentially what this means is that society is composed of a set of systems (economy, politics, law, and art, among others) that evolve and complexify but not toward any unified state, such as Parsons’s “societal community.” Rather, each system tends toward its own independence and standards, and thus much of Luhmann’s book explores what he calls “the autonomy of art,” that is, the ability of the art system to develop its own “self‐description.”<br>

Abstract: Moments of crisis shed the first light on the matter. When something goes wrong with Hawking’s body (pain, discomfort) or with the computer (failure), the assistants—
         ever‐presentand ready to intervene, although discreet and relatively unobtrusive during the interview—are mobilized by the computer and the activation of its voice function. They try to be immediately operational by reading the words displayed on the computer screen or by reading Hawking’s face or by touching the various apparatuses surrounding him, just as a doctor would feel the various parts of a patient’s body to detect painful areas. Hawking is at the same time the surgeon in command of the bodies of others and the patient being taken care of by the others.37Thus the parts of the human or mechanical body to be repaired are identified (legsorchair‐in) and/or the operations to be carried out are indicated (suctionorget Tom). In this process Hawking’s voice acts as an indicator:yes, no,and so on. The distribution of tasks seems fairly well codified, though it can also be negotiated during the action. When the voice sayslegsorsuction,there is no ambiguity. The nurse is immediately operational, whereaschair‐incauses a moment’s hesitation. The nurse wants to extend her competence to repair the computer but, as we have seen, Hawking does not want her to intervene. That is Tom’s domain. The artificial voice is important because it is used to alert this small collective of assistants when there is a problem. It thus enables them to have a relatively large degree of autonomy. They are not forced to be constantly breathing down Hawking’s neck. The nurse, alerted by the voice, can serve as a relay between Hawking and Tom. It is also through this voice that a semblance of normal conversation with me can be created (yes, no, Why you?). He does not, however, use it to provide formal answers to my questions or to communicate with his assistants when they are around him. Thus, communication with Hawking w~<br>

Abstract: Not only does man know that he does not know himself, even if this were only because within his most intimate depths he discovers an unfathomable memory: “Magna vis est memoriae, nescio quid horrendum, Deus meus, profunda et infinita multiplicitas. Et hoc animus est et hoc ego ipse sum. Quid ego sum Deus? Quae natura sum?” (“Great is the power of memory, an awe‐inspiring mystery, my God, a power of profound and infinite multiplicity. And this is mind, this is I myself. What then am I, my God? What is my nature?”).
         31But above all, man understands, within this impasse, that the one who is alone in knowing him remains for him another, namely, God: “Utrum ita sim, nescio. Minus mihi in hac re notus sum ipse quam tu. Obsecro te, Deus meus, et me ipsum mihi indica” (“Whether I am one or the other I do not know. In this matter I know myself less well than I know you. I beseech you, my God, show me myself”).32Under Augustine’s analysis, man’s incomprehensibility to himself thus takes on yet wider and vaster dimensions. To begin with, as in the Greek fathers, the analysis points out not only the image and likeness of God within man’s incomprehensibility but also a unique privilege held by the human being with regard to all other creatures (which only resemble theirgenus, which is to say, themselves). Next, this incomprehensibility tells man that he goes beyond and exceeds himself, in short that “l’homme passe infiniment l’homme” (“man transcends man”), following the formulation of an exemplary Augustinian: in a word, man passes beyond his own means, man lives above his means.33Finally and above all, according to a strict consequence, only the infinite and incomprehensible can comprehend man, and thus tell him of and show him to himself; only God can reveal man to man, because man only reveals himself by revealing, without knowing it, the one whose image he bears. Not only is it true that “Je est un autre” (I is another), but this other calls himself God within man,~<br>

Abstract: Second, readers of Braudel’s
         Mediterranean,no matter how much of the book they actually have read, continue to be struck by the energy, engagement, and dedication of a fervent lover and committed convert. “I have passionately loved the Mediterranean, no doubt because I am a northerner like so many others in whose footsteps I have followed.”74This famous opening sentence in the preface to the first edition, dated May 1946, one year after VE Day and Braudel’s release from a German prisoner‐of‐war camp, resonates in Braudel’s remarks during a 1981 interview thirty‐five years later on his initial excitement at seeing the Mediterranean for the first time in October 1923 at the age of twenty‐one:
               North Africa freed Braudel, like so many earlier enchanted and enthralled romantic travelers, from his provincial complaisance. One can almost hear him chanting Goethe’s 1787 credo on finding one’s true self in the liberating southern sun: “I hardly recognize myself. I feel like a completely different person. Yesterday I thought: ‘Either you used to be mad, or you are now.’”It was for me such a surprise! I did not know the sea, I saw the Mediterranean, avowing that it is a present of the gods! Imagine someone like me who went down the Rhone Valley for the first time, who stopped at Marseille, who embarked on a boat and learned with pleasure that he had sea legs—it was just like that—and abruptly saw the arrival of Algiers on the horizon.… Algiers was the most beautiful city in France, after Paris, and a city itself very different, with, I would say, the beauty of its streets, the extraordinary beauty of its women.… It was hot, there was wine, fish, everything that one wants. For me, I began to live.

Abstract: See Edward Tufte, “The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint,”
               www.edwardtufte.com. Tufte’s argument can be appreciated in the parodic example he cites, Peter Norvig’s rendition of the Gettysburg Address in PowerPoint. He also effectively skewers the notorious PowerPoint presentation that failed to persuade NASA managers that there was a problem with the shuttleColumbia.For Tufte’s trilogy, seeEnvisioning Information(Cheshire, Conn., 1990),The Visual Display of Quantitative Information(Cheshire, Conn., 2001), andVisual Explanations: Images and Quantities, Evidence, and Narrative(Cheshire, Conn., 1997). In my view Tufte’s trilogy is theInstitutio oratoriaof our time. He has produced what is unmistakeably a rhetoric of information genres, for which no matter of presentation is too small or merely ornamental, even the thickness of the lines in a graph; see Tufte,The Visual Display of Quantitative Information,p. 185.<br>

Abstract: Lewis Coser’s concept of “non‐realistic” conflict (
            The Functions of Social Conflict[Glencoe, IL: Free Press, 1956], 48–55 and passim) is helpful for understanding this notion of the priority of the need to affirm communal identity over objective conflicts. In contrast to “realistic” struggles motivated by actual conflicts of interest, nonrealistic conflicts derive from an underlying need to maintain the cohesion of a social group. The actual matter of contention is more or less accidental in a situation of nonrealistic conflict. Coser, following Georg Simmel, notes that nonrealistic conflict is more apt to occur with respect to groups in which members participate with their entire personalities (58, 67ff.). Religious communities would represent the paradigmatic form of this type of social group. Of course, actual religious conflicts would involve both realistic and nonrealistic elements.<br>

Abstract: The two volumes under review here expand on these valuable historical insights. The first collection of essays, edited by Roger Chartier and his Italian counterpart, Guglielmo Cavallo, is very nearly a comprehensive overview of the issues, the sources, and the literature in the field from ancient Greece to the twentieth‐century Internet. Eleven prominent scholars join Chartier and Cavallo in an assessment of developments in their various specialties. Despite considerable differences in approach—linguistic, etymological, ethnographic, material, theological, social, and economic, among others—the essays share some themes, which the editors summarize well in their introduction. Historically speaking, a text written is not a text read; it does not speak for itself; readers must first give it meaning, which is often far removed from what the author had intended. As Paul Ricoeur put it in his
      Time and Narrative(trans. Kathleen McLaughlin and David Pellauer, 3 vols. [Chicago, 1984–88]), the world of the text and the world of the reader are not one and the same, and their relationship does not remain the same over time. Historians of the book, like Henri‐Jean Martin, have attended well to the changing modalities of the material text; historians of literacy, like François Furet and Jacques Ozouf, have also considered the limitations of textual reception; but only recently have historians pondered how historical changes in printed matter affected the way it was received, as Donald F. McKenzie recommends in his bibliographic sociology of texts. Similarly, historians have finally learned to take seriously the historical implications of Stanley Fish’s interpretive communities, whose predispositions to texts have a life of their own independent of the texts themselves in ways that can be traced over time. In this, we are at a considerable distance from the philological obsessions of nineteenth‐century literary scholarship.<br>

Abstract: What’s the difference between a “limit” and a “boundary,” and does it make a difference? Does it matter, for example, that
      Grenzenin the title of Immanuel Kant’s major work on the philosophy of religion,Die Religion innerhalb der Grenzen der blossen Vernunft, is perhaps better translated as “boundaries” and not as “limits”? According to Patrick Bourgeois’s recent book,Philosophy at the Boundary of Reason: Ethics and Postmodernity, much hangs on this distinction. The book pursues three interlocking agendas, each concerning themes of interest to scholars of religion and ethics. The author’s primary agenda is to draw attention to what he sees as a neglected philosophical distinction within the Kantian critical philosophy crucial to a proper interpretation of the notion of the “limit‐boundary of reason” and to the ruinous effects the failure to apprehend this distinction unleashed within twentieth‐century philosophy. Second, he pursues an important new reading of Paul Ricoeur as a philosopher who gets the idea of the limit‐boundary of reason right in his hermeneutical phenomenology. Finally, Bourgeois tries to show how getting the distinction right makes it possible to extricate the positive elements of postmodern ethics (especially Emmanuel Lévinas’s recognition of the ethical claim of alterity) from deconstruction’s false philosophy of limit as closure. In Bourgeois’s view, deconstruction decenters meaning and subjectivity to so large a degree as to render responsible human agency ineffectual.<br>

Abstract: Accordingly, Meyers examines the role of a series of gender‐specific images in women’s agency, addressing pronatalism, mother‐child imagery, the family, narcissism, aging, and sexuality. Each of these topics could occupy a book, and one hopes that Meyers will expand on the ideas developed here. The strength of this approach is the familiarity of the subject matter to a large audience—although not to all women—and Meyers strives to remain conscious of the fact that she cannot make universal claims about women. But many readers will find something in the text that resonates with their own experience. (Meyers’s discussion relies in part on interviews with women.) For example, when she criticizes “matrigyno‐idolatry” (32) or the pressure to become a mother, she does not merely report on tensions that some women face. Nor does she simply analyze the power of social discourse to manipulate women’s choices. Rather, she sticks to her middle path, demonstrating persuasively that there is currently no space in matrigyno‐idolatrous discourse for genuine autonomy for women, and she makes a parallel point for each set of images she examines. Whatever choice one makes—including the choice to remain childless, which, she correctly points out, is seldom considered by feminist theorists—there is a cultural image ready at hand to define and constrict women’s agency.<br>

Abstract: While Gare acknowledges that there are complexities and anomalies not adequately accounted for by this brief characterization of modern thought, nevertheless he contends that the history of modern philosophy and science becomes properly intelligible only when construed in this way [
         5]. He argues that this sketch of a revisionist history of philosophy could be the basis of a more coherent history than we have seen to date. So, building on the kind of account that we also see in Budd [3], Gare goes considerably further [5]; he contextualizes certain philosophical traditions from the viewpoint of today’s world and the conditions we now face, wherein a “whole of knowledge” approach is not only called for but also viable; he retrieves from current thinking a position that offers possibilities; and he suggests that we review the work of certain thinkers, such as Schelling, given these moves. Whereas Budd concludes that the categories central to LIS theory should be essence, being, interpretation, perception, self and other, and intentionality [3], Gare offers us a broader theory [11]. Calling for development of more adequate categories to define the nature of the cosmos, he argues that matter, space, time, and motion should be replaced by activity; order and potentiality; process, structure, and event; cause; and spatiotemporal position. From Gare we have a sense of the organically integrated, self‐sustaining whole that is human knowledge in motion, and beyond this we have nature as the force that shapes human endeavor [11].<br>

Abstract: In
         Bodies That Matter(1993), a book that begins, significantly, with an epigraph from Haraway’s “A Cyborg Manifesto” (1991), Butler begins to ponder the problems of the analogical model, although race is arguably still added to arguments about gender and sexuality. The bulk of the introduction theorizes the constructedness of “sex” and interrogates the critical assumption of a prior, unmarked category of sex onto which gender is culturally imposed. Instead of constructedness, Butler proposes the notion of matter, a process that “produce[s]the effect of boundary, fixity, and surface we call matter” (1993, 9). Sex and the contours of the body, Butler argues, are regulated by the heterosexual imperative. It is only much later in the introduction, after the theorizations of the body, sex, and matter have been made, that Butler introduces, as part of her chapter summaries, the idea that “normative heterosexuality is clearly not the only regulatory regime in the production of bodily contours” (1993, 17). Structurally, that is, body, sex, and matter are constituted as the main items of theory to which race is added. As Butler argues, race is not simply another domain separable from sexual difference, “but … its ‘addition’ subverts the monolithic workings of the heterosexual imperative as I have described it so far” (18). Although Butler is clearly aware of the problems of simply adding race to the understandings of the body and of sex, her own positioning of race in the introduction is nonetheless additive. Yet Butler goes on to suggest a focus on the specificities as well as intersections of race and gender construction: “It seems crucial to resist the model of power that would set up racism and homophobia and misogyny as parallel or analogical relations. The assertion of their abstract or structural equivalence not only misses the specific history of their construction and elaboration, but also delays the important work of thinking through the ways in which thes~<br>

Abstract: Yet, just as a bona fide recognition of others’ worth cannot be produced by a mere moral injunction to esteem difference, a genuine openness to being transformed by others cannot follow from a sheer demand to be open and vulnerable to their truth claims. In order to have a truly self‐transformative encounter with another, a provisional presumption of the other's worth and the accompanying open‐mindedness toward listening to the other are requisite. From a Christian theological perspective, this means that a Christian confessional standpoint that makes such a presumption, namely, some kind of working theology of religions that is favorably disposed to the value of other religious traditions, is necessary. Given that exclusivism refuses to recognize the value of other traditions as a matter of principle, such a working theology of religions would have to be some form of inclusivism or confessional pluralism whose unreserved confession of the uniqueness, centrality, and comprehensiveness of its own parochial way has at the same time a measure of a priori recognition of others built into it.

Abstract: Ultimately, Frei’s analysis leads to the conclusion that understanding the grammar of the text in terms of its historical linguistic context—in other words, with reference to the culture outside the text itself—divorces the meaning or subject matter of the text from the narrative cohesion of scripture, such that a practice that finds “meaning” in the ascriptive, figural resonances between passages fades from view. “Where hermeneutics and interpretation are governed by the conviction that the interpreter’s unique stance and process of understanding are face to face with that same motion within the discourse to be interpreted, and that this affinity alone (apart from the `linguistic stock’) is the ground for understanding what is being said, such ‘surface’ reading, finding character and society firmly related—a reading, moreover, which discovers the continuity of the narrative in its very contingency—must be viewed as superficial or worse.”
         39In the conclusion toEclipse, Frei suggests that if one divorces grammatical interpretation from its psychological cohort, it may serve as a more appropriate interpretive approach for recovering a narrative sense: “If they are not [united], it still does not necessarily follow that grammatical interpretation can do justice to the obviously narrative features of such realistic texts as the biblical stories. But it does follow that of these two it alone is a candidate, since it alone is concerned with verbal connections.”40<br>

Abstract: Stanley Fish (
            1996) has written about the philosophical dimensions of this conflict, implying that there is no common ground that could form the basis for either agreement or even shared discussion about that disagreement. “To put the matter baldly,” he writes, “a person of religious conviction should not want to enter the marketplace of ideas but to shut it down, at least insofar as it presumes to determine matters that he believes have been determined by God and faith. The religious person should not seek an accommodation with liberalism,” he continues, “he should seek to rout it from the field, to extirpate it, root and branch” (21).<br>

Abstract: Nevertheless, empiricism does not have the last word—it perhaps never has the last word, not even in what might be called “positivist empiricism,” and certainly not in practical theology, as this discipline is characterized by the interaction between empiricism and normativeness. We both share this conviction—the fifth characteristic. Therefore human rights—no matter how contested they are, which is neither surprising nor extraordinary—offer an important perspective, as the normative criteria they embody always require critical and constructive reflection. In the last part of the article I have even presented them as regulative principles of truth and justice, as a result of which they offer a kind of worldview‐related and morality‐related infrastructure for the social institutions that determine human actions in societal and personal life—the sixth characteristic. After all, for both Browning and me the ultimate issue is—the seventh characteristic—the vitality of the Christian tradition in terms of relevance and identity in the context of a multicivilization society.<br>

Abstract: Ibid. Here the interesting issue of the frequent change of urban and rural place names is being raised. Yet clearly the changing of names and the changing of landmarks, despite being seemingly identical, evoke different emotional responses, although both have had a long historical tradition in all societies. Somehow the changing of names is accepted, no matter whether triumphantly or grudgingly. So is the changing function of a landmark, as long as it is still preserved. In both cases, the signifier is changed, but the signified stays. However, the signified's complete erasure is strongly and passionately contested, probably because of its imposing materiality.<br>

Abstract: To the ear of a theological ethicist, however, this emphasis on children’s agency raises significant questions. The notion that agency defines what it means to be human has profound problems even when it comes to adults. Postmodern ethics of various kinds has shown that human life in society is fundamentally conditioned by a number of non‐agential factors. These include historical and cultural traditions, shared social narratives, systems of power, commitments to common goods, biological and evolutionary needs, intersubjective norms of dialogue and relationship, transcending sources of social meaning, and needs for receptivity and responsiveness toward persons and cultures that are other. Jürgen Habermas argues that since ethics confronts human life with a “pluralism of ultimate value orientations,” it must be grounded ultimately not in the expression of subjective agency but in procedures of larger “intersubjective discourse” that allow for mutual dialogue to arise and flourish between diverse points of view.
         38Ricoeur has criticized one‐sided ethics of agency as masking the mere utilitarian pursuit of self‐interest in which the powerless silently lose out.39More emphatically, Levinas has shown how the ethics of agency can be used to justify social violence (Levinas himself was a Jewish survivor of the Holocaust) in permitting those with the greatest social agency to “totalize” shared moral worlds. Ethics should begin, according to Levinas, in agency’s very opposite: the otherness of the other calling the self to “a passivity more passive still than the passivity of matter.”40<br>

Abstract: By the time of Thomas’s
         Summa Theologica, the distinction of poetics from ethics is fully taken for granted. In the brief sections he devotes to it, Thomas directly and explicitly follows Aristotle to argue that “art is the ‘right reason of things to be made’; whereas prudence [that is, phronesis] is the ‘right reason of things to be done.’ … Now ‘making’ and ‘doing’ differ … in that ‘making’ is an action passing into outward matter, e.g. ‘to build,’ ‘to saw,’ and so forth; whereas ‘doing’ is an action abiding in the agent, e.g. ‘to see,’ ‘to will,’ and the like.”9Again, since moral virtue is judged according to its internal habit or end, it is of an entirely different nature than art or creativity, whose goodness or worth is defined principally by the external form of its product.<br>

Abstract: Three general features of this method can be noted in advance. First, this method must be immanent or internal to its subject matter. Dialectical theorists reject outright the idea that the thinker can occupy some privileged Archimedean point outside the subject of investigation. … A second feature of dialectical method is its dialogical character. Theorizing is an activity taking place not simply within the mind but between minds. Thinking is dialogical because it always takes the form of an exchange or a conversation between ourselves, our contemporaries, and our predecessors. … Third, the dialogical element is related to the historical dimension of theory.

Abstract: Whether or not Smith completed the project has been a matter of debate among his followers. Compare Robert J. Matthews,
            “A Plainer Translation,” Joseph Smith’s Translation of the Bible: A History and Commentary(Provo, UT: Brigham Young University Press, 1985), 207–14; and Richard P. Howard,Restoration Scriptures: A Study of Their Textual Development(Independence, MO: Herald Publishing House, 1995), 130–31. For a summary of the problem and its contemporary resolution, see Robert L. Millet, “Joseph Smith’s Translation of the Bible: A Historical Overview,” inThe Joseph Smith Translation: A Restoration of Plain and Precious Things, ed. M. S. Nyman and R. L. Millet (Provo, UT: Brigham Young University Religious Studies Center, 1985), 22–49. Generally speaking, however, it is doubtful that Smith considered any of his works finished in the sense that he did not feel free to revisit them at a later date, including after publication. Smith explicitly rejected the notion of inerrancy. See, e.g., Book of Mormon, title page ( “And now, if there are faults they are the mistakes of men; wherefore, condemn not the things of God.”).<br>

Abstract: “I chose this story above all others because it’s a story I’m struggling to end. … That’s why I write fiction—so that I can keep telling the story. … Always a new beginning, a different end,” Winterson writes toward the close of her narrative (
         2005, 137). Linking the desire for retelling with the inability to formulate a conclusion and the necessity for an open ending, Winterson has Atlas walk away, yet presents this “very particular end not found elsewhere” (xiv) as but one possibility among several, the choice of which is ultimately left to the individual reader’s personal preference: “no one knows its composition,” Winterson observes. “Dark matter could be conventional matter, … or it could even be black holes. Or it could be Atlas holding up the universe. But I think it is Atlas and Laïka walking away” (2005, 151).Weight’s multiperspectival ending underscores its status as inaugural retelling of myth for a twenty‐first century that can only assimilate more pasts into its ever broadening present. In this sense, the Myths seems typical for the contemporary take on re‐vision. Whereas the names of the authors hold the promise of retellings with a critical edge—Achebe having given usThings Fall Apartas a reply to and a thorough undermining of Joseph Conrad’sHeart of Darkness(see Moyers1989; Achebe1990), and neither Atwood nor Winterson is a stranger to rewriting as cultural critique—Winterson’s phrase and its appropriation by the series’ editor make us suspect differently. “We want to tell the story again,” as the series’ editor Jamie Byng puts it on Canongate’s Web site, speaks of the storyteller’s desire for and delight in language; of the pleasure of telling stories, of keeping the stories alive by retelling them. Inevitably also meaning “we want tosellthe story again,” retelling becomes a retailing strategy, promising ever new and improved reading experiences that are as ephemeral as any other consumer experience.

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Abstract: So I return to that invented novel one last time, anomalous though it is, as an exemplar of more familiar novelistic tendencies in order to make clear the methodological implications its concoction does
         notentail. Narratography per se has nothing to do with the conjuration of wholesale counternovels. Albeit an assiduous close reader of fiction, that Oxford don is no practitioner of narratography—or at least not in anything we've heard from him here. He is a virtual biographer, in other words a fiction writer. The contrapuntal tale of the lost mother takes to an extreme dilation the fleeting thoughts anyone might have in learning of her so suddenly, and then learning no more, and then being denied even the closural satisfaction of watching the hero find out the stunning truth, even if it only transpired for the reader in a second or two of reflective recoil from the headlong settlements of the plot. But the work of narratography (a matter always of diction, syntax, punctuation, figuration) comes later—most intensely when the very wordmother's(possessive in every sense) is seen to assimilate the male hero to its lexical confines across the prose cadence, and ghostly grammatical antecedence, of plot's immediate marital aftermath.<br>

Abstract: In similar circumstances, as we just saw, Augustine accepts as a fact of life the mutual incoherence, brought about by death, between his and Monnica’s souls and awaits submissively the reunion that will follow his own death, when both he and Monnica will be endowed of the same body of divine love. Marcel, on the contrary, strives to reconnect right away, in the here‐and‐now, his soul with that of his grandmother. It is an urgent matter, for him; in spite of the physical absence imposed on his grandmother by death, he believes he can reactualize the cohesion of their two souls and renew thereby his past identification with his grandmother.<br>

Abstract: Viewed in these Augustinian terms, just‐war morality invites one to ask what a war means—how we interpret ourselves and others regarding matters of life and death. Death raises fundamental questions regarding horizons of meaning and desire, and war asks in the starkest terms whether its participants are willing to impose or take on the ultimate sacrifice. In this respect we continue to travel with Augustine despite our distance from him. For surely he would have us ask whether we possess a second‐order framework for determining whether the desires aroused by killing, death, and sacrifice are themselves desirable. That is to say, Augustine would have us ask about the effects of killing on individual and corporate character and how death affects the practices of self‐interpretation and the public history we wish to write about ourselves. War for Augustine was not only a matter of personal virtue and vice; it also raised questions of meaning and memory as these bear upon the formation of civic identity and the construction of desire across generations.<br>

Abstract: We live in a time when it seems that many disciplines within the university are unsure of their task and purpose. Some scholars bemoan the listlessness of the humanities and religious studies. There are the relentless attacks, sometimes warranted and sometimes not, on things modern and Western. Of course, the question of what defines the university and its several disciplines is itself constitutive of the university and its disciplines. Yet the purpose of answering that question, and so clarifying the nature and connection of forms of knowledge, is not always transparent in our time, especially in the humanities and religious studies. Unconcerned with squabbles among humanists and scholars of religion, the natural sciences, like neuroscience and genetics, and the social sciences, especially economics, daily make inroads into domains of thought previously defined as the
         Geisteswissenschaften. In this context I have proposed a reconstruction of my own discipline in order to demonstrate its place within and contribution to the wider work and purposes of the university. This proposal might have implications for other fields of study. That is a question for thinkers in the various disciplines to debate. Yet beyond the matter of how we constitute and conceive of disciplines of inquiry, I have been driving at something else in this lecture.<br>

Abstract: The film object exists differently, or not at all, when kidnapped by consumers and sequestered on their computer desktops. Not only do individuals watch films on PCs at their leisure (stopping and starting at will, sampling chapters, and so on), they watch them on one window among several that may be running simultaneously (including those that hold email messages, the IMDb entry on the film, notes, a blog, and the current weather). Cinema constitutes just one kind of software content available to the powerful Windows operating system and the all‐encompassing PC hardware. Called up on demand or via YouTube, a movie appears on a flat panel, where many windows are displayed—as many as the user chooses, then shuffles, moving them around like cards in a game of solitaire.
         Monitoranddisplayseem more apt terms thanscreento designate the visual experience that computers deliver. The computer monitor of the twenty‐first century, just like thecinématographeof the nineteenth, presents the viewer with the present, with immediate attractions, no matter what is on display. Cinema, which ruled the twentieth century, pulls the viewer into another world and an encounter with something that has passed and is just out of reach.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 603531<br>
Date: 10 2009<br>
Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: It is on this basis that Coleridge affirms special providence, but not in the sense of God’s being swayed to allow us to have certain things, “this or that particular petition … any single detached event or incident.” Instead, God’s effect is defined against “the
         whole Chainof the Events, Incidents, internal processes & changes, & external providences, of our Life” (N6474, fol. 9v)—that is, our whole being, the ultimate determination and horizon of which is God’s relation to it. This is why Coleridge claims on more than one occasion that the answer to the efficacy of prayer lies with the intuition ofdeitas diffusa, “the Godhead as present in and thro’ all things” (N5411, fol. 45).24God is with us, for Coleridge, “present to our inmost Being”; it is simply a matter of letting him make his claim on us, as Coleridge affirms in marginalia to the Book of Common Prayer: “As God, he must bepresent entireineverycreature; but he is said todwellin the regenerate; tocometo them who receive him by Faith in hisname.”25Once the presence and claim of God is acknowledged, the effect follows: “Prayer is a gift … that must be received in order to come into being.”26Human prayer is always answered because our acts of prayer are in themselves acts of opening us up to receive, from God, our most authentic identities and meanings, authenticity that glimmers to us from the wounded root of our being: “O grant me the aid of thy Spirit, that I may with a deeper faith, a more enkindled Love bless thee, who thro’ thy Son has privileged me to call thee Abba Father!”27<br>

Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: In addition,
         Judaism and Enlightenmentalso breaks considerable new ground when dealing with the role of the Kabbalah in the formation of radical philosophy. Sutcliffe describes Jewish mysticism, with its analogs in the Gnostic and Neoplatonic traditions, not only as “the universal core buried within the historical particularism of Judaism” but also as a “mysticalprisca theologica” that straddled the divide between “Renaissance esotericism” and the “practical universalism of the Enlightenment.” Given these multiple uses, it is not entirely surprising that interest in the Kabbalah deepened during the seventeenth century alongside early Enlightenment attempts to articulate the bases for a natural religion. For example, the theologian Georg Wachter, despite an early aversion to the tradition, later embraced its denial of the distinctions between God and world. Wachter went so far as to identify this position with that of Spinoza—even though the latter had denounced the Jewish mysticism in hisTractatus Politicus(1677). Both the Kabbalah and Spinozist philosophy aimed at “a mystical spiritualisation of matter” under the aegis of pantheistic monism (Sutcliffe, 148–64, quotes on 148, 153–54, 158). Another contemporary commentator, Thomas Burnet, described the creation narrative of the Kabbalah in similar terms. Not unlike Stoics and Neoplatonists, he observed, Jewish mystics “explain the Rise of all Things by Emanations from the first Cause” and describe an eventual “Restoration to their primitive State,” which occurs “when all Things again become God.”36<br>

Abstract: Tillich sought to take up the challenge of constructing a theology that mediated between theology itself and human culture, broadly construed. In this essay (Paul Tillich, “Uber die Idee einer Theologie der Kultur,” in
            Writings in Philosophy of Culture, ed. Michael Palmer, Main Works/Hauptwerke [Berlin: de Gruyter, 1990], 2:69–88), Tillich outlined much of his subsequent task, no matter its lapidary formulations and his shifting use of these concepts, especially as demonstrated by John Powell Clayton (The Concept of Correlation, 191–221). Here one may read his proposal for thinking of the relationship between religion and culture asGestaltandGehalt. These two metaphors have either together or singly been the axle and motor of correlation in theology; less so has his writing on critique and prophetic theology. Pursuing these underdeveloped metaphors can aid the reconstruction of a theology of correlation in its various domains, as I have outlined here, at least for political theology.<br>

Abstract: For Bonaventure, following Augustinian prompts, Francis's life was like a return to the
         hortus deliciarumbefore humankind's lapse and separation from nature. In Francis's model relationship to God and nature, according to Bonaventure, God's creatures are brothers and sisters: “When he [Francis] considered the primordial source of all things, he was filled with even more abundant piety, calling creatures no matter how small by the name of brother and sister because he knew they had the same source as himself.”45This position is radically different from the dichotomized man-animal opposition upheld in the philosophical tradition and that has, as Agamben argues, anthropomorphized animals and animalized man.46Because it is rooted in “affective and aesthetic experience,” this Franciscan-inspired theology is never purely intellectual, for it expresses the “sense of union with the being and life of Nature.”47<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 656725<br>
Date: 01 01, 2011<br>
Author(s): Pranger Burcht<br>
Abstract: If that is indeed the case, it is our historical duty to realize that the rhetoric of
      Confessionscomprises both sound and silence to the effect that the fullness of voice can sound in such a way that it is possible to say about Augustine—and his reader—that he “did not hear [its] silence.” Is that perhaps the essence of the fact that what Augustine is looking for cannot but be a momentary gift and that the rhetoric of this search in all its loudness comes down to shaping the fact that it cannot be ascertained, beyond the “speech act” ofconfessioitself, whether that which is given sounds or not? Saying this, we do not find ourselves in the realm of mystical silence. We are, rather, faced with the demands of rhetorical precision. For to establish the magic of a language of desire that is given—a language with the power of Kafka's hammer of the facts of life in the shape of the song of the Sirens—confessiohas to be framed and shaped, dramatized and theatricalized. Consequently, the possibility has to be taken into account that the phrase “Ulysses did not hear the silence of the Sirens” is not the final word about the matter, just as the dialectic of speech and silence cannot be taken to function as an automatism.<br>

Author(s): Thistleton Anthony C.<br>
Abstract: Due to the encyclopedic character of the work and the extensive range it covers, however, certain significant thinkers are often treated too quickly, whereas other, more marginal thinkers are treated too closely. This is particularly the case in his treatment of hermeneutics in the “pre-modern” period. For example, in chapter 6, entitled “From the Third Century to the Thirteenth Centuries,” he covers no fewer than twenty-four thinkers. At times, one feels flooded and inundated with a litany of references and historical facts, and it is easy to get confused as to the overall trajectory and purpose of the chapter and how it contributes to the formation and development of hermeneutics. The work would have been better served if it was more balanced and had devoted the same kind of sustained attention and precision to important “pre-modern” thinkers that it devoted to many key figures in modern and contemporary hermeneutics. In the same vein, in the rush to cover the history of hermeneutics, chapters are often oddly divided. For instance, the reader may be surprised to find the thought of Karl Barth lumped in together with structuralism and poststructuralism in a chapter loosely titled, “Some Mid-Twentieth Century Approaches.” It remains unclear as to why such disparate figures and strands of thought are gathered together into a single chapter, and it thus lacks the tightness and coherence of argument that it otherwise could have. If certain sections may glide over thinkers too quickly and other sections pay attention too closely, there are, despite the encyclopedic range of this book, certain gaps altogether in the history of hermeneutics that Thistleton offers. Thistleton himself concedes in his conclusion, for example, that there is insufficient attention paid particularly to Catholic biblical scholarship, which clearly indicates a way of introducing hermeneutics from a distinctly Protestant perspective. Any work that seeks to introduce a subject matter necessarily ma~<br>

Author(s): Landy Joshua<br>
Abstract: Is this a little narcissistic?
         19Yes, but the beauty of it is that narcissism is the only strategy appropriate to the context. To be sure, Kaufman's movie is really a movie about Kaufman, not Orlean; but then, Orlean's book was really a book about Orlean, not Laroche.The Orchid Thiefis not about flowers, or Laroche, or even orchid hunting more generally; it is, instead, about the ability, so yearned for by Orlean, “to care about something passionately.”20So, too, Charlie projects his own frustrated desire—in his case, for reciprocated attraction, for release from the prison of solipsism—onto the subject matter. (Immediately after an imagined Susan advises him to “find that one thing that you care passionately about and then write about that,” the film cuts to Charlie saying into his voice recorder “we see Susan Orlean, delicate, haunted by loneliness, fragile, beautiful.”)21And so, too,Kaufmanprojects onto ithisown desire, this time for a Hollywood film that would just be about flowers. In short, paradoxically, Kaufman captures the spirit ofThe Orchid Thiefprecisely by being unfaithful to it.<br>

Article Title: Why Devils Came When Faustus Called Them<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 660269<br>
Date: 08 2011<br>
Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: But Faustus feels little need to read allegorically, to seek the signification that transcends direct presentation, for he never imagines spirit or even presence as anywhere but in signs themselves. Despite striking moments of doubt and panic in which he senses he is deceived, he consistently reads with the belief that spirit is entirely immanent in the letter. That is why he so loves the signs of magic: the lines, circles, schemes, and characters that apparently perform “the metaphysics of magicians” (1.1.51) by seeming to enact visibly, palpably, and presently that letter and spirit, and matter and soul, are one.
      28The fantasy that objects have spiritual efficacy provides his consolation. Indeed, Faustus seems even more invested in the spiritual power of the materiality of the sign than is the devil himself: when at one point Lucifer warns Faustus to “not think of God” (2.3.92), Faustus responds by vowing “never to look to heaven, / Never to name God” (2.3.95–96), as if naming God or performing acts that mark or deal in “the outside” of things were equivalent to thinking about God—as if naming and thinking were phenomenologically identical or produced the same results. For Faustus, naming suffices: for him spirit inheres in surfaces, and being therefore exists only in embodied form. And Faustus manifests this principle both in his epistemology and in his very sense of subjectivity itself. When Faustus reflects on his achievements in medicine—his having helped “whole cities” (1.1.21) to escape plague—he decides that such successes are worthless, and that only by being able to “make men…live eternally, / Or, being dead, raise them to life again” (1.1.24–25) were the medical profession “to be esteemed” (1.1.26). Faustus is not abandoning medicine here in order to take up divinity, as if he thought that the prolongation of earthly life were less vital than the pastoral care of immortal souls. Rather, Faustus is revealing that he conceives of eternal life itself ~<br>

Author(s): Regan Ethna<br>
Abstract: Regan’s chief impetus for writing the book is the assumption that rights talk is anathema to theology. She addresses this assumption from several distinct perspectives: via definition, description, theological construction, and critical analysis. As a matter of defining human rights, Regan aims to show that one of the bases for the perceived opposition between theology and human rights lies in an overly narrow conception of the nature and scope of human rights discourse. Given her experiences working with street children in Trinidad, Regan rejects the view that human rights discourse merely defines human beings as atomistic, autonomous rights-bearers with few ethical imperatives. To correct the perception that human rights and theology are mutual antagonists, she articulates a definition of human rights as a “dialectical boundary discourse,” by which she means that human rights ought to be understood as a rich discourse that operates within a specified sphere. As a discourse, human rights consist in more than the lowest limits of ethical conduct. They express an intrinsic conviction that humans ought to flourish and that certain conditions can destroy, distort, or thwart the potential for human flourishing. Human rights discourse does not itself define human flourishing or delineate the conditions of human flourishing, but rather adopts a
      via negativa, drawing on examples from human experience to articulate conditions that prevent, disrupt, or damage capacities to flourish. In this way, human rights discourse adopts a role that Regan describes as “protective marginality,” not serving as ends in themselves but located at the margins of ethics, carving out a space within which ethical life may be possible, leaving the task of fuller development of ethics within this sphere to other discourses. By defining human rights as a dialectical boundary discourse of protective marginality, Regan shows that there is no necessary conflict between theological ethics and theo~<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 671448<br>
Date: 10 01, 2013<br>
Author(s): Feder Yitzhaq<br>
Abstract: Let us begin with an anthropological account of pollution which encapsulates many of the emphases of embodiment theory. In an important critique of Douglas’ theory based on field work in Papua New Guinea, A. S. Meigs points out that not every disordered phenomenon is considered defiling. Whereas a toy boat on the kitchen table may be “messy,” it is not considered defiling like shoes on the kitchen table. The reason for this discrepancy, Meigs suggests, is that shoes are potential carriers of substances such as feces, urine and saliva from the street. More generally, she relates notions of defilement to a visceral sense of disgust for decay and waste matter, particularly when these threaten to access another person’s body, such as through eating or sexual relations.
            
                  For our purposes, the important point is the difference between Meigs’s emotional/intuitive account of defilement and that of Douglas and others who relate the notion to category violations or ambivalent states. Unlike the abstract explanations of pollution which invoke goals foreign to the motives of the actors, Meigs’s account is consistent with their conscious concerns.24

Abstract: In his erudite and wide-ranging article, “Morality as a Cultural System?” Csordas explores the anthropology of morality by focusing on the anthropology of evil. His analysis combines emic and etic perspectives, and it extends to the morality of anthropological theory and practice. Avoiding (what he sees as reductive) Durkheimian functionalism and pragmatic neo-Marxist activism, he argues that morality does not form a cultural system. Nor, for that matter, do cultures—including those of academic anthropology—themselves form closed and static systems (Rorty
            1994).<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>

Author(s): Urbaniak Jakub<br>
Abstract: That should remind us of the two religious dimensions that Bonhoeffer aimed to overcome for the sake of a worldly faith, namely other-worldliness (metaphysics) and inwardness (individualism). By making us servants of the “heavenly God,” who does not have the human face of Jesus, religion almost automatically establishes the sphere of the sacred and that of the profane, and in so doing makes us see ourselves as privileged or pure. In such a divided reality, those who do not confess our God sooner or later become our enemies. While narrowly comprehended, religious affiliation generates the distinctions that divide us into hostile camps, the Christ of the nonreligious faith “wants us to be in the midst of our enemies, just as she was.”
         
               The religion that Bonhoeffer seeks to deconstruct is the “habit of heart that allows us to approach the world without love, even while declaring that we are doing just the opposite.”160
            
               In this sense, Bonhoeffer’s holistic approach to life and his Christological radicalism can preclude the church from falling into totalitarianism, on the one hand, and becoming sectarian and xenophobic, on the other. Individualism also constitutes a constant threat to faith, yet in a different way: striving for my own salvation simply goes against the Christian ideal of participation in Jesus’s being for others and consequent solidarity with the world’s sufferings. Besides, the egocentric focus on one’s own salvation that compromises the common good can be easily manipulated into serving diverse political agendas. Indeed, when one’s salvation becomes a matter of saving one’s own culture, society, country or community, it shows that religion degenerates into what Bonhoeffer calls “pagan wisdom.”161

Abstract: Murray Jardine continues this theme of “foundations without foundationalism” in his essay “Sight, Sound, and Participatory Symbolization,” which compares the communications of print and speech in the context of Voegelin's and Poteat's philosophies. According to Jardine, literate cultures tend to promote thinking of symbols as visual phenomena, which results in neglecting the initial experiential content behind them. Voegelin's conception of consciousness as participatory and his emphasis on experience asks us to return to an oral culture in which reality is conceived of in a personal context; what this context consists of, however, especially with respect to Christianity, is a source of disagreement for Voegelin and Poteat. For Jardine, Voegelin misconceptualized Christian revelation in terms of nature instead of human creativity, leading to a dogmatization of own symbolization of the Christian experience (83). This misconception of Christianity stems from Voegelin's belief that Christian revelation has been “a closed matter” since the time of Augustine.<br>

Abstract: The very centrality of its questions to literary studies may be the greatest handicap for
   Translating Investments.Words That Matter, especially in its recovery of grammatical theory, had more surprises page-for-page. Here the big ideas are perforce more familiar, the innovations more incremental. The reward, however, is a fine sense of metaphor as a cultural project across an especially broad range of terrain in early modern England. Anderson insists, and teaches us to insist, on the local, historical conditions of metaphor’s torpor and vitality, how writers thought about and went about killing and quickening the trope she calls “the scaffolding of human culture” (216).<br>

Abstract: Although the clarity with which Wu writes makes this book accessible to nonspecialists, he evidently assumes the reader is familiar with China and the subject of tombs. For example, no maps are included, despite frequent mentions made of specific provinces and cities. Additionally, no matter how obscure or technical the terms, he provides Chinese characters in only one instance (128). The reliance on pinyin romanization may make it somewhat frustrating for specialists encountering these terms for the first time to understand them or even to look them up in a dictionary. Oddly, several line drawings and diagrams only employ Chinese characters; it would have been helpful for Wu to translate these. However, these minor shortcomings do not overshadow the overall importance of this book. On account of its remarkably original theoretical approach,
   The Art of the Yellow Springsis essential reading material for anyone interested in a new interpretation of Chinese tombs.<br>

Abstract: At a time when immanent abandonment of plural marriage was sorely testing the faithful's confidence, rituals commemorating Joseph Smith's birth established three aspects of his legacy as the core of L.D.S self-conception: restored church order, divine authority, and continuing revelation. These three claims, inscribed on the Vermont monument, were given particular force by the church's new Progressive-Era uses of the autobiographical narrative of Joseph Smith's early life. Specifically, during this period the narrative of Smith's original theophany achieved the primacy once accorded plural marriage, allowing the Latter-day Saints to forget as a practical matter, the once-definitive marriage practice. This essay uses theories of narrative and myths of origin to show how uses of Smith's theophany allowed the Latter-day Saints to jettison plural marriage without destroying their identity, much less their confidence in Joseph Smith as church founder.<br>

Abstract: This article analyses a recently completed research project, to answer the question, on what were the findings based? It draws on the hermeneutics of Gadamer to explore the relationship between researcher and research subject in qualitative educational research. It argues that all qualitative research findings are simultaneously subjective and objective, being essentially constructed interpretations of data which are partly, but only partly, external to the researcher. Yet many contemporary educational researchers tend to focus almost exclusively on either the subject matter under investigation or upon the standpoint of the researcher him/herself. A simultaneous combination of both is necessary to understand the nature of research findings.<br>

Abstract: Recent challenges to traditional approaches and purposes for studying the history of political theory have raised questions about its constitution as both a subject matter and subfield of political science. Methodological arguments advocating what is characterized as a more truly historical mode of inquiry for understanding political ideas and recovering textual meaning have become increasingly popular. The relationship of these hermeneutical claims about historicity, such as that advanced by Quentin Skinner, to the actual practice of interpretation is problematical. Such claims are more a defense of a certain norm of historical investigation than a method of interpretation, and the implications of this norm for the reconstitution of the history of political theory require careful consideration.<br>

Author(s): Widmaier Wesley W.<br>
Abstract: Over the past two decades, monetary crises have played a key role in spurring increased monetary cooperation. From one, materialist, vantage, such crises appear as exogenous shocks, which matter primarily as they alter the material incentives to cooperation. However, such frameworks obscure the importance of debates over the meaning of crises, monetary understandings, and state interests themselves. I therefore offer a constructivist theory of crises, and trace the post-1980s evolution from New Classical interpretations of crises, which stressed domestic policy errors and obscured interests in cooperation, to subsequent New Keynesian interpretations, which have stressed market instabilities and legitimated greater cooperation.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i211059<br>
Date: 11 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Kane Anne E.<br>
Abstract: Though the process of meaning construction is widely recognized to be a crucial factor in the mobilization, unfolding, and outcomes of social movements, the conditions and mechanisms that allow meaning construction and cultural transformation are often misconceptualized and/or underanalyzed. Following a "tool kit" perspective on culture, dominant social movement theory locates meaning only as it is embodied in concrete social practices. Meaning construction from this perspective is a matter of manipulating static symbols and meaning to achieve goals. I argue instead that meaning is located in the structure of culture, and that the condition and mechanism of meaning construction and transformation are, respectively, the metaphoric nature of symbolic systems, and individual and collective interpretation of those systems in the face of concrete events. This theory is demonstrated by analyzing, through textual analysis, meaning construction during the Irish Land War, 1879-1882, showing how diverse social groups constructed new and emergent symbolic meanings and how transformed collective understandings contributed to specific, yet unpredictable, political action and movement outcomes. The theoretical model and empirical case demonstrates that social movement analysis must examine the metaphoric logic of symbolic systems and the interpretive process by which people construct meaning in order to fully explain the role of culture in social movements, the agency of movement participants, and the contingency of the course and outcomes of social movements.<br>

Abstract: No one owns the concept 'culture' Anthropology's long-standing proprietary claim on the concept rests on three sorts of contentions — none of which are convincing Anthropology's overwhelmingly interpretive approaches to cultural materials have led to a preoccupation with the details of cultural materials at the expense of formulating explanatory theories This has, among other things, rendered fieldwork experience sufficient for professional credentials However, if the details are all that matter, then comparative and cross-cultural research, as well as most of the social sciences, make no sense Contrary to this view, it is proposed here that theories reveal which details matter Cognitive accounts of the sort we advanced in Rethinking Religion (1990) offer a firm theoretical basis for cross-cultural study of religious materials Other types of research concerning non-human primates, early childhood development, and various social and cognitive impairments also offer insight into culture (without relying on fieldwork studies)<br>

Abstract: The aim is to show how formations of discourse can be seen as the subject matter for the historian of religions, drawing on structuralist and hermeneutic approaches. Although these may differ on important theoretical and methodological issues, I find the way in which they correspond, namely by pointing to the topic of discourse as their field of investigation, even more important. In this article a discourse is understood as a framework of communication, and the focus is laid upon religious discourse as a special kind of authorization. In ancient Greece, for example, "authors" such as Homer and Orpheus were the authorities of two different discursive traditions. The analysis of discourse can present us with a view of how certain frames of communication were interacting by means of contest, and how, eventually, it was the very strategy of authorization that was contested. Hence, what has often been seen as a paradigmatic shift from mythos to logos could more fruitfully be viewed from a discursive angle than from a perspective of different mentalities. Discourse analysis, as presented in this article, is a way of coming to terms with the process of transformation by regarding dynamic properties of communication, that is, as interrelated strategies on connected levels of system and event.<br>

Abstract: The relationship between Sören Kierkegaard and Johann Gottlieb Fichte has been a desideratum of philosophical inquiry for a considerable time. And this for two reasons: firstly, we do not know enough about Kierkegaard's relationship to German idealism, as long as we limit ourselves to the relationship of Kierkegaard-Hegel or Kierkegaard-Schelling. Secondly, there are quite a number of publications, which see in Fichte the most noteworthly intellectual relationship to Kierkegaard within the framework of idealism. It is necessary therefore to raise the following questions: what can we determine from the texts and historical material, which we possess, about Kierkegaard's relationship to Fichte? Is the opinion justified that Fichte is intellectually related to Kierkegaard? The present article's research gives the following answers to these questions: historically speaking there are again and again texts in which Kierkegaard relates to Fichte. Particulary for the early years, a certain occupation with him cannot be denied. As a matter of fact a whole series of formal agreements cannot be overlooked. Nevertheless there can be no question of a real meeting of minds. Fichte was merely an occasion for Kierkegaard to form his own philosophy, in no way however an intellectual partner. This historical result in no way excludes the possibility of comparing Kierkegaard and Fichte on the same intellectual level. Seen from this point of view there is actually a certain reason in establishing an intellectual relationship in the secondary literature. But nevertheless the differences outweigh the agreements. This can not only be ascertained fundamentally insofar as both come from a completely different understanding of reality, but also as regards their concept of subjectivity. Especially, as far as the structures, which ascertain the self-realization of the subjectivity, are concerned, the differences are particulary noticeable. With this result one does not however intend to say, t~<br>

Author(s): Schmitz Heinz-Gerd<br>
Abstract: Discussing some aspects of Carl Schmitt's, Chantal Mouffe's, Paul Ricœur's, and Jacques Rancière's political theories the paper tries to determine the proper subject of political and social philosophy. To that end the author constructs two terminological oppositions: ‚the social‘ versus 'the society', 'the political' versus 'politics'. These four nouns form a terminological square which marks the social and the political difference. The social appears when underprivileged people demand a redistribution of wealth and influence, i.e. a reconstruction of a given society. The political emerges when the hidden normative framework of politics comes into vie. Confronting the social and the political difference in this way makes it possible to determine: politics are the matter of the political sciences, the difference between politics and the political, conversely, is the theme of political philosophy; society is the subject of sociology, the difference between the social and any form of society, however, is the issue of social philosophy.<br>

Author(s): Sabete Wagdi<br>
Abstract: This article aims at explaining, on the one hand, the inadequacy of the formalist positivist method in answering the essential questions of constitutional Law, such as the validity of the constitutional norm, the sovereignty of the people which comes before the original constitutional act and the effects of a theory of values on the limitation of the revision power. On the other hand, it proposes an onto-axiological approach, which refers to the Philosophy of Law. A relevant methodology of constitutional science of Liberty helps the specialists to follow the progress of knowledge. It puts forward means for approaching the subject matter of science (the norm), the constitutional environment and the theoretical basis of the norm. Following this proposed method would help not only in describing the norms but also in checking their validity, their justification and their imperfection when compared with their aims. These thought processes are a never ending search, that is to say a characteristic of science itself.<br>

Abstract: Será possível colocar a questão da culpa à parte de determinantes morais e históricos? Heidegger parece pensar que sim e, em verdade, empreende esta tarefa com base na reflexão sobre o papel do chamamento, um tema que, como a culpa, também está rodeado por inevitáveis conotações religiosas. O seu propósito inicial, mesmo que não declarado explicitamente, é mostrar a viabilidade de uma análise do chamamento, sem fazer uma apologia de qualquer tradição. Por seu lado, Foucault mostrou-nos os problemas associados com uma separação histórico-social do tema da culpa. Neste artigo pretendo expor estas duas abordagens sobre a questão da culpa. Is it possible to raise the question of guilt apart from those moral and historical determinants? Heidegger seems to think so and actually undertakes this task based on the reflection on the role of the call, a matter that, like guilt, is also surrounded by unavoidable religious cannotations. Its initial purpose, but does not state explicitly, is to show that it is feasible consistent and deep analysis of the call without making at any time through you an apology for any religious tradition. For his part, Foucault has shown us the problems associated with socio-historical untethering of the issue of guilt. In this paper I intend to expose these two lines of approach to the question of guilt.<br>

Author(s): Picone Michelangelo<br>
Abstract: The problem that Petrarch's Canzoniere poses for the modern reader is the same as that posed by all collections of poems assembled by their author: it is a matter of understanding the connection between each of the poems and the collection, the relation between the whole and the parts. On the one hand, the collection presents a discontinuous series of poems composed separately that can be read as discrete works; on the other hand, the same poems come together as part of a love and/or existential story. Our task is to study the Canzoniere as a macrotext and to clarify the relation of each of the compositions to the collection of lyric verse to which it belongs. Petrarch's desperate attempt to complete his work is the same hopeless challenge that the mythical Arachne dared to make to Minerva. At the deepest level Petrarch reveals an awareness of the fact that every human endeavor is a spider's web that is woven in the course of a lifetime, and thus is never completed. The destiny of human beings therefore is to weave a tapestry that is never finished, just as the fate of the poet is to write an in-finite work; namely, a work that in the end can never reach the perfection and integrity of the divine work.<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24049943<br>
Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Bell Allan<br>
Abstract: This article questions the aptness of 'discourse analysis' as a label for our field, and prefers the less reductionist concept of 'Discourse Interpretation'. It does this through drawing on ideas from the field of philosophical hermeneutics – the theory and practice of interpreting texts. It operationalizes and adapts the construct of the Interpretive Arc from the philosophy of Paul Ricoeur in order to address issues that are central to discourse work, including that of how we warrant the validity of our textual interpretations. The Interpretive Arc consists of six interlinked phases, which the article presents and exemplifies through discussion of a single text – the story of Babel. Phase I of the arc defines readers as being in a state of Estrangement before the text because of the distancing created by its written or technological form. Phase 2 is that of Pre-view, the state of opinion or knowledge that readers bring to a text. At phase 3, a first reading forms readers' Proto-understanding, their initial 'guess' at what the text means. Then processes of Analysis (phase 4) test and evidence the validity of alternative readings, limiting the interpretations which can plausibly be taken from a text. Three byways of interpretive analysis are challenged and discarded: the dominance of author intention, structuralist analysis and limitless polysemy. Analysis then leads into 5, the phase of informed Understanding of the matter or injunction of the text, of what is disclosed or unfolded before the text. The Interpretive Arc is completed in phase 6, Ownership. Here, through processes of critique of their own and the text's ideologies and of fresh listening, readers are led to a new self formed by the matter of the text. There is a dialectic amongst Analysis, Understanding and Ownership, with each informing and modifying the other. The approach emphasizes interpretation as the heart of discourse work. The 3000-year-old narrative of Babel is a subject as well as an object h~<br>

Author(s): Bell Allan<br>
Abstract: The nine responses to my focus article 'Re-constructing Babel: Discourse analysis, hermeneutics and the Interpretive Arc' are cross-disciplinary, as is the article itself. They come from discourse studies (Van Dijk, Billig, Wodak), cognitive science (Tepe, Yeari and Van den Broek, Van Dijk), Old Testament studies (Billig), hermeneutics (Pellauer, Scott-Baumann), history (Gardner) and literature (Pratt). I identify and address five main issues which I see these responses raising for discourse interpretation: the role of author intent and the original sociocultural context in interpretation; principles of translation, particularly in relation to the Babel story; issues of certainty and subjectivism in interpretation, again including the Babel story; the role and limitations of cognitive approaches, and the potential of images like 'unfolding the matter of the text' to be realized in teaching hands-on discourse work; and finally a call to new listening in the encounter with hermeneutics, as a route to freshening the field I like to call Discourse Interpretation.<br>

Abstract: This paper explores trivial or minor issues of body parts and relics and the major matter of evil. These incongruities offer a means of reflecting on the relationships between sociology and theology as re-set by the advent of postsecularity and the fears of Benedict XVI concerning the dictatorship of relativism. Efforts to resolve these incongruities draw attention to metaphors and the limits of sociological rhetoric in handling matters pertaining to theology. A means of overcoming these dilemmas is to be found in the musical explorations of Weber who offers a way of coming to terms with the irruptive spectres of postsecularity.<br>

Abstract: This article examines the relativistic view according to which the interpretation of texts is a matter of opinion and one interpretation is as good as any other. It clarifies the question by establishing precise understandings of texts and interpretations and by introducing various distinctions between different kinds of interpretations based on their function. It argues that not all kinds of interpretations are relativistic, although all interpretations are relative, and that even those interpretations that are relativistic are not so in the same ways.<br>

Abstract: This study is based on 150 interviews carried out in three countries among individuals of working class origin who have experienced very rapid social advancement. My approach consists of three stages. First, I establish a typology of the many forms taken by attempts to rehabilitate their working class origins among those interviewed. Second, I draw upon this typology to open up avenues for reflecting on what makes it possible to present working class origins as a resource. In this respect, it would seem that the narrative skill with which this experience is recounted – a matter of genuine social competence – constitutes a decisive factor. The conception of working class origins as a resource is above all permitted by a process of mystification which seeks to obscure the fact that this value is the product of an effort of self-narration. Third, I take a comparative approach to show that such individual strategies of narration remain extremely contingent on the cultural specificities of the countries in which they take place.<br>

Publisher: Brill<br>

Author(s): Dostal Robert J.<br>
Abstract: Against the background of Gadamer's hermeneutics of trust, for which the primary concern of the hermeneutical enterprise is the matter under discussion, the Sache, this essay raises the question of Gadamer's treatment of irony. Gadamer and Gadamerians have criticized the hermeneutics of suspicion—a hermeneutics that always looks under the surface of what is said to see what is hidden. This would seem to make irony a problematic aspect of texts and discourse for a Gadamerian hermeneutics. Nowhere in Gadamer's corpus can we find an extensive discussion of irony, but Gadamer does raise the question of irony in a provocative way in several important junctures. This essay contrasts Gadamer's treatment of irony to that of Leo Strauss and Jacques Derrida. It explores why for Gadamer irony does not call for a hermeneutics of suspicion.<br>

Publisher: Brill<br>
Issue: i24659567<br>
Date: 1 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): WARE OWEN<br>
Abstract: One of the central questions of Jacques Derrida's later writings concerns the sources of religion. At times he gives explicit priority to the universal dimension of religion. In other places, however, he considers the primacy of faith in its concrete, historical context. This paper will clarify Derrida's relationship to universality and historicity by first comparing his notion of "messianicity without messianism" to that of Walter Benjamin's "weak Messianism." After drawing out these differences, I will focus on Derrida's later writings. I will show that much of the ambiguity of Derrida's thinking on religion can be resolved by turning to his work on khōra, the Greek word for "space" or "matter." The rhetoric of khōra can allow us to think through a twofold logic, one that includes the universal/historical distinction and exceeds its alternatives.<br>

Author(s): HILTEBEITEL ALF<br>
Abstract: The same term used by Vaisampayana in the Ramopakhyana's "frame story"
to describe the monkeys, bears, Pändavas, and allies of Indra (276.5-10 - four
times). On these passages, see Hiltebeitel, "Authorial Paths." Not surprisingly (see
n. 22 above), J. Brockington sees these verses as an interpolation; see J. Brocking-
ton, The Sanskrit Epics, Handbuch der Orientalistik, Zweite Abteilung, Indien,
Vol. 12, J. Bronkhorst, ed. (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1998), 476. Considering the
Ramopäkyäna as subsequent to the Rämäyana (a matter I cannot take up here,
but on which I do not agree), Brockington takes these Rämopäkhyäna /Mbh verses
as indicative of growth subsequent to the Rämäyana's "second stage," arguing that
they are "[t]he sole exception" to Rama being mainly a human and exemplary fig-
ure, "the position reached in the middle of the second stage of growth of the
Rämäyana." He finds it "the more significant that the Rämopäkhyäna does not
allude to Rama's divinity in its closing chapter." But it is hard not to read
Brahma's closing words there as just such an allusion: "Like an immortal, you
have accomplished a great feat of the gods (krtam tvayä mahatkäryam devänäm
amaraprabhd)" (3.275.34cd). In any case, it is in the same adhyäya that Rama is
soon consecrated "the vaisnava hero" (65). For similar comments ("the only
exception"), see also J. Brockington, Epic Threads: John Brockington on the San-
skrit Epics, Greg Bailey and Mary Brockington, eds. (New Delhi: Oxford Univer-
sity Press, 2000), 300.<br>

Author(s): AKRAM MUHAMMAD<br>
Abstract: This paper discusses the issue of the relationship between theology and religious studies, drawing on certain principles of Hans-Georg Gadamer's hermeneutical theory. Leaving aside differences between Gadamer and his critics, it is argued that his rehabilitation of prejudice, authority and tradition as well as his notions of the fusion of horizons and intersubjective dialogue put into question the utility of dichotomous categories like subjective-objective, normative-descriptive, and insider-outsider in approaches to religion. It is suggested, therefore, that a clearer distinction between theology and religious studies can be established in terms of the subject matter of these disciplines rather than on the basis of their methodological principles. However, as both disciplines venture to understand at least some overlapping dimensions of religious phenomena which make up their common subject matter, to this extent, they can be viewed as dialogical partners and as providing different but complementary perspectives on religion.<br>

Abstract: Thesis XVI: "Aristotle's definitive conception of the anima rationalis as the 'body in
action' clearly shows that Aristotle must have held thinking and willing to be conscious perfor-
mances on the part of the anima rationalis. He could not consistently develop this important
insight however, because the Greek form-matter theme demanded that at least the general
principle of thinking (as rational form principle) be understood as a substance (ousia) wholly
independent of the 'material body'. Because of this Aristotle could only conceive of the faculty
of receptive human thought (thought as dunamis) as part of the human soul, but not the actual
thinking activity (nous poietikos), understood to be the 'form of the body'." Compare Glas
(1992).<br>

Abstract: In Matter and Memory, Bergson examines the relationship between perception and memory, the status of consciousness in its relation to the brain, and more generally, a possible conjunction of matter and mind. Our reading focuses in particular on his understanding of the evanescent presence of the present and of its debt vis-à-vis the "unconscious" consciousness of a "virtual" past. We wish to show that the Bergsonian version of a critique of "the metaphysics of presence" is, for all that, an offshoot of a Platonic type of metaphysics. It is true that Bergson departs from traditional stand-points on the side of a self-sufficient and original present and a form of presence to which the transparency of consciousness would confer the character of immediate evidence. All the same, it can hardly be claimed that his rehabilitation of the past and the unconscious opens up new perspectives on how forgetting and death are bound up with the work of memory.<br>

Abstract: Why should past occurrences matter to us as such? Are they in fact meaningful in a specifically historical way, or do they only become meaningful in being connected to other sorts of meaning-political or speculative, for example-as many notable theorists imply? Ranke and Oakeshott affirmed a purely historical meaningfulness but left its nature unclear. The purpose of this essay is to confirm historical meaningfulness by arguing that our commanding practical interest in how we share action with other actors is distinctively engaged by presumed information about past occurrences. We recognize that past occurrences have determined the conditions of action sharing, constraining our practice with regard to which actors we share practical reality with and which compounding actions we may or must join in progress.<br>

Publisher: Society for Historical Archaeology<br>
Issue: i25616488<br>
Date: 1 1, 1996<br>
Author(s): McCarthy John P.<br>
Abstract: Much archaeological scholarship on consumption has approached its subject matter as the means to an end—e.g., as a way of studying socioeconomic status—rather than as a proper object of study in its own right. The "consumer choice" school, and, more recently, advocates of consumer behavior studies, have supported approaches that emphasize quantitative methods, at the same time downplaying the "qualitative" or symbolic aspects of consumption. A considerable body of literature on the symbolic aspects of consumption exists both in historical archaeology and other fields. The intention of this essay is to draw together this recent literature on consumption and combine it into a single approach that emphasizes shopping as the meaningful action at the very heart of consumption. With the emphasis on agency, this approach presents shopping as that crucial moment of transformation where identity, intention, and symbol combine in the decision to purchase, to own, an object.<br>

Abstract: Le mot « traduction » est à l'honneur: le philosophe Paul Ricœur l'érige en principe éthique, la « traductologie » se pose en nouvelle discipline littéraire et un courant de la sociologie des sciences le prend pour paradigme. Au-delà de ce dernier usage analogique, n'y a-t-il pas place pour une sociologie de la traduction qui ne soit pas seulement une sociographie des traducteurs amateurs ou professionnels, ni même une annexe fonctionnelle de la théorie des champs culturels et de leurs échanges inégaux? L'événement éditorial que constitue une nouvelle traduction littéraire de la Bible offre ainsi au sociologue matière à associer ses dimensions linguistiques, institutionnelles et relationnelles pour déterminer une « configuration traductive » exemplaire de la rencontre équivoque entre mondes littéraires, médiatiques et religieux en contexte de modernité avancée. The word « translation » has pride of place at the present time: the philosopher Paul Ricœur sets it up as an ethical principle, « translation studies » become a new international subject and the sociology of sciences takes it up as paradigm. Beyond this last figurative use, the question is how can we draw up a sociology of translation apart from studies of professional sets and transnational cultural exchanges? The New Bible Translation, a recent literary event in the French-speaking world, gives matter for combining linguistic, institutional and relational points of view. This translation case as a sociological configuration accounts for this ambiguous meeting point — at the crossroads between literature, religion and publishing — in advanced modernity.<br>

Abstract: In the context of autonomy, it is important to note the affinities between Freud and
what is known as 'positive liberty' (the type of liberty Isaiah Berlin suggested both Rousseau
and Kant adhered to). Freud believes that the self s freedom involves self-mastery, the capac-
ity of the ego to occupy the mind as much as possible. From his perspective, freedom is not
simply given once external interferences and obstacles are removed; rather, it is gained by
learning to conquer the psychic forces that spring from both the id and the super-ego, forces
that if left unchecked inhibit our capacity to function in and cope with the world. Neverthe-
less, Freud did not translate his understanding of human freedom to the political realm, and
avoided the notion that self-mastery also involves similarity among selves. On this matter,
see J. Brunner, Freud: The Politics of Psychoanalysis (London, 1995), ch. 10.<br>

Abstract: Mansell, in "Metaphor as Matter," writes, "It has been observed that metaphor seems always to
mean something that could (albeit with difficulty) be translated into a statement.... But metaphor
will never come into its own so long as it is thought of in this way. Interpretation actually leads away
from metaphor's strength" (p. 112).

Abstract: L'article présente les premiers résultats d'une recherche en cours, menée d'après les archives de huit Conseils de prud'hommes, depuis leurs origines. A travers l'interaction aux audiences est étudiée l'interaction sur les lieux de travail. L'exploration d'un domaine inconnu jusqu'à maintenant met en cause la vision historique des rapports patrons-ouvriers, depuis le Premier Empire jusqu'au Second, qu'il s'agisse du droit ou des pratiques usuelles. Afin de reconstruire un ordre industriel, la voie conciliatrice s'imposa comme la solution la plus efficace, face à l'impuissance des voies répressives. L'article analyse comment les conflits pouvaient éclater et se régler, comment se sont établies des sortes de législations locales du travail, en dissidence avec le droit national français, puis comment ce modèle a été remis en cause, à la fin du Second Empire, lorsque des patrons prétendirent s'instaurer seuls juges sur le lieu de travail. /// The article gives the first results of an ongoing research through eight "Conseil de prud'hommes" archives. The interactions during the hearings give a way to understand the interactions on the workplace. The exploration of a yet unknown world questions the common historical view of labour relations from the First to the Second Empire, whatever a matter of law or of common practices. The individual conciliator way was thrusted by evidence of efficiency against the repressive way, in order to rebuild an industrial order. The article analyses how the conflicts could break out and be settled, how sets of local rules were laid down and generated a discrepancy between prud'hommes' customs and the national law. And how this model was destabilized at the end of the Second Empire, when employers claimed to be instituted as unique judges on the workplace. seuls juges sur le lieu de travail. /// The article gives the first results of an ongoing research through eight "Conseil de prud'hommes'" archives.

Publisher: Palgrave Macmillan<br>
Issue: i371628<br>
Date: 1 1, 1996<br>
Author(s): Winnicott Amal<br>
Abstract: Drawing on two studies of children aged between seven and 10 years this article explores their narratives of themselves, families, sibling and peer relationships. Their narratives were full of push-pull and contradictory processes. The children moved towards knowledge as well as a disavowal of 'reality' about their families and material conditions. Critically they revealed profound wishes for something better alongside the knowledge that 'this is it'. This article focuses on theorizing children's understandings of and relationships to social and material life in order to argue that meanings matter and meanings have matter. Narratives are social in two critical ways: they involve reaching out and connecting with others, and narratives are constructed within and through the social sphere, while simultaneously they are shot through with conscious and unconscious fantasies. Children are moving towards being in a complex - engaged in and inhabiting many relationships.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000757<br>

Author(s): Novak David<br>
Abstract: Jewish ethics like Judaism itself has often been charged with being "particularistic," and in modernity it has been unfavorably compared with the universality of secular ethics. This charge has become acute philosophically when the comparison is made with the ethics of Kant. However, at this level, much of the ethical rejection of Jewish particularism, especially its being beholden to a God who is above the universe to whom this God prescribes moral norms and judges according to them, is also a rejection of Christian (or any other monotheistic) ethics, no matter how otherwise universal. Yet this essay argues that Jewish ethics that prescribes norms for all humans, and that is knowable by all humans, actually constitutes a wider moral universe than does Kantian ethics, because it can include non-rational human objects and even non-human objects altogether. This essay also argues that a totally egalitarian moral universe, encompassing all human relations, becomes an infinite, totalizing universe, which can easily become the ideological justification (ratio essendi) of a totalitarian regime.<br>

Publisher: West Virginia University<br>
Issue: i40001871<br>
Date: 7 1, 1981<br>
Author(s): Findlay L. M.<br>
Abstract: In "Ulysses" Tennyson adapts and refines the traditional techniques of ars memoria to create a poem that is vivid, specific, yet rich in allusion. Ulysses draws on present sensation and a well-stocked memory to help him face the future. This process is highly selective and manipulative, and Tennyson exposes its dangers by subtly appealing to a greater memory: that collective literary memory where Homer and Dante reign. Personal memory furnishes the immediate and attractive subject matter of the poem: its fabric of allusion implies and controls its larger and more cautionary meanings.<br>

Author(s): Renaud Michel<br>
Abstract: O tema principal deste artigo incide na relação entre a metafísica de Deus e a abordagem de Deus na filosofia da religião. Três modelos são apresentados, respectivamente sob os títulos seguintes: 1) o caminho da filosofia para a fé; 2) a filosofia e a fé no mesmo caminho; 3) o caminho da fé para a filosofia. Os modelos apoiam-se sobre: 1) Tomás de Aquino, na primeira parte; 2) Hegel, na segunda e 3) a hermenêutica contemporânea, na terceira. Não se trata de repetir esses autores, mas de tentar decifrar o momento especulativo próprio de cada um no que diz respeito à articulação do Deus da metafísica com o Deus da fé. /// Le thème principal de cet article concerne la relation entre la métaphysique de Dieu et l'approche de Dieu en philosophie de la religion. Trois modèles sont proposés, respectivement: 1) le chemin de la philosophie vers la foi; 2) la philosophie et la foi sur le même chemin; 3) le chemin de la foi vers la philosophie. Ces modèles s'appuient sur les auteurs ou courants philosophiques suivants: Thomas d'Aquin dans la première partie; Hegel, dans la seconde; l'herméneutique contemporaine dans la troisième. Il ne s'agit pas de répéter ces auteurs, mais de dégager le moment spéculatif de chacun quant à l'articulation du Dieu de la métaphysique avec le Dieu de la foi. /// The principal them of this article has to do with the religion that can be established between the God of metaphysics and that which can be discerned in the philosophy of religion. Three models are presented: 1) the path from philosophy to faith; 2) philosophy and faith on this very path; 3) the path from fait to philosophy. These three models are based respectively on the following: 1) Thomas Aquinas; 2) Hegel; and 3) contemporary hermeneutics. It is not a matter of repeating these others, but rather to capture the speculative moment that can be found in each and that contribute to the articulation of he God of metaphysics with the God of faith.<br>

Abstract: This paper takes up Richard Kearney's work The God Who May Be, specifically in the context of postmodern debates concerning epistemological claims regarding the other. Kearney's hermeneutics of religion attempts to forge a middle path between ontotheological philosophies of religion and various quasi-religious manifestations of postmodernism; however, my main concern is to address certain points of disagreement between Kearney and proponents of a deconstructive "religion without religion" principally Jacques Derrida and John D. Caputo. The main issue at stake is just how other God is, which is itself a specific case of a broader question concerning otherness per se. Caputo et al. claim that religious assertions about God are fundamentally undecidable, which means that they are "infinitely translatable" and "substitutable," that we can never tell what is a translation of what, but the ultimate point is that it "does not matter" The undecidable nature of religious claims includes the very claim that religion is a discourse about God, which is why deconstructive religion without religion is a messianic hope for "the impossible" devoid of any content. Kearney objects that such radical undecidability leaves us lost in the desert ofkhora with no way to distinguish, even imperfectly and provisionally, between God and Satan, good and evil, the widow and the terrorist. In this paper I claim that Kearney succeeds in finding this via tertia between the Scylla of dogmatism and the Charybdis of complete indeterminacy by thinking God in two important ways: as persona-prosopon (which avoids confusing God with khora or monstrosity) and as posse (which keeps us from dogmatism). /// O presente artigo toma em particular consideração a obra de Richard Kearney The God Who May Be, especificamente no contexto dos debates pós-modernos acerca do estatuto epistemológico da alteridade.

Article Title: Reader and Text in the Horizon of Understanding Methodology: Gadamer and Methodological Hermeneutics<br>

Abstract: Judging Gadamer's theoretical stance is a complicated matter, and his ontological hermeneutics is usually regarded as a text-centered theory of understanding. Through an analysis of the phenomenological premises from which his theories take off, however, we can clearly see his reader-centric stance. On the basis of this stance some cease to seek for the original intention of the author or the original meaning of the text, which ineluctably leads to the ignorance of an understanding methodology. As far as people's intentional understanding is concerned, however, the important as well as essential task is still that of striving for a certain kind of understanding that is relatively correct, with universally effective methodology as its necessary prerequisite. What is more, herein lies the significance of the epistemology of hermeneutics. This article aims to re-insert a sense of methodology after hermeneutics went through a period of ontological reflection, and hence clarify that it is of necessity that hermeneutics resumes its text-centric methodological stance. /// 判定加达默尔的理论立场是一个复杂的问题。他的本体论诠释学一般被视为 一种文本中心论的理解理论，然而通过对他所从出发的现象学前提之分析，可以清 楚地看出他的读者中心论的立场.正是基于这一立场，放弃了对作者原意或文本原 义之诉求，必然导致对理解方法论的漠视。但是，就人们有意识的理解活动而言， 首要的以及根本的任务仍然是努力获得某种相对正确的理解，而普遍有效的方法论 就是其必要的前提，诠释学的认识论意义便在于此.在诠释学经历了本体论的反思 后，应重新注入一种方法论的意识，回到以文本为中心的方法论立场.<br>

Abstract: O presente artigo tem por objectivo fazer uma reflexão sobre o motto, o prólogo e a introdução a O conceito de Angústia (1844) de Søren Kierkegaard. Longe de serem meros preâmbulos, estes textos constituent importantes chaves de leitura para a obra que encabeçam. Na verdade, a distinção socrática entre o que se sabe e o que não se sabe do motto de O conceito de angústia transforma-se no argumento propriamente dito da obra. A partir desta distinção, Kierkegaard desenvolve a sua crítica contra a confusão moderna das ciências, ao mesmo tempo que propõe uma nova divisão em ordem a poder situar legitimamente a questão do pecado. Em vez de conceber o pecado de maneira especulativa, a psicologia da angústia é apresentada como a única disciplina em que propriamente se pode tratar o problema do pecado e, ao mesmo tempo, ser consciente da sua incompreensibilidade. /// The objective of this article is to think about the motto, preface and introduction to Kierkegaard's The Concept of Anxiety (1844). Far from being mere preambles, these texts constitute the reading key for the book they lead. As a matter of fact, the Socratic distinction between what we understand and what we do not understand from The concept of Anxiety's motto becomes the philosophical argument of the work. From this distinction, Kierkegaard carries out a critique against the modern confusion of sciences and at the same time proposes a new arrangement in which to place legitimately the problem of sin. Instead of conceiving sin in a speculative way, the psychology of anxiety shows itself to be the only discipline able to deal properly with the question of sin and to be conscious of its mysterious dimension.<br>

Abstract: It would seem to the purpose here to consider the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga in his relation to his fellow-historians, Robert Fruin and Jan Romein. For in this trio Huizinga contrasted with Fruin, and in his turn Romein contrasted with Huizinga, whereas, on the other hand, in spite of their different view-points, they are at the same time connected by the plainly unbroken line of liberal adogmatism. Fruin the father of Dutch historiography, was original in his liberal adogmatism. Not a single thesis, according to him, is to be carried into safety beforehand and exempted from investigation. Nothing is to be held up for acceptance without permission for examination. In demanding such blind acceptance one would be guilty of moral constraint and mental repression, a fault according to him especially committed by the Roman Catholic Church. In the long run this liberal and adogmatic inspiration of Fruin's came to run dry. With him the devices and the technique of research became ends in themselves. Fruin rationalized this development in the thesis that the disinterestedness with which we ought to strive after the truth would be tarnished if we were to expect from scholarly historical research any contribution whatsoever to the existential unfolding of the investigating subject. Huizinga's views on the theory of history constitute a violent reaction to this view. He argues that owing to the historian's selection of his material, as well as by the ideas through which the historian comprehends the historical process, subjectivity is unavoidable. Moreover, it is desirable. It is unscholariy, Huizinga says, to assume without evidence that the purification the subject desires to undergo by his adogmatic stand, should presuppose complete elimination—impossible in itself—of any subjective element whatsoever. The idea of objectivity, he says, should be broadened from a non-subjective objectivity, without evidence too narrowly conceived, per se unattainable, into an objectivity~<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Abstract: In the last one hundred and fifty years, in human and social sciences and especially in geography, there was a dialectic parallelism between the positivist and humanist paradigms. The formers putted its accent in the objectivity and the quantitative methodology and the humanistic in the subjectivity and hermeneutics, with significant influence of Marxist philosophy. Nowadays, emergences of epistemological anarchism attack heavily the search of scientific truth. In consequence, is shaping up a new dichotomy of geography: we ought to pursue social ethics or we ought to pursue scientific ethic. In Latin America, where geographical science can contribute actively to reach the so desired sustainable development, to take position in the sense of the objectivity and the scientific truth, should be the way to a leading role for the geographers in matter of territorial arrangement. En los últimos 150 años, en las ciencias humanas y sociales y especialmente en la geografía, hubo un paralelismo dialéctico entre los paradigmas positivistas y los humanistas. Los primeros pusieron su acento en la objetividad y los métodos cuantitativos, y los humanistas en la subjetividad y la hermenéutica, con significativa influencía de la filosofía marxista. Actualmente, el surgimiento del anarquismo epistemológico ataca fuertemente la búsqueda de la verdad científica. En consecuencia, está tomando forma una nueva dicotomía de la geografía: debemos perseguir una ética social o debemos perseguir una ética científica. En América Latina, donde la ciencia geográfica puede contribuir activamente a alcanzar el tan deseado desarrollo sustentable, tomar posición en el sentido de la objetividad y de la verdad científica debería ser el camino hacia un rol protagónico para los geógrafos en materia de ordenamiento territorial.<br>

Abstract: A educaçao é vulgarmente considerada um importante instrumento impulsionador da transformacäo social. Alias, segundo a teoría liberal, a educaçao foi sempre considerada urna via para a mobilidade social e a chave do progresso individual e social. Todavía, foi nos anos 60 que a educaçao começou a atrair as atençôes dos economistas, dos políticos, dos organismos internacionais e dos movimentos revolucionarios. Com efeito, tiveram lugar certos acontecimentos que levaram a olhar mais de perto os processus e as instituiçôes educacionais. A elaboraçâo de teorías económicas da educaçao constituí um indicativo deste descente interesse pela educaçao e pelo saber. A concepçâo económica do « capital humano » contém, porém, pressupostos ideológicos que reforçam o modelo capitalista da sociedade. De qualquer modo, a educaçao, em termos de descimentó económico e mobilidade social, foi posta em evidencia em todos os países capitalistas desenvolvidos. Nos países capitalistas subdesenvolvidos, a crescente industrializaçâo também salientou o papel da educaçao na mudança social. Mas, além dos problemas do desenvolvimento capitalista nos países desenvolvidos e da industrializaçâo nos países capitalistas subdesenvolvidos, os anos 60 e os principios dos anos 70 proporcionaran! outras razöes para destacar a importancia da educaçao nas mudanças sociais. Designadamente, as reformas educacionais socialistas em Cuba, na China e, mais recentemente, em diversos países africanos constitiiem inspiraçao para novos e importantes estudos. Na revoluçâo socialista há a consciência de que a luta das classes também se manifesta nas escolas. Por outro lado, as teorías de confuto, marxistas e näo marxistas, também se aplicam à análise das reformas educacionais nas sociedades capitalistas. Estas teorías tentam estabelecer as bases para uma sociedade alternativa, baseada no valor do trabalho.

Author(s): Vieillard-Baron Jean-Louis<br>
Abstract: Le premier volume d'inédits de Levinas comprend un hommage à Bergson rédigé en 1946. Levinas voit en Bergson celui qui s'est opposé au temps de la science et des machines au nom du temps vécu ; ceci a rendu possible la conception heideggérienne du temps comme être. Levinas souscrit à la grande découverte de Bergson. Il souligne l'intérêt de la critique bergsonienne du néant comme être biffé, mais rejette la critique du désordre qui ne serait qu'un ordre différent ; pour lui, le désordre est le chaos préalable à tout ordre. Surtout, il voit dans la durée un temps fondamental, une diachronie première, qui rend possibles les trois dimensions du temps. Et il note que la durée est une vie que la mort ne limite pas ; le temps n'est pas la marque de notre finitude. Pour Bergson, seule la matière meurt, par manque d'énergie. Bien qu'il n'ait pas suivi la méthode bergsonienne, Levinas reconnaît la supériorité de l'analyse de la durée et la prolonge dans le sens d'un immémorial subjectif. The first volume of Levinas' unpublished texts includes a tribute paid to Bergson in 1946. Levinas considers Bergson as the philosopher who opposed the time of science and machines in the name of time experienced, and this in turn paved the way to Heidegger's concept of time as being. Levinas subscribes to that major insight of Bergson. He underlines the interest of Bergson's criticism of nothingness as « being scratched out », but rejects his criticism of disorder as but a different kind of order. For Levinas, disorder is the chaos preliminary to any kind of order. Above all, he sees in duration a fundamental time, a primary diachrony which makes possible the three dimensions of time. He remarks that duration is life not limited by death: time is not the mark of our finitude. For Bergson, matter alone dies, for lack of energy. While he does not follow Bergson's method, Levinas acknowledges the superiority of his analysis of duration and takes it further in the direction of immemorial subjec~<br>

Abstract: Predicative Metaphor (e.g. Max is a lion) is commonly construed as a problem of conceptual rupture in a cognitive framework, even if many philosophers and semanticists have already criticized this view. This text aims at showing that, for explaining why such predications are usual, grammatical and, in some sense, coherent, we need a internally much more flexible conception both of lexical and grammatical (the predication) meanings. They should not be confused with an unique (categorial) dimension, but should integrate an open "motif" stratum, anticipating and mixing up all possible "thematic" instantiations of the meaning. This is both a linguistic and philosophical matter.<br>

Issue: i40100618<br>
Date: 1 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Špirit Michael<br>
Abstract: This article discusses the attitude of the Czech literary critic Václav Černý to his fellow critic and compatriot F. X. Šalda, that is to say, Černý's self-stylization, which was defined in polemical reference to Šalda, and also the way Černý 'broadcast' it or concealed it - the primary feature of his technique. Concerning the question of whether literary criticism is a science or an art, the author does not state that Šalda was correct in his Stance against Černý nor, for that matter, that Černý was correct in his against Šalda: the construct of Černý's 'Co je kritika, co není a k čemu je na světě' [What Criticism Is, What It Is Not, and Why It Exists at All] is just as valid as Šalda's claim. The article seeks to demonstrate that in particular it was in his conception of literary criticism that Černý needed to distance himself from Šalda. The fact that Černý could argue for his own method only thanks to Šalda's not having declared criticism a science is only seemingly a paradox. The article also points out parallels between Šalda’s Boje o zítřek and Černý's Osobnost, tvorba a boj, which are interesting particularly for the way the narrow correspondence between the two works then stands out and how Černý in fact barely discussed Šalda at ali. The affinity of the two critics emphasizes how important it was for Černý to stress the difference between himself and his predecessor in the very area in which he was in fact most similar to him.<br>

Abstract: This study is concerned with the method and results of an empirical research project called’ Regional Topics and the Understanding of Region: Research into Reception of Literature in Silesia and North Moravia’, which took place in May 1998. The starting point was an attempt to summarize the predominant approaches to regionalism, the particular nature of a region, and the predominant forms of Communication in regional Communication in the arts and in society in general. The chosen method of asking the questions and the results of the quantitative analysis have been received with a certain degree of scepticism, though a comparison with some of the signs and features discovered in similar research in 1982-4 is not without interest. The entire matter, however, has taken on a new form and cannot be looked at in isolation.<br>

Abstract: Narratology has explored in depth the modes of narration, but it has left largely untouched the question of the modes of narrativity. This term designates the various ways in which narrative structures are realized in texts. To call a novel or short story narrative is an entirely different matter from that of applying the same term to a lyric poem or a drama. The study of the modes of narrativity attempts to answer the question: what does it mean to say "this text is narrative"? As a cognitive category necessary to the proper understanding of a work, the narrative structure of a text may be compared to the identifiable shape of an object in a visual artwork. Thus, various modes of narrative may be compared to a type of picture or visual phenomenon.<br>

Abstract: Dans L'Étoile de la rédemption de Franz Rosenzweig, une topologie articule la question du pardon en tant que non-originaire. La distribution qui scande, organise et tisse toute une série de reliaisons faisant « système » dans L'Étoile, c'est : Création /révélation /rédemption comme modes relationnels et temporels déterminant des façons pour l'homme de se trouver pris dans des liaisons spécifiques avec Dieu, avec le monde, avec les autres hommes. Dans ces réseaux tissés par L'Étoile, la question est de savoir si le pardon est chose humaine ou grâce divine, « propre de l'homme » ou « propre de dieu » et de quoi il pourrait bien être, du coup, l'« impropre ». In the Star of Redemption of Franz Rosenzweig the forgiveness ist not really originary. The dispatching or distribution model who rules a multiplicity of « systematic » relations in the Star is the triplicity Creation/Revelation/Redemption. Thus the question is: is forgiveness a human affair or a divine favor ? Is it practicable in the community or is it a matter of inter subjectivity ? The themes of time, love, forgiveness and otherness are central in this reflexion.<br>

Abstract: In Britain, as in France, 'mainstream' anthropologists were hesitant to acknowledge studies within their own country as proper subjects for anthropological enquiry. British social anthropology defined itself as the study of 'other cultures' and became entrenched in a tradition in which Otherness was confused with manifest difference. This naivete, elevated into a scientific principle, precluded the recognition of 'self as anything other than a scientific instrument; but also led to the invention of a generalisable Other, and thereby ignored the complexity of variation within the cultures it studied. By the same token, it blinded anthropologists to heterogeneity within their 'own' local cultures as well, and was finally changed only by a series of related paradigm leaps. Our understanding of culture changed from a set of prescriptive influences which integrated society, to a ragged and non-systemic array of interpretive tools which aggregated society. Consequent upon this change, symbols were acknowledged as vehicles of expression and of negotiable meaning rather than as having stipulated and invariant referents. The demise of modernist theories liberated anthropology from its scientific illusions and positivistic pretensions, enabling it to acknowledge the personal and speculative nature of the enterprise. This admission of the subjective, of the anthropologist's self, was necessary in order to see Otherness as inhering in 'person' rather than in an abstraction such as 'culture' and, therefore, to be enabled to recognise diversity within cultures rather than merely between them. This enhanced perception of internal heterogeneity clearly places the Self of the anthropologist at the centre of the stage and has led to the contemporary debates about the nature of ethnographic writing and the status of ethnographic 'authority'. It has also had obvious consequences for anthropological research, including the raising anew of the relationship of individual to society; and t~<br>

Abstract: During the reign of Catherine the Great, the question of the origins of the Russian State and people ('the Varagian-Norman question') becomes a matter of wide discussion in Russia and in Europe. It has been a very controversial topic in the Russian Academy of Sciences and the occasion of a violent polemic between historians around 1749-50. It has long been kept secret because of the possible dangerous political consequences for the Monarchy and the national pride. The political power wanted by all means to give its subjects a glorious national history but at the same time to control the story of the origins, the ethnic aspects and possible liberal, parliamentary or democratic interpretations of the beginnings of the Russian State. While western historians (German, French and English) gave their accounts of this founding event to the Enlightened Europe, making this story widespread in the West, Catherine made ancient Russian history part of the new modern national education of the elites. She was writing plays herself and patronizing artists and printers, censuring them occasionally: she tried to orient collective memory and used it as an ideological tool to create a unified empire under her lead. В правление имератрицы Екатерины Великой (1762-1796 гг.) - как в России, так и в Европе - всё активнее обсуждается т н. «варяжско-норманский вопрос», т.е. вопрос происхождения Российского государства и народа. Еще в правление императрицы Елизаветы Петровны (1742-1761 гг.) внутри Российской Академии наук, и прежде всего в 1749-1750 гг., данный вопрос стал предметом острой полемики между историками. Между тем долго опасались огласки, т.к. было принято считать, что самый спор, пожалуй, может вызывать нежелательные политические последствия для Монархии и национальной гордости. Политическая власть стремилась к тому, чтобы в ее основание легла величественная национальная история. В свзи с этим она пыталась иметь контроль над повествованием о своем происхождении, и также об этниче~<br>

Abstract: Conspiracy accounting is often regarded as an atypical, pathological form of political reasoning, and little research has considered how ordinary social actors may refer to political conspiracies in the course of argument. In this article, we consider the spontaneous use of conspiracy narratives by politically engaged Greek citizens in interview discussions of the Macedonian crisis. Analysis revealed that conspiracy narratives were typically used to challenge dominant representations that attributed the Macedonian crisis to Greek xenophobic nationalism. Specifically, conspiracy accounts were used to dispute assumptions concerning Greece's majority status by representing the political opposition as a consortium rather than a single out-group, by recasting the threat posed to Greece as a matter of realistic rather than symbolic competition, and by extending the historical frame of reference to encompass past and prospective future threats to the Greek people and the Greek state. In conclusion, we note how the use of conspiratorial reasoning may be used to construct complex causal arguments concerning intergroup relations and to challenge dominant ideological assumptions about social hierarchy and political legitimacy. In this respect, conspiratorial reasoning might be regarded as a prototypical form of intergroup representation.<br>

Abstract: The first-generation literature on policy design has made considerable contributions over the last 30 years to our understanding of the process, politics and implications of policy design and instrument choice. This literature, however, has generally treated institutions as a black box and has not developed a coherent set of frameworks, theories and models of how institutions matter to policy design. In this paper, I unpack the black box of institutions using transaction cost and mechanism design to show how regulations can be better designed in developing countries when institutions are weak, unaccountable, corrupted or not credible. Under these conditions, I show that efficient regulatory design has to minimize transaction costs, particularly agency problems, by having incentive compatible (self-enforcing) mechanisms. I conclude with a second-generation research agenda on regulatory design with implications for environmental, food and drug safety, healthcare and financial regulation in developing countries.<br>

L'auteur y montre les changements dans les thèses de Changeux en les accompagnant de ses commentaires philosophiques et théologiques aussi bien critiques que constructifs. L'homme, ses origines et sa structure, le cerveau humain, la conscience de soi, la matière et sa complexité évolutive, la sensibilité artistique, la morale, la religion, la question d'une lecture intégrale de Darwin et de Spinoza, la signification du discours sur « l'homme de vérité » sont les principaux sujets traités. Le but de l'article est un dialogue interdisciplinaire entre neurosciences et théologie sur la compréhension de l'être humain. This article passes in revue the following works of the neurobiologist J.-P. Changeux : L'homme neuronal, 1983, Raison et plaisir, 1982, Ce qui nous fait penser (a dialogue with Paul Ricœur), 1998, and L'homme de vérité, 2002. The author shows the changes in Changeux's theses, accompanying them with his philosophical and theological commentaries, critical as well as constructive. Man, his origins and structure, the human brain, self consciousness, matter and its progressive complexity, artistic sensibility, morality, religion, the question of an integral reading of Darwin and Spinoza, and the significance of discourse upon « L'homme de vérité » are the principal subjects treated. The goal of the article is an interdisciplinary dialogue between the neurosciences and theology about the understanding of the human being.<br>

Author(s): Centemeri Laura<br>
Abstract: Through an analysis of the 40-year history of conflicts triggered by the repeated attempts to expand the Malpensa airport in northern Italy, this paper seeks to show the heuristic strength of using the concept of modes of valuation of the environment to discuss the transformations of environmental critique over time in their relation to social change. I argue that, beyond empirical specifics, the trajectory witnessed in this case – from public participation to place-based resistance – reflects more generalized dynamics that can be found in many other conflicts over large infrastructural projects in contemporary Europe. The article is organized as follows: in the first section I briefly introduce the concept of modes of valuation of the environment, which is inspired by recent work in pragmatic sociology. In particular, I distinguish between universal, local, and emplaced modes of valuation. In the second and third sections I provide an analysis of the struggles against the Malpensa airport expansion from 1970 to 2014. Here, I distinguish three phases of mobilization, which I discuss in terms of the transformations that can be observed in the arguments that actors develop to fight or support the airport expansion. I argue that these transformations are articulated not only with changing action repertoires but also with evolving social and sociotechnical imaginarles that convey specific understandings of the environment as a matter of political concern. This analysis shows that, far from being simply a case of citizens' resistance to change, the mobilization against the Malpensa airport has contributed to producing the cultural basis of an increased collective reflexivity about the many values that the environment takes on among community members in the airport region. In the final section I discuss some hypotheses concerning what modes of valuation of the environment reveal about the emergence of a new radicalism in environmental struggles.<br>

Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219828<br>
Date: 10 1, 1965<br>
Author(s): Watkins John<br>
Abstract: Milton scholarship has long regarded chaos in Paradise Lost as hostile to God and creation. This judgment identifies Milton with traditional Western attitudes toward matter and material disorder-evident as early as the Babylonian creation epic, the Enuma elish. In contrast to such attitudes, modern science conceives of chaos as dynamically productive of order, and postmodern cultural studies sees chaos as a relevant principle of ironic indeterminacy. Milton anticipates the postmodern endorsement of chaos in his theology of matter and in the symbolic reflections and allegorical representations of chaos in Paradise Lost. Appreciation of chaotic disorder and of indeterminacy and disapproval of the tyrannical suppression of these qualities distinguish Milton's idiosyncratic theology, political theory, and aesthetics. Even Milton's God contains the potency of chaotic matter, a womblike virtue essential to God's creative power.<br>

Publisher: American Bar Foundation<br>
Issue: i234271<br>
Date: 1 1, 1948<br>
Author(s): Corner Stephen A.<br>
Abstract: American federalism is nothing more-and nothing less-than a metaphor. This was how James Wilson, the most prominent lawyer at the Philadelphia Convention, came to approach the novel problem of understanding and conveying what federalism in a modern republic should mean. The Federal Republic created in 1787 was, for Wilson, more than a matter of ingenious political design, more than a matter of the "new science of politics," and more than a matter of constitutional law or constitutionalism itself-unless the Constitution were seen to "comprehend" the moral purpose and moral promise of the new nation. To Wilson, this view of the importance of the moral content of republican federalism was entailed by the "knowledge" that he took to be the necessary foundation of the Republic. It was this knowledge of certain fundamental principles-of "moral science," human nature, and the nature of language, and, more generally, of "cultivation" as a political and social process that was also an end in itself-that ultimately justified "the People" as the "sublime" metaphor governing American constitutional theory. Yet, for all Wilson's faith in figurative "comprehensiveness," his distinctive approach to securing the New Republic through a federal union of the American People seems to have proved less and less compelling to his contemporaries the more he tried to pursue it as far as his vision of a politics of cultivation directed.<br>

Abstract: Poetry has come a long way since T. S. Eliot's endnotes documenting his citations and sources in
         The Waste Landfirst troubled his readers. Or has it? Endnotes are common currency in back margins of poetry books published today in North America. They archive and index their sources in a quasi-scholarly fashion, assiduously referencing their source documents or offhandedly alluding to “inspiration” from textual and non-textual sources they have “drawn from,” “appropriated,” are “indebted to,” “borrow from,” or which they “adapt.”
               In a send-up of this fashion, Mónica de la Torre and Terence Gower's83

Abstract: Further, the method of triggering nostalgia through music is appropriate since music and sound communicate directly to a reader's feelings. In doing so, they often become important connotations of memory. The long quotation above represents a good example of the musicality in Fitzgerald's prose, a matter discussed by Langman (31–40) and Bryer (123–27). This musicality is especially noticeable in the first half of the novel when it is designed to pull the reader into the ecstasy and presence of the narrative, as well as at the very end when there is a resolution of the two different nostalgic elements. The long winding sentences, where the subordinate clauses play with and complement each other, are not unlike the instruments in a string quartet. In the passage above, we find only four periods, which means there is a flow and a rhythm amidst repetitions. Asyndeton and polysyndeton function as pausing elements instead of periods. Asyndeton connects clauses through the use of comma, while polysyndeton primarily uses the word “and.” The repeating rhythm is most prominent in the enumeration of instruments in the beginning of the passage or in the phrase “the air is alive with chatter and laughter and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other's names”; the several “and[s]” create a feeling of breathlessness, which can be compared to the hyper-excitement so often found in children when they experience something important and immediately want to try to tell someone about it. The specific phrasing in this case seems to emphasize action and eventfulness in an almost impressionistic manner, so that the atmosphere of the actual scene is syntactically transferred into the reader's experience. This is further enhanced by the aforementioned switch into present tense in the middle of the description, which minimizes the distance between the reader and the narrated impressions.<br>

Abstract: Jabbeh Wesley leaves us with more than pictures of desolation in her poetics of testimony. Even as she explores the traumas of the war, she steers the reader's attention to the Liberian people's passion for life. In “I am Not Dekuah,” from
         Before the Palm Could Bloom, the speaker addresses his clansmen:
               
         Dieh, I come knocking
               Clansmen, I come calling.
               I come crawling at your doors.
               There is a matter
               from my heart.
               Gather your sons from afar

Abstract: There have been diasporas throughout human histories. The term itself received its classical definition as a description of the removal of the Hebrew from Israel to Babylon in 587 BCE. The modern period is characterized by the intensity, number, and impact of the meaning and nature of diasporic formations. As a matter of fact, one might look upon modern Europe as a diasporic culture. I have already alluded to the dispersal of the Jews from Spain in the symbolic inaugural date of the beginning of modernity in 1492. Subsequently, European cultures established several diasporic communities throughout the world. The major ones were English-settler populations in East and South Africa and in North America and military-colonial communities in India and Africa. During their rule of India, the English dispersed thousands of Indians to the Fiji Islands of the Pacific, East Africa, South Africa, and Trinidad and Tobago. While these were in fact diasporic communities, the rhetoric accompanying these movements avoided any implication or hint of diasporic meaning. Daniel Defert has noted that
         
               Most of the diasporic communities in the modern world have come about as a result of the transcultural expanse of European culture. The kind of vulnerabilities and resources present in transcultural situations were not admitted to or expressed by the Europeans. Thus, transculturation involved for them, as Defert put it, “a collection of the world,” and in the language of Gaster, the evacuation of meaning from other cultures, or emptying, for the sake of European hegemony, or filling. Africa as a continent and Europe as a geo-ideological construct have had a special relationship over the last millennia, the intensity of this relationship intensifying over the last five hundred years. On the whole, diasporic cultures and religions have never chosen the binary option for any length of time. The binary as defining completely separate worlds has been the position of the ~<br>

Abstract: From the outset, all of us could see that nonscientific concerns, felt human sense, and pretheoretical understanding are not, as the patronizing label had it, “merely subjective” and thus philosophically unworthy. We all knew, for example, that no real human beings—except possibly Merleau-Ponty's Schneider—open their eyes in the morning and face the problem of whether percepts can be synthesized with concepts to make sure there is an external world. And whatever the good life is, it seemed pretty obvious that one gets no closer to it by defining ethical discourse as noncognitive or by obsessing over individuals and their moral rules while ignoring class interests, culture, and social structure. For me, the matter came to a head when I studied Dilthey on the difference between explaining nature and understanding people. On any fair reading of his beautiful accounts of how
      Verstehenworks and how a whole group of genuine sciences could be founded on it, Dilthey seemed obviously right. And yet, I was reading a fifty-year-old book by someone who had in the meantime clearly lost the argument.

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Although the uncanny strangeness of the unconscious may be, as Kristeva says, the “ultimate condition of our being with others” (1991, 192), this haunting togetherness is based niether on Kantian equality as like for like nor on Levinasian unrecognizable radical alterity. Rather, unconscious fears and desires produce others whom we recognize as friend or enemy, loved or hated, human or animal, virtuous or monstrous, having the right to live or deserving to be put to death. While intimately related to the hyperbolic and impossible ethical demand to open ourselves to the unrecognizable, these categorical oppositions are not simply a matter of our inability to recognize others or even the otherness of others. Rather, they are a matter of recognizing them as abject others deserving to be locked up, tortured, and killed. We cannot begin to witness to what is beyond recognition in the singularity of each life until we come to terms with the death drive in ourselves, specifically as it manifests itself in our own fears and desires through which we create both our friends and our enemies, both those who are like us and those who are not, both those who are with us and those who are against us.<br>

Abstract: Consider how you may be facing an operation and you have to make some decisions in regard to the procedures. In one case there is an expensive procedure requiring total anesthesia where no pain will be felt. The other is very inexpensive and requires no anesthesia. Thus, it will involve excruciating pain. But prior to the operation you can receive a drug that obliterates your memory of your present life. After the operation you will receive another drug that will extinguish your memory of the operation. Given the advantages of little expense and the avoidance of the pain that you, for example, John Brough, would feel, I ask you: Would it not be reasonable for you to opt for the less expensive operation? Or, rather, would it not be more reasonable to say that even though the one you now regard as John Brough would not be known by you, you now have no doubt that it is you who will be undergoing the excruciating pain at the time, and in this respect it will be a completely indifferent matter to you whether you can remember who you were the day before?

Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: This statement expresses a postmodern perspective more effectively than such concepts as deconstruction, death of God, poststructuralism, or genealogical thought. By virtue of is vagueness it articulates the absence of a defining subject, mastering terms, or a foundation for thought. It privileges varieties of approach and subject matter that destabilize each other and avoids a definitive framework that would guide the organization. Instead it offers SPEP as an open space for incompatible as well as compatible types of knowledge, approach, and philosophical sensibility. It affirms an indeterminate ambiguity in all words that people might otherwise interpret as centralizing and directive in an exclusive way. I believe that it reflects a kind of democratic pluralism rather more than the philosophical traditions could tolerate that came from Europe and played defining roles in SPEP's early years. I am quite sure that some of the organization's early leaders would consider the mission statement no less nihilistic than they found Nietzsche, Sartre, Derrida, Foucault, and all other philosophers identified as postmodern in 1980.<br>

Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Or take an example from ancient physics (2400 B.P.), Democritean atoms. Democritus theorized bits of matter so small
            in factbut alsoin principleto be too small to be humanly perceived. Yet he went on to hypothesize that their shapes werecausesof our perceptions. Thus smooth round shapes caused sweet tastes, while barbed ones caused bitter. From today's technologically embodied science we have now overcome his limitations with scanning, tunneling electronic microscopes and now know, recently, that two-atom-thick carbon films can be arranged into thirteen different multistable forms through imaging of the atoms. Thus, using the vocabulary of modernist realism, we could conclude that Democritean atoms never existed, or using the vocabulary of social constructionism, we could say that the ancient “scientific objects—Democritus's atoms” have disappeared to be replaced in the nineteenth century by Rutherfordian mini–solar system atoms and today again replaced by quantum structures. Or we could turn postphenomenological and note that through improved new instrumental technologies, we can now mediatedly “see” the carbon structures noted. What has changed with both Democritus and Rutherford are lifeworlds in which objects, knowledge production, and human–world interrelationships have been superseded.<br>

Article Title: Ethics and Religion in Continental Philosophy<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: We at SPEP have never been modern and have made a good living off the critique of modernism and of its binary oppositions. But I think that the business as usual of Continental philosophy will have to be expanded to include a critique of the opposition of the human and the nonhuman, of
            physisandtechne, and of “Continental philosophy” and “science.” For the truth is that we have been a party to the science wars. That is why I think that the work of Catherine Malabou is exactly the sort of work that SPEP and Continental philosophy generally will have to do in the future.
                  We have yet to admit how deeply inscribed the human is in the nonhuman and the technical. We have yet to appreciate that being-in-the-world is not only historicized, gendered, and incarnate but also both a neural and a galactic event, of both microscopic and macroscopic proportions. Can it be of no interest to “philosophy,” can there be nothing to “wonder” about, that our bodies are literally made of stardust? We have yet to realize how deeply interwoven is the imagination of speculative physics with the wonder of the philosophers. If the best we can do is to protect our turf by saying that science does not think, the sciences will steal our thunder, that is, our wonder, right out from under us. Science does think, and science wonders, because wonder is the piety of thought. That is a matter to which SPEP, and Continental philosophers generally, whether they have taken a theological turn or are running in the opposite direction, should give more thought.36

Article Title: Recovering Hyperbole:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.45.4.issue-4<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Adopting a hyperbolic perspective is also certainly a way to argue as well as a way to examine other “texts” because it is a trope and figure of thought that reveals those moments within discourse when one is attempting to transcend the bounds of reality because the extraordinary nature of a given situation or subject matter requires the use of an excessive prophetic voice or an ardent polemical exaggeration. As Mileur posits, “The work is a hyperbole, the intersection of other hyperboles, and the subject is, insofar as he can be written about at all, another hyperbole” (1990, 86). Rather than circumventing it, understanding hyperbole as the focus of thought and action can create significant moments of
      inventioas well aselocutiofor the hyperbolist and critic alike. By approaching a particular text, a critical term, and even a piece of criticism itself from a hyperbolic perspective, one might (re)consider and (re)interpret these “texts” as a stretching of discursive limits that leads one toward a re-presentation of the extraordinary—an attempt to communicate the ineffable or transgress the expressible.<br>

Issue: shaw.34.1.issue-1<br>

Author(s): Einsohn Howard Ira<br>
Abstract: Moreover, the astute logician in Shaw sees the newborn child as a commissioned envoy of divinity, whether that divinity is understood as the Judeo-Christian God, the Shavian Life Force, or the equivalent in some other belief system. Using the Christian sacrament of Baptism as a dispositive case in point, Shaw, always the cogent syllogist, argues that “if God is the Father of all men, and if the child is the father to man, it follows then that the true representative of God at the christening is the child itself.”
         
               Hence, from Shaw's considered viewpoint, if we seek the Kingdom of Heaven, we need not scour the galaxy frenetically. Instead, we should look no further than ourselves, for in each of us dwell effervescent particles of the same numen that breathes life into inert matter. In sum, for Shaw, every conception is immaculate,42
            
               and every child is a living incarnation of the primeval goodness that bathes the universe.43<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: What is more pertinent to utopian studies in classical rhetorical inventio is the division of compositions into three main genres: forensic, deliberative, and epideictic. The division is a matter of
         whenthe event in question has taken place. Deliberative rhetoric urges plans or policies for the future. Forensic rhetoric makes a judgment about past events. And epideictic, the rhetoric of praise and blame, celebrates the values of the audience in order to meld people together into a whole—for example, a nation or a community. As with any system of genres, a single text may overlap in two or more categories. A utopian rhetoric can be defined with reference to these terms as well. Because utopia is an imagined society that currently resides in no time and no place, except perhaps as a fiction, it lends itself to use in deliberative rhetoric about reform: The future imagined as a utopia can be used in arguments for shaping the future. On the other hand, if utopia is imagined in the past, like the subject matter of judicial rhetoric, we may have a golden age place, a conservative utopia. But perhaps most pervasively, utopia is the playground of epideictic persuasion, the category that includes ceremonial speeches, preaching, and a great deal of campaign rhetoric. For some scholars of rhetoric, epideictic also includes teaching.
               All of these types of rhetoric praise values that are considered the ideals of a society or group and blame competing values that would cause divisiveness.7<br>

Article Title: The Meta-Utopian Metatext:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 10 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: This opposition between the static and the dynamic—and the triumph of the latter in
         Finnegans Wake—is modeled by Sheldon Brivic in terms of Joyce's symbolic uses of gender within the novel: “The male story enacts conflict and decline, but the female one may be seen as showing discovery and development that proceed through the disintegration of the discourse of patriarchal coherence.”
               Yet one might suggest not so much that the novel is about gender difference as that it deploys gender difference to symbolize the dichotomy between the static and dynamic historical perspectives upon which it reflects. Brivic admits that his feminist reading of156
            Finnegans Wakeshould not claim to reveal the novel's “ultimate or real meaning”—and if (as he writes) the novel represents “history as progress through literary work” in a way that offers “freedom through the disintegration of stable identity,”
               then it may be that, in order to engage with that progressive idealism, such determining terminologies as157
            feminism—orUtopianism, for that matter—and all of the categorical polarizations they involve might no longer seem particularly relevant. A static Utopia has no need for Utopianists (perfect worlds do not need dreamers); and a dynamic Utopia—a world populated by such aspirants—would have no need for such deterministic, static, and outmoded categorizations. A progressive Utopia must be unfinished; it is not a state but a perpetual coming-into-state in which all of its subjects continue to dream, to hope, to aspire. This work of progress is, likeFinnegans Wake, an unendingwork in progress. It may at first seem incongruous that this Utopia of unceasing movement is also the Utopia of real, material place, but it is clear that one of the defining characteristics of material reality is that it never stays still.<br>

Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: Coming from the Latin
         decidere, “to cut off,” “by giving the victory to one side or the other” in a choice or conflict,decidecan have no truck with “both/and.” In point of fact, ethical behavior requires that the ambivalence of extreme relativism and radical subjectivity be overcome so that something like provisional certainty can arise, such as utopian imagination requires and projects. It does not matter that such certainty may be short-lived. The value of Utopia for imagining superior conditions resides in its vocation for doing so, even if time and necessity must always defeat attempts at total application: life lived will always attempt to play itself out in the loosest conformity with the prescriptions of any plan or social project (even in the face of violence).<br>
