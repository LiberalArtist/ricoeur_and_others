  Britain at War: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1c6v89n">Mourning Animals</a><br>
  Author(s) KEAN HILDA<br>
  Abstract: In recent decades when contested invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq have resulted in human and nonhuman animal combatant and civilian war dead—and massive demonstrations against such adventures—the British remain obsessed with commemorating the Second World War. The 1939–45 war has remained as a “good” war in public memory. Despite—or perhaps because of—the passing of the years new memorials have been erected to discrete groups of humans previously not specifically commemorated. These include one to firefighters near St. Paul’s Cathedral (which they helped to ensure was not destroyed by fire), one to women in the site<br>

  CHAPTER 2  Of Madeleines, Mothers, and Montjouvain from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt4qt">Intimate Domain</a><br>
  Abstract: My route forward with Proust begins with the madeleine. Girard cites the madeleine as a preliminary revelation for Proust—a “first glimmer of novelistic grace” for the novel that is to come—and Kristeva also begins her reflections on Proust with the madeleine.¹ However, because Kristeva draws out elements of this metaphor of which Girard takes no notice after he sets aside his early interest in affective memory and sensory experience, her observations can enhance Girard’s mimetic theory. Reflecting on the madeleine from a perspective grounded in Kristeva’s corporeal hermeneutics, I demonstrate how an augmented mimetic theory can offer a<br>

  Book Title: Memory Work-Anne Truitt and Sculpture<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): de Baca Miguel<br>
  Abstract: Memory Workdemonstrates the evolution of the pioneering minimalist sculptor Anne Truitt. An artist determined to make her way through a new aesthetic in the 1960s, Truitt was tireless in her pursuit of a strong cultural voice. At the heart of her practice was the key theme of memory, which enabled her not only to express personal experience but also to address how perception was changing for a contemporary viewership. She gravitated toward the idea that an object in one's focus could unleash a powerful return to the past through memory, which in turn brings a fresh, even critical, attention to the present moment. In addition to the artist's own popular published writings, which detail the unique challenges facing female artists,Memory Workdraws on unpublished manuscripts, private recordings, and never-before-seen working drawings to validate Truitt's original ideas about the link between perception and mnemonic reference in contemporary art. De Baca offers an insider's view of the artist's unstinting efforts to realize her artistic vision, as well as the cultural, political, and historical resonances her oeuvre has for us today.<br>

                  The Thought of Musicmight seem to indicate a primarily conceptual orientation, something that has been strongly evident in the preceding chapters. Chapter 1 concerned itself with conceptual questions directly by focusing on ideas, and the succeeding two chapters continued that concern by focusing on language, which, insofar as it makes sense—and it doesn’t always—is permeated with conceptuality. But music is obviously also a sensory medium. Music thinks in feelings, and thinking about music and with music must take account of that.

  Abstract: Both modernity and its artistic offshoot, modernism, famously involve skepticism and confusion, widespread unintelligibility and the negation of meaning. A few iconic names make the point nicely: Schoenberg. Joyce. Eliot. Picasso. Time may long since have blunted their radical edge, but the memory remains sharp. How, then, does either modernism or modernity fit, except as a tragic or celebratory passage away from bygone clarities and promises, in a historically sensitive theory of interpretation? Is a hermeneutics of the modern and the modernist possible?<br>

  CHAPTER 5  Heroes and Ancestors from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pnztv">After the Massacre</a><br>
  Abstract: Ancestors and ghosts are not the only categories of death found in Vietnamese domestic ritual space. In traditional times, these two categories might have been sufficient for conceptually organizing the cosmological mirror of the living world. The rise of the modern nation-state, however, has added a novel category of death to the traditional cosmology of death. Called
                  liet siin Vietnamese, it refers to the heroic death of fallen soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the sacred purpose of protecting the nation. Historians suggest that the institutionalized commemoration of this category constitutes the core of “modern national memory.”¹ In western<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pnztv">After the Massacre</a><br>
  Abstract: The moral identity of mass village war death was ambivalent. It shifted between tragic and heroic, as illustrated by the Ha Gia mass reburial described in the previous chapter. Finding a place for the identity of an individual victim was also uncertain: some believed it should be in the ancestral memorial, whereas some chose its structural opposite. In preparing for a domestic ritual, people imagined that ancestors who experienced tragic death were hesitating between the ancestral shrine and the shrine for ghosts. The memory of mass civilian deaths created relationships with the domain of political hero worship as well as<br>

  CHAPTER 8  The Decomposition of the Cold War from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pnztv">After the Massacre</a><br>
  Abstract: Heroes, ancestors, and ghosts coexist in the village environment. While revolutionary politics and traditional religious heritage separate them, the three social classes in afterlife associate in popular ritual practices. Although they constitute a hierarchy, the hierarchy that structures their relative values varies at different sites of memory. Their status changes between the state war memorial and the community temple, and the war heroes who occupy the symbolic center in the former are relegated to the margins, outside the village ancestors, in the latter. The position of ghosts also shifts in this movement of memories. The memory of tragic death is<br>

  7  Demonstrating History: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1ppj3r">Gatekeepers of the Arab Past</a><br>
  Abstract: The decade that followed the events of July 1952 critically altered the conventional assumptions of post–World War I Egyptian historiography. This impact was obvious. A variety of state-owned media invoked the memory of past events on a daily basis. Indeed, over the years, scholars had been drawn to the extensive usage of the past during the 1950s. Subscribing to the idea that the task of historiography is mainly that of studying shifts in historical representation, they emphasized the changing image of several rulers and popular leaders.¹ Though the issue of changing historical images was the most visible historiographical trait<br>

  Book Title: Rifle Reports-A Story of Indonesian Independence<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Steedly Mary Margaret<br>
  Abstract: On August 17, 1945, Indonesia proclaimed its independence from Dutch colonial rule. Five years later, the Republic of Indonesia was recognized as a unified, sovereign state. The period in between was a time of aspiration, mobilization, and violence, in which nationalists fought to expel the Dutch while also trying to come to grips with the meaning of "independence."
      Rifle Reportsis an ethnographic history of this extraordinary time as it was experienced on the outskirts of the nation among Karo Batak villagers in the rural highlands of North Sumatra. Based on extensive interviews and conversations with Karo veterans,Rifle Reportsinterweaves personal and family memories, songs and stories, memoirs and local histories, photographs and monuments, to trace the variously tangled and perhaps incompletely understood ways that Karo women and men contributed to the founding of the Indonesian nation. The routes they followed are divergent, difficult, sometimes wavering, and rarely obvious, but they are clearly marked with the signs of gender. This innovative historical study of nationalism and decolonization is an anthropological exploration of the gendering of wartime experience, as well as an inquiry into the work of storytelling as memory practice and ethnographic genre.<br>

  CHAPTER 7  The Memory Artist from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt2jcbst">Rifle Reports</a><br>
  Abstract: News from afar sometimes seems to bear an uncanny resemblance to one’s own remembered past. This is not because of the banal redundancy of events but because of memory’s interpretive reach and its inclination to refurbish itself in contemporary designs and novel images. In 1994, when I was collecting these stories, horrifying pictures of ethnic violence from around the world seemed to appear nightly on the television news. In central Africa, roadways were filled with thousands of starving, desperate people traveling toward unknown destinations. This made a big impression on my Karo informants. “That’s exactly how it was here,” they<br>

  Abstract: Late Second Temple period scholarship is premised on the belief that Jews of the time thought about the past differently from the way we do. Their knowledge was rooted in traditional legends and communal bonds; ours is data-driven, self-critical, and context-free. Both statements—history is subjective and situation-dependent, and history is objective and situation-transcendent—provoke ambivalence because both are partly but not absolutely true.

  Abstract: Early rabbinic literature poses special challenges to social memory theory and its application that are in some ways very different from those posed by the New Testament and the search for the “historical Jesus.” Conversely, early rabbinic literature provides exceptional opportunities for examining the relation between the practice and theory of collective memory in relation to the formation and maintenance of social identity. In what follows I will attend to both these challenges and opportunities (typically the flip side of one another) through the analysis of specific rabbinic texts that both thematize and practice collective memory in the face of<br>

  Prolegomena on the Textualization of Mark’s Gospel: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1287n36">Memory and Identity in Ancient Judaism and Early Christianity</a><br>
  Author(s) Keith Chris<br>
  Abstract: One of the defining characteristics of Barry Schwartz’s substantial contributions to social memory studies is his consistent insistence that researchers should avoid being more skeptical about the connections between the past and the present than is warranted (inter alia, Schwartz 1982, 395–96; Zhang and Schwartz 1997, 189–91, 196–97, 205–8). This theme has also featured prominently in Schwartz’s interdisciplinary contributions to biblical studies. In one of his early contributions, he argued against overly cynical skepticism in Gospels scholarship (Schwartz 2005, 47–54; see also 2011, 225–26, 230–34), and his introductory essay to this volume continues<br>

  Author(s) Brickle Jeffrey E.<br>
  Abstract: Barry Schwartz’s introduction to the present volume invites reflection on how social memory theory might illuminate the origins and context of the Johannine corpus. Conceiving of John as a cultural “memorian” (to borrow Jan Assmann’s term; 1997, 21) contrasts sharply with a tenaciously held view that portrays the author of the Fourth Gospel as a solitary, mystical purveyor of largely independent and idiosyncratic traditions transmitted within a relatively closed sectarian community. Schwartz’s provocative and insightful memory research compels one to reexamine John’s plausible network of associations and attempt to explain how these associations might relate to the occasion and nature<br>

  Abstract: The shifting significance of Abraham Lincoln in American memory since his assassination in 1865 (see Schwartz 2000, 2008) is analogous to the varying—and so variable—interpretations of Jesus’ suffering throughout the last two millennia. The present essay surveys how the author of Luke-Acts employs traditions from the Psalms to provide an appropriate interpretation of Jesus’ crucifixion. First, we will briefly survey Barry Schwartz’s model of social memory as “keying,” in which the past is matched to the present. Second, we will examine the function of quotations, allusions, and/or echoes of the Psalms within the speeches of Acts that help<br>

  Author(s) Schwartz Barry<br>
  Abstract: Memory’s fallibility is well documented; its powers, less so. Acknowledging the evidential traces that all significant events leave behind, the preceding essays in this volume make memory’s credibility more evident. How ironic it is that so much ink has been spilled on social memory’s incidental functions—the forgetting or ignoring of wrongdoing, legitimating and challenging power, exaggerating and underestimating beneficent acts, giving voice to the marginalized—while its major function, to bring us into more direct contact with the past, the very capacity that gives memory its survival value, has led to nothing significant in the way of theoretical explication.<br>

In one of his early contributions, he argued against overly cynical skepticism in Gospels scholarship (Schwartz 2005, 47–54; see also 2011, 225–26, 230–34), and his introductory essay to this volume continues<br>

  Author(s) Brickle Jeffrey E.<br>
  Abstract: Barry Schwartz’s introduction to the present volume invites reflection on how social memory theory might illuminate the origins and context of the Johannine corpus. Conceiving of John as a cultural “memorian” (to borrow Jan Assmann’s term; 1997, 21) contrasts sharply with a tenaciously held view that portrays the author of the Fourth Gospel as a solitary, mystical purveyor of largely independent and idiosyncratic traditions transmitted within a relatively closed sectarian community. Schwartz’s provocative and insightful memory research compels one to reexamine John’s plausible network of associations and attempt to explain how these associations might relate to the occasion and nature<br>

  Abstract: The shifting significance of Abraham Lincoln in American memory since his assassination in 1865 (see Schwartz 2000, 2008) is analogous to the varying—and so variable—interpretations of Jesus’ suffering throughout the last two millennia. The present essay surveys how the author of Luke-Acts employs traditions from the Psalms to provide an appropriate interpretation of Jesus’ crucifixion. First, we will briefly survey Barry Schwartz’s model of social memory as “keying,” in which the past is matched to the present.

  Abstract: Memory’s fallibility is well documented; its powers, less so. Acknowledging the evidential traces that all significant events leave behind, the preceding essays in this volume make memory’s credibility more evident. How ironic it is that so much ink has been spilled on social memory’s incidental functions—the forgetting or ignoring of wrongdoing, legitimating and challenging power, exaggerating and underestimating beneficent acts, giving voice to the marginalized—while its major function, to bring us into more direct contact with the past, the very capacity that gives memory its survival value, has led to nothing significant in the way of theoretical explication.<br>

  Abstract: Biblical studies has long been concerned with aspects of what is now called “cultural memory,” especially in the form of a preoccupation with tradition history.¹ Yet even though the major theorists of tradition history were active at the same time that Maurice Halbwachs and Aby Warburg were developing their ideas about cultural memory in society and art, there is no evidence of intellectual cross-fertilization.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1287n36">Memory and Identity in Ancient Judaism and Early Christianity</a><br>
  Author(s) Fraade Steven D.<br>
  Abstract: Early rabbinic literature poses special challenges to social memory theory and its application that are in some ways very different from those posed by the New Testament and the search for the “historical Jesus.” Conversely, early rabbinic literature provides exceptional opportunities for examining the relation between the practice and theory of collective memory in relation to the formation and maintenance of social identity. In what follows I will attend to both these challenges and opportunities (typically the flip side of one another) through the analysis of specific rabbinic texts that both thematize and practice collective memory in the face of<br>

  Author(s) Kirk Alan<br>
  Abstract: Tradition and memory are distinct yet somehow cognate phenomena, and Synoptic scholarship going back to the form critics has struggled with how properly to construe their relationship. The work of Barry Schwartz and Jan Assmann on social and cultural aspects of memory, and of experimental psychologists on its cognitive aspects, provides a framework for reconceptualizing and potentially resolving the vexed problem of the memory–tradition nexus. But the exploitation of memory research in Gospels scholarship has been scattershot and fragmentary, often ill-informed or selectively employed in special pleading.

  1  Senses of Place: from:

  Abstract: In “Place, Pastness, Poems,” Seamus Heaney quotes this passage from T.S. Eliot’s “Little Gidding” to support his view that in lieu of a cultural center the literary tradition is what links “the private experience of a poet to the usual life of the age.”¹ For Heaney, tradition allows the regional poet to affirm the centrality of local experience to his own being, but with the hope of making that experience accessible to readers from wholly different walks of life. Ideally, by raising private experience to the level of cultural expression, Heaney would have tradition transform personal memory into cultural memory.<br>

  Abstract: Any study of the past is in some sense a study about memory The past is gone irretrievably; but memories remain, providing us with information and yielding meaning about past events. Even historical sources apparently created “on the spot” are the creations of memory; a general’s account, a newspaper report, and a descriptive letter are all created after the events that they recount. Memory is thus inherent in any historical study Though there is certainly a difference between a memory of five hours and a memory of fifty years, it is not always clear how this difference is manifest; the<br>

But if a community educates only in the Torah, it may also do a disservice to its members. It may nourish them to fixity, to stability that becomes rigidity, to a kind of certitude that believes all of the important questions are settled.

  Abstract: Toward the end of his reflective philosophical journal
                  The Inward Morning, Henry Bugbee recalls a searing moment in the mid-Pacific during World War II when he served as captain of a minesweeper.² He recalls bringing down kamikaze pilots close enough that he and the crew of his small vessel could see the incoming pilots face-to-face. As that memory floods his present consciousness, he asks, pen in hand and eight years later, if it is not true that “we were not enemies,” though by all accounts they would have been. And he follows by asking how, if “we were not enemies,”<br>

  Book Title: For Derrida-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Miller J. Hillis<br>
  Abstract: This book-the culmination of forty years of friendship between J. Hillis Miller and Jacques Derrida, during which Miller also closely followed all Derrida's writings and seminars-is for Derridain two senses. It is for him,dedicated to his memory. The chapters also speak, in acts of reading, as advocates for Derrida's work. They focus especially on Derrida's late work, including passages from the last, as yet unpublished, seminars. The chapters are partial to Derrida,on his side, taking his part, gratefully submitting themselves to the demand made by Derrida's writings to be read-slowly, carefully, faithfully, with close attention to semantic detail.The chapters do not progress forward to tell a sequential story. They are, rather, a series of perspectives on the heterogeneity of Derrida's work, or forays into that heterogeneity.The chief goal has been, to borrow a phrase from Wallace Stevens, plainly to propoundwhat Derrida says. The book aims, above all, to render Derrida's writings justice. It should be remembered, however, that, according to Derrida himself, every rendering of justice is also a transformative interpretation. A book like this one is not a substitute for reading Derrida for oneself. It is to be hoped that it will encourage readers to do just that.<br>

  Book Title: Saintly Influence: Edith Wyschogrod and the Possibilities of Philosophy of Religion-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): KAVKA MARTIN<br>
  Abstract: Since the publication of her first book, Emmanuel Levinas: The Problem of Ethical Metaphysics, in 1974-the first book about Levinas published in English-Edith Wyschogrod has been at the forefront of the fields of Continental philosophy and philosophy of religion. Her work has crossed many disciplinary boundaries, making peregrinations from phenomenology and moral philosophy to historiography, the history of religions (both Western and non-Western), aesthetics, and the philosophy of biology. In all of these discourses, she has sought to cultivate an awareness of how the self is situated and influenced, as well as the ways in which a self can influence others.In this volume, twelve scholars examine and display the influence of Wyschogrod's work in essays that take up the thematics of influence in a variety of contexts: Christian theology, the saintly behavior of the villagers of Le Chambon sur Lignon, the texts of the medieval Jewish mystic Abraham Abulafia, the philosophies of Levinas, Derrida, and Benjamin, the practice of intellectual history, the cultural memory of the New Testament, and pedagogy.In response, Wyschogrod shows how her interlocutors have brought to light her multiple authorial personae and have thus marked the ambiguity of selfhood, its position at the nexus of being influenced by and influencing others.<br>

In all of these discourses, she has sought to cultivate an awareness of how the self is situated and influenced, as well as the ways in which a self can influence others.In this volume, twelve scholars examine and display the influence of Wyschogrod's work in essays that take up the thematics of influence in a variety of contexts: Christian theology, the saintly behavior of the villagers of Le Chambon sur Lignon, the texts of the medieval Jewish mystic Abraham Abulafia, the philosophies of Levinas, Derrida, and Benjamin, the practice of intellectual history, the cultural memory of the New Testament, and pedagogy.In response, Wyschogrod shows how her interlocutors have brought to light her multiple authorial personae and have thus marked the ambiguity of selfhood, its position at the nexus of being influenced by and influencing others.<br>

  Author(s): Burrell David B.<br>
  Abstract: How do Catholic intellectuals draw on faith in their work? And how does their work as scholars influence their lives as people of faith?For more than a generation, the University of Dayton has invited a prominent Catholic intellectual to present the annual Marianist Award Lecture on the general theme of the encounter of faith and profession. Over the years, the lectures have become central to the Catholic conversation about church, culture, and society.In this book, ten leading figures explore the connections in their own lives between the private realms of faith and their public calling as teachers, scholars, and intellectuals.This last decade of Marianist Lectures brings together theologians and philosophers, historians, anthropologists, academic scholars, and lay intellectuals and critics.Here are Avery Cardinal Dulles, S.J., on the tensions between faith and theology in his career; Jill Ker Conway on the spiritual dimensions of memory and personal narrative; Mary Ann Glendon on the roots of human rights in Catholic social teaching; Mary Douglas on the fruitful dialogue between religion and anthropology in her own life; Peter Steinfels on what it really means to be a liberal Catholic; and Margaret O'Brien Steinfels on the complicated history of women in today's church. From Charles Taylor and David Tracy on the fractured relationship between Catholicism and modernity to Gustavo Gutirrez on the enduring call of the poor and Marcia Colish on the historic links between the church and intellectual freedom, these essays track a decade of provocative, illuminating, and essential thought. James L. Heft, S.M., is President and Founding Director of the Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies and University Professor of Faith and Culture and Chancellor, University of Dayton.

  Author(s) Loskota Brie<br>
  Abstract: Organized religion in the United States is on the threshold of a seismic shift. Today, religious and community leaders are witnessing a crisis in the transmission of religious memory, practice, and tradition to the next generation. In major urban centers across the United States, there is a generalized perception that individuals in their twenties and early thirties constitute a “black hole” in congregational life. Members of the young-adult population are simply missing from most churches, synagogues, and mosques. Religious and community leaders are given to lamenting about the throngs of young people who are “spiritual but not religious” as a<br>

  Book Title: Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness traces the reflections of the French philosopher and musicologist Vladimir Jankelevitch on the conditions and temporality of forgiveness in relation to creation, history, and memory. The author demonstrates the influence of Jewish and Christian thought on Jankelevitch's philosophy and compares his ideas about the gift character of forgiveness, the role of retributive emotions in conceptions of justice, and the limits of reason with those of Aristotle, Butler, Kant, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Scheler, Arendt, Derrida, Levinas, and Ricoeur. The Shoah was the pivotal historical event in Jankelevitch's life. As this book shows, Jankelevitch's question "Is forgiveness possible as a response to evil?" remains a potent philosophical conundrum today. Paradoxically, for Jankelevitch, evil is both the impetus and the obstacle to forgiveness.<br>

  Book Title: Gender and Nation in Meiji Japan-Modernity, Loss, and the Doing of History<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Karlin Jason G.<br>
  Abstract: Gender and Nation in Meiji Japan is a historical analysis of the discourses of nostalgia in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Japan. Through an analysis of the experience of rapid social change in Japan’s modernization, it argues that fads (ryūkō) and the desires they express are central to understanding Japanese modernity, conceptions of gender, and discourses of nationalism. In doing so, the author uncovers the myth of eternal return that lurks below the surface of Japanese history as an expression of the desire to find meaning amid the chaos and alienation of modern times. The Meiji period (1868–1912) was one of rapid change that hastened the process of forgetting: The state’s aggressive program of modernization required the repression of history and memory. However, repression merely produced new forms of desire seeking a return to the past, with the result that competing or alternative conceptions of the nation haunted the history of modern Japan. Rooted in the belief that the nation was a natural and organic entity that predated the rational, modern state, such conceptions often were responses to modernity that envisioned the nation in opposition to the modern state. What these visions of the nation shared was the ironic desire to overcome the modern condition by seeking the timeless past. While the condition of their repression was often linked to the modernizing policies of the Meiji state, the means for imagining the nation in opposition to the state required the construction of new symbols that claimed the authority of history and appealed to a rearticulated tradition. Through the idiom of gender and nation, new reified representations of continuity, timelessness, and history were fashioned to compensate for the unmooring of inherited practices from the shared locales of everyday life. This book examines the intellectual, social, and cultural factors that contributed to the rapid spread of Western tastes and styles, along with the backlash against Westernization that was expressed as a longing for the past. By focusing on the expressions of these desires in popular culture and media texts, it reveals how the conflation of mother, countryside, everyday life, and history structured representations to naturalize ideologies of gender and nationalism.<br>

  Abstract: Does Douglas Coupland’s fiction ‘speak’ with ‘a voice from nowhere’? Is he a Canadian who strategically chooses to write with a US accent, an involuntary American novelist who happens to hold a Canadian passport or a writer whose narrative concerns transcend national boundaries? The anonymous narrator of Coupland’s short story, ‘In the Desert’ (1994), a wanderer lost in the scorched American wilderness, makes revealing connections between the simulated, late twentieth-century ‘electronic dream’ of shared televisual memory and the dubious coherence of his own life story.

Gazing at the enigmatic landscape, the writer lists places that, apart from the colonial act of naming, appear to be untainted by human intervention (‘Hudson Bay and the Ungava Peninsula, Ellesmere Island, Baffin Island’) and starts the work of rethinking his own relationship with geography. Cocooned in the memory of one or many aeroplane cabins – an interchangeable tourist space emblematic of modernity’s uninhibited penchant for constant motion – Coupland attempts to connect the knowable and malleable (sub)urban reality<br>

Thatcher, who sketches the essential evolution of classic memory arts through Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, and Quintilian—a craft extended and further developed in the Middle Ages—posits that John fashioned his Gospel by means of established Greco-Roman organizational devices and structures designed to aid the memory,<br>

  Abstract: In the field of history, the practice of analyzing (and utilizing) images began in the 1990s, with classifications and typologies. The sensorial shock of an image can both influence the course of one’s life and change one’s perception of history. With respect to the end of the Algerian War, Jean-François Sirinelli rightly asks, “Do not the shocking photos in

  Abstract: I am less concerned with untangling the relationship between collective and personal memories, or between memory and history, than with showing once more the reticence on the part of the French academic “ nomenclature” to integrate the colony into discussions, notably, at a time of public debate on the slave trade, slavery, and colonialism. Critical and negative reactions have abounded with respect to what have often been considered poor “ group” manners, namely, the demand to be considered equal among equals.

  Abstract: Since the Middle Ages, Saladin has been one of the most influential figures of historical memory in Eurasia. He was used as a symbol of the noble enemy, of war with the West and Israel, and of peace.¹ In various incarnations he was also a national hero. During the Lebanon War of 2006, even Nasrallah, the Shi‘i leader of the Hizbullah in Lebanon, was eulogized by Syrians as the “Saladin of the modern age.”² Moreover, after the fall of Saddam Hussein, the Sunni

  Author(s): Diagne Souleymane Bachir<br>
  Abstract: Jean Godefroy Bidima's La Palabre examines the traditional African institution of palaver as a way to create dialogue and open exchange in an effort to resolve conflict and promote democracy. In the wake of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commissions and the gacaca courts in Rwanda, Bidima offers a compelling model of how to develop an African public space where dialogue can combat misunderstanding. This volume, which includes other essays on legal processes, cultural diversity, memory, and the internet in Africa, offers English-speaking readers the opportunity to become acquainted with a highly original and important postcolonial thinker.<br>

  Abstract: In a recent exchange in the journal
                  Environmental Ethics, David Abram and Ted Toadvine engage in a spirited debate about questions of sensuousness, perception, reflection, writing, memory, and landscape. Focused on their conflicting interpretations of Abram’s popular bookThe Spell of the Sensuous(1996), and eventually resting on their divergent readings of Merleau-Ponty’sPhenomenology of Perception(1962),¹ Toadvine and Abram each attempt to address a set of ontological questions that are, I think, foundational for environmental philosophy: How can we understand the human body as a particular site of perceptions of, and interactions with, the more-than-human world?

  Abstract: The work of memory is an ethical act. Among its foci can be the recollection of violence. In 2001, a truth and reconciliation commission, or Comisión de la Verdad y Reconciliación (CVR), was established by the transitional government of Valentín Paniagua to examine atrocities committed during the 1980s and 1990s, when Peru was plagued by the worst violence in its history. The CVR was given a two-year term to produce a rigorous research on the violence. The final report was completed and published in 2003.<br>

  Abstract: In his ethnographic account of the Muslim precept of knowledge in Mayotte, Lambek provides thick descriptive detail regarding the cultural and moral system of behavior, including the imagination of evil. In Mayotte, evil is often personified by a figure that circulates after sunset, dancing on graves in blatant contempt for the memory and space of the departed. Rogue characters of the night go unclothed, walk backward, feast on human waste, disrespect the elderly, mock the living, and are particularly harmful toward children.

  Author(s) WEEDON CHRIS<br>
  Abstract: Recent years have seen the rise of widespread interest in cultural and collective memory and their relation to history, power, voice, identity and representation. This interest is shared by family, local and academic history, museums and community projects and increasingly groups that perceive themselves as marginal to mainstream national and public history. The authors of this chapter have over twenty-five years of experience working with people’s history and community memories. These are areas that we will argue are particularly important in multi-ethnic societies like Wales where they are tied to issues of roots, identity and belonging.<br>

  Abstract: As a temporal disruption, trauma dislocates individuals from the integrated, narrative context of personal memory and collective history.¹ Thrust into the role of survivor, trauma victims often fail to understand and navigate their new position, since trauma initially exists as an absence in the mind.² Following the initial failure to remember, trauma comes to be situated on the margins of consciousness—implicit memory and dreams—as the brain takes on the work of comprehension and meaning making that cannot yet be faced when cognizant.³ Those who emerge into trauma’s

  Abstract: The next three contributions explore the biological and ethological sources of musical meaning and affect. They deal with aspects of musical experience and interpretation by going beyond a mere acoustic description of the sound. Music-as-heard calls forth expressive interpretations and emotions. This is the case for the recognition of tonality and tonal melodies, which are not merely sequences or successions of pitches. Being rooted in biological evolution, they can be linked to the transmission of meaning by establishing a kind of specific connection between perception of sounds, memory function and emotional assessment. The biological foundation of tonality can be related<br>

  Book Title: Locating Cultural Creativity-  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Liep John<br>
  Abstract: The contributors to this volume reexamine the interconnectedness of culture and creativity in an increasingly hybrid world. They argue that while many of the old certainties about high culture and artistic canons may now be disintegrating, culture and creativity themselves are still very much a reflection of social processes involving power and the control of resources. Case studies include youth subcultures in Europe; experimental theatre derived from the Brazilian candomblé dance; the role of memory in mythology among the Pukapukan of Polynesia; the evolution of football and polo in Argentina; gender relations in Algerian raï music; the notion of authenticity in artistic movements in Zanzibar; traditional and modern practices of the Lio in Indonesia; and kula exchange and social movements in the Trobriand Islands in the Pacific.<br>

  Author(s) KLIGER ILYA<br>
  Abstract: The concept of “genre memory,” proposed by Mikhail Bakhtin in the second edition of his book on Dostoevsky from 1963, names one of the most vivid and enigmatic figurations of literary-historical continuity we have. It is of course not the first attempt to think such continuity within the Russian tradition. Almost one hundred years before Bakhtin coined the term, Alexander Veselovsky, the founder of Historical Poetics as a paradigm within literary scholarship, wondered whether “each new poetic epoch [does] not work on images bequeathed from antiquity, being of necessity constrained by their boundaries.”¹ Veselovsky would go on to refine and<br>

  Abstract: Most of the histories examined in the last chapter reconstruct origins and memory with present socio-political ends in mind. All derive from nostalgia for a past and present home, and seek to establish roots and legitimacy by reconstituting a New Caledonian history that guarantees their community its own place, cultural specificity, and centrality. The dialectic between literature and history, between European and New Caledonian homes, refashions the sense of history in these texts: a (hi)story that is more about a distinctive (group), a political message, and an ethical vision of the future than a faithful reproduction of a past society<br>

  Book Title: Memory, Narrative and the Great War-Rifleman Patrick MacGill and the Construction of Wartime Experience<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): Taylor David<br>
  Abstract: Memory, Narrative and the Great War provides a detailed examination of the varied and complex war writings of a relatively marginal figure, Patrick MacGill, within a general framework of our current pre-occupation with blood, mud and suffering. In particular, it seeks to explain how his interpretation of war shifted from the heroic wartime autobiographical trilogy, with its emphasis on 'the romance of the rifleman' to the pessimistic and guilt-ridden interpretations in his post-war novel, Fear!, and play, Suspense. Through an exploration of the way in which war-time experiences were remembered (and re-remembered) and retold in strikingly different narratives, and using insights from cognitive psychology, it is argued that there is no contradiction between these two seemingly opposing views. Instead it is argued that, given the present orientation and problem-solving nature of both memory and narrative, the different interpretations are both 'true' in the sense that they throw light on the ongoing way in which MacGill came to terms with his experiences of war. This in turn has implications for broader interpretations of the Great War, which has increasingly be seen in terms of futile suffering, not least because of the eloquent testimony of ex-Great War soldiers, reflecting on their experiences many years after the event. Without suggesting that such testimony is invalid, it is argued that this is one view but not the only view of the war. Rather wartime memory and narrative is more akin to an ever-changing kaleidoscope, in which pieces of memory take on different (but equally valid) shapes as they are shaken with the passing of time.<br>

  Abstract: This book explores how South Africa is negotiating its past in and through various modes of performance in contemporary theatre, public events and memorial spaces. It analyses the Truth and Reconciliation Commission as a live event, as an archive, and in various theatrical engagements with it, asking throughout how the TRC has affected the definition of identity and memory in contemporary South Africa, including disavowed memories. Hutchison then considers how the SA-Mali Timbuktu Manuscript Project and the 2010 South African World Cup opening ceremony attempted to restage the nation in their own ways. She investigates how the Voortrekker Monument and Freedom Park embody issues related to memory in contemporary South Africa. She also analyses current renegotiations of popular repertoires, particularly songs and dances related to the Struggle, revivals of classic European and South African protest plays, new history plays and specific racial and ethnic histories and identities.<br>

  Abstract: Bakiner demonstrates how truth commissions have recovered basic facts about human rights violations, forced societies to rethink the violence and exclusion of nation building, and produced a new dynamic whereby the state seeks to legitimize its central position between history and politics by accepting a high degree of societal penetration into the production and diffusion of official national history. By doing so, truth commissions have challenged and transformed public discourses on memory, truth, justice, reconciliation, recognition, nationalism, and political legitimacy in the contemporary world.<br>

In their task of making up for lost memory – that is, for the loss of ways of thinking, as well as for the passing of successive eras – archives carry out their functions incompletely. Archives mark what has been lost in their preservation of remnants that remain incomplete in what we imagine to be their testimony to a much fuller moment. Can we think of archives as time machines that bring us into direct contact with the documents and relics of a forgotten age? Or do<br>

  Book Title: Moments of Silence-Authenticity in the Cultural Expressions of the Iran-Iraq War, 1980-1988<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Vatanabadi Shouleh<br>
  Abstract: The Iran-Iraq War was the longest conventional war of the 20th century. The memory of it may have faded in the wake of more recent wars in the region, but the harrowing facts remain: over one million soldiers and civilians dead, millions more permanently displaced and disabled, and an entire generation marked by prosthetic implants and teenage martyrdom. These same facts have been instrumentalized by agendas both foreign and domestic, but also aestheticized, defamiliarized, readdressed and reconciled by artists, writers, and filmmakers across an array of identities: linguistic (Arabic, Persian, Kurdish), religious (Shiite, Sunni, atheist), and political (Iranian, Iraqi, internationalist). Official discourses have unsurprisingly tried to dominate the process of production and distribution of war narratives. In doing so, they have ignored and silenced other voices.Centering on novels, films, memoirs, and poster art that gave aesthetic expression to the Iran-Iraq War, the essays gathered in this volume present multiple perspectives on the war's most complex and underrepresented narratives. These scholars do not naively claim to represent an authenticity lacking in official discourses of the war, but rather, they call into question the notion of authenticity itself. Finding, deciding upon, and creating a language that can convey any sort of truth at all-collective, national, or private-is the major preoccupation of the texts and critiques in this diverse collection.<br>

  Author(s) RASTEGAR KAMRAN<br>
  Abstract: Questions of ideological dedication are perhaps most fraught within the context of war. Memory discourse, in particular on the memory of war and its traumas, is often a legitimating instrument in the contest to elaborate who serves as hero and who as traitor during the war and afterward. In post-revolutionary Iran, the onset of the Iran-Iraq War allowed for the articulation of new if shifting parameters for ideological commitment and heroism, as well as treachery or cowardice. The evolution of the “sacred defense” concept allowed for the most articulate elaboration of these binaries, and wartime and postwar cultural producers, bureaucrats,<br>

  Abstract: “Early cinema is a global cinema.” “National cinema only appears later in film history.” I would endorse both these statements as important historical principles, and might restate them, borrowing a phrase from my colleague Michael Raine, one of the finest historians of Japanese cinema, as “cinema was international before it was national”. However, immediately a flurry of problems intervene, mainly dealing with terminology. What do we mean by: “global”, “international” or even “national”?

  Book Title: Narration, Identity, and Historical Consciousness-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Straub Jürgen<br>
  Abstract: A generally acknowledged characteristic of modern life, namely the temporalization of experience, inextricable from our intensified experience of contingency and difference, has until now remained largely outside psychology's purview. Wherever questions about the development, structure, and function of the concept of time have been posed - for example by Piaget and other founders of genetic structuralism - they have been concerned predominantly with concepts of "physical", chronometrical time, and related concepts (e.g., "velocity"). All the contributions to the present volume attempt to close this gap. A larger number are especially interested in the narration of stories. Overviews of the relevant literature, as well as empirical case studies, appear alongside theoretical and methodological reflections.

  Book Title: Narration, Identity, and Historical Consciousness-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Straub Jürgen<br>
  Abstract: A generally acknowledged characteristic of modern life, namely the temporalization of experience, inextricable from our intensified experience of contingency and difference, has until now remained largely outside psychology's purview. Wherever questions about the development, structure, and function of the concept of time have been posed - for example by Piaget and other founders of genetic structuralism - they have been concerned predominantly with concepts of "physical", chronometrical time, and related concepts (e.g., "velocity"). All the contributions to the present volume attempt to close this gap. A larger number are especially interested in the narration of stories. Overviews of the relevant literature, as well as empirical case studies, appear alongside theoretical and methodological reflections. Most contributions refer to specifically historical phenomena and meaning-constructions. Some touch on the subjects of biographical memory and biographical constructions of reality.

  Book Title: Recollections of France-Memories, Identities and Heritage in Contemporary France<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Picard Jeanine<br>
  Abstract: Since the 1980s, France has experienced a vigorous revival of interest in its past and cultural heritage. This has been expressed as part of a movement of remembering through museums and festivals as well as via elaborate commemorations, most notably those held to celebrate the bi-centenary of the Revolution in 1989 and can be interpreted as part of a re-examinaton of what it means to be French in the context of ongoing Europeanization. This study brings together scholars from multidisciplinary backgrounds and engages them in debate with professionals from France, who are working in the fields of museology, heritage and cultural production. Addressing subjects such as war and memory, gastronomy and regional identity, maritime culture and urban societies, they throw fresh light on the process by which France has been conceptualized and packaged as a cultural object.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1btbxwz">Recollections of France</a><br>
  Author(s) Reynolds Siân<br>
  Abstract: Is it true, as Pierre Nora claimed in 1984, that memory becomes precious just when it vanishes? ‘On ne parle tant de mémoire que parce qu’il n’y en a plus’. What he seems to mean is not that individuals have forgotten their own past, but that collective repositories of memory – such as the French
                  paysans– have been destroyed or scattered by devastating and rapid change in recent times. Memory as something magical, often tied to physical objects, rituals or sensations, can be contrasted as it is by Nora, with history, which implies critical reflection: memory is poetry, history<br>

  Abstract: Cities, and capital cities in particular, are clearly the central focus for national memory. At the centre of such memory is the manner in which the city space is captured in the shorthand of symbol or mental representation. For example, the city of Paris is most easily represented by certain of the monuments that define its central space, or possibly by less monumental buildings that nonetheless capture the flavour and atmosphere of a particular quarter or

  Abstract: "Identity" has become a core concept of the social and cultural sciences. Bringing together perspectives from sociology, anthropology, psychology, history, and literary criticism, this book offers a comprehensive and critical overview on how this concept is currently used and how it relates to memory and constructions of historical meaning.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1btbzsw">Beyond Rationalism</a><br>
  Author(s) Feldman Allen<br>
  Abstract: At no other time more than in the present day has individual, social and institutional memory come under such concerted pressure, critique and exposure as a fragile foundation for truth and facticity. This current reluctance to authenticate social memory is intimately tied to well-known postmodernist depredations, which profoundly disenchanted the authority of tradition and authenticity, and emptied core institutionalised myths of their temporal and semantic continuity. As institutionalised memory fails to provide overarching master narratives that can win cultural consent, it has also become increasingly disjunctive with previously unnarratable history and experience. Consider the synchronic fictions of recent ethno-histories, the<br>

  Abstract: The wrong place to begin this chapter is with an account of daydreaming through a Daniel Barenboim recital at Symphony Hall in Boston. Perhaps because Barenboim’s playing was routine that evening, I found myself recollecting a concert there forty years prior: the Limeliters, a folk group popular at the dispersal of the fifties and the gathering of the sixties, had been performing. I could, at the Barenboim concert, only vaguely recall roly-poly Glenn Yarbrough, an Irish tenor whose lovely voice sounded to me enough like falsetto to be embarrassing at the time.

  Abstract: Biblical Performance Criticism is a way of understanding the Bible. It is the result of many streams of thought meeting over the last century, including form criticism, oral-tradition studies, rhetorical criticism, narrative criticism, memory studies, media studies, and performance studies. In some way, each of these streams analyzes four elements: (1) someone speaking, (2) someone hearing, (3) a text, and (4) a social situation. Each has contributed to the understanding that the Bible should be read in terms of the interaction of those four elements rather than any one of them in isolation.<br>

  Book Title: Memory-Histories, Theories, Debates<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SCHWARZ BILL<br>
  Abstract: Memory has never been closer to us, yet never more difficult to understand. In the more than thirty specially commissioned essays that make up this book, leading scholars survey the histories, the theories, and the faultlines that compose the field of memory research.The volume reconstructs the work of the great philosophical and literary figures of the last two centuries who recast the concept of memory and brought it into the forefront of the modernist and postmodernist imagination-among them, Bergson, Halbwachs, Freud, Proust, Benjamin, Adorno, Derrida, and Deleuze. Drawing on recent advances in the sciences and in the humanities, the contributors address thequestion of how memory works, highlighting transactions between the interiority of subjective memory and the larger fields of public or collective memory.The public, political life of memory is an increasingly urgent issue in the societies we now inhabit, while the category of memory itself seems to become ever more capacious.Asking how we might think about the politics of memory, the closing chapters explore anumber of defining instances in which the troubled phenomenon of memory has entered and reshaped our very conception of what makes and drives the domain of politics. These include issues of slavery, the Soviet experience, the Holocaust, feminism and recovered memory, and memory in post-apartheid South Africa.<br>

  Introduction: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c999bq">Memory</a><br>
  Author(s) Schwarz Bill<br>
  Abstract: The idea of memory runs through contemporary public life at high voltage, generating polemic and passionate debate in the media, in the spheres of politics and in the academy. Yet although the contemporary “presentness” of memory is evident, how this is to be understood remains a matter of dispute. It is not clear what meanings attach themselves to the generic conception of memory itself; and while in the academy there is a common belief that memory is “everywhere,”¹ what this means remains an open matter.

  Author(s) Carruthers Mary<br>
  Abstract: The so-called “arts of memory,”
                  artes memorandi, which were taught commonly in the curricula of dialectic and rhetoric for roughly two thousand years between the fourth century BCE and the sixteenth century CE, belong to a different psychological country from that of the modern Western, post-Enlightenment “memory” that is the concern of most of the rest of this volume. Of course, there are also complex medieval attitudes and practices regarding history and commemoration of the dead, but it is not with these that theartes memorandiare concerned.¹ Academic redefinitions and reclassifications of the old natural and philosophical sciences, especially<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c999bq">Memory</a><br>
  Author(s) Sherlock Peter<br>
  Abstract: Europe witnessed a revolution in memory during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. By the eighteenth century, the ancient “arts of memory” were archaic. The explosive power of print had made it possible both to archive and to multiply knowledge cheaply and efficiently in books. Oral testimony was increasingly displaced by written records. New bureaucratic structures designed to record information on evergreater numbers of individuals abounded. Scientific discoveries forced a reappraisal of the very nature of the universe, including time as well as space. Most potently of all, social memory was hotly contested as polemicists sought to shape and legitimize the<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter on Bergson and memory I shall focus on two key questions that Henri Bergson sought to establish as the foundation for a philosophical treatment of memory. First, what is the relation between past and present? Is it merely a difference in degree, or it possible to locate the difference between them as one of kind? If we can do the latter, what will this reveal about memory? Second, what is the status of the past? Is it something merely psychological, or might it be possible to ascribe an ontological status to it? In other words, what is<br>

  Abstract: In 1924, the French social scientist Maurice Halbwachs published
                  Les cadres sociaux de la mémoire(On Collective Memory).¹ Its publication was immediately seen by his contemporaries as a major event, its importance acknowledged even by those who did not fully share his theoretical views. Prophetically, the historian Marc Bloch saw the analyses presented by Halbwachs in this book as a major contribution to the developing discipline of social science.

  Author(s) Terdiman Richard<br>
  Abstract: In the modern period, memory seems caught in a distinctive form of crisis. We could think of modernity’s “memory” as involving two contrary mismatches between recollection and its object. Memory is either frustrated by insufficiency, or it is cursed with exaggeration:

  Author(s) Wood Michael<br>
  Abstract: “And no one will ever know, not even oneself, the melody that had been pursuing one with its elusive and delectable rhythm.”² Underneath these words, probably written in 1909 and certainly part of a draft of what was to become
                  À la recherche du temps perdu, Proust wrote “Finish there.”³ The melody is a missing memory; and memory itself, in Proust, repeatedly appears as a melody. The analogy helps us, I believe, to bring together the more obvious and the more elusive elements of Proust’s view of this subject, so central to his thought and writing, and especially to understand<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c999bq">Memory</a><br>
  Author(s) Leslie Esther<br>
  Abstract: In mid-December 1932 Siegfried Kracauer wrote a short newspaper article entitled “Street without Memory.” Here he describes Berlin’s fashionable shopping street, the Kurfürstendamm, as a place voided of memory: “the embodiment of empty flowing time, where nothing persists.”¹ He relates how on visiting a café where he often ate, and where he was sure he had peeked in the night before, he found it closed, its interior emptied. A year later he found that the café’s replacement, a patisserie, had suffered the same fate. Having disappeared, these spaces do not become part of memory, for “constant change purges memory.”² Reflecting<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c999bq">Memory</a><br>
  Author(s) O’Connor Brian<br>
  Abstract: In Theodor W. Adorno’s philosophy, memory is analyzed as a form of knowledge that has become problematic. Adorno argues that what we can know through memory is threatened with eclipse by certain allegedly more rational forms. That eclipse, though, amounts to an act of forgetting that is, as he puts it, equivalent to a “destruction of memory.”¹ Now obviously not all events or all things can be remembered or ought to be remembered. Adorno’s considerations of the issue, in fact, pivot specifically both on the loss of
                  individualityand on the danger of forgettinghuman suffering. This places memory at<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c999bq">Memory</a><br>

  Abstract: Gilles Deleuze’s reading of Proust’s novel
                  In Search of Lost Time(À la recherche du temps perdu) inProust and Signscontains the striking claim that what constitutes its unity is not memory, not even involuntary memory. The “search” is not steered by the effort of recall or the exploration of memory, but by the desire for truth (which, following Nietzsche, we can say is always “hard”).¹ Memory intervenes in this search only as a means but not the most profound means, just as past time intervenes as a structure of time but not the most profound one. Moreover, according<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c999bq">Memory</a><br>
  Author(s) Kennedy Roger<br>
  Abstract: From its early days the place and function of memory has been central to the theory and technique of psychoanalysis, though the picture of how memory functions from a psychoanalytic point of view has undergone many transformations. From memories that arose from the hypnotic treatment of adults, Freud began with the notion that hysteria was caused by the sexual molestation of children. As is well known, Freud later felt that in this early work on hysteria, he had overvalued reality and undervalued fantasy.¹ In his later work, the main emphasis passed away from actual sexual abuse as a cause of<br>

  Author(s) Rose Steven<br>
  Abstract: “If any one faculty of our nature may be called more wonderful than the rest, I do think it is memory. There seems something more speakingly incomprehensible in the powers, the failures, the inequalities of memory, than in any other of our intelligences. The memory is sometimes so retentive, so serviceable, so obedient—at others, so bewildered and so weak—and at others again, so tyrannical, so beyond controul!—We are to be sure a miracle in every way—but our powers of recollecting and forgetting, do seem peculiarly past finding out.”<br>

  Author(s) Barnier Amanda J.<br>
  Abstract: In his contribution to the first issue of
                  Memory Studies, Jeffrey Olick notes that despite “the mutual affirmations of psychologists who want more emphasis on the social and sociologists who want more emphasis on the cognitive,” in fact “actual cross-disciplinary research . . . has been much rarer than affirmations about its necessity and desirability.”¹ The peculiar, contingent disciplinary divisions that structure our academic institutions create and enable many powerful intellectual cultures, but memory researchers are unusually aware that uneasy faultlines and glaring gulfs lie in the uncertain zones between them. The processes of memory are simultaneously natural and cultural.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c999bq">Memory</a><br>
  Author(s) Caygill Howard<br>
  Abstract: The study of cultural memory depends almost without exception upon a prior physiological or psychological account of individual memory. Aby Warburg’s influential studies of cultural memory, including his innovative
                  Mnemosyneproject of the mid-to late 1920s are rooted in his early work on energetic models of the physiology of memory, 1 contemporary with those that provided the point of departure for Freud’s analyses of the pathologies of memory in the 1895Project for a Scientific Psychologyand for Bergson’s 1896Matter and Memory. Charting the relationship between cultural processes of memory and the formation of individual memory remains a challenge<br>

  Abstract: In his book
                     Neuropolitics: Thinking, Culture, Speed, political theorist William Connolly protests against “the insufficiency of . . . intellectualist and deliberationist models of thinking’’ by suggesting that such models, as manifested in philosophy and the human sciences, give too much priority to the highest and conceptually most sophisticated brain nodules in thinking and judgment [and may] . . . underestimate the importance of body image, unconscious motor memory, and thought-imbued affect.²<br>

  Author(s) Freeman Mark<br>
  Abstract: Ever since the pioneering work of Sir Frederic Bartlett, it has become commonplace to assume that the process of remembering the personal past is a reconstructive one mediated by a host of significant factors, ranging from prevailing conventions of remembering all the way to the inevitable impact of present experience on the rendering of the past.¹ The recognition of this simple and seemingly indisputable fact has become something of a double-edged sword in the conceptualization of memory. On the one hand, it has vastly expanded the field of memory studies: memory, far from being the mere videotape-like replica of the<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c999bq">Memory</a><br>
  Author(s) Hamilton Paula<br>
  Abstract: One of the most difficult theoretical issues confronting the study of memory has been the conceptual problem of group memory and how memories carried by individuals become part of a larger social dynamic. While there has been much debate about descriptive, adjectival terms such as “collective,” “cultural,” “popular,” and “social” memory, terms that are often invoked with noticeable imprecision, less consideration has been given to questions of what social relations make memory public or how we understand the very “publicness” of memory. When we think of

  21.  Sites of Memory from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c999bq">Memory</a><br>
  Author(s) Winter Jay<br>
  Abstract: Sites of memory are places where groups of people engage in public activity through which they express “a collective shared knowledge . . . of the past, on which a group’s sense of unity and individuality is based.”¹ The group that goes to such sites inherits earlier meanings attached to the event, as well as adding new meanings. Such activity is crucial to the presentation and preservation of commemorative sites. When such groups disperse or disappear, sites of memory lose their initial force, and may fade away entirely.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c999bq">Memory</a><br>
  Author(s) Radstone Susannah<br>
  Abstract: The recent film
                  The Butterfly Effect(Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber, 2004) tells the story of a young man, Evan, whose capacity to recover lost memories goes further than most, for once his memories return, he learns how to “jump into” the scenes of his past, traveling back in time to divert fate and put right the wrongs of the past. But this “memory travel” turns out to be doomed from the start. Only by killing himself at birth, Evan discovers, can he change the past and save the girl he loves.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c999bq">Memory</a><br>
  Author(s) Parisi Luciana<br>
  Abstract: In the age of sampling, chronology is twisted from a straight line into a loop. Cybernetic memories are plucked out of history, stored in machine banks, to be potentially mutated, then reassembled in any combination rhythmically. Digitally coded events leave sensory residue across distributed networks of body-machines. Memories are transgenetically transported across species and scales; biological programming becomes folded into unintended host bodies in a mnemonic symbiosis: layers of memory stratified into a machinery of achronological time.<br>

  Author(s) Merridale Catherine<br>
  Abstract: Citizens of the former Soviet Union, the men and women who grew up under Communism, share many extraordinary experiences of hardship, violence, and trauma. They have also spent the greater part of their lives interpreting and discussing their experience in a language almost entirely shaped by ideology. These aspects of their mental world lend special resonance to the work of collecting and analyzing their memories. In their case, too, the controversial term “collective memory” has real meaning. The Soviet state was very largely sealed from outside influences for several decades beginning in the 1930s. Official discourse was carefully shaped and<br>

The second was the filmShoahby Claude Lanzmann, which first appeared in France in 1985.” These two works, Felman elaborates, changed “the vocabulary of collective memory”—they added a “new idiomto the discourse on the Holocaust.” A new idiom, Felman<br>

  Author(s) Haaken Janice<br>
  Abstract: The Seventh Veil, released in 1945, represents one of the earliest cinematic portrayals of gothic psychiatric narratives— stories that position the female psyche as a darkly shrouded mystery, revealed through the investigations of a pioneering psychiatrist.¹ As a prototype of this genre,The Seventh Veilregisters the emerging position of the psychiatrist in facilitating modern forms of female subjectivity—forms that require a reworking of memory and a therapeutic encounter with a debilitating past.<br>

  Author(s) Passerini Luisa<br>
  Abstract: The present state of memory studies requires a particular attention to the transmission of what has been accumulated in this field since the 1970s. That was a decade in which many of the energies that had been employed in direct political activism during the previous decade were translated into cultural terms, opening up new areas of research, in which memory was central. I am thinking of the role memory has played over the past four decades in the constitution of cultural history and cultural studies in general, and more specifically of gender studies, cinema and literary studies, area studies, age<br>

  Abstract: Freud’s reading of Jewish history, centered around the return to group consciousness of the long repressed memory of the primeval Father, did not end with Moses or the Hebrew prophets. Yes, Moses created the Jews and Judaism by restoring the Father to them alone, through his own person and in the teaching of the one omnipotent God of the universe. Following his death this revelation was repressed in turn, only to reemerge from its state of unconscious latency in the teachings of the prophets, which would become the common patrimony of the entire Jewish people.<br>

  Book Title: Archaeology and Memory-  Publisher: Oxbow Books<br>
  Author(s): Borić Dušan<br>
  Abstract: Memory can be both a horrifying trauma and an empowering resource. From the Ancient Greeks to Nietzsche and Derrida, the dilemma about the relationship between history and memory has filled many pages, with one important question singled out: is the writing of history to memory a remedy or a poison? Recently, a growing interest in and preoccupation with the issue of memory, remembering and forgetting has resulted in a proliferation of published works, in various disciplines, that have memory as their focus. This trend, to which the present volume contributes, has started to occupy the dominant discourses of disciplines such as sociology, philosophy, history, anthropology and archaeology, and has also disseminated into the wider public discourse of society and culture today. Such a condition may perhaps echo the phenomenon of a melancholic experience at the turn of the millennium. Archaeology and Memory seeks to examine the diversity of mnemonic systems and their significance in different past contexts as well as the epistemological and ontological importance of archaeological practice and narratives in constituting the human historical condition. The twelve substantial contributions in this volume cover a diverse set of regional examples and focus on a range of prehistoric and classical case studies in Eurasian regional contexts as well as on the predicaments of memory in examples of the archaeologies of 'contemporary past'. From the Mesolithic and Neolithic burial chambers to the trenches of World War I and the role of materiality in international criminal courts, a number of contributors examine how people in the past have thought about their own pasts, while others reflect on our own present-day sensibilities in dealing with the material testimonies of recent history. Both kinds of papers offer wider theoretical reflections on materiality, archaeological methodologies and the ethical responsibilities of archaeological narration about the past.<br>

An examination of quotidian mnemonic processes offers an opportunity for us to explore the ways in which local peoples negotiated, influenced, and responded to imperial social climates.

  4  Revising Yoderʹs Theological Method from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cg4k49">Principalities and Powers</a><br>
  Abstract: The powers’ dynamic autonomization never escapes the grip of providence. The fallen powers are created powers. As neither wholly good, nor wholly evil, the shape of the powers must be discerned. Yoder’s theological method privileges a form of discernment rooted in the practical encounter between specific Christian communities and specific powers. Discernment is ultimately a function of mission. Theologians’ contribution to this mission is limited, according to Yoder, yet indispensable for the discernment process. The theologian’s gifts of linguistic analysis and scriptural and historical memory are useful because they facilitate a comparison of the powers with the way of Jesus.<br>

  Book Title: Making Memory-Jewish and Christian Explorations in Monument, Narrative, and Liturgy<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Vincent Alana M.<br>
  Abstract: The twentieth century has been called a "century of horror". Proof of that, designation can be found in the vast and ever-increasing volume of scholarly work on violence, trauma, memory, and history across diverse academic disciplines. This book demonstrates not only the ways in which the wars of the twentieth century have altered theological engagement and religious practice, but also the degree to which religious ways of thinking have shaped the way we construct historical narratives. Drawing on diverse sources - from the Hebrew Bible to Commonwealth war graves, from Greek tragedy to post-Holocaust theology - Alana M. Vincent probes the intersections between past and present, memory and identity, religion and nationality. The result is a book that defies categorization and offers no easy answers, but instead pursues an agenda of theological realism, holding out continued hope for the restoration of the world.<br>

  Author(s) Jasper David<br>
  Abstract: The twentieth century is now but a memory, existing in the minds, souls, and seared flesh of those who survived it and we who write and read the words that become our past. Theology—whether Jewish or Christian—is embedded in the past and the command to remember, or to forget. But remembering or forgetting are both unstable and unreliable. We remember and we forget but in part, as individuals and as communities. We remember things that we would prefer to forget, or seek to blot out those things which make life intolerable or are an offense. Alana Vincent’s book<br>

  Abstract: This is a book about living with the past—not about memory itself
                  per se, but about the process of constructing cultural memory, about the negotiation, implicit or explicit, between what is remembered, transmuted into narrative, handed on from generation to generation, and what is forgotten, unspoken, overlooked. My underlying assumption is that the understanding of the past generated by such a process plays an essential role in shaping attitudes and actions of individuals and societies in the present. This understanding (“memory”) is at times difficult to distinguish from the process of its formation (“memorialization”); the former is often the<br>

  Abstract: The Great War remains an important touchstone of Canadian cultural memory, filtered through the redemptive metanarrative of Western Christianity. It is therefore of interest to both theologians and scholars of religion and nationalism to carefully observe the manner in which that memory is either supported or challenged by the memory of the Holocaust, which, in spite of academic protestations about Roma and Sinti and homosexuals and political prisoners, is generally treated as a particularly Jewish tragedy. The gap between the memorialization of the two events is the gap between Christians and Jews, between the Greeks and the Bible, between those<br>

  Abstract: Despite the fact that the Fourth Gospel was finalized in a Hellenistic setting, its cultural background and thought forms remain thoroughly Jewish.¹ Recognizing Semitic terms and syntax within the Johannine narrative provides a distinctive window into the Evangelist’s presentation of Jesus. While scholars have tended to assume with varying degrees of certainty that none of the Evangelist’s words go back to the historical Jesus, the presence of this Semitic material nonetheless requires an accounting for its origin. Such an inquiry cannot claim to verify a primitive recollection of the Galilean rabbi within the memory of Johannine tradition, yet it still<br>

  Abstract: Transatlantic Voicesis the first collection of critical essays by European scholars on contemporary Native North American literatures. Devoted to the primary genres of Native literature-fiction, nonfiction, drama, poetry-the essays chart the course of recent theories of Native literature, delineate the crosscurrents in the history of Native literature studies, and probe specific themes of trauma and memory as well as changing mythologies. These essays also incorporate incipient transnational and transcultural methodologies in their approach to Native North American writing.<br>

  8  Anamnesiac Mappings: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1djmc5d">Transatlantic Voices</a><br>
  Author(s) TILLETT REBECCA<br>
  Abstract: Generating some notable critical hostility upon its publication in 1991,¹ Leslie Marmon Silko’s contentious novel
                  Almanac of the Deadhas since been hailed as “a radical, stunning manifesto” that offers a graphic, brutal, and highly political analysis of America and the Americas at the turn of the twenty-first century.² Confronting the willful amnesia that pervades contemporary U.S. society regarding the history of settlement and of subsequent Anglo-Indian relations, Silko offers an anamnesiac consideration of the trauma of contact and a celebration of the significance of memory in the face of cultural assimilation and of the power of remembrance to heal<br>

  Book Title: Public Memory in Early China-  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Brashier K. E.<br>
  Abstract: In early imperial China, the dead were remembered by stereotyping them, by relating them to the existing public memory and not by vaunting what made each person individually distinct and extraordinary in his or her lifetime. Their posthumous names were chosen from a limited predetermined pool; their descriptors were derived from set phrases in the classical tradition; and their identities were explicitly categorized as being like this cultural hero or that sage official in antiquity. In other words, postmortem remembrance was a process of pouring new ancestors into prefabricated molds or stamping them with rigid cookie cutters. Public Memory in Early China is an examination of this pouring and stamping process. After surveying ways in which learning in the early imperial period relied upon memorization and recitation, K. E. Brashier treats three definitive parameters of identity—name, age, and kinship—as ways of negotiating a person’s relative position within the collective consciousness. He then examines both the tangible and intangible media responsible for keeping that defined identity welded into the infrastructure of Han public memory.<br>

  Part IV  The Context of Early Chinese Performative Thinking from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1dnnb5m">Ancestral Memory in Early China</a><br>
  Abstract: When discussing texts that closely intertwine memory and spirits, Part III used the phrase “performative thinking” for thinking that, in and of itself, directly impacts the environment outside the thinker. As already noted, I adapted this notion from J. D. Austin’s “performative utterances,” utterances that, by Austin’s own definition, do not merely report about or stimulate an act but are the very execution of the act itself, such as when someone pledges “I do” in a marriage ceremony or is pronounced “Guilty!” at a trial.¹ The celebratory wedding or the courtroom drama are highly ritualized institutions in modern society, and<br>

But what else can be said about how this absence is manifested? For the surviving lineage, the lacuna may require restructuring family authority; for the individual descendant, it leads to forgetfulness as details about the dead gradually fade and memories blur. Furthermore this absence brought about by death is of course an

  Abstract: There are two reasons why a volume dedicated to the memory of George W. Stocking Jr. is, in our opinion, the most appropriate venue for this chapter. First, its American author studied with George at the University of Chicago and developed a strong interest in the history of anthropology under his influence.¹ It was Stocking who encouraged him to take advantage of his knowledge of Russian and explore the history of the relationship between Boas and his Russian colleagues, such as Vladimir Bogoraz and Lev Shternberg.

  Book Title: The Southern Hospitality Myth-Ethics, Politics, Race, and American Memory<br>
  Publisher: University of Georgia Press<br>
  Author(s): Richardson Riché<br>
  Abstract: Historians have offered a variety of explanations of the origins and cultural practices of hospitality in the antebellum South. Economic historians have at times portrayed southern hospitality as evidence of conspicuous consumption and competition among wealthy planters, while cultural historians have treated it peripherally as a symptomatic expression of the southern code of honor. Although historians have offered different theories, they generally agree that the mythic dimensions of southern hospitality eventually outstripped its actual practices. Szczesiul examines why we have chosen to remember and valorize this particular aspect of the South, and he raises fundamental ethical questions that underlie both the concept of hospitality and the cultural work of American memory, particularly in light of the region's historical legacy of slavery and segregation.<br>

  Book Title: Inca Garcilaso and Contemporary World-Making-  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Fernández Christian<br>
  Abstract: This edited volume offers new perspectives from leading scholars on the important work of Inca Garcilaso de la Vega (1539-1616), one of the first Latin American writers to present an intellectual analysis of pre-Columbian history and culture and the ensuing colonial period. To the contributors, Inca Garcilaso's
      Royal Commentaries of the Incaspresented an early counter-hegemonic discourse and a reframing of the history of native non-alphabetic cultures that undermined the colonial rhetoric of his time and the geopolitical divisions it purported. Through his research in both Andean and Renaissance archives, Inca Garcilaso sought to connect these divergent cultures into one world.This collection offers five classical studies ofRoyal Commentariespreviously unavailable in English, along with seven new essays that cover topics including Andean memory, historiography, translation, philosophy, trauma, and ethnic identity. This cross-disciplinary volume will be of interest to students and scholars of Latin American history, culture, comparative literature, subaltern studies, and works in translation.<br>

  Book Title: Patrick Chamoiseau-Recovering Memory<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): FORSDICK CHARLES<br>
  Abstract: This timely new book skilfully examines the work of the award-winning writer Patrick Chamoiseau. Considered by many as one of the most innovative writers to hit the French literary scene in over 40 years, Chamoiseau made his name with his book Texaco (published in 1992 and winner of the highest literary prize in France, the Prix Goncourt). His books have gone on to sell millions and his work has been translated by a number of academic presses. McCusker sets the author in context, providing a valuable contribution to ‘memory studies’ by looking at literary representation of memory in Martinique, a society founded on slavery but now politically assimilated to the metropolitan centre, France.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gn6cf5">Patrick Chamoiseau</a><br>
  Abstract: Since the early 1990s, the islands of the French-speaking Caribbean – the
                  départements d’outre-mer, Martinique and Guadeloupe, as well as Haiti, the first Black republic – have been the site of a heightened and intense debate around historical memory. These islands – and notably Martinique – have already witnessed a long-standing tradition of theoretical self-analysis and identitarian debate, and have produced a number of thinkers (Frantz Fanon, Aimé Césaire, Edouard Glissant) who have anticipated and contributed to what we now call postcolonial discourse. Yet the contemporary centrality of the concern with collective memory, its pervasive and almost obsessive force, is<br>

  CHAPTER 1  Beginnings: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gn6cf5">Patrick Chamoiseau</a><br>
  Abstract: Chronique des sept misères, Chamoiseau’s first novel, establishes many of the key concerns which will be further explored in his later writings. It deals throughout, and in a very direct way, with the confrontation between memory and oblivion, and presents a pessimistic diagnosis of the possibilities for memory, and hence self-knowledge, in contemporary Martinique. The novel is structured around a fall from grace: it traces the island’s transition from an economy based on the local Creole market in the early twentieth century to its brutal entry into the world of modernity, consumerism and global capital in the aftermath of World<br>

  CHAPTER 2  ‘Une tracée de survie’: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gn6cf5">Patrick Chamoiseau</a><br>
  Abstract: The previous chapter explored the ways in which the absence of any sense of a stable, identifiable beginning, whether historical or mythical, motivates narrative and inflects form in Caribbean fiction, and specifically in
                  Chronique des sept misères. In many ways, the autobiographical impulse expresses much the same need, in that it represents a quest for origins of a particular, but similarly elusive, nature. While, as we will see in later chapters, the elderly fictional protagonist is a privileged source of both the personal and the collective past, Chamoiseau’s autobiographies foreground the child as a vector of individual memory, although in<br>

  CHAPTER 4  Memory Materialized: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gn6cf5">Patrick Chamoiseau</a><br>
  Abstract: Memory is at once an innate capacity, and an intangible ‘store’ of past experiences, sensations, abilities and events. But as recent studies of memory have repeatedly underlined, it is mediated through and stimulated by
                  things: sites, monuments or archives in the public domain, and paraphernalia, possessions or souvenirs in the personal sphere. In his highly critical study of the prevalence of memory as an explicit theme in recent writing, Kerwin Klein argues that contemporary memory is frequently vested in ‘a dramatically imperfect piece of material culture, and such fragments are best if imbued with pathos’. These memorial tropes, he argues,<br>

  Afterword from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gn6cf5">Patrick Chamoiseau</a><br>
  Abstract: In the transition that has been traced in this monograph, from an æsthetics of re-collection and transcription to a poetics of materiality, the body has emerged as a primary site of both fictional and autobiographical memory, an archive and an active witness. It is appropriate that this study should end with further consideration of
                  Bibliquebecause, as we have seen, this novel focuses on the body to an unprecedented degree, and because the text exemplifies many of the tensions which have lain at the heart of my analysis more generally, such as the fraught borderline between nostalgia and ‘authentic’ memory,<br>

  Book Title: Patrick Modiano-Second Edition<br>

  Author(s): KAWAKAMI AKANE<br>
  Abstract: Conceived as a second edition to Kawakami's acclaimed A Self-Conscious Art, which was the first full-length study in English of Patrick Modiano’s work, this book has been comprehensively updated with two new chapters, notably discussing the author's recent work and his Nobel Prize win. Kawakami shows how by parodying precursors such as Proust or the nouveau romanciers, Modiano's narratives are built around a profound lack of faith in the ability of writing to retrieve the past through memory, and this failure is acknowledged in the discreet playfulness that characterises his novels. This welcome update on the work of one of the most successful modern French novelists will be essential reading for scholars working on contemporary French writing.<br>

  Book Title: At the Limits of Memory-Legacies of Slavery in the Francophone World<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hodgson Kate<br>
  Abstract: Recent years have seen a growing body of literature dedicated to memories of slavery in the Anglophone world, yet little has been done to approach this subject from Francophone perspectives. This collection responds to the urgent need to contribute to current research on slavery and memory studies by focusing specifically on the Francophone world. Featuring the scholarship of leading academics in France, Britain, the United States and Canada, the collection reflects upon contemporary commemorative practices that relate to the history of slavery and the slave trade, and questions how they function in relationship to other, less memorialized histories of exploitation, such as indentured and forced labour. The volume is set against the context of France’s growing body of memory legislation, as well as its close cultural and political connections to its former empire, all of which make it an influential player in how slavery continues to be memorialized and conceptualized in the public sphere. Contributors retrace and redraw the narrative map of slavery and its legacies in the Francophone world through a comparative understanding of how these different, but interconnected forms of labour exploitation have been remembered and/or forgotten from European, West African, Indian Ocean and Caribbean perspectives.<br>

  Abstract: Over the past decade, the field of memory studies has given rise to a growing body of literature that has responded to the recent boom in memories of slavery and the slave trade. The proliferation of memorial sites relating to Europe’s slaving past has largely coincided with two key commemorative dates relating to abolitionism: the Abolition of the Slave Trade in 1807 (UK) and the Abolition of Slavery in 1848 (France). The accompanying literature – not least of which are the extensive studies conducted by Christine Chivallon and Françoise Vergès which bookend the current volume¹ – has served to enrich<br>

By engaging with the history of the slave trade and exploring its connections with the use of African labour in contemporary modes of production in West Africa, recent art works from the region that once formed the heartland of the French slave trade can be seen to offer a discursive platform on which to foreground ‘alternative memorial practices and forms of memory-making’<br>

  Abstract: As memories of slavery re-emerge in recent historiographies of the transatlantic slave trade, contemporary visual culture from Francophone Africa is participating in this reassessment of the past as part of an on-going discussion of ‘development’ in present-day Africa. By engaging with the history of the slave trade and exploring its connections with the use of African labour in contemporary modes of production in West Africa, recent art works from the region that once formed the heartland of the French slave trade can be seen to offer a discursive platform on which to foreground ‘alternative memorial practices and forms of memory-making’<br>

  Book Title: At the Limits of Memory-Legacies of Slavery in the Francophone World<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hodgson Kate<br>
  Abstract: Recent years have seen a growing body of literature dedicated to memories of slavery in the Anglophone world, yet little has been done to approach this subject from Francophone perspectives. This collection responds to the urgent need to contribute to current research on slavery and memory studies by focusing specifically on the Francophone world. Featuring the scholarship of leading academics in France, Britain, the United States and Canada, the collection reflects upon contemporary commemorative practices that relate to the history of slavery and the slave trade, and questions how they function in relationship to other, less memorialized histories of exploitation, such as indentured and forced labour. The volume is set against the context of France’s growing body of memory legislation, as well as its close cultural and political connections to its former empire, all of which make it an influential player in how slavery continues to be memorialized and conceptualized in the public sphere. Contributors retrace and redraw the narrative map of slavery and its legacies in the Francophone world through a comparative understanding of how these different, but interconnected forms of labour exploitation have been remembered and/or forgotten from European, West African, Indian Ocean and Caribbean perspectives.<br>

  Slavery and Its Legacies: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gpcb4p">At the Limits of Memory</a><br>
  Author(s) Hodgson Kate<br>
  Abstract: Over the past decade, the field of memory studies has given rise to a growing body of literature that has responded to the recent boom in memories of slavery and the slave trade. The proliferation of memorial sites relating to Europe’s slaving past has largely coincided with two key commemorative dates relating to abolitionism: the Abolition of the Slave Trade in 1807 (UK) and the Abolition of Slavery in 1848 (France). The accompanying literature – not least of which are the extensive studies conducted by Christine Chivallon and Françoise Vergès which bookend the current volume¹ – has served to enrich<br>

  Abstract: This chapter is concerned with the development of new patrimonial and museographical practices relating to transatlantic slavery in France and its far-flung overseas departments in the Caribbean.² From the outset, it is worth recalling that these departments consist of micro-societies that were born out of slavery and whose historical trajectory has yet to find its rightful place within that of the French nation. What follows may therefore appear surprising since the proposed analysis chimes a dissonant note amid the increasing clamour for action at a museal level for the creation of places to collect, remember and honour the memory of<br>

  Abstract: In 2005, the French government chose 10 May as the annual date for its national day for remembering the slave trade, slavery and their abolitions. The creation of this official day of remembrance fulfilled one of the criteria set out in the so-called Taubira law (2001), which sought to inscribe the slave trade, slavery and their abolitions into national memory. Since the 1983 decree under François Mitterrand, each of France’s overseas departments and former slave colonies has had its own official commemorative date to celebrate abolition.

  Abstract: This book explores the memory of the First Hungarian Soviet Republic of 1919, which proved crucial for communist Hungarian political culture throughout the twentieth century.

  Abstract: “‘Every South African has been damaged by apartheid,’ Michael Lapsley and his colleagues of the Institute for Healing of Memories used to say when they facilitated the first Healing of Memories workshops in the late 1990s.”¹ As we enter the third decade of liberation and democracy “we realise,” argues Philippe Denis, another pioneer of memory work in the South African context, “that, as part of the legacy of apartheid, a host of challenges face South African society. We are also damaged by HIV and AIDS, domestic violence, sexual abuse, violent crime, xenophobia, corruption and various forms of discrimination.” In sum,<br>

  Abstract: This third volume of
                  Irish Cultural Memorysets out to focus on two periods that form what I call “memory cruxes” within the broader memory bank of Irish cultural experience. In an obvious way, just as there are particular moments that stand out in the individual memory over time, there are also moments that can be identified as particularly important in the cultural memory of a group. These might be historical events deemed to be retrospectively important for ushering in a new era, or a period of heightened change; particular individuals can become emblematic of a given time or connected<br>

  Abstract: The problem is, surely, how to address redress with adequate justice. Redress assumes, not a saving intervention that might prevent acts of violence and expropriation in the present, but an address to the past from which we are disjoined by the very history of which effective violence is a constitutive part. In relation to the violence of the past, we seem helpless, impotent to set right the injustice that has so forcefully shaped the very times that we inhabit. Suspended between the call to vengeance and the commitment to memory, redress is charged neither with the repetition of the cycles<br>

  Abstract: Emblematic of a dark period in a troubled colonization, the workhouse is a dirty word in Irish history. Its system, buildings, and sites comprise a challenging representational struggle between erasure and reconstruction in remembrance. Workhouses took years to build, employed thousands in the building process, subsequently housed hundreds of thousands from 1840s onward and yet remain a quiet aspect of Famine memory in visual and material culture.¹ The absence of extensively conserved workhouses is a consequence of life going on after the Famine, as some sites became utilized for different purposes and others succumbed to politically motivated destruction.² Workhouses have<br>

  Abstract: Since the 1994 paramilitary ceasefires, the Irish peace process has stimulated a flowering of practices of history-making, remembrance, and commemoration concerned with the legacy of the Troubles in “post-conflict” Northern Ireland.¹ Much of this work has taken the form of oral-history and life-history narrative that enables personal reflection on the significance of violent conflict in the recent past and reassessment of its impact upon individuals, families, and local areas.

  Abstract: The past is always present in Northern Ireland, structuring everyday experience to a degree not generally found elsewhere. In a society where historical events are continually relevant to contemporary life, both cultural memory and processes of memorialization become significant means whereby people live out their identities. In turn, this level of awareness also informs aspects of the visual: artists are not separate from the culture they inhabit but are equally formed by its shared experiences of community, danger, and loss.

The word that sparks this essay is “retained” rather than the inherently grander claims of Brodsky’s statement, claims that one can only fully understand and relate to the traditions of Russian poetry, instead of the slightly more moderate preoccupations of contemporary poetry in English. For “retained” read “memory,” the bulwark of the individual mind, or poetic imagination, in the act<br>

  Author(s) BARBER FIONNA<br>
  Abstract: The past is always present in Northern Ireland, structuring everyday experience to a degree not generally found elsewhere. In a society where historical events are continually relevant to contemporary life, both cultural memory and processes of memorialization become significant means whereby people live out their identities. In turn, this level of awareness also informs aspects of the visual: artists are not separate from the culture they inhabit but are equally formed by its shared experiences of community, danger, and loss. Much of the work of artists in post-conflict Northern Ireland bears the marks of this communality of experience, whether through<br>

  Abstract: The Field Day Theatre Company, originating in Derry in the throes of the Troubles in 1980, set out with the express purpose of discovering a new language for the expression of Irish cultural memory. Field Day’s mission was “to contribute to the solution of the present crisis by producing analysis of the established opinions, myths and stereotypes which had become both a symptom and a cause of the current situation” (Deane 1985b, blurb). The intention was to try to open up new ways of understanding the past beyond those enshrined in the outmoded and bankrupt ideologies of traditional nationalism and<br>

  Book Title: Memory Ireland-Diaspora and Memory Practices, Volume 2<br>
  Publisher: Syracuse University Press<br>
  Author(s): Frawley Oona<br>
  Abstract: In the second volume of a series that will ultimately include four, the authors consider Irish diasporic memory and memory practices. While the Irish diaspora has become the subject of a wide range of scholar­ship, there has been little work focused on its relationship to memory. The first half of the volume asks how diasporic memory functions in dif­ferent places and times, and what forms it takes on. As an island nation with a history of emigration, Ireland has developed a rich diasporic cultural memory, one that draws on multiple traditions and his­toriographies of both "home" and "away." Native traditions are not imported wholesale, but instead develop their own curious hybridity, reflecting the nature of emigrant memory that absorbs new ways of thinking about home. How do immigrants remember their homeland? How do descendants of immigrants "remem­ber" a land they rarely visit? How does diasporic memory pass through families, and how is it represented in cultural forms such as literature, festivals, and souvenirs?<br>

  Abstract: Cultural memory, as the project
                  Memory Irelanddemonstrates, has an array of milieus. Irish cultural memory can be located at heritage sites, embodied by memorials and museums, found in landscapes inscribed with place names that have changed over time. Cultural memory is also located, though, in cultural forms that remain unattached to a geographical space. Instead, such cultural forms function as containers of specific indexes of memory and reflect a range of what I term “memory practices,” which are ways of cultural remembering that result from and are shaped by particular cultural forms. Many of these cultural forms embody memory<br>

  Abstract: Ireland, with its reputation as the “Land of Song,” is the only country in the world to have a musical instrument as its national symbol. It is thus not surprising that music is so intimately involved in the collective remembering of events in Irish history. When in the eighteenth century a decline in the numbers of Irish speakers occurred, the Irish language could no longer serve to transmit cultural memory as it once had; during this period, music became central to national expression. Charles Hamilton Teeling, a member of the United Irishmen, noted that throughout the time surrounding the 1798<br>

  Abstract: It has been noted that “the language of memory does seem to be above all a language of images” (Kuhn 2000, 188). Susan Sontag argues that photography’s preeminence within the “language” of memory stems from the mechanics of how memory operates, in that it “freeze-frames”; its “basic unit is the single image” (2004, 19). If we accept that “there is no such thing as an authentic origin of memory, since all memory, whether preserved in image, word, or sound, is grounded in representation” (van Dijik 2004, 268), we must accept too that there is no such thing as an authentic<br>

  Book Title: Memory Ireland-History and Modernity, Volume 1<br>
  Publisher: Syracuse University Press<br>
  Author(s): Frawley Oona<br>
  Abstract: Despite the ease with which scholars have used the term "memory" in recent decades, its definition remains enigmatic. Does cultural memory rely on the memories of individuals, or does it take shape beyond the borders of the individual mind? Cultural memory has garnered particular attention within Irish studies. With its trauma-filled history and sizable global diaspora, Ireland presents an ideal subject for work in this vein. What do stereotypes of Irish memory—as extensive, unforgiving, begrudging, but also blank on particular, usually traumatic, subjects—reveal about the ways in which cultural remembrance works in contemporary Irish culture and in Irish diasporic culture? How do icons of Irishness—from the harp to the cottage, from the Celtic cross to a figure like James Joyce—function in cultural memory? This collection seeks to address these questions as it maps a landscape of cultural memory in Ireland through theoretical, historical, literary, and cultural explorations by top scholars in the field of Irish studies. In a series that will ultimately include four volumes, the sixteen essays in this first volume explore remembrance and forgetting throughout history, from early modern Ireland to contemporary multicultural Ireland. Among the many subjects addressed: Guy Beiner disentangles "collective" from "folk" memory in "Remembering and Forgetting the Irish Rebellion of 1798," and Anne Dolan looks at local memory of the civil war in "Embodying the Memory of War and Civil War." The volume concludes with Alan Titley’s "The Great Forgetting," a compelling argument for viewing modern Irish culture as an artifact of the Europeanization of Ireland and for bringing into focus the urgent need for further, wide-ranging Irishlanguage scholarship.<br>

  Author(s) FRAWLEY OONA<br>
  Abstract: The field of “memory studies” has been growing steadily in recent decades, fueled by multidisciplinary interest in the ways in which a variety of social groups remember. Among humanities-based scholars, those with a stake in this area include sociologists, historians, literary critics, art historians, and anthropologists, while outside of the humanities, psychologists, neuroscientists and biologists all have the potential to contribute valuably to the field. The net cast by memory studies is so wide, in fact, that in forums like the journal

  Author(s) MISZTAL BARBARA A.<br>
  Abstract: Paradoxically, despite the fact that contemporary society is commonly conceptualized as “terminally ill with amnesia” (Huyssen 1995, 1), memory has established itself as a major discourse; interest in memory in the last thirty years has been unprecedented. This interest accounts for the discovery of ethnic and local roots as well as for the construction of common pasts to bind communities and give meaning to their collective fates. The intensification of a memory discourse can be illustrated by the epidemics of public commemoration, the growing recognition of memory as both a constitutive component of political culture and an important base of<br>

  Author(s) FRAWLEY OONA<br>
  Abstract: While terms like “memory,” “cultural memory,” and their variants frequently occur in the discourses of Irish literature, culture, and history, “memory” has remained largely undefined, addressed laterally. That the field of Irish studies has thus far failed adequately to define memory is hardly surprising, since those who have made memory their lifework experience similar problems. Memory, as the neuroscientist Antonio Damasio points out, is particularly elusive. “We are not conscious,” he writes, “of which memories we store and which memories we do not; of how we store memories; of how we classify and organize them; of how we interrelate memories<br>

  Abstract: The harp image encompasses distinct and sometimes conflicting iconographical histories and cultural “memories” that influenced the complex formation of Irish identity. Long recognized as an iconic site of Irish identity, the harp is also a palimpsest of cultural memory. The origins of the harp icon’s meanings extend well beyond Ireland and can be traced to a variety of ancient and modern sources, in fact and in cultural memory.

Although the leadership of the United Irishmen, the revolutionary secret society behind the Rebellion, were lionized as the iconic founding fathers of Irish republicanism, militant republicans did not have a monopoly on the interpretation of the historical events.

  Abstract: The current proliferation of analyses dealing with memory does not signal a temporary fascination or a provisional critical turn.

Because of its suppressed nature, queer memory is flimsier: while mainstream public memory is solidly supported institutionally by politics and history, queer memory is more symbolic, derived from what is implied by exclusion rather than inclusion. By uncovering previously hidden gay and lesbian experiences, queer historians have initiated a type of cultural rebellion, juxtaposing queer memory with hetero-normative histories. The production of this alternative history has evoked a renewed engagement with memory because more traditional methodological approaches to<br>

  Book Title: Metaphor and the Slave Trade in West African Literature-  Publisher: Ohio University Press<br>
  Author(s): MURPHY LAURA T.<br>
  Abstract: Metaphor and the Slave Tradeprovides compelling evidence of the hidden but unmistakable traces of the transatlantic slave trade that persist in West African discourse. Through an examination of metaphors that describe the trauma, loss, and suffering associated with the commerce in human lives, this book shows how the horrors of slavery are communicated from generation to generation.Laura T. Murphy's insightful new readings of canonical West African fiction, autobiography, drama, and poetry explore the relationship between memory and metaphor and emphasize how repressed or otherwise marginalized memories can be transmitted through images, tropes, rumors, and fears. By analyzing the unique codes through which West Africans have represented the slave trade, this work foregrounds African literary contributions to Black Atlantic discourse and draws attention to the archive that metaphor unlocks for scholars of all disciplines and fields of study.<br>

Within the West African literary tradition, creative writers of all stripes, including many of the most canonical fiction authors as well as other dramatists, poets, popular novelists, and children’s authors, have similarly attempted to come to terms with the memory and legacy of the slave trade.

  Author(s): Jacobson Karl N.<br>
  Abstract: Although the Psalms of Asaph (Pss. 50, 73‒83) contain a concentration of historical referents unparalleled in the Psalter, they have rarely attracted sustained historical interest. Karl N. Jacobson identifies these Psalms as containing cultic historiography, historical narratives written for recitation in worship, and explores them through mnemohistory, attending to how the past is remembered and to the rhetorical function of recitation in the cultic setting. Asaph “remembers" the past as a movement from henotheism to Yahwism as the core memory that informs a new historical situation for worship participants.<br>

  1  Introduction and History of Interpretation from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1kgqv1h">Memories of Asaph</a><br>
  Abstract: The biblical psalms attributed to Asaph (Psalms 50, 73–83) exhibit the most concentrated collection of historical referents in the Psalter. These historical referents, embodied in the Asaphite collection, serve as the marshals of Israel’s historical memory and establish a cultic framework in which Israel’s memory is formed, its history represented, and its identity shaped. My contention is that the historical material in these psalms, paired as it is with a broad vocabulary of remembrance, is a form of cultic historiography that is principally attested in Asaph and is distinctive of the Psalter.<br>

In the case of ancient Israel, the socioreligious collective was complex, and the contributions of numerous individuals and groups can be discerned in the composition of the Hebrew Bible. In the Hebrew Bible at large, there are bodies of material that record, retell, and reshape the people’s past; from the Pentateuch through the prophets, the remembered past is an integral part of the biblical material.¹ It is within the ranks of the keepers of Israel’s memory that Asaph finds his place. Yet within the<br>

  Abstract: To reiterate one of the tenets of this study, when historical references are employed in and with the language of memory, there is a rhetorical function and impact of the psalm that is different than it would otherwise be if the mnemohistorical referent were either absent or if some other
                     Erinnerungsfigurwere employed. Within the Asaphite corpus of the Psalter, there are two forms in which a historical referent is found.¹ The Psalms of Asaph offer both clear, intentional historical referents (explicit mnemohistory) and unintentional holdovers or reflections of older traditions and practices (residual mnemohistory).<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1kgqv1h">Memories of Asaph</a><br>
  Abstract: It has been shown that the Asaphite Psalms (50 and 73–83) exhibit the most concentrated collection of historical referents in the Psalter. This material is distinctive both in terms of its content (when compared to other Levitical collections and other individual psalms) and in its function. In the cultic poetry of the Asaphite material in particular, there is a ritualization of the act of shared remembering, engendered through recourse to the record of historical subjects or moments. The historical referents embodied in the Asaphite collection serve to preserve and pass on Israel’s historical memory and to establish a cultic<br>

  Abstract: All societies have ways of locating themselves in time and history. That is far from saying that the popular recall of the past is perfect. On the contrary, many are the complaints that people today – led especially, it seems, by the young – are constituting a heedless ‘Now Generation’ that knows nothing of olden times. ‘Speak so much of memory because there is so little of it left,’ the French historian Pierre Nora exclaimed dramatically in 1989. And he is not alone in expressing such anxieties.<br>

  Abstract: The past six chapters have analyzed how we process text in the meganovel, ranging from its sentence-level lacunae up to its macro-scale figurations of nation and world. Given how utterly mega-novel text overwhelms our limited working memory and how often it dissolves its most important text into a large amount of cruft, I have argued that we must hone our ability to modulate attention to an extremely fine degree, filtering the latter so as to better perceive the former. Some passages should be processed closely and slowly, while others should be read more quickly; some are best read distantly, and<br>

  Abstract: The waning years mark a stage in life when it is natural for people to feel nostalgic and recollect their pasts. Kathleen Woodward and Murray Schwartz argue that “aging anticipates loss,” which intensifies the work of memory and fantasy (3). Although it is generally understood that the elderly experience a waning in their ability to remember, the decline mainly affects the recall of new learning, while the capacity to vividly recall episodes from the past may be high and even stronger than that of young adults (Burke, 124–6).

  Book Title: Bearing Witness-Perspectives on War and Peace from the Arts and Humanities<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Johnstone Tiffany<br>
  Abstract: As the centenary of the Great War approaches, citizens worldwide are reflecting on the history, trauma, and losses of a war-torn twentieth century. It is in remembering past wars that we are at once confronted with the profound horror and suffering of armed conflict and the increasing elusiveness of peace. The contributors to Bearing Witness do not presume to resolve these troubling questions, but provoke new kinds of reflection. They explore literature, the arts, history, language, and popular culture to move beyond the language of rhetoric and commemoration provided by politicians and the military. Adding nuance to discussions of war and peace, this collection probes the understanding and insight created in the works of musicians, dramatists, poets, painters, photographers, and novelists, to provide a complex view of the ways in which war is waged, witnessed, and remembered. A compelling and informative collection, Bearing Witness sheds new light on the impact of war and the power of suffering, heroism and memory, to expose the human roots of violence and compassion. Contributors include Heribert Adam (Simon Fraser University), Laura Brandon (Carleton University), Mireille Calle-Gruber (Université La Sorbonne Nouvelle), Janet Danielson (Simon Fraser University), Sandra Djwa (emeritus, Simon Fraser University), Alan Filewod (University of Guelph), Sherrill Grace (University of British Columbia), Patrick Imbert (University of Ottawa), Tiffany Johnstone (PhD Candidate, University of British Columbia), Martin Löschnigg (Graz University), Lauren Lydic (PhD, University of Toronto), Conny Steenman Marcusse (Netherlands), Jonathan Vance (University of Western Ontario), Aritha van Herk (University of Calgary), Peter C. van Wyck (Concordia University), Christl Verduyn (Mount Allison University), and Anne Wheeler (filmmaker).<br>

  Abstract: Over the past thirty years, and with increasing frequency, Canadian writers, filmmakers, and playwrights have assumed the task of recreating the experiences of Canadians in the Second World War. Canadians are by no means unique in this work of cultural memory and the recreation of the past; artists, historians, and philosophers from many of the countries involved in that global war have revisited it, tried to make sense of the sheer senselessness of many events, and yet stubbornly insisted that later generations must remember and must try to understand.

  Abstract: Second-generation authors are also readers of inherited memory, recognizing the presence of the unreadable through aligning themselves with their audience.¹ Part of the drive behind second-generation authors wanting to document their relationship with their parents is to read and touch the material presence offered by a text that they have been largely deprived of through a range of destructive and traumatic means. By their own recounting, second-generation memoirists acknowledge the push and pull of two incongruous forces: a desire to read—to handle, to contain—the experience of their eyewitness parents and, at the same time, a desire to understand<br>

  Abstract: The etymology of the word “text,” like all etymology, reveals buried connotations that haunt the contemporary meaning beneath the level of active memory. For most of us, “text” means the written document, and even in the more nuanced semiological concept, texts are “sign-systems, linguistic or non-linguistic” (
                  Concise Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms), the plural “systems” suggesting the disintegration of the unified concept of “text” into texts of different kinds: verbal, visual, aural, gestural, and so on. The etymology of the word, however, seems to resist divisions, indicating integration and unification: the participle of the verb, textus, from which we get<br>

The Holocaust also reinforced perspectives that became associated with the construction of collective memory, especially in countries where society identified itself, or was identified by, these categories, specifically Israel and Germany. ‘Who was a Holocaust survivor?’ was determined first legally and then historically (Gutman, 1990). In Israel, this identity became an important issue in terms of social labelling in the 1950s, and later became salient in terms of self-chosen categorisation in the 1980s and 1990s<br>

For more complex chains of events, the historiographers of the

In each case, Obama recognized a segregation of memory along the lines of color, class, and generation.

  Book Title: Holocaust Monuments and National Memory-France and Germany since 1989<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Carrier Peter<br>
  Abstract: Since 1989, two sites of memory with respect to the deportation and persecution of Jews in France and Germany during the Second World War have received intense public attention: the Vélo d'Hiver (Winter Velodrome) in Paris and the Monument for the Murdered Jews of Europe or Holocaust Monument in Berlin. Why is this so? Both monuments, the author argues, are unique in the history of memorial projects. Although they are genuine "sites of memory", neither monument celebrates history, but rather serve as platforms for the deliberation, negotiation and promotion of social consensus over the memorial status of war crimes in France and Germany. The debates over these monuments indicate that it is the communication among members of the public via the mass media, rather than qualities inherent in the sites themselves, which transformed these sites into symbols beyond traditional conceptions of heritage and patriotism.<br>

  Abstract: The national monuments in memory of deportations and genocide carried out during the Second World War, known as the Vél’ d’Hiv’ and Holocaust Monument, arose from distinct political and cultural contexts and did not result from a policy of Franco-German reconciliation. Comparison of these monuments does not reveal direct interaction between the two memory cultures, therefore, but transnational analogies between local commemorative customs and discourses as well as local specificities.¹ It is precisely with such investigations of commemorations on the basis of analogies and specificities that it is possible to establish the degree to which the focal points, narrative structures<br>

  Abstract: Controversial ceremonies on the site of a central monument commemorating the deportation of Jews from Paris in 1942 became the focus of presidents Mitterrand and Chirac’s attempts to secure national reconciliation from 1992. Memories of state persecutions and victims of national policy presented an obstacle to the representation of conventional national identity. The monument and related commemorations of Vichy were nevertheless used to legitimate a cohesive official state memory: by rhetorical appeals to humanist traditions and to nationhood as an ideal, almost religious vocation.<br>

  5  The Institutionalisation of Memory in Public Art and Rhetoric from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1x76f8h">Holocaust Monuments and National Memory</a><br>
  Abstract: This detailed examination of the evolution of the Vél d’Hiv’ and Holocaust Monument reveals discrepancies, but also analogies and overlaps between memory cultures in France and Germany. Memory cultures are not unique and confined in time and space, but are subject to what the sociologist Ulrich Beck calls ‘polycentric memory, in which non-state, transnational actors (such as social movements) also play a role’¹ – a model which he perceives to be a key to the constitution of a European memory culture. Beck dismisses Christianity, ethnicity or principles of the welfare state as foundations of either national or European heritages. A multinational<br>

  [Part III Introduction] from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1x76f8h">Holocaust Monuments and National Memory</a><br>
  Abstract: The dramatic increase in the number of historical monuments, commemorations and exhibitions since the 1970s is an international phenomenon, as demonstrated by the sociologist Frank Füredi in his extensive study of memory cultures in the U.K., France, Germany, Japan and the United States.¹ In Europe, debates over historical monuments, museums and commemorations have occurred with such frequency and intensity during this period that the debates themselves have become paradigmatic moments if not intellectual monuments of contemporary public understandings of history. Controversy over the cult of the past following the National Heritage Act of 1983 in the U.K., the Historians’ Dispute<br>

  6  The National Memorial Paradigm from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1x76f8h">Holocaust Monuments and National Memory</a><br>
  Abstract: The proliferation of monuments and commemorations and the social and political values invested in them since the 1970s are symptomatic of societies that have been actively seeking a symbolic reinforcement of collective memories. Public symbols are neither a cause nor a consequence of the present international preoccupation with memory, however, but the very language with which these societies transmit and negotiate their pasts. What are the historical and political origins and the social consequences of this phenomenon? And how do contemporary societies legitimate their existence on the basis of memory and historical representations? The rise of memory cultures, which is<br>

  7  The Postnational Memorial Paradigm from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1x76f8h">Holocaust Monuments and National Memory</a><br>
  Abstract: The monumental historiographical projects on sites of memory in France and Germany,
                  Les Lieux de mémoireandDeutsche Erinnerungsorte, provide pedagogical models for understanding the historical foundations of contemporary memory cultures in these two countries. Both projects are highly informative, thorough in their treatment of historical facts, and theoretically innovative. The notions that collective symbols are today ‘patrimonial’ instead of partisan foci of collective memory, that we are subjects of ‘archival’ memory, that ‘present time’ is a historiographical category in which societies forge a cohesive self-understanding on the basis of shared symbols of the past, and that the mass media<br>

  Chapter 4  Narrativity and Objectivity in Historical Studies from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1x76fc2">History</a><br>
  Abstract: “Narrativity” and “objectivity” seem to be contradictory characterizations of historical studies. The category of narrativity brings historical studies close to literature; it discloses the literary character of historiography, and the linguistic procedures and principles which constitute “history” as a meaningful and sensible representation of the past in the cultural practices of historical memory. Objectivity, on the other hand, is a category that discloses a certain kind of historical knowledge, gained through the methodically-ruled procedures of research and that has furnished it with a solid validity jutting over the field of arbitrary meaning.<br>

  Book Title: Sexual Disorientations-Queer Temporalities, Affects, Theologies<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): MOORE STEPHEN D.<br>
  Abstract: Sexual Disorientations brings some of the most recent and significant works of queer theory into conversation with the overlapping fields of biblical, theological and religious studies to explore the deep theological resonances of questions about the social and cultural construction of time, memory, and futurity. Apocalyptic, eschatological and apophatic languages, frameworks, and orientations pervade both queer theorizing and theologizing about time, affect, history and desire. The volume fosters a more explicit engagement between theories of queer temporality and affectivity and religious texts and discourses.<br>

  Abstract: “Surely my memory is where you dwell,” Augustine famously writes in his
                  Confessions, addressing the puzzling, immaterial God for whom “there can be no question of place.” We might hope to resolve the puzzle by replacing the “where” of memory with a “when,” but chronologically, too, God turns out to be not quite placeable. Augustine argues that one way that we can be sure that werememberGod is that we all seek the happiness God brings, even though we have not yet found it in this life: How else could we know about it?¹ It must be that we<br>

Film and television became central mechanisms of memory construction during the second half of the twentieth century and Western scholarship has long been emphasizing the power of fictional as well as documentary film in the representation of history¹ and defending television’s capabilities to “mediate” history successfully against those who doubt it.² According to Edgerton, televisual characteristics such as immediacy, dramatization, personalization, and intimacy, all shape the medium’s interaction with the<br>

  Author(s) Nets-Zehngut Rafi<br>
  Abstract: Nations involved in an intractable conflict usually present a biased
                     official memoryof the conflict. To fit their interests, such memory portrays these nations positively and their rivals negatively. As such, it plays an important role in the conflict by affecting the psychological and behavioral reactions of the parties toward their rivals. Therefore, such memory is of importance for scholarly research as attested by the blooming research literature in recent years on memory, especially in the context of conflict, war, and peace.¹<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2005tc4">The War of 1948</a><br>
  Author(s) Kolodney Ziva<br>
  Abstract: Haifa’s Memorial Garden (Gan ha-Zikkaron) was the subject of an architectural competition immediately after the 1948 War. It was a main urban open space, situated at the heart of the city’s current municipal center along the confrontation seam between the pre-1948 Arab quarter of Haifa’s downtown area and the Jewish neighborhood of Hadar ha-Carmel. Today, the garden overlooks the long-gone Old City area of Haifa, which was demolished during the Shikmona Operation in 1948–49.

  Abstract: The question “What is memory to history?” has occupied and continues to occupy many historians. In the opinion of Pierre Nora, history is a problematic and incomplete reconstruction of what is no more, while memory is always relevant. Memory is life, borne constantly by living groups, and is therefore constantly developing, open to a dialectic of remembrance and forgetting, sensitive to all<br>

  Book Title: The Colonial Legacy in France-Fracture, Rupture, and Apartheid<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Pernsteiner Alexis<br>
  Abstract: Debates about the legacy of colonialism in France are not new, but they have taken on new urgency in the wake of recent terrorist attacks. Responding to acts of religious and racial violence in 2005, 2010, and 2015 and beyond, the essays in this volume pit French ideals against government-sponsored revisionist decrees that have exacerbated tensions, complicated the process of establishing and recording national memory, and triggered divisive debates on what it means to identify as French. As they document the checkered legacy of French colonialism, the contributors raise questions about France and the contemporary role of Islam, the banlieues, immigration, race, history, pedagogy, and the future of the Republic. This innovative volume reconsiders the cultural, economic, political, and social realities facing global French citizens today and includes contributions by Achille Mbembe, Benjamin Stora, Françoise Vergès, Alec Hargreaves,Elsa Dorlin,and Alain Mabanckou, among others.<br>

  Abstract: It says a lot about your intellectual life if you remember being pushed around for wearing glasses and reading books as a kid—or if you remember pushing around kids who wore glasses and read books.

  Book Title: Holocaust Public Memory in Postcommunist Romania-  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Florian Alexandru<br>
  Abstract: How is the Holocaust remembered in Romania since the fall of communism? Alexandru Florian and an international group of contributors unveil how and why Romania, a place where large segments of the Jewish and Roma populations perished, still fails to address its recent past. These essays focus on the roles of government and public actors that choose to promote, construct, defend, or contest the memory of the Holocaust, as well as the tools-the press, the media, monuments, and commemorations-that create public memory. Coming from a variety of perspectives, these essays provide a compelling view of what memories exist, how they are sustained, how they can be distorted, and how public remembrance of the Holocaust can be encouraged in Romanian society today.<br>

  Abstract: In 1989, at the time of the December Revolution, Romania had only one highway, 120 kilometers long. In 2017, despite all the strategies to modernize the infrastructure, there are only two highways and parts of a third; there is no highway from north to south, or from east to west. When we think of places of memory,

  Abstract: Public memory may be defined as a relationship with the past expressed in the public space. It finds its expression in the institutionalized elements that connect it to the public space, such as memorials, prevailing discourses, books, courses, and so on. This research relates to the complex issues that the Holocaust, as well as other genocides, might be caused by situations still present in contemporary society, including the fragility of political and social institutions and society’s responsibility to its people, all in the context of post1989 Romania and its road toward democratization.<br>

  Book Title: Echoes of the Tambaran-Masculinity, history and the subject in the work of Donald F. Tuzin<br>
  Publisher: ANU E Press<br>
  Author(s): Roscoe Paul<br>
  Abstract: In the Sepik Basin of Papua New Guinea, ritual culture was dominated by the Tambaran —a male tutelary spirit that acted as a social and intellectual guardian or patron to those under its aegis as they made their way through life. To Melanesian scholarship, the cultural and psychological anthropologist, Donald F. Tuzin, was something of a Tambaran, a figure whose brilliant and fine-grained ethnographic project in the Arapesh village of Ilahita was immensely influential within and beyond New Guinea anthropology. Tuzin died in 2007, at the age of 61. In his memory, the editors of this collection commissioned a set of original and thought provoking essays from eminent and accomplished anthropologists who knew and were influenced by his work. They are echoes of the Tambaran. The anthology begins with a biographical sketch of Tuzin's life and scholarship. It is divided into four sections, each of which focuses loosely around one of his preoccupations. The first concerns warfare history, the male cult and changing masculinity, all in Melanesia. The second addresses the relationship between actor and structure. Here, the ethnographic focus momentarily shifts to the Caribbean before turning back to Papua New Guinea in essays that examine uncanny phenomena, narratives about childhood and messianic promises. The third part goes on to offer comparative and psychoanalytic perspectives on the subject in Fiji, Bali, the Amazon as well as Melanesia. Appropriately, the last section concludes with essays on Tuzin's fieldwork style and his distinctive authorial voice.<br>

  Abstract: Process-relational metaphysics demands careful attention. Like classical metaphysics, process metaphysics is too often quickly dismissed by those who do not understand it or fail to grasp its significance. Too often have contemporary philosophers and theologians viewed process thought as a recent curiosity that must be relegated to the memory of twentieth-century intellectual anomalies. This is because neither the questions process metaphysics addresses nor its complex and sophisticated answers are adequately understood, let alone appreciated. This work tries to treat process thought with the detail and thoroughness required to grasp its true significance. Theologians and philosophers doing metaphysics, as well those<br>

In post-Partition India, Lahore felt a million miles further than Dubai.

  Book Title: The Philosophy of Neo-Noir-  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Conard Mark T.<br>
  Abstract: Film noir is a classic genre characterized by visual elements such as tilted camera angles, skewed scene compositions, and an interplay between darkness and light. Common motifs include crime and punishment, the upheaval of traditional moral values, and a pessimistic stance on the meaning of life and on the place of humankind in the universe. Spanning the 1940s and 1950s, the classic film noir era saw the release of many of Hollywood's best-loved studies of shady characters and shadowy underworlds, including Double Indemnity, The Big Sleep, Touch of Evil, and The Maltese Falcon. Neo-noir is a somewhat loosely defined genre of films produced after the classic noir era that display the visual or thematic hallmarks of the noir sensibility. The essays collected in The Philosophy of Neo-Noir explore the philosophical implications of neo-noir touchstones such as Blade Runner, Chinatown, Reservoir Dogs, Memento, and the films of the Coen brothers. Through the lens of philosophy, Mark T. Conard and the contributors examine previously obscure layers of meaning in these challenging films. The contributors also consider these neo-noir films as a means of addressing philosophical questions about guilt, redemption, the essence of human nature, and problems of knowledge, memory and identity. In the neo-noir universe, the lines between right and wrong and good and evil are blurred, and the detective and the criminal frequently mirror each other's most debilitating personality traits. The neo-noir detective -- more antihero than hero -- is frequently a morally compromised and spiritually shaken individual whose pursuit of a criminal masks the search for lost or unattainable aspects of the self. Conard argues that the films discussed in The Philosophy of Neo-Noir convey ambiguity, disillusionment, and disorientation more effectively than even the most iconic films of the classic noir era. Able to self-consciously draw upon noir conventions and simultaneously subvert them, neo-noir directors push beyond the earlier genre's limitations and open new paths of cinematic and philosophical exploration.<br>

  John Locke, Personal Identity, and Memento from:

  Author(s) Smith Basil<br>
  Abstract: In his
                  Essay concerning Human Understanding,John Locke famously offers an explanation of personal identity. In particular, he holds that our conscious memories constitute our identities.¹ Christopher Nolan’sMemento(2000) tests this theory of personal identity. In the film, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), an insurance investigator from San Francisco, suffers shortterm memory loss as a result of an assault on his wife, Catherine (Jorja Fox), and himself. But now, without his memories, he can hardly function. He insists that his attackers have destroyed his ability to live. Leonard asks: “How can I heal if I cannot feel time?” The question<br>

  Abstract: Spike Lee dramatically announces the tone and perspective of his adaptation of Richard Price’s novel of urban decay,

As David Bordwell points out, they are “highly self-conscious and explicitly addressed to the audience.”¹ Not only do titles and names provide a context for the narrative, but still and moving images oft en “anticipate a motif” or “establish the space of upcoming action.” Credits, Bordewell argues, accumulate significance as “memory is amplified by the ongoing story.”² InClockers, Lee goes<br>

  Book Title: Power and the Past-Collective Memory and International Relations<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Shain Yossi<br>
  Abstract: Only recently have international relations scholars started to seriously examine the influence of collective memory on foreign policy formation and relations between states and peoples. The ways in which the memories of past events are interpreted, misinterpreted, or even manipulated in public discourse create the context that shapes international relations.
      Power and the Pastbrings together leading history and international relations scholars to provide a groundbreaking examination of the impact of collective memory. This timely study makes a contribution to developing a theory of memory and international relations and also examines specific cases of collective memory's influence resulting from the legacies of World War II, the Holocaust, and September 11. Addressing concerns shared by world leaders and international institutions as well as scholars of international studies, this volume illustrates clearly how the memory of past events alters the ways countries interact in the present, how memory shapes public debate and policymaking, and how memory may aid or more frequently impede conflict resolution.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2tt597">Power and the Past</a><br>
  Author(s) Langenbacher Eric<br>
  Abstract: For years, observers have identified a so-called memory boom among scholars and in many societies worldwide—a boom that the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks have only intensified.¹ In some countries the memory of traumatic events is still raw, and processes of settling accounts linger in the current political agenda. Elsewhere, where the seminal events on which collective memories rest are further in the past, the issues involve debating and institutionalizing an appropriate culture of memory and collective identity for future generations. Sometimes the individual and collective wounds fester, waiting for necessary healing through political and judicial processes. Other times<br>

  Abstract: Now that the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, are almost ten years in the past, it may be illuminating to elaborate on three hypotheses concerning the relationship between collective memory and the lessons of the past, on the one hand, and the foreign policies of the United States and the major European powers, especially Germany, on the other. First, despite some difficulties in its application to differing historical settings, the concept of totalitarianism—first applied to fascism, Nazism, and Stalinism—also usefully applies to the secular expression in the Ba’ath regime of Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, along with the religious<br>

  Author(s) Fiorenza Elisabeth Schüssler<br>
  Abstract: In the greek old testament 
                  ekklēsia means the “assembly of the people of Israel before God.” In the New Testament ekklēsia comes through the agency of the Spirit to visible, tangible expression in and through the gathering of God’s people around the table, eating together a meal, breaking the bread, and sharing the cup in memory of Christ’s passion and resurrection. Christian spirituality means eating together, sharing together, drinking together, talking with each other, receiving each other, experiencing God’s presence through each other, and, in doing so, proclaiming the gospel as God’s alternative vision for everyone, especially for those who<br>

  Abstract: In the 1940s, a disabling syndrome was identified in France. This disorder, spasmophilia, which literally means “to like spasms,” was characterized by a range of symptoms including muscular spasms and hyperventilation, as well as cramps, convulsions, loss of memory, insomnia, migraines, stress, anxiety, the “neurotic triad” of hypochondriasis, depression, and hysteria, and other personalized symptoms (Durlach and Bara 2000, 98–9 and 129).

  Author(s) Hatimi Mohammed<br>
  Abstract: The Islamic scholarly literature granted little place to the conversion of the Jews to Islam. Although Christians did so more often for many reasons, many Jews did convert and contributed toward shaping Muslim civilization. The absence of Jewish converts in the collective memory is linked in many cases to Islamic resentment at not having been successful in gathering the Jews, despite the fact that, early on, Muhammad had hoped to find in them an ally on which to build the new religion he was professing. It is therefore the refusal to convert that became a major theme in the Arabic<br>

  Abstract: In 1923, the year Mustafa Kemal Atatürk’s population, Republic of Turkey was created, there were 78,000 members of the Jewish community in Turkey. By the 2000s, the figure had fallen to 17,000. That demographic decline, which even now continues at a slower pace, stands in contrast to the rather prosperous situation of the Jewish population, whose institutions have experienced a clear revival since the late 1990s. That paradox is an expression of the complex relations between the Turkish nation and its Jewish community, and it demonstrates equally complex connections between history and memory. Despite the drop in its population, the<br>

  Author(s) BERMANN SANDRA<br>
  Abstract: René Char’s “Feuillets d’Hypnos” brings before us the lived history of the French resistance, joining traumatic memory with hopes for a future of freedom and human dialogue. Closely intertwined with Char’s own actions as captain on the maquis, the collection of prose poems offers a rare engagement with historical experience in poetic form, both a tragic affirmation of life and, in its own right, a means of resistance. But I also argue here that this example of historical poetry illustrates some important connections between the writing of lived historical event and translation. Both are linguistic acts dedicated to the “survival”<br>

  Book Title: Clan Cleansing in Somalia-The Ruinous Legacy of 1991<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Kapteijns Lidwien<br>
  Abstract: In 1991, certain political and military leaders in Somalia, wishing to gain exclusive control over the state, mobilized their followers to use terror-wounding, raping, and killing-to expel a vast number of Somalis from the capital city of Mogadishu and south-central and southern Somalia. Manipulating clan sentiment, they succeeded in turning ordinary civilians against neighbors, friends, and coworkers. Although this episode of organized communal violence is common knowledge among Somalis, its real nature has not been publicly acknowledged and has been ignored, concealed, or misrepresented in scholarly works and political memoirs-until now. Marshaling a vast amount of source material, including Somali poetry and survivor accounts,
      Clan Cleansing in Somaliaanalyzes this campaign of clan cleansing against the historical background of a violent and divisive military dictatorship, in the contemporary context of regime collapse, and in relationship to the rampant militia warfare that followed in its wake.Clan Cleansing in Somaliaalso reflects on the relationship between history, truth, and postconflict reconstruction in Somalia. Documenting the organization and intent behind the campaign of clan cleansing, Lidwien Kapteijns traces the emergence of the hate narratives and code words that came to serve as rationales and triggers for the violence. However, it was not clans that killed, she insists, but people who killed in the name of clan. Kapteijns argues that the mutual forgiveness for which politicians often so lightly call is not a feasible proposition as long as the violent acts for which Somalis should forgive each other remain suppressed and undiscussed.Clan Cleansing in Somaliaestablishes that public acknowledgment of the ruinous turn to communal violence is indispensable to social and moral repair, and can provide a gateway for the critical memory work required from Somalis on all sides of this multifaceted conflict.<br>

                  Corregidora, a haunting tale about cultural memory and the “counter-memories” of four generations of Afro-Brazilian and African American women. Throughout the novel the protagonist’s great-grandmother talks repeatedly about “conscious” and how the memories of “conscious” are deeper than the “official” historical texts and records. “Conscious,” which Great Gram considers “evidence,” is sedimented in the bodies of the women, all of whom are haunted by the hulking presence of the Portuguese sailor Corregidora, who owned, abused, and abandoned them. Jones describes how these memories extend well beyond the protagonist’s great-grandmother. Indeed, the<br>

  Abstract: Burundi has many claims to fame, none to be envied. Despite widespread assumptions to the contrary, it has the sad distinction of having experienced the first genocide recorded in Central Africa. Although overshadowed in public attention by the far more extensive carnage in Rwanda, to this day the killing of an estimated quarter of a million Hutu at the hands of a Tutsi-dominated army remains deeply etched in the collective memory of the Hutu people. If trust is in such dramatically short supply in Burundi society, this is largely the legacy of a mass crime that has never been officially<br>

  Book Title: Performing the Past-Memory, History, and Identity in Modern Europe<br>
  Publisher: Amsterdam University Press<br>
  Author(s): Winter Jay<br>
  Abstract: Special EURO 10,- discount for our ABG readers: now EURO 24,50 instead of EURO 34,50Performing the Past is an investigation of the multiple social and culture practices through which Europeans have negotiated the space between their history and their memory over the past 200 years. In museums, in opera houses, in the streets, in the schools, in theatres, in films, on the internet and beyond, narratives about the past circulate today at a dizzying speed. Producing and selling them is big business; if the past is indeed a foreign country, there are tens of thousands of tourist agents, guides, and pundits around to help us on our way, for a fee, to be sure.This collection of essays by renowned scholars from, among others, Yale, Columbia, Amsterdam Oxford, Cambridge, New York University and the European University Institute in Florence, is essential reading for anyone interested in today's memory boom. Drawing on different national and disciplinary traditions, the authors ultimately engage us with the ways in which Europeans continue a venerable tradition of finding out who they are, and where they are going, by performing the past.<br>

  Abstract: Over the last decade, memory has been acknowledged as a ‘leading concept’ of cultural studies.¹ The number of books and essays that have appeared on the subject already fill whole libraries. The memory discourse is quickly expanding. There is a growing number of different approaches to cultural memory which exist side by side without taking much notice of one another, let alone engage in a discussion of their various underlying axioms and goals. What the memory discourse still lacks is theoretical rigour, an integral as well as differentiated view of the enterprise, and a self-critical investigation of its central concepts.<br>

At one extreme, we find historical plays from Shakespeare to Strindberg and beyond or the historical operas of Verdi, say, or Glinka; in other words, performances that are tightly organized, fully scripted, and carefully rehearsed. At the other extreme, there are loosely organized, unscripted, and unrehearsed attempts to re-enact past events in<br>

  Abstract: As an art working with time and addressing the ear, music, like poetry, requires and challenges memory. As early as the fourth century, Augustine used the example of music to illustrate his meditations on time and memory, describing the process of understanding a melody that unfolds in time,¹ and Edmund Husserl, in his
                  Untersuchungen zur Phänomenologie des inneren Zeitbewußtseins, used music as the most obvious example of how memory and expectation or, in his terminology, retention and protention, cooperate in the perceptive construction of a melody.² Perceiving and understanding a melody requires memory, the same kind of short-term memory which<br>

In doing so, it draws attention to three interrelated problem areas: 1) the currency of literature is principally shaped by the language of its expression, whereas the currency of memories is principally shaped in societal or political frameworks; 2) the social and political frameworks (i.e. states and institutions) in which cultural memories are current can be less durable and more fluid than the canonicity of certain literary texts; 3) the literary evocation<br>

  Abstract: Many authors have noticed the symbolic deficit that affects the European institutions. European citizens do not feel attached to them. For some this is the inevitable result of a process of integration that is the spill-over effect of economic integration, while for others it is the consequence of the quasisupranational character of the European Union. The current European context is a very interesting case for the study of memory building, both because it is characterized by a complex process of pooling and sharing of sovereignty between nation-states and supranational institutions and because it is a process

  Book Title: Sound Souvenirs-Audio Technologies, Memory and Cultural Practices<br>
  Publisher: Amsterdam University Press<br>
  Author(s): van Dijck José<br>
  Abstract: In recent decades, the importance of sound for remembering the past and for creating a sense of belonging has been increasingly acknowledged. We keep "sound souvenirs" such as cassette tapes and long play albums in our attics because we want to be able to recreate the music and everyday sounds we once cherished. Artists and ordinary listeners deploy the newest digital audio technologies to recycle past sounds into present tunes. Sound and memory are inextricably intertwined, not just through the commercially exploited nostalgia on oldies radio stations, but through the exchange of valued songs by means of pristine recordings and cultural practices such as collecting, archiving and listing. This book explores several types of cultural practices involving the remembrance and restoration of past sounds. At the same time, it theorizes the cultural meaning of collecting, recycling, reciting, and remembering sound and music. This title is available in the OAPEN Library - http://www.oapen.org.<br>

  Abstract: No tradition, intellectual or otherwise, can exist or stay alive without demarcating its own identity from something that is seen as representing its negative counterpart, its ‘other’; and as a result, this ‘other’ necessarily accompanies any tradition, as the shadowy background or dark canvas which allows it to draw the contours of its own identity in the first place. The presence of this shadow can therefore never be forgotten; but in order to fulfill its role as a negative background, neither can it be brought into the full daylight of memory and recollection.

  Book Title: After Representation?-The Holocaust, Literature, and Culture<br>
  Publisher: Rutgers University Press<br>
  Author(s): EHRENREICH ROBERT M.<br>
  Abstract: After Representation?explores one of the major issues in Holocaust studiesùthe intersection of memory and ethics in artistic expression, particularly within literature.As experts in the study of literature and culture, the scholars in this collection examine the shifting cultural contexts for Holocaust representation and reveal how writersùwhether they write as witnesses to the Holocaust or at an imaginative distance from the Nazi genocideùarticulate the shadowy borderline between fact and fiction, between event and expression, and between the condition of life endured in atrocity and the hope of a meaningful existence. What imaginative literature brings to the study of the Holocaust is an ability to test the limits of language and its conventions.After Representation?moves beyond the suspicion of representation and explores the changing meaning of the Holocaust for different generations, audiences, and contexts.<br>

  Abstract: A Holocaust literature that took its imperatives from the existential conditions of the camps would begin always as at the end of culture, in a world of dying, degradation, and atrocity wherein all books and learning exist but as a faint memory of what it meant to be human in some other time, some other place.

  Abstract: Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi wrote over two decades ago about the curious disjunction of memory and history in the years leading up to the middle of the twentieth century in Jewish culture, claiming that if history and memory were to meet in the years following the Shoah, the discursive field in which they might intersect would be not history but fiction (and, one could add, poetry).

  Author(s): EHRENREICH ROBERT M.<br>
  Abstract: After Representation?explores one of the major issues in Holocaust studiesùthe intersection of memory and ethics in artistic expression, particularly within literature.As experts in the study of literature and culture, the scholars in this collection examine the shifting cultural contexts for Holocaust representation and reveal how writersùwhether they write as witnesses to the Holocaust or at an imaginative distance from the Nazi genocideùarticulate the shadowy borderline between fact and fiction, between event and expression, and between the condition of life endured in atrocity and the hope of a meaningful existence. What imaginative literature brings to the study of the Holocaust is an ability to test the limits of language and its conventions.After Representation?moves beyond the suspicion of representation and explores the changing meaning of the Holocaust for different generations, audiences, and contexts.<br>

  Author(s): COHEN LAWRENCE<br>
  Abstract: Bringing together essays by nineteen respected scholars, this volume approaches dementia from a variety of angles, exploring its historical, psychological, and philosophical implications. The authors employ a cross-cultural perspective that is based on ethnographic fieldwork and focuses on questions of age, mind, voice, self, loss, temporality, memory, and affect.<br>

  Author(s) MITTENESS LINDA S.<br>
  Abstract: Midway through our interview, Mrs. Jones, whose husband was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease two years earlier, began talking about a change in her husband that distressed her—his forgetfulness. My immediate association was to short-term memory loss, a core part of the professional criteria of dementia. She then told us a story about his inability to set the alarm in their house in response to her admonitions to do so. Again, her description appeared to conform to the clinical criteria for dementia, which include functional decline and difficulties with higher-order cognitive tasks that require planning and sequencing (executive functioning).

  Abstract: There is evidence to suggest that individuals who complain of memory problems but have no objective deficits constitute between 12 and 30 percent of the patient population that is seen in memory clinics (Almeida et al. 1993; Berrios, Marková, and Girala 2000). There are conflicting views about the clinical significance of such complaints. Berrios, Markovà, and Girala (2000) remark that because these patients do not fit into any accepted definition of memory disorder, attitudes toward “persistent memory complainers with negative neurological, neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric assessments tend to be harsher, particularly in memory clinics whose objective is to collect patients for<br>

  Abstract: Part of the reason for taking on this subject, I guess, was the memory of teenage irritation, more than fifty years ago, when I found myself increasingly frustrated at the many occurrences of “thou,” “thee,” and “ye”; the suffixes “-eth” and “-est”; and “hath,” “spake,” “wist,” “wax,” and “brethren.” It was all so old-fashioned, out of date, not language I would use in any other context than reading the Bible. So I suppose I wanted an opportunity to say how I came to find the KJV less and less satisfactory and satisfying as a translation. Not simply for me in<br>

  Book Title: Imprints, Voiceprints, and Footprints of Memory-Collected Essays of Werner H. Kelber<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Kelber Werner H.<br>
  Abstract: Jesus and his followers defined their allegiances and expressed their identities in a communications culture that manifested itself in voice and chirographic practices, in oral-scribal interfaces, and in performative activities rooted in memory. In the sixteen essays gathered in Imprints, Voiceprints, and Footprints of Memory, Werner Kelber explores the verbal arts of early Christian word processing operative in a media world that was separated by two millennia from our contemporary media history. The title articulates the fact that the ancient culture of voiced texts, hand-copying, and remembering is chiefly accessible to us in print format and predominantly assimilated from print perspectives. The oral-scribal-memorial-performative paradigm developed in these essays challenges the reigning historical-critical model in biblical scholarship. Notions of tradition, the fixation on the single original saying, the dominant methodology of form criticism, and the heroic labors of the Quest—stalwart features of the historical, documentary paradigm—are all subject to a critical review. A number of essays reach beyond New Testament texts, ranging from the pre-Socratic Gorgias through medieval manuscript culture on to print’s triumphant apotheosis in Gutenberg’s Vulgate, product of the high tech of the fifteenth century, all the way to conflicting commemorations of Auschwitz—taking tentative steps toward a history of media technologies, culture, and cognition of the Christian tradition in the West.<br>

  11  The Works of Memory: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjh34">Imprints, Voiceprints, and Footprints of Memory</a><br>
  Abstract: In the human and social sciences, the modern academic study of memory is generally acknowledged to have been initiated by the sociologist Maurice Halbwachs (1925; 1992). Virtually effaced from scholarly consciousness, he received academic acceptance only decades following his death in Buchenwald. His omnipresence in current memory studies owes much to the work of Jan Assmann, himself the author of a classic work on memory theory. In part dependent on Halbwachs and in part quite separately, memory has recently emerged as a pivotal concept in cultural studies and as a principal topic of research in the humanities and social sciences.<br>

  Abstract: While the experience of being “at risk” is newly recognized as presenting a problem for language and literature, pain has long been understood to resist expression in words. At its worst, pain is unchosen, extreme, and without purpose; it obscures memory, thought, language, everything but itself. How can one communicate such an experience? Chronic pain does not present the same challenge to expression as acute pain and even agony can find its way into a story as time passes, but the problem posed by pain remains.

  Book Title: A Self-Conscious Art-Patrick Modiano’s Postmodern Fictions<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): KAWAKAMI AKANE<br>
  Abstract: A Self-Conscious Art is the first full-length study in English to attempt to deal with the formal complexities of Modiano’s work, by reading ‘against the grain’ of his self-professed ingenuousness. A detailed examination of his narratives shows the deeply postmodern nature of his writing. Parodying precursors such as Proust or the nouveau romanciers, his narratives are built around a profound lack of faith in the ability of writing to retrieve the past through memory, and this failure is acknowledged in the discreet playfulness that characterises his novels. This book is a timely introduction to the work of one of the most successful modern French novelists.<br>

  Book Title: Ciaran Carson-Space, Place, Writing<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): ALEXANDER NEAL<br>
  Abstract: Ciaran Carson is one of the most challenging and inventive of contemporary Irish writers, exhibiting verbal brilliance, formal complexity, and intellectual daring across a remarkably varied body of work. This study considers the full range of his oeuvre, in poetry, prose, and translations, and discusses the major themes to which he returns, including: memory and history, narrative, language and translation, mapping, violence, and power. It argues that the singularity of Carson’s writing is to be found in his radical imaginative engagements with ideas of space and place. The city of Belfast, in particular, occupies a crucially important place in his texts, serving as an imaginative focal point around which his many other concerns are constellated. The city, in all its volatile mutability, is an abiding frame of reference and a reservoir of creative impetus for Carson’s imagination. Accordingly, the book adopts an interdisciplinary approach that draws upon geography, urbanism, and cultural theory as well as literary criticism. It provides both a stimulating and thorough introduction to Carson’s work, and a flexible critical framework for exploring literary representations of space.<br>

  CHAPTER FOUR  Revised Versions: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjcgf">Ciaran Carson</a><br>
  Abstract: The importance and complexity of memory in Carson’s aesthetic is apparent when, as in ‘Ambition’, time is conceived as a road that rarely runs straight, its course marked by manifold obstructions and convolutions. After all, the action of taking one step forward, two steps back can be understood in temporal as well as spatial terms, and in Carson’s writing the past typically manifests itself as ‘a trail of moments/Dislocated, then located’ (
                  IFN, 58) that precludes a commanding overview. This much is clear in the opening lines of ‘Ambition’, where the narrator and his father have climbed Black Mountain in order<br>

American anthropologist Richard Price’s study of the role of memory in modern Martinican society examines the strange fate of a social pariah, Médard Aribot, thief and artist, who, following his return from prison on Devil’s Island, divided his time during the final years of his life between Petite-Anse and the town of Le Diamant in the south west of Martinique.<br>

  Abstract: The Bicentenary of the French Revolution in 1989 heralded the series of commemorations by which late twentieth-century France now appears to have been increasingly characterized. In the 1990s, literature, cinema and intellectual debate all began to reflect an increasing focus on memory, a tendency also apparent in popular culture and public life. The historian Pierre Nora, inaugurating in 1984
                  Les Lieux de mémoire, a monumental collection of essays on key ‘sites’ of the French historical experience understood as having had an impact on national self-identity, presented the lack of shared post-war national memory as a rationale for alternative manifestations of<br>

  Abstract: Half a century has passed since the victory of the Allied troops put an abrupt end to Hitler’s ‘final solution of the Jewish question’ – but the memory of the Holocaust goes on polluting the world of the living, and the inventory of its insidious poisons seems anything but complete. We are all to some degree possessed by that memory, though the Jews among us, the prime targets of the Holocaust, are perhaps more than most.¹<br>

  Book Title: Commemorating the Irish Famine-Memory and the Monument<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): MARK-FITZGERALD EMILY<br>
  Abstract: Commemorating the Irish Famine: Memory and the Monument presents for the first time a visual cultural history of the 1840s Irish Famine, tracing its representation and commemoration from the 19th century up to its 150th anniversary in the 1990s and beyond. As the watershed event of 19th century Ireland, the Famine’s political and social impacts profoundly shaped modern Ireland and the nations of its diaspora. Yet up until the 1990s, the memory of the Famine remained relatively muted and neglected, attracting little public attention. Thus the Famine commemorative boom of the mid-1990s was unprecedented in scale and output, with close to one hundred monuments newly constructed across Ireland, Britain, the United States, Canada and Australia. Drawing on an extensive global survey of recent community and national responses to the Famine’s anniversary, and by outlining why these memories matter and to whom, this book argues how the phenomenon of Famine commemoration may be understood in the context of a growing memorial culture worldwide. It offers an innovative look at a well-known migration history whilst exploring how a now-global ethnic community redefines itself through acts of public memory and representation.<br>

  2  Visualizing the Famine: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjkfn">Commemorating the Irish Famine</a><br>
  Abstract: If twentieth-century attempts to give visual form to Famine memory are to be understood within a tradition of Famine image-making, the obvious antecedents lie in the visual representations of the Irish Famine from the nineteenth century. How was the Famine visually represented and interpreted in its own time, and what meanings do such images communicate? The evolution of the visual culture and representational history of ‘the Famine’ has yet to be satisfactorily mapped, and the relationship of its nineteenth-century iconography to latter-day visualizations both troubles and intrigues. This central question of how ‘famine’ (conceptually and historically) might be represented in<br>

  3  Commemorating the Famine: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjkfn">Commemorating the Irish Famine</a><br>
  Abstract: If the visual record of the Famine from the nineteenth century awaits wider recognition and exposition, there is no doubt its visual representation fell sharply from the public eye with the onset of the twentieth.¹ As the Famine moved from direct experience to received memory, a consistent and defined space within the public sphere of memory, Irish visual culture and commemoration failed to coalesce until the 1990s. Although this chapter is largely concerned with the historical, social and political circumstances of Famine memory’s revival during its sesquicentenary and beyond, some initial reflections on its public memorialization prior to the 1990s<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjkfn">Commemorating the Irish Famine</a><br>
  Abstract: As with the monuments of the previous chapter, most community commemorations in Northern Ireland and the diaspora represent vernacular counterparts to officially sanctioned and nationally scaled monumental projects, screened through local concerns, histories and places. Though the rallying cry ‘remember the Famine’ unites these memorials, the outcomes of more than three dozen projects in Northern Ireland, Britain, Canada and the United States constructed since 1990 indicate that key questions of what Famine memory actually
                  isandwhyit should be remembered remain far from consensual.¹ From the outset there were concerns voiced in the Irish media that diasporic, particularly American,<br>

  6  Major Famine Memorials from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjkfn">Commemorating the Irish Famine</a><br>
  Abstract: Monuments to the Irish Famine can be found in communities across three continents; while the majority remain relatively unseen, unknown affairs, a small proportion has attained widespread recognition and attention. These memorials are the products of sustained, well-funded, and organized commemorative efforts, usually supported by an infrastructure of official and/or national bodies, and present an embodiment of Famine memory explicitly intended for wider viewership. As a consequence, many bear the scars of protracted civic negotiation and politicized appropriation, of artistic vision and compromise, and of struggles between competing versions of Irish history and identity. They are, in every sense, ‘monumental’<br>

  Book Title: Spanish Spaces-Landscape, Space and Place in Contemporary Spanish Culture<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): DAVIES ANN<br>
  Abstract: Spanish Spaces is a pioneering study that marries contemporary cultural geography with contemporary Spanish culture. The field of cultural geography has grown both extensively and rapidly, as has the field of cultural analysis and debate on Spanish cultural texts; yet despite a convergence in study between cultural geography (and cultural studies more widely) and cultural texts themselves, this has made little impact to date within the area of contemporary Spanish cultural studies. Yet Spain’s varied terrain, with complex negotiations between rural, urban and coastal (negotiations that have on occasion spilled over into political and violent conflict), and perhaps its very lack of a contemporary landscape tradition familiar to British and German cultural studies, offer the opportunity for fresh insights into questions of landscape, space and place. Drawing on case studies from contemporary Spanish film and literature, Davies explores the themes of memory and forgetting, nationalism and terrorism, crime and detection, gender, tourism and immigration, investigating what it means to think of space and places in specifically Spanish terms.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjnd2">Thresholds of Meaning</a><br>
  Abstract: Over the last thirty years, memory and commemoration studies have become one of the fastest developing interdisciplinary fields in the humanities, attracting the attention of, among others, historians, anthropologists, sociologists, literary critics and art-historians. This growth and the dizzying array of publications produced not only reflect what has been variously described as a memory boom, a memory industry, an addiction to memory and, perhaps most graphically, an ‘immersion in memory and its sites [that] may at times have the quality of junk-Proustian

  Abstract: Adventurous philosophical thought was always at the center of the Pontigny tradition, especially when the philosopher-poet Jean Wahl assumed the direction of Pontigny-en-Amérique after 1942. Wahl invited his favorite American poets, Wallace Stevens and Marianne Moore, along with John Peale Bishop, to speak at Mount Holyoke during the summer of 1943. The topic was to be the relation of poetry and philosophy. Moore lectured on “Feeling and Precision,” carefully choosing her examples of understated eloquence from poetic responses to war. “An unselfish experiment like that of the Pontigny Committee,” she wrote in a letter, “leaves a certain memory of exaltation,<br>

  Abstract: Let me now further explore the semi-public, semi-private cultural realm of unspeakable ‘otherness’ connected to expectations about assimilation introduced in the previous chapter. I will trace how this realm, in 19th-century France, was connected to the idea that assimilation implied secularisation in terms of the transformation of ethno-religious culture into privatised ‘religion’. By exploring this cultural realm through
                     In Search of Lost Timewe will be able to trace how it hosts a specific kind of ethno-religious difference in which othering and secrecy, shame and the cultural memory of religious and cultural difference, intermingle and sometimes clash.<br>

  Abstract: Here is surely a truth now universally acknowledged: that the whole of our cultural inheritance has to be recurated and reedited in digital forms and institutional structures. But as the technology of cultural memory shifts from bibliographical to digital machines, a difficult question arises: what do we do with the books? This is a problem for society at large and many people are working at it, none more assiduously than certain expert persons, often technicians. Highly skilled and motivated as they are, book history and the complex machineries of books fall outside their professional expertise. Humanist scholars, the long-recognized monitors<br>

  Abstract: Since all the cultural materials discussed in this book are resolutely Occidental, I should perhaps say something about how I’ve tried to engage with the global issues facing anyone interested in these things. For my argument holds that digital technology has realized the idea of a new Library of Alexandria. That institution’s dark reciprocal, however, is the global character of the threat to memory, epitomized in the crisis of our languages. Linguists expect that by the end of this century some half of the 7,000 currently recognized languages will be extinct. In a narrow Western view, those losses occur at<br>

On the night of the eighth full moon, when the moonlight is the brightest of the year, each Chinese family celebrates the traditional Mid-Autumn Festival by remembering its family members who live a great distance away.

  Book Title: Relative Histories-Mediating History in Asian American Family Memoirs<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Davis Rocío G.<br>
  Abstract: Relative Histories focuses on the Asian American memoir that specifically recounts the story of at least three generations of the same family. This form of auto/biography concentrates as much on other members of one’s family as on oneself, generally collapses the boundaries conventionally established between biography and autobiography, and in many cases—as Rocío G. Davis proposes for the auto/biographies of ethnic writers—crosses the frontier into history, promoting collective memory. Davis centers on how Asian American family memoirs expand the limits and function of life writing by reclaiming history and promoting community cohesion. She argues that identity is shaped by not only the stories we have been told, but also the stories we tell, making these narratives important examples of the ways we remember our family’s past and tell our community’s story. In the context of auto/biographical writing or filmmaking that explores specific ethnic experiences of diaspora, assimilation, and integration, this work considers two important aspects: These texts re-imagine the past by creating a work that exists both in history and as a historical document, making the creative process a form of re-enactment of the past itself. Each chapter centers on a thematic concern germane to the Asian American experience: the narrative of twentieth-century Asian wars and revolutions, which has become the subtext of a significant number of Asian American family memoirs (Pang-Mei Natasha Chang’s Bound Feet and Western Dress, May-lee and Winberg Chai’s The Girl from Purple Mountain, K. Connie Kang’s Home Was The Land of Morning Calm, Doung Van Mai Elliott’s The Sacred Willow); family experiences of travel and displacement within Asia in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which unveil a history of multiple diasporas that are often elided after families immigrate to the United States (Helie Lee’s Still Life With Rice, Jael Silliman’s Jewish Portraits, Indian Frames, Mira Kamdar’s Motiba’s Tattoos); and the development of Chinatowns as family spaces (Maxine Hong Kingston’s China Men, Lisa See’s On Gold Mountain, Bruce Edward Hall’s Tea that Burns). The final chapter analyzes the discursive possibilities of the filmed family memoir ("family portrait documentary"), examining Lise Yasui’s A Family Gathering, Ruth Ozeki Lounsbury’s Halving the Bones, and Ann Marie Fleming’s The Magical Life of Long Tack Sam. Davis concludes the work with a metaliterary engagement with the history of her own Asian diasporic family as she demonstrates the profound interconnection between forms of life writing.<br>

At the same time, memories of the past, in literature as in life, are commonly anchored in places, landscapes, or buildings. As approaches to the study of culture, ecocriticism and cultural memory studies differ in their principal concerns: while the former relates to nature and space, and examines cultural constructions of the natural environment, the latter is oriented toward history and time, and principally preoccupied with representations and understandings of the social, in formulations relating the<br>

  Abstract: Some of the most innovative writers of contemporary literature are writing in diaspora in their second or third language. Here Azade Seyhan describes the domain of transnational poetics they inhabit. She begins by examining the works of selected bilingual and bicultural writers of the United States (including Oscar Hijuelos, Maxine Hong Kingston, and Eva Hoffman) and Germany (Libuse Moníková, Rafik Schami, and E. S. Özdamar, among others), developing a new framework for understanding the relationship between displacement, memory, and language. Considering themes of loss, witness, translation, identity, and exclusion, Seyhan interprets diasporic literatures as condensed archives of cultural and linguistic memory that give integrity and coherence to pasts ruptured by migration.<br>

  Abstract: The words of the eighteenth-century German Romantic poet Novalis (Friedrich von Hardenberg) resonate beyond the boundaries of their history and geography and are poignantly rearticulated by a contemporary master of the arts of memory. Salman Rushdie’s critical sentiment stands as a testimony to the labor of remembrance that reclaims the lost experience of another time and place in language and imagination. The work of commemoration is often the only means of releasing our (hi)stories from subjugation to official or institutionalized regimes of forgetting.

  Abstract: In
                  Migrancy, Culture, Identity, Iain Chambers presents a well-orchestrated medley of personal memory, philosophical reflection, anthropological and literary theory, cultural criticism, social commentary, well-positioned quotations, and photographs to communicate how notions of identity and geography shift and shape as they travel through myriad languages and cultures, across borders and histories. At one level, this book can be read as the long version of Chambers’s curriculum vitae, his ownBildungsroman.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7s8h3">Writing Outside the Nation</a><br>
  Abstract: Whether removed from the subject by one or more generations, several decades, or a few years, the memory and images of nation continue to inhabit the exilic imagination. The symbolic registers of the nation usually increase proportionately to the length of time spent outside the nation, and the loyalties that bind the “imagined community” (Anderson) diverge into smaller communities bound by gender, class, caste, religion, home region, profession, language, and dialect. The concept of a sacred mythical originary nation, Aztlán, developed at the height of the Chicano movement as a source of identification and identity formation in a diasporic community<br>

  AFTERWORD from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7s8h3">Writing Outside the Nation</a><br>
  Abstract: The transnational and “bilingual” narratives of the present study foster an awareness of the contingencies of power structures and value systems in history. Consequently, they guide the reader away from narrowly defined or unreflected positions of interpretation. “As other histories emerge from the archaeology of modernity to disturb the monologue of History,” writes Iain Chambers, “we are reminded of the multiple rhythms of life that have been written out and forgotten.”¹ Benjamin’s reflections on history suggest that the narratives of the powerful are remembered as history, but those of the disenfranchised need to be “wrested away” as memory from the<br>

  Book Title: The Harmony of Illusions-Inventing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Young Allan<br>
  Abstract: As far back as we know, there have been individuals incapacitated by memories that have filled them with sadness and remorse, fright and horror, or a sense of irreparable loss. Only recently, however, have people tormented with such recollections been diagnosed as suffering from "post-traumatic stress disorder." Here Allan Young traces this malady, particularly as it is suffered by Vietnam veterans, to its beginnings in the emergence of ideas about the unconscious mind and to earlier manifestations of traumatic memory like shell shock or traumatic hysteria. In Young's view, PTSD is not a timeless or universal phenomenon newly discovered. Rather, it is a "harmony of illusions," a cultural product gradually put together by the practices, technologies, and narratives with which it is diagnosed, studied, and treated and by the various interests, institutions, and moral arguments mobilizing these efforts.<br>

  One  Making Traumatic Memory from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7swhj">The Harmony of Illusions</a><br>
  Abstract: A century ago, a new kind of memory was born, at the intersection of two streams of scientific inquiry: somatic and psychological. The somatic stream dates from the 1860s and the discovery of a previously unidentified kind of assault, called “nervous shock.” The psychological stream begins earlier, in the 1790s, and leads to the discovery of a previously unidentified kind of forgetting, called “repression” and “dissociation.” By the 1890s, nervous shock and repression/dissociation have been conjoined to produce

  Abstract: In Alfred Hitchcock’s film,
                  Spellbound(1944), Gregory Peck plays the victim of a traumatic neurosis similar to PTSD. He is tormented by a memory he cannot recall but is certain that it concerns an act of terrible violence. He also suffers from a mysterious phobic horror of objects decorated with parallel lines. By the film’s end, it is discovered that the phobia mirrors a visual element of his traumatic experience, which involved attempted homicide and accidental death on a downhill ski slope. Like many of the patients who speak on the following pages, the Gregory Peck character is chronically angry<br>

  CHAPTER TWO  Telling Time in War from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7t6rs">War at a Distance</a><br>
  Abstract: This chapter extends the thought that the experience of war at a distance, of a mediated war, is fundamentally dislocating, and that such dislocation expresses itself most frequently and forcefully through our sense of the movement (or stasis) of time, through temporalities. Thus the wartime poems set on a winter’s evening, considered in the prelude, elaborate the simplest markers of time (winter, evening) into channels of memory and prophecy, avenues of recursivity and nodes of stillness. Wartime in modernity refers not to a single temporal mode—
                  thetime of war. Rather it houses many temporalities, each one, as we will<br>

  Abstract: Understanding war. This book has been asking what war meant to a population whose experience and memory were shaped by warfare, a population whose armies and navies were almost constantly engaged in military conflict across the globe, though rarely, if ever, on home ground. It has asked how war was understood by those who were, at least as subjects of a sovereign state, often at war, though never actually in battle. But it has not yet asked what it meant to make war an object of understanding.<br>

  Abstract: Human memory is a tricky phenomenon. We remember so easily what we take pleasure in recalling, and also what we most definitely do
                  notwish to recall. Sometimes if one is quick and nimble enough, one can even catch the process of “reconstructing” one’s past in memory on the hop, that is, one can recall the original impression and also the gradual way in which it began to fade, shift, and be transformed. Very occasionally, the original experience is so vivid, one cannot help thinking it is preserved in the mind in a form that excludes serious error or uncertainty<br>

  Abstract: Roy Pascal has observed that autobiography involves an interplay or collusion between the past and the present, that indeed its significance is more truly understood as the revelation of the present situation of the autobiographer than as the uncovering of his past.¹ As readers of autobiography we ordinarily do need to be reminded of this obvious truth, even though Freud and his followers have shaken our faith in the ability of memory to provide reliable access to the contents of the past. When we settle into the theater of autobiography, what we are ready to believe—and what most autobiographers<br>

While mainly focusing on Germany (though not exclusively), the authors analyze different forms of popular historiographies and popular presentations of history since 1800 and the interrelation between popular and academic historiography, exploring in particular popular histories in different media and popular historiography as part of memory culture.<br>

                  composeror even the best-knownpianist—these, in Hanslick’s view, had already faded from public memory.

  Author(s) Meyer Christian<br>
  Abstract: The International Rhetoric Culture Project has stated in its theoretical outline that “just as rhetoric is founded in culture, culture is founded in rhetoric.” The first part of this chiasmus can readily be accepted, since cross-cultural research on speaker performance, memory techniques, social expression of emotion, practical reasoning, and the interrelation between speaking styles and political organization have provided abundant evidence that rhetoric is culture-specific. Extensive research in folklore studies, the ethnography of speaking, and linguistic anthropology have also proved this claim over and over again, the most spectacular cases being the use of parallelism and metaphor (e.g., Fox 1988,<br>

  Book Title: Dark Traces of the Past-Psychoanalysis and Historical Thinking<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Rüsen Jörn<br>
  Abstract: The relationship between historical studies and psychoanalysis remains an open debate that is full of tension, in both a positive and a negative sense. In particular, the following question has not been answered satisfactorily: what distinguishes a psychoanalytically oriented study of historical realities from a historical psychoanalysis? Skepticism and fear of collaboration dominate on both sides. Initiating a productive dialogue between historical studies and psychoanalysis seems to be plagued by ignorance and, at times, a sense of helplessness. Interdisciplinary collaborations are rare. Empirical research, formulation of theory, and the development of methods are essentially carried out within the conventional disciplinary boundaries. This volume undertakes to overcome these limitations by combining psychoanalytical and historical perspectives and thus exploring the underlying "unconscious" dimensions and by informing academic and nonacademic forms of historical memory. Moreover, it puts special emphasis on transgenerational forms of remembrance, on the notion of trauma as a key concept in this field, and on case studies that point the way to further research.<br>

  Book Title: Dark Traces of the Past-Psychoanalysis and Historical Thinking<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Rüsen Jörn<br>
  Abstract: The relationship between historical studies and psychoanalysis remains an open debate that is full of tension, in both a positive and a negative sense. In particular, the following question has not been answered satisfactorily: what distinguishes a psychoanalytically oriented study of historical realities from a historical psychoanalysis? Skepticism and fear of collaboration dominate on both sides. Initiating a productive dialogue between historical studies and psychoanalysis seems to be plagued by ignorance and, at times, a sense of helplessness. Interdisciplinary collaborations are rare. Empirical research, formulation of theory, and the development of methods are essentially carried out within the conventional disciplinary boundaries. This volume undertakes to overcome these limitations by combining psychoanalytical and historical perspectives and thus exploring the underlying "unconscious" dimensions and by informing academic and nonacademic forms of historical memory. Moreover, it puts special emphasis on transgenerational forms of remembrance, on the notion of trauma as a key concept in this field, and on case studies that point the way to further research.<br>

  CHAPTER 2  Reality of Representation, Reality behind Representation: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qd1wz">A Lover's Quarrel with the Past</a><br>
  Abstract: The two terms that form a contrasting pair are
                  effacement(forgetfulness) andconservation.Memory is, always and necessarily, an interaction between the two. The complete restitution of the past is terrifying and a clear impossibility (one, however, that Borges imagined in his story of ‘Funes, the Memorious’). Memory is essentially a selection: certain traits of an event are conserved, others immediately or progressively set aside and forgotten. Hence it is baffling that the ability Computers have to save information is termed memory, since they lack a basic feature of memory,<br>

  Abstract: If memory is to be collective and useful, “an altar cannot be in honor of, but is to the memory of a person” (Camon 1978: 84). The memory of major events tends to crystallize, to acquire a fixed frame of interpretations and analysis, suggested by personal feelings and political beliefs. Tragedies, especially when highly shocking, tend to turn into “legendary” narratives, and the more important they are, the harder it becomes to examine them critically. The events of July 2001 in Genoa are already part of a militant legend. The death of Carlo Giuliani during the G8 riots was instantly<br>

  Abstract: With this letter, Zalmen Gradowski, a worker in a Sonderkommando unit at Auschwitz, issued an invitation. Enter the “eternally traveling Jewish train,” he asked, a plea that is not limited to wartime trains if one looks at the image of the freight car housed in the permanent exhibition at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) in Washington, DC (see Figure 4.1). The image of the freight car fuses historical space and contemporary memory practices. By looking at the platform of Auschwitz from the departure side of the rail car, the photo promises an Auschwitz arrival to the museum visitor.<br>

  Abstract: Conclusions are difficult to write. They promise findings and outcomes, claims and counterclaims. Where does the story of deportation begin and end? Is it more than a journey caught between rhetoric and pain? Why are the trains seemingly on standby to return us to the past, as though we had never left it? Although the Holocaust took place in the 1930s and 1940s in Europe, its memory routes remain open and continue to guide passengers to the dark places of compulsive return and witness. Recall the scene at Oswiecim, Poland on 27 January 2005, the sixtieth anniversary of the liberation<br>

  Abstract: On a trip to Europe in June and July 2007, the themes of transit and memory weighed heavily on me, as they had for many years. But the weight of that past was intellectual. I labored over it, daunted by the responsibility of the task, letting the experiences of the European victims defeat me and my limited abilities at telling their stories. I sorted through the testimony, the theory, what other people had said about deportation, and how people suffered because of it. Trains and trauma were known mainly through books and other people’s words, and not from experiences of<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qdcbq">Narrating the Nation</a><br>
  Author(s) Rigney Ann<br>
  Abstract: Recent years have seen considerable advances in our understanding of the ways in which societies recollect their past. Where earlier discussions were often derived from psychological models, there has been a growing realisation in various fields that collective memory should be studied in the first instance as a cultural phenomenon: as the product of the historically variable cultural practices that bring images of the past into circulation. After all, communication in some form or other, even if this is only between parent and child, is a prerequisite for transferring recollections and making them social. The past can only be invested<br>

  Abstract: One of Thomas Bernhard’s most historically specific plays,
                  Vor dem Ruhestand(Eve of Retirement, 1979) is also one of his most ritualistic. A play of “doubleness” and unsynthesizable tensions, it is both realistic and metaphoric, structured both causally and cyclically. Steeped in public history, it simultaneously ritualizes history through private memory. This doubleness—the coexistence of historical and ahistorical consciousness, of development and stasis, time and timelessness—is, no doubt, central to Bernhard’s work as a whole; and it is knowingly, indeed pointedly used by Bernhard in this play to both reflect and implicate the history and memory of his<br>

  Author(s) Spencer Margaret Meek<br>
  Abstract: As recent classical scholarship makes plain, reading is a human, deictic invention. Evidence comes from the evolution of ancient alphabetic writing systems: Sumerian (cuneiform), Akkadian (
                  Gilgamesh), Ugaritic (a fine, delicate script), and Egyptian hieroglyphs. Texts on stone and papyrus proved to be more lasting ways of recalling past events than human memory. Long, long before twentieth-century educators would debate whether reading should be taught by phonics or meaning-based methods, the Sumerians showed their young writers how to make word lists on clay tablets by incorporating elements of both of these pedagogies in their instruction.

  Author(s) FERNÀNDEZ JOSEP-ANTON<br>
  Abstract: Recent scholarship on Catalan culture has tended to focus on space, urban geography and memory in relation to place. The city of Barcelona has been the obvious case study, not just because of its international projection, but also because of its position as a site of symbolic struggles with regards to Catalan identity (see Epps, 2004; Johnson, 2006; Resina, 2008a). By virtue of its very title, Ventura Pons’s nineteenth feature film,
                  Barcelona (Un mapa)(2007), would therefore seem to be an ideal object for analysis from this kind of perspective. Indeed, the film’s title appears to point to the centrality<br>

  Abstract: The events and actors of the Algerian war hold an ambiguous place in recent French history, particularly given the way in which the war was actively erased from national memory soon after Algerian independence.¹ However, since the early 1990s, narratives of the war have re-emerged in France, taking complex and often conflicting positions which have escalated to the level of ‘memory wars’.² The contrast between the recent, violent return of Algerian war memories and the long preceding period of societal amnesia has meant that the persistent memories of the metropolitan French populace generated during the conflict are often overlooked.

Centred around an interracial family unit, the film explores the effects of (neo-) colonialism on concepts of race, cultural memory and identity politics, proposing contemporary Africa as a borderland in which hybridity flourishes. By foregrounding the experiences of mixed-race women and their families, and examining personal and cultural histories and identities, the film<br>

And indeed, a collective turn to memory – variously referred to as an industry, a boom, an avalanche, and a crisis – undeniably began to materialize in both Western culture and critical discourse in the late 1990s.¹ As elaborated by Andreas Huyssen, this turn can be mapped along three trajectories: the rejection of modernity’s blind trust in progress and development, the articulation of anxiety around<br>

  Abstract: The films of the late Theo Angelopoulos have been praised for their historical ambition, political themes and explorations of memory, but also for their commitment to cinematic modernism. For some critics, like David Bordwell, Angelopoulos is a late modernist auteur whose ‘anachronistic’ cinematic style bears the hallmarks of 1960s and ’70s ‘political modernism’ (1997: 106; see also Rodowick 1988). For others, like Fredric Jameson, Angelopoulos’ work is best understood as hybrid or transitional: grounded in an aesthetic and historical sensibility that combines progressive elements, which render collective memory through a materialist aesthetic, and regressive elements, which revert to an individualistic,<br>

Not surprisingly, this extends as far back as Plato and Aristotle as well as being found in the more recent philosophical thinking of writers as diverse as Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900), Sigmund Freud (1856–1939), Émile Durkheim (1858–1917), Henri Bergson (1859–1941) and Walter Benjamin (1892–1940). It has developed from early sixteenth-century beliefs that ‘memory could offer unmediated access to experience or to external reality’ (Radstone and Hodgkin 2005: 9) to late nineteenth-century challenges; as ‘modernity’s<br>

  Abstract: Before providing a critical overview of key theories of memory (personal, collective, mediated and new), let us take a well-known example that elicits the discourses on media and memory this chapter is concerned with. This will help us to understand the ways in which memory operates as extrapolated by Paul Connerton in 
                  How Societies Remember (1989): through cognitive and performative modes. In the cognitive mode, the past is past and we retrieve events and experiences from the past into the present: through the act of remembering. In the performative, the past is brought into the present as a commemorative act<br>

  Abstract: Media and the development and history of media from the printing press to the blogosphere have been caught in a tension between democracy and control. Pierre Nora has argued that a ‘democratization of history’ can occur if emancipatory versions of the past surface: ‘Unlike history, which has always been in the hands of the public authorities, of scholars and specialised peer groups, memory has acquired all the new privileges and prestige of a popular protest movement’ (2002: 6). Therefore a free and creative media brings with it democracy, or at least the possibility of democratisation. New media technologies of digital<br>

  Abstract: There is a tendency within media studies to ignore sound. The visual image has dominated: art, photography, advertising, film, television, video games, online media, mobile phones. Just compare the amount of scholarly texts on television to radio, on cinema and gaming rather than soundtracks and soundscapes. Even the mobile phone, which is essentially a listening device, has only become interesting to media studies since it has a screen interface of applications, games, graphics, e-mail, photos and videos. When it comes to memory we assume that the visual dominates and structures our understanding of the world. We do not assume that<br>

  Abstract: The previous case study chapters have drawn upon particular examples of memory being articulated through the broadcast media of radio and television as well as post-broadcast media platforms such as YouTube. The emphasis has been on the mediation (van Dijck 2007) and mediatisation (Livingstone 2008) of history and memory in terms of local, national and international events or persons. As each chapter has progressed, so too has the consideration of the level and extent of audience involvement in the construction of making mediated memories.

  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): McNeill Isabelle<br>
  Abstract: A vital rethinking of memory and the moving image for the digital age, Isabelle McNeill investigates the role of the moving image in cultural memory, considering the impact of digital technologies on visual culture. Drawing on an interdisciplinary range of theoretical resources and an unusual body of films and moving image works, the author examines the ways in which recent French filmmaking conceptualises both the past and the workings of memory. Ultimately the author argues that memory is an intersubjective process, in which filmic forms continue to play a crucial role even as new media come to dominate our contemporary experience.Memory and the Moving Image:*Introduces new ways of thinking about the relation between film and memory, arising from a compelling, interdisciplinary study of theories and films*Subtly explores the French context while drawing theoretical conclusions with wider implications and applicability*Provides detailed and illuminating close readings of varied moving image works to aid theoretical explorations*Moves away from auteurist approaches, examining work by canonical directors including Jean-Luc Godard, Chris Marker and Agnès Varda alongside that of less well-known filmmakers such as Claire Simon and Yamina Benguigui*Brings together thinkers such as Bergson, Deleuze, Bazin and Barthes with, for example, Rodowick and Mulvey, in an engaging interweaving of theories.Works considered include Jean-Luc Godard's Histoire(s) du Cinéma (1989-98), Yamina Benguigui's Mémoires d'Immigrés (1997), Chris Marker's CD-ROM Immemory (1998), Claire Simon's Mimi (2003), Michael Haneke's Caché (2005) and Agnès Varda's multi-media exhibition, L'Île et Elle (2006).<br>

  Author(s): Murphy Christopher J.<br>
  Abstract: The first introduction to writing about intelligence and intelligence services. Secrecy has never stopped people from writing about intelligence. From memoirs and academic texts to conspiracy-laden exposés and spy novels, writing on intelligence abounds. Now, this new account uncovers intelligence historiography's hugely important role in shaping popular understandings and the social memory of intelligence. In this first introduction to these official and unofficial histories, a range of leading contributors narrate and interpret the development of intelligence studies as a discipline. Each chapter showcases new archival material, looking at a particular book or series of books and considering issues of production, censorship, representation and reception.<br>

  Book Title: Archives, Documentation, and Institutions of Social Memory-Essays from the Sawyer Seminar<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Rosenberg William G.<br>
  Abstract: As sites of documentary preservation rooted in various national and social contexts, artifacts of culture, and places of uncovering, archives provide tangible evidence of memory for individuals, communities, and states, as well as defining memory institutionally within prevailing political systems and cultural norms. By assigning the prerogatives of record keeper to the archivist, whose acquisition policies, finding aids, and various institutionalized predilections mediate between scholarship and information, archives produce knowledge, legitimize political systems, and construct identities. Far from being mere repositories of data, archives actually embody the fragments of culture that endure as signifiers of who we are, and why. The essays in A
      rchives, Documentation, and Institutions of Social Memoryconceive of archives not simply as historical repositories but as a complex of structures, processes, and epistemologies situated at a critical point of the intersection between scholarship, cultural practices, politics, and technologies.<br>

Consequently, the archives are organized to support the production process, and any other function is secondary to that objective. At the same time, by default not design, television archives contain the cultural legacy of the twentieth century and play a key role in the infrastructure of modern memory.

  Abstract: Institutions of social memory in Bosnia-Herzegovina have undergone dramatic changes in status, ownership, and management during the 1990s. Several institutions were physically damaged or destroyed during the siege of Sarajevo (1992–95) and required reconstitution and rebuilding on a large scale. But even before the war began, the triumph of nationalist political forces and the end of socialist rule had initiated far-reaching changes in the country’s major institutions. Nationalist leaders reconstructed some long-standing institutions, allowed others to atrophy, and established new ones in support of their political and cultural objectives.

We cultivate consciousness and memory in the ways we move, registering correlative emotional attunements. We absolutely cannot escape the

  Book Title: The Minor Intimacies of Race-Asian Publics in North America<br>
  Publisher: University of Illinois Press<br>
  Author(s): Daniels Roger<br>
  Abstract: An attempt to put an Asian woman on Canada's $100 bill in 2012 unleashed enormous controversy. The racism and xenophobia that answered this symbolic move toward inclusiveness revealed the nation's trumpeted commitment to multiculturalism as a lie. It also showed how multiple minor publics as well as the dominant public responded to the ongoing issue of race in Canada. In this new study, Christine Kim delves into the ways cultural conversations minimize race's relevance even as violent expressions and structural forms of racism continue to occur. Kim turns to literary texts, artistic works, and media debates to highlight the struggles of minor publics with social intimacy. Her insightful engagement with everyday conversations as well as artistic expressions that invoke the figure of the Asian allows Kim to reveal the affective dimensions of racialized publics. It also extends ongoing critical conversations within Asian Canadian and Asian American studies about Orientalism, diasporic memory, racialized citizenship, and migration and human rights. An original reconsideration of foundational concerns, The Minor Intimacies of Race focuses on the ephemeral and the nuanced to reveal the social hierarchies and power structures inherent in today's North America.<br>

  Abstract: Dance is usually considered the most ephemeral form of art in Western society. This transitory character of dance dominates both historical and contemporary discourse. Nonetheless, historical investigations trace not only the history of dance, but also demonstrate how dance embodies historic and cultural corporealities. Only in more recent years, however, has a focus on history and memory appeared in research on contemporary European concert dance. As Aleida Assmann states, “Today it is most prominently art, which discovers the crisis of memory as its topic and finds new modes in which the dynamic process of cultural memory and forgetting configures.”¹ For<br>

  Abstract: Media and thinking are intimately related. Our memory, perception, and cognition are not just a given, as weightless, immaterial processes taking place purely mentally behind the walls of our skull, but also always already rest on a medial basis. As Nietzsche claims, “Our writing equipment takes part in the forming of our thoughts” (Unser Schreibzeug arbeitet mit an unseren Gedanken).¹ From here we can derive the media-philosophical insight that a new medium makes us think differently. Media thus reveal themselves as the body or, better, the different bodies of thought. It is important to note these bodies are not retroactive<br>

  Book Title: Commemorating and Forgetting-Challenges for the New South Africa<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): MURRAY MARTIN J.<br>
  Abstract: How is the historical past made to appear in the present? In addressing these questions, Murray reveals how collective memory is stored and disseminated in architecture, statuary, monuments and memorials, literature, and art-"landscapes of remembrance" that selectively recall and even fabricate history in the service of nation-building. He examines such vehicles of memory in postapartheid South Africa and parses the stories they tell-stories by turn sanitized, distorted, embellished, and compressed. In this analysis,
      Commemorating and Forgettingmarks a critical move toward recognizing how the legacies and impositions of white minority rule, far from being truly past, remain embedded in, intertwined with, and imprinted on the new nation's here and now.<br>

  1  The Power of Collective Memory from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctt32bck0">Commemorating and Forgetting</a><br>
  Abstract: Collective memory is not at all like a living organism that develops and matures on its own accord in linear time, as present disappears into past. Instead, it is something that is socially constructed and socially situated—not only incubated in the shared desire to preserve that which is worth remembering but also fashioned in such a way as to connect it to an “eternal present.” Collective remembrance is absolutely essential for connecting the past with the future. Without memory, there is no grounding in the present or ability to imagine the future. It endows past events and persons with<br>

  2  White Lies: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctt32bck0">Commemorating and Forgetting</a><br>
  Abstract: What becomes of the social memories of settler colonialism and white minority rule when the myth-laden, sociocultural world of their making lies in ruins?¹ The end of apartheid and the transition to parliamentary democracy triggered what amounted to a crisis of collective memory that left citizens of the “new South Africa” without the stable reference points necessary for building a shared sense of national identity. Pierre Nora captured a sense of this dilemma in his famous aphorism: “We speak so much of memory because there is so little of it left.”² What should be remembered and how? Where do old-fashioned<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctt32bck0">Commemorating and Forgetting</a><br>
  Abstract: The erection of monuments and memorials—along with the choreographed ceremonies of commemoration centered on them and the orchestration of public participation around them—transforms particular places into ideologically charged sites of collective memory. Monuments and memorials are powerful mnemonic devices through which the custodians of collective memory seek to encode particular histories and geographies into landscapes of power and resistance. They provide rallying points for shared memories and common identities. They are material signifiers of ideas, transmitters of sentiments, and repositories of ideologies that their permanent affixture to public space intends to immortalize. The elaborate language of symbolism and<br>

  5  Haunted Heritage: from:

  Abstract: Urban landscapes are densely textured places where both material and immaterial traces of the past cling stubbornly to the social fabric, refusing to fade into obscurity. The meaning of a place depends in large measure upon the residues of memory that are embedded there. The thickness of these memory-traces indicates the lingering presence of unresolved tensions and unrealized hopes for the future.¹<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctt32bck0">Commemorating and Forgetting</a><br>
  Abstract: In the aftermath of tragedy, collective memory can become attached to a specific place: sites of loss can be marked, set aside, and sanctified as “hollowed ground.” Particular places—Robben Island, the Hector Pieterson Memorial, the District Six Museum, the commemorative plaque in Gugulethu dedicated to the memory of Amy Biehl, the bronze statue of Steve Biko in East London, and more—have become the fixed, externalized locations of what was once an internalized social memory.¹ As the located presence of the past, these places can be transformed into pilgrimage destinations. As spatially demarcated places set aside for public viewing,<br>

The memory of war intervenes inescapably in the relations among states, whether bringing them together or driving them apart. It gives rise, year after year, at predetermined dates and in predetermined places, to appeals for forgiveness, symbolic gestures of reconciliation, just as, here and there, it is used to recall unpaid debts and persistent misapprehensions, as well as absolutions that wait enduringly upon unuttered pleas for forgiveness.

  Abstract: The draft title for this chapter was “What is memory?” Such a title invites a single and univocal definition of the term. Though not involving a logical contradiction, asking what memory is (in singular) may seem at odds with offering to study processes of memory construction, of memories in the plural, and of social disputes over memories, their social legitimacy, and claims to “truth.” This chapter attempts to advance some conceptual issues in order to offer some tools for further analytical and empirical steps.

  Abstract: The relationship between memory and history is nowadays a central preoccupation within several fields of the social sciences. Debates and reflection on the subject are most extensive and intensive within the discipline of history itself, particularly among those scholars who, recognizing that the historian’s craft extends beyond the mere “reconstruction” of what “actually” happened, deploy more complex modes of analysis in their work. An initial complexity emerges from the recognition that what “actually happened” includes the subjective perceptions and experiences of social actors. Furthermore, historical knowledge includes interpretive processes, the construction and selection of the “facts,” and the selection of<br>

  Abstract: In phenomenology and classical film theory, “the trace” relates both to the materiality of an imprint and to the experience of an irrevocable past. It is conceived of as an indexical sign, an existential operator interrelating image, history, and memory. Traditionally it is an object, a mark inscribed, or a photograph that bears witness of life or events in the past.<br>

  Author(s) WAHLBERG MALIN<br>
  Abstract: In phenomenology and classical film theory, “the trace” relates both to the materiality of an imprint and to the experience of an irrevocable past. It is conceived of as an indexical sign, an existential operator interrelating image, history, and memory. Traditionally it is an object, a mark inscribed, or a photograph that bears witness of life or events in the past.<br>

  Abstract: One of the key features of politics in Korea is a persistently recurring state of military tension. The roots of this conflict are historical: as a result of the emerging Soviet-American rivalry at the end of World War II, the Korean peninsula was tentatively divided along the thirtyeighth parallel. With the creation of two politically and ideologically separate Korean states in 1948, and their subsequent confrontation during the Korean War, the patterns for conflict in northeast Asia were set. In 1953 the Armistice Agreement ended three years of intense fighting that killed more than a million people. But the memory<br>

  Book Title: Counter-Archive-Film, the Everyday, and Albert Kahn's Archives de la Planète<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): AMAD PAULA<br>
  Abstract: Tucked away in a garden on the edge of Paris is a multimedia archive like no other: Albert Kahn's
      Archives de la Planète(1908-1931). Kahn's vast photo-cinematographic experiment preserved world memory through the privileged lens of everyday life, andCounter-Archivesituates this project in its biographic, intellectual, and cinematic contexts. Tracing the archive's key influences, such as the philosopher Henri Bergson, the geographer Jean Brunhes, and the biologist Jean Comandon, Paula Amad maps an alternative landscape of French cultural modernity in which vitalist philosophy cross-pollinated with early film theory, documentary film with the avant-garde, cinematic models of temporality with the early Annales school of history, and film's appropriation of the planet with human geography and colonial ideology. At the heart of the book is an insightful meditation upon the transformed concept of the archive in the age of cinema and an innovative argument about film's counter-archival challenge to history. The first comprehensive study of Kahn's films,Counter-Archivealso offers a vital historical perspective on debates involving archives, media, and memory.<br>

  3  THE COUNTER-ARCHIVE OF CINEMATIC MEMORY from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/amad13500">Counter-Archive</a><br>
  Abstract: In the first decades of their emergence, photography and film inspired artists and intellectuals to debate their implications for a diverse range of aesthetic, scientific, and philosophical issues. Underlying many of these debates was the impact of these new recording devices upon conceptions of memory. Both Baudelaire’s infamous diatribe against photography and Bergson’s equally renowned denunciation of 
                  photographie animée centered on the association of the new media with a debased if professionally useful form of memory. Proust’s related literary inquiry into photographic and cinematographic understandings of memory, whose first stirrings we find in the above fragment from his unfinished novel<br>

  Book Title: A Materialism for the Masses-Saint Paul and the Philosophy of Undying Life<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Blanton Ward<br>
  Abstract: Nietzsche and Freud saw Christianity as metaphysical escapism, with Nietzsche calling the religion a "Platonism for the masses" and faulting Paul the apostle for negating more immanent, material modes of thought and political solidarity. Integrating this debate with the philosophies of difference espoused by Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, Jacques Lacan, and Pier Paolo Pasolini, Ward Blanton argues that genealogical interventions into the political economies of Western cultural memory do not go far enough in relation to the imagined founder of Christianity.<br>

  Abstract: READ SIMILARLY TO NIETZSCHE, FREUD FOR ME WAS CORRECT inasmuch as he understood Paulinism as a kind of counterpoint to the “religion” of the people of Moses. But Freud was still not sleuthing hard enough, not doing enough dreamwork on the force and forms of cultural memory, when he considered Paul himself as actually having instituted the operative break between Judaism and Christianity. For all his shrewd reflections on revolution, institutionalization, and its repressions, Freud still read Paul like Martin Luther, participating in an aged panoply of a triumphalistically anti-Jewish and implicitly pro-imperial tradition inasmuch as he finds in Paul<br>

  Three  The Dancing, Singing Daughters of Memory from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/coll17686">Neopoetics</a><br>
  Abstract: Storytelling also circles—it comes back and starts over. This is as true in literate cultures that cherish traditional religious or secular narratives as it is in preliterate cultures. Stories, unless they are wholly improvised, are not merely performed: they are
                  reperformed and for that reason must berecollected. In an oral culture, storytelling may not require verbatim recall, but the skillful reperformance of a well-known narrative does require a very good memory for times, places, and persons. This is especially the case when that performance includes rhythm, melody, and movement. One can appreciate why, in some cultures, performers, before<br>

  Abstract: Singing is a universal human behavior combining words that awaken the memory, melodies that arouse the emotions, and rhythms that move the body. The singer, who might also play a drum or stringed instrument, therefore always occupied a prominent place in social and religious gatherings, which often would be held during times of leisure and feasting after other group activities, such as hunting, planting, harvesting, and herding.<br>

  Book Title: On the Difficulty of Living Together-Memory, Politics, and History<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Jacques Richard<br>
  Abstract: Manuel Cruz launches a nuanced study of memory and forgetting, defining their forms and uses, political meanings, and social and historical implications. Memory is not an intrinsically positive phenomenon, he argues, but an impressionable and malleable one, used to advance a variety of agendas. Cruz focuses on five memory models: that which is inherently valuable; that which legitimizes the present; that which supports retributive justice; that which is essential to mourning; and that which elicits renunciation or revelation.<br>

  Author(s) PÖTZSCH HOLGER<br>
  Abstract: It is a defining feature of war stories that issues of memory and history strangely intersect. War stories are often the stories of individual soldiers. However, due to the peculiar nature of their content relating to major collective endeavours, suffering and sacrifice, these stories quickly adopt major significance for the self-perception and self-legitimisation of collectives. Initially published as memoires, or historical novels written by men directly involved in the events under consideration, many of the tales are subsequently adapted to screen. As movies ‘based on true stories’, they reach far greater audiences and become important instruments for the social construction<br>

  Book Title: Religion and the Specter of the West-Sikhism, India, Postcoloniality, and the Politics of Translation<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mandair Arvind-Pal S.<br>
  Abstract: India's imperial elite subtly recast Sikh tradition as a sui generis religion, which robbed its teachings of their political force. In turn, Sikhs began to define themselves as a "nation" and a "world religion" that was separate from, but parallel to, the rise of the Indian state and global Hinduism. Rather than investigate these processes in isolation from Europe, Mandair shifts the focus closer to the political history of ideas, thereby recovering part of Europe's repressed colonial memory.<br>

  Abstract: At first sight, Marxism and memory appear as two foreign continents. Since Marx, many scholars belonging to his intellectual tradition have elaborated philosophies of history or investigated historical temporalities—E. P. Thompson’s studies on time and work discipline in early industrial capitalism are the most known—but have never conceptualized collective remembrance. Opened one century ago by Henri Bergson and Maurice Halbwachs, the scholarly debate on memory deeply shaped sociology, historiography, and philosophy without receiving any significant Marxist contribution. The rare assessments made by Marxist scholars on this topic simply reproduce a classical, positivistic dichotomy between history and memory: memory<br>

  Abstract: While the nondiscursive, frequently digressive character of the
      Mnemosyne-Atlascomplicates any linear narrative of its themes and contents, Christopher D. Johnson traces several thematic sequences in the panels. By drawing on Warburg's published and unpublished writings and by attending to Warburg's cardinal idea that "pathos formulas" structure the West's cultural memory, Johnson maps numerous tensions between word and image in theMnemosyne-Atlas. In addition to examining the work itself, he considers the literary, philosophical, and intellectual-historical implications of theMnemosyne-Atlas. As Johnson demonstrates, theMnemosyne-Atlasis not simply the culmination of Warburg's lifelong study of Renaissance culture but the ultimate expression of his now literal, now metaphoric search for syncretic solutions to the urgent problems posed by the history of art and culture.<br>

  Book Title: Middle English Romance and the Craft of Memory-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): McKINSTRY JAMIE<br>
  Abstract: In Middle English romances many memories are created, stored, forgotten, and rediscovered by both the characters and audience; such memory work is not, however, either simple or obvious. This study examines the ways in which recollection is achieved and sustained through physical, cognitive, and interpretative challenges. It uses examples such as Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Sir Orfeo, and Emaré, alongside romances by Chaucer and Malory, to investigate the genre's reliance on individual and collective memorial processes. The author argues that a tale's objects, places, dreams, discoveries, disguises, prophecies, and dramatic ironies influence that romance's essential memory work, which relies as much on creativity as it does accuracy. He also explores the imaginative crafts of memory that are employed by romances themselves. Dr Jamie McKinstry teaches in the Department of English Studies at Durham University, where he is a member of the Institute of Medieval and Early Modern Studies.<br>

  Abstract: Why, indeed, is memory important in medieval romances? This question needs clarification given the many associations and definitions of such a complex cognitive faculty as memory, and the equally wide-ranging scope of this particular literary genre. We should begin by considering what exactly we mean by “memory,” which can be both individual, relating to the thought processes of a single remembering subject, and also collective. To take examples from the romance genre itself, a single knight might be trying desperately to maintain the memory of his love whilst away from home for many years. This is his individual memorial challenge.<br>

  Book Title: Edinburgh German Yearbook 9-Archive and Memory in German Literature and Visual Culture<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Osborne Dora<br>
  Abstract: In recent years, the discourse of memory - and of German memory culture in particular - has become increasingly concerned with questions of the archive. An archive can refer to a physical place, the material found there, or the system that orders this material; in its broadest sense, it might refer to something public (records housed in a municipal building), or something private (photographs in a family album). The material and documentary qualities of the archive confer on it an authenticating function attributed only cautiously to memory, but theories of the archive have questioned the status of material, documentary vestiges of the past. Memory and the archive are inextricably linked, but how does this affect the mediation of the past? This volume explores the changing relationship between memory and the archive in German-language literature and culture since 1945. Contributions approach this topic from a range of perspectives (film, visual culture, urban culture, digital technology, as well as literature) and offer illuminating studies of Harun Farocki, Anselm Kiefer, Thomas Demand, Bernd and Hilla Becher, Jürgen Fuchs, Stefan Wolter, and Sasa Stanisic.

  Abstract: In her autobiographically inspired study of family photographs, tellingly entitled
                  Family Secrets(1995), Annette Kuhn describes the family album as “one moment in the cultural construction of family,” further claiming that “it is no coincidence that the conventions of the family album—what goes in and how it is arranged—are, culturally speaking, rather circumscribed.”¹ Kuhn’s observation implies an interconnectedness between the construction of family and its visual representation in family photographs. This connection is manifested in the multiple memory layers of the family album, where memories of the album curator and the reader of the album merge. This “archive<br>

  Abstract: This introductory comment in the foreword to Jana Döhring’s
                  Stasiratte(Stasi Rat, 2012) underscores the Janus-faced nature of memory. Nowhere has this been more evident than in the confrontations that East Germans have had with their secret police (Stasi) files. More than twenty-five years after the dissolution of the oppressive regime that ruled the German Democratic Republic for forty years, the legacy of the Stasi files continues to impact personal biographies in myriad ways. The peculiarity of the Stasi remains a source of fascination, and the Academy Award–winning filmDas Leben der Anderen(The Lives of Others, 2006) made<br>

  Book Title: Writing and Heritage in Contemporary Spain-The Imaginary Museum of Literature<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): DAVIS STUART<br>
  Abstract: This is an innovative exploration of cultural heritage and the literary traditions that shape the contemporary literary scene in Spain. Through a coalescence of museum studies, metacriticism and traditional literary criticism the study interweaves discussion of museum spaces with literary analysis, exploring them as agents of memorialisation and a means for preserving and conveying heritage. Following introductory explorations of the development of museums and the literary canon, each chapter begins with a "visit" to a Spanish museum, establishing the framework for the subsequent discussion of critical practices and texts. Case studies include examination of the palimpsest and unconscious influence of canonical cores; the response to masculine traditions of poetry and art; counter-culture of the 1990s; and the ethical concerns of postmemory writing. STUART DAVIS is a Lecturer in Spanish, Girton College, and Newton Trust Lecturer in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese, University of Cambridge.<br>

  Book Title: Twenty Years On-Competing Memories of the GDR in Postunification German Culture<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Tate Dennis<br>
  Abstract: Twenty years on from the dramatic events that led to the opening of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the GDR, the subjective dimension of German unification is still far from complete. The nature of the East German state remains a matter of cultural as well as political debate. This volume of new research focuses on competing memories of the GDR and the ways they have evolved in the mass media, literature, and film since 1989-90. Taking as its point of departure the impact of iconic visual images of the fall of the Wall on our understanding of the historical GDR, the volume first considers the decade of cultural conflict that followed unification and then the emergence of a more complex and diverse "textual memory" of the GDR since the Berlin Republic was established in 1999. It highlights competing generational perspectives on the GDR era and the unexpected "afterlife" of the GDR in recent publications. The volume as a whole shows the vitality of eastern German culture two decades after the demise of the GDR and the centrality of these memory debates to the success of Germany's unification process.

To begin with, however, I explain why I find the iota so apt for characterizing the memory of GDR socialism now that so little socialism of any kind remains. In other than a mocking sense the iota might turn out to be indicative to me alone, so I cannot pretend<br>

  Abstract: Taking my cue from a few telling remarks in Franz Fühmann’s 1973 Hungarian travel diary 
                  Zweiundzwanzig Tage, I want to examine the figure of the “iota of difference” in reference to really existing socialism.¹ I come to a discussion of Fühmann’s curious passage in the second half of this essay. To begin with, however, I explain why I find the iota so apt for characterizing the memory of GDR socialism now that so little socialism of any kind remains. In other than a mocking sense the iota might turn out to be indicative to me alone, so I cannot pretend<br>

  Book Title: The Novels of Josefina Aldecoa-Women, Society and Cultural Memory in Contemporary Spain<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): KENNY NUALA<br>
  Abstract: Josefina Aldecoa, in her treatment of themes such as a woman's place in society under and after dictatorship, mother-daughter relationships, war, and memory, confirmed her unique role as a contemporary novelist concerned with women's identity in Spain and as a writer of the mid-century generation ('los niños de la guerra'). The first volume of her trilogy, Historia de una maestra, was one of the earliest narratives of historical memory to be produced in Spain. In this sense, Aldecoa's work anticipated new developments in gender studies, such as the intersection of feminist concerns and cultural memory. This book offers a comprehensive examination of Aldecoa's trajectory as a novelist, from La enredadera to Hermanas, centring on her primary preoccupations of gender and memory, arguing that Aldecoa's fiction offers a new, more complex understanding of women's identity than previously understood. The work combines the two dominating theoretical components of feminism and cultural memory with close textual analysis of Aldecoa's narratives. Her novels highlight the importance of the details of women's daily experiences and struggles throughout the twentieth century, a period of significant socio-political upheaval and change in Spain's history. NUALA KENNY teaches Spanish at the National University of Maynooth, Ireland.<br>

  Abstract: The aim of this study is to present a comprehensive analysis of the novels of Josefina Aldecoa, which span the last three decades. In doing so, it employs a thematic approach, which is combined with a dual theoretical perspective centred on feminism and cultural memory in contemporary Spain. Such a structure accommodates an in-depth investigation of Aldecoa’s body of work and seeks to highlight the interconnection between women’s experiences and Spain’s current preoccupation with cultural memory. Moreover, a key objective of this book is to draw attention to the link between Aldecoa’s narrative and the historical and socio-cultural conditions in<br>

  Abstract: This chapter will examine the issue of cultural memory and the impact of the Spanish Civil War as depicted in Aldecoa’s trilogy,
                  Historia de una maestra, Mujeres de negroandLa fuerza del destino. These novels tell the story of Gabriela López Pardo, her mother and her daughter Juana, who together bear witness to one of the most turbulent periods in Spain’s history. In order to pass them on to her daughter, Gabriela records her memories of the coming of the Second Republic, her dreams of educational reform, and the death of her husband at the outbreak of the Civil<br>

  Conclusion from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt1x72wv">The Novels of Josefina Aldecoa</a><br>
  Abstract: This study has demonstrated how Aldecoa’s narrative reconfigures women’s identity in contemporary Spain and confronts the memory of the Spanish Civil War and the years of the Francoist dictatorship, exploring its deep psychological impact on current and future generations. In examining the cultural and social myths surrounding women’s role in Spanish society, Aldecoa deconstructs traditional patriarchal paradigms and offers a new, more complex understanding of women’s identity, free from existing hierarchical and binary structures. This rejection of the patriarchal system that pervades the fabric of Western culture is further extended by Aldecoa in her depiction of the Civil War and<br>

  Book Title: Medieval Hispanic Studies in Memory of Alan Deyermond-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Weiss Julian<br>
  Abstract: Professor Alan Deyermond was one of the leading British Hispanists of the last fifty years, whose work had a formative influence on medieval Hispanic studies around the world. There were several tributes to his work published during his lifetime, and it is fitting that this one, in his memory, should be produced by Tamesis, the publishing house that he helped establish and to which he contributed so much as author and editor right up to his death. The contributors to this volume are some of Professor Deyermond's former colleagues, doctoral students, and members of the Medieval Hispanic Research Seminar. Given Professor Deyermond's breadth of expertise, the span of the essays is appropriately wide, ranging chronologically from the thirteenth to the sixteenth century, and covering lyric, hagiography, clerical verse narrative, frontier balladry, historical and codicological studies. The volume opens with a personal memoir of her father by Ruth Deyermond, and closes with the draft of an unpublished essay found amongst Professor Deyermond's papers, and edited by his literary executor, Professor David Hook. Andrew M. Beresford is Reader and Head of Hispanic Studies at the University of Durham. Louise M. Haywood is Reader in Medieval Iberian Literary and Cultural Studies, and Head of the Department of Spanish and Portuguese at the University of Cambridge. Julian Weiss is Professor of Medieval & Early Modern Hispanic Studies at King's College London.<br>

  Abstract: Este libro evalúa la aportación del documental cinematográfico y televisivo producido en España a partir de los años 90 al debate en torno a la memoria de la represión franquista, por un lado, así como a la construcción de la identidad democrática, en términos más generales. Propongo que tanto los documentales con un enfoque histórico explícito como aquellos cuya mirada retrospectiva se realiza sin referentes tan concretos cuestionan el proyecto político teleológico concebido durante la Transición. La primera parte de mi estudio trata de la memoria histórica de la guerra civil específicamente y, la segunda, de la memoria en un sentido socioeconómico para apuntar el déficit de agencia del sujeto en la democracia neoliberal. En última instancia se reivindica la marginalidad social de la víctima a la vez que se deja al descubierto su obliteración de los procesos democráticos. Isabel M. Estrada is Visiting Assistant Professor, Franklin & Marshall College. ENGLISH VERSION This book examines how a selected group of documentaries made since 1995 for both film and television inform the debate centered on the so-called "recuperation of memory" of the Spanish Civil War and dictatorship. Estrada contends that these documentaries modify Spanish identity as it was conceived by the teleological historical project of the transition. The narrative of mass media should be examined in order to comprehend the process of the "recovery of memory" that culminated in the Law of Historical Memory (2007). She carries out a comparative analysis of the visual discourse of the documentary and the narrative discourses of history and testimony, paying special attention to the relations of power among them. Using theoretical frameworks provided by Badiou, Adorno, Renov, and Ricoeur, this study ultimately sheds light on the status of the victim in the context of Spain's neoliberal democracy. Isabel M.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt2jbm1c">Christians and Jews in Angevin England</a><br>
  Author(s) Watson Sethina<br>
  Abstract: During the course of one desperate night in March 1190, an estimated 150 Jewish men, women and children committed suicide or were murdered at the royal castle in York, where they had fled for safety. The York massacre horrified contemporaries, Christians and Jews, and is remembered today around the world. It is recalled in Jewish elegies and holds a singular, sad place in the English national story as ʹthe most notorious anti-Jewish atrocityʹ in its history.¹ Most particularly, the memory is tied to place. Cliffordʹs Tower, the mid-thirteenth-century stone keep of the royal castle, has become its most enduring symbol.²<br>

  Book Title: The Civil Wars after 1660-Public Remembering in Late Stuart England<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Neufeld Matthew<br>
  Abstract: This book examines the conflicting ways in which the civil wars and Interregnum were remembered, constructed and represented in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century England. It argues that during the late Stuart period, public remembering of the English civil wars and Interregnum was not concerned with re-fighting the old struggle but rather with commending and justifying, or contesting and attacking, the Restoration settlements. After the return of King Charles II the political nation had to address the question of remembering and forgetting the recent conflict. The answer was to construct a polity grounded on remembering and scapegoating puritan politics and piety. The proscription of the puritan impulse enacted by the Restoration settlements was supported by a public memory of the 1640s and 1650s which was used to show that Dissenters could not, and should not, be trusted with power. Drawing upon the interdisciplinary field of social memory studies, this book offers a new perspective on the historical and political cultures of early modern England, and will be of significant interest to social, cultural and political historians as well as scholars working in memory studies. Matthew Neufeld is Lecturer in early modern British history at the University of Saskatchewan, Canada.<br>

  Abstract: Emerging from a period of civil violence and political upheaval, the English in 1660 faced a critical question: what from the troubled past should be retained in memory and what ought to be consigned to oblivion? It is a question that many nations today with painful and tragic histories still struggle to answer.¹ At the turn of the millennium, Canadian journalist Erna Paris travelled to seven of them – Germany, France, Japan, the USA, Chile, Argentina and South Africa – determined to understand how their citizens remembered or did not remember past conflicts, and the impact that remembering and forgetting had on<br>

  Abstract: The Parliament that assembled to construct a settlement around the revolution of 1688 took a new approach to the question of remembering and forgetting the conflicted past. Several laws enacted by the Convention Parliament had profound implications for the cultural memory of the civil wars and Interregnum. Most significantly, under the Toleration Act of 1689, Trinitarian Protestant Dissenters could worship freely, subject to the granting of licences by local magistrates.¹ This meant that for the first time since the Reformation, the crown legally relinquished its role as promoter and enforcer of religious conformity. Moreover, religious toleration implied that the spiritual<br>

  Abstract: In 1705, Ann Harris was an old woman who possessed an increasingly rare and precious resource: a personal memory of the civil war years. Indeed, it is possible that by the turn of the seventeenth century she was the only person remaining in the parish of Coleorton, Leicestershire, who could recall that tumultuous period. During the 1640s, Harris had been a servant in the household of William Pestell, Coleorton’s rector. Six decades later, she claimed to remember very well the abuse her employer had received at the hands of parliamentarian soldiers. Forced by them to ride over sixteen miles to<br>

  Abstract: Heritage, memory, community archaeology and the politics of the past form the main strands running through the papers in this volume.The authors tackle these subjects from a range of different philosophical perspectives, with many drawing on the experience of recent community, commercial and other projects. Throughout, there is a strong emphasis on both the philosophy of engagement and with its enactment in specific contexts; the essays deal with an interest in the meaning, value and contested nature of the recent past and in the theory and practice of archaeological engagements with that past. Chris Dalglish is a lecturer in archaeology at the University of Glasgow.

Olick and Robbins¹ have argued that ‘collective memory is the active past that forms our identities’ and Samuel² has identified memory as being a dynamic, active, shaping force. Within individual community archaeology projects it is possible to identify the ‘rediscovery’ of memories as the motivating desire behind the instigation of the project in the first instance.

  Abstract: Este libro analiza la perspectiva de cuatro escritoras mexicanas -Nellie Campobello, Elena Garro, Laura Esquivel y Ángeles Mastretta- acerca de la Revolución Mexicana y cómo estas escritoras recuperan la memoria popular, recreando y reincluyendo a las mujeres en la narrativa nacional respecto a su participación en la propia Revolución, más allá del conocido papel de soldaderas y Adelitas que acompañaban a los diferentes ejércitos revolucionarios. Este trabajo combina diferentes planteamientos críticos feministas, antropológicos y geográficos que además de las mujeres, incluyen a los indígenas y a otras minorías étnicas contemplando la interrelación de las categorías de género, espacio, raza y clase como un todo que define y redefine, permanentemente, identidades espacializadas en cambio permanente y constante.

It examines how they recover popular memory to re-create and re-insert women in the national narrative with respect to their participation in the Revolution, which extended beyond the role of soldiers, camp followers, and soldiers' wives. The work combines cultural studies with feminist critical readings and an anthropological and geographical awareness of the roles of indigenous people and ethnic minorities, while paying attention to different categories such as gender, place, race, and class, as a wholeness of spatialized identities in permanent and constant flux.

Common sense alone suggests that in denying a critical need to relate the individual subject (whether author or reader) to a larger cultural, historically specific field of operations, Barthes’ theory of textual construction went too far.

  Book Title: El niño en el cine argentino de la postdictadura (1983-2008)-alegoría y nostalgia<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): DUFAYS SOPHIE<br>
  Abstract: Este libro constituye la primera monografía dedicada al papel del niño en el cine latinoamericano. El análisis detallado de una decena de películas argentinas de la post-dictadura dirigidas entre 1983 y 2008, incluyendo tanto clásicas (La historia oficial, Un lugar en el mundo) como olvidadas (Amigomio, El rigor del destino), revela cómo la mirada y el lenguaje del niño son puestos al servicio de una alegoría nostálgica, estructurada en torno a la memoria o al lenguaje verbal y vinculada a la figura del padre ausente. Dufays combina los análisis fílmicos con una amplia reflexión teórica sobre las cuatro nociones clave de alegoría, melancolía, nostalgia y duelo y los articula con una genealogía de la figura alegórica del niño en las tradiciones narrativas latinoamericanas. Este recorrido permite al lector explorar las significaciones simbólicas y discursivas que el personaje infantil, la infancia y la familia han adquirido en el cine y en el contexto postdictatorial argentino. Sophie Dufays es investigadora postdoctoral del Fondo Nacional de Investigación Científica de Bélgica, en la Universidad de Louvain-la-Neuve. This book is the first monograph devoted to the role of the child in Latin American cinema. Through close analysis of about ten Argentine fiction films of the post-dictatorship period directed between 1983 and 2008, including both classic such as The Official Story and A Place in the World) and forgotten works such as Amigomío and El rigor del destino. Dufays shows how the child's gaze and language are a means of focusing a nostalgic form of allegory, structured around either memory or verbal language, and related to the figure of the absent father. In combining these analyses with a wide theoretical articulation of four key notions (allegory, melancholy, mourning and nostalgia) and with a genealogy of the allegorical child character in Latin American narrative traditions, Relatos de infancia allows the reader to explore the meanings that childhood and family have come to acquire in cinema, particularly in the Argentine post-dictatorial context.

  Author(s): Rolle Sabine<br>
  Abstract: Established, commissioned, and edited by the Department of German at the University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh German Yearbook encourages and disseminates lively and open discussion of themes pertinent to German Studies, viewed from all angles but with particular interest in problems arising out of politics and history. No other yearbook covers the entire field while addressing a focused theme in each issue. Coinciding with the twentieth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, volume 3 re-directs current debates on memory and tradition, opening up fresh perspectives on the cultural history of the GDR and exploring how the nation's cultural discourses entered into a productive but often problematic dialogue with the values of the past and with the German cultural inheritance. Topics include the compositional engagement with musical heritage; industrial design and cultural politics; the establishment of antifascist monuments and their use as sites of resistance; constructions of a cultural heritage in architecture; the influence of cultural politics on literary scholarship; continuities and breaks with tradition in visual and literary culture; and engagement with the past in the works of Konrad Wolf, Irmtraud Morgner, and Anna Seghers.

  Abstract: As in the preceding decades, the development of the French-Canadian novel after 1918 was closely connected to the nationalism of Quebec’s Catholic intelligentsia: In 1866 Abbé Henri-Raymond Casgrain demanded that the novel should advocate the French language and Catholicism, as well as concentrate on regional themes, country life, and the memory of Nouvelle-France. Camille Roy’s speech “La nationalisation de la littérature canadienne,” held in 1904 in the Société du parler français, built upon Casgrain’s theses and led the way for virtually all novels produced until 1930.

This monograph examines the complexities behind the narrative technique employed in creating such a minefield, including an analysis of the role played by both male and female characters, the relevance of the past as a motif, and aspects of the role of storytelling in creating mystery where none should exist. Both Revertian novels and journalistic writing are seen to be part of an over-all game which is played between their author and his readers. Film, too, forms part of the material reviewed as, though Pérez-Reverte is not a script writer, many films have been based on his novels. The text-centred analysis concludes that the themes of interest in all Revertian output revolve around two main areas: the significance of the past, whether historical, cultural, or literary, and the role of the written word in communicating, in rescuing and in challenging versions of that past in order to combat what Pérez-Reverte terms 'dismemory'.

  Abstract: The German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe once said that all the clever ideas have already been had; it is only a matter of thinking them again. There is hardly any other intellectual field that would provide more evidence for Goethe’s dictum than sociology and the history of ideas associated with our discipline. In this sense, the following considerations do not claim to present something really new. Following Goethe’s invitation, they are directed toward a reconstruction. It will be a matter of calling to mind an important intellectual tradition that nevertheless became largely submerged in the collective memory—as we<br>

  Abstract: The voluminous body of scholarly work on Vasil Levski, among which some genuine and masterly contributions stand out, is focused entirely on the historical figure and its activities. The first and only analysis of Levski’s posthumous fate is Genchev’s chapter on “Vasil Levski in the Bulgarian historical memory,” which he published in his 1987 book on Levski. In it, Genchev makes an attempt to explain the abrupt turn in the Levski discourse after the Balkan Wars and the First World War. He contends that history itself vindicated Levski’s ideas. The reason for this, according to Genchev, is the critical reassessment<br>

  Book Title: Remembering Communism-Private and Public Recollections of Lived Experience in Southeast Europe<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Troebst Stefan<br>
  Abstract: Remembering Communism examines the formation and transformation of the memory of communism in the post-communist period. The majority of the articles focus on memory practices in the post-Stalinist era in Bulgaria and Romania, with occasional references to the cases of Poland and the GDR. Based on an interdisciplinary approach, including history, anthropology, cultural studies and sociology, the volume examines the mechanisms and processes that influence, determine and mint the private and public memory of communism in the post-1989 era. The common denominator to all essays is the emphasis on the process of remembering in the present, and the modalities by means of which the present perspective shapes processes of remembering, including practices of commemoration and representation of the past.<br>

  Book Title: Remembrance, History, and Justice-Coming to terms with traumatic pasts in democratic societies<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Iacob Bogdan C.<br>
  Abstract: The twentieth century has left behind a painful and complicated legacy of massive trauma, monstrous crimes, radical social engineering, or collective/individual guilt syndromes that were often the premises for and the specters haunting the process of democratization in the various societies that emerged out of these profoundly de-structuring contexts. The present manuscript is a state of the art reassessment and analysis of how the interplay between memory, history, and justice generates insight that is multifariously relevant for comprehending the present and future of democracy without becoming limited to a Europe-centric framework of understanding. The manuscript is structured on three complementary and interconnected trajectories: the public use of history, politics of memory, and transitional justice. Key words 1. Europe, Eastern—Politics and government—1989– 2. Collective memory—Europe, Eastern. 3. Memory—Political aspects—Europe, Eastern. 4. Democratization— Social aspects—Europe, Eastern. 5. Europe, Eastern—Historiography—Social aspects. 6. Europe, Eastern—Historiography—Political aspects. 7. Social justice— Europe, Eastern. 8. Post-communism—Europe, Eastern. 9. Fascism—Social aspects—Europe, Eastern. 10. Dictatorship—Social aspects—Europe, Eastern.<br>

On the one hand, only a liberal democracy based on the rule of law, checks and balances of power, an independent judiciary, and the basic principle of the dignity and rights of all individuals is able and is interested in bringing perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity to justice based on the rule of law.

  Abstract: Since the late 1980s, when the changes in Eastern and Central Europe seemed overwhelming and access to previously restricted information grew exponentially, this region could safely claim an unpredictable past. Today, almost two decades after the fall of communist regimes, scholars working on the recent past are paradoxically challenged by the abundance of memory and the variety of witnesses’ accounts, which confront the professional historical narrative with the simple claim “I was there and it was completely different.” Walking down the street, having a family dinner, or flipping through postcards and photo albums, we all make daily inroads into history.<br>

  Book Title: Where Currents Meet-Frontiers of Memory in Post-Soviet Fiction of Kharkiv, Ukraine<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Zaharchenko Tanya<br>
  Abstract: Where Currents Meet treats the Ukrainian and Russian components of cultural experience in Ukraine’s East as elements of a complex continuum. This study of cultural memory in post-Soviet space shows how its inhabitants negotiate the historical legacy they have inherited. Tanya Zaharchenko approaches contemporary Ukrainian literature at the intersection of memory studies and border studies, and her analysis adds a new voice to an ongoing exploration of cultural and historical discourses in Ukraine. This scholarly journey through storylines explores the ways in which younger writers in Kharkiv (Kharkov in Russian), a diverse, dynamic, but understudied border city in east Ukraine today come to grips with a traumatized post-Soviet cultural landscape. Zaharchenko’s book examines the works of Serhiy Zhadan, Andrei Krasniashchikh, Yuri Tsaplin, Oleh Kotsarev and others, introducing them as a “doubletake" generation who came of age during the Soviet Union’s collapse and as adults revisited this experience in their novels. Filling the space between society and the state, local literary texts have turned into forms of historical memory and agents of political life.<br>

  Abstract: Few are the reliable and well-written books that seek to tell the history of recent art in Eastern Europe—that is, the history of work by the artists who crossed the line in time that divided the old, communist era from the new postcommunist one. The communist past as experienced by those who lived it is largely a foreign concept to the majority of art historians in the West, who thus tread hesitantly over its uncanny terrain. As for the new generations of Eastern European art historians, they have already partially forgotten this past or even actively suppressed the memory<br>

Abstract: Ahearn, always a perceptive writer, brings out a fear that many linguistic anthropologists have but rarely expressthe fear of being assimilated to sociocultural anthropology and thus losing their identity through the forfeiting of their specificity. This is the flip side of William Labovs original wish that sociolinguistics might disappear once linguistics agreed to see language as a social phenomenon (that this has not happened is both an indictment of linguistics narrowmindedness and a validation of Labovs and other sociolinguists efforts to develop sociolinguistics into a vibrant independent field). The question then arises why we should worry about being assimilated. Shouldnt we, on the contrary, welcome such a possibility, to be seen as a validation of our work or as the mainstreaming of our concerns? The problem is not in the future, which cannot be predicted, but in the past. Everything we know from our earlier experiences warns us that an anthropology without a distinct group of language specialists is likely to be an anthropology with a nave understanding of communication. We have seen it happen already. When anthropology departments decide not to have a linguistic subfield, thinking that they dont need one, their students tend to take language for granted, identifying it with a vague notion of discourse. It is for this reason that we need to sharpen our historical, theoretical, and methodological understanding of what it means to study language as culture. We owe it first to our students.<br>

Abstract: This idea of the deliberate recovery of theological tensions by crossing religious boundaries can be understood in terms of the ecumenical concept of the complementarity of conflicting doctrinal formulations. Opposing doctrinal formulations are regarded as complementary expressions of a theological truth so profound as to be irreducible to any single formulation. For the ecumenical use of the complementarity concept, see, e.g., Avery Dulles, “Paths to Doctrinal Agreement: Ten Theses,”
            Theological Studies47 (1986): 44–45.<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur gets the relation of critique and reason right, in Bourgeois’s eyes, as a philosopher who sees imagination tied to thinking at the boundary (not limit) of reason. In a chapter examining Derrida’s views on “sign, time, and trace” (chap. 7), Bourgeois elaborates Derrida’s view that Edmund Husserl’s distinction between meaningful expression and sign depends on a stable borderline between primary and secondary memory (or retention and recollection) in his theory of “the living present” (or duration), which, Derrida asserts, is phenomenologically unavailable. In light of this analysis, Bourgeois draws an interesting contrast between Derrida’s insistence on a discrete closure of meaning and Ricoeur’s theory of language and imagination based in a view of the living present of meaning and experience that refuses such discrete closure. Once more, however, Bourgeois overreaches when he attempts to identify these accurately drawn contrasts with the limit/boundary distinction. In Bourgeois’s reading of Ricoeur, imagination does not produce reason from below (as in Heidegger); rather, “reason itself limits knowledge to experience from above, putting the imagination in a central position both in knowledge and thinking” (p. 131). A productive imagination of living metaphor takes place at the boundary of reason, allowing the living present in meaning and action to escape deconstruction’s critique while still incorporating a positive relation to alterity. Nevertheless, Bourgeois may be drawing the wrong conclusion about these contrasts, for it seems possible to read both Ricoeur and Derrida as seeking to work at the boundary (not limit) of reason and to think somehow the presentation of the Idea in the Kantian sense. Whereas Ricoeur’s theory of metaphor and narrative allows him to present the semantic content of the Ideas of Reason positively, these remain for Derrida (as for Kant) unrepresentable, or “the impossible.” This problem has been Derrida’s enduring concern since his 1962
   Introduction to Husserl’s “The Origin of Geometry.”The real difference between the thought of Ricoeur and Derrida is the distinctive way each thinker supplements phenomenology to take into account the creativity of meaning at the boundary of reason. For Derrida, it is thedifféranceof deconstruction; for Ricoeur, the graft of hermeneutics.<br>

            The Spivak Reader, 214–21. Serene Jones has drawn attention to the fact that the poststructuralist theoretical assumptions about the always oppressive nature of binarisms do not necessarily hold up under the pressures of concrete political struggles and that, in order to strengthen the bond of solidarity for a coalition of diverse social and cultural identities, what is called for is some kind of grand narrative that clearly defines the powers to be resisted and dismantled. I think this applies to a coalition of different religious identities as well.

Abstract: Whatever normative conclusions may be drawn in the end, theological ethicists ignore the unique situation of children and childhood at their own peril. Neglecting such marginalized groups as women and minorities weakened the voice of theological ethics in the past, both by silently playing into larger social wrongs and by failing to learn and grow from those silenced. Childhood in the United States and the world presents theological ethics today with a new and different but just as acute social challenge. Methodologically, since children cannot speak up as fully as can adults for themselves, theological ethicists should engage as deeply as possible with children’s actual social experiences, including through the sophisticated observational work of the human sciences, in order more creatively to understand and respond. Substantively, childhood demands at the very least renewed attention to the asymmetrical tensions of human moral responsibility, the senses in which others demand of those around them creative self‐transformation. This childist gesture of responsiveness and self‐critique has already begun to animate the human sciences. How much more, then, should it be welcomed and deepened further by Christian ethicists, who in one way or another trace a transformed world to the possibilities incarnated in an infant’s birth.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: In a first reading of the book, I was critical of this emphasis on moral motivations, since it seemed to be overburdened by a psychological approach. But, on a second reading, I had to refrain from my critique. Ricoeur makes the point that he has no intention to “take the place of a resolution for the perplexities raised by the very concept of a struggle, still less of a resolution of the conflicts” (218). In other words, Ricoeur is proposing a well‐needed complement to the institutional design trend that has invaded contemporary political philosophy. Contrary to many, he stands before the most perplexing issue of recognition with eyes wide open: indeed, demands of recognition may never end and take the form of an “unhappy consciousness” (218). One can try to resolve this potential inflation of claims by sorting out political and substantive issues. But a solution that takes only this path could create vast areas of frustration that canny elites have learned to fuel, or come to neglect recognition claims on the grounds that they hide a Pandora's box waiting to be opened. I suspect that this neglect mechanism is one of the reasons why so many legitimate recognition claims still languish in limbo as we speak. The course taken by Ricoeur may be difficult to square with the mainstream approach in contemporary political philosophy—political liberalism, to name it—but it nonetheless deserves careful attention.<br>

Abstract: My encounter with this student suggests another way of thinking about the political value of rewriting. Countering all the more blasé signals my students were giving me that it was most naive to think the retelling of stories from another point of view could have any political impact, it is evidence that women’s rewritings of classic texts can still affect young women, still make them think and make them want to contribute to the discussions, the debates that shape the public sphere. Although we need, of course, to factor in serendipity—the student was on holiday and thought she had discovered a little‐known book when in fact it was a
      New York Timesbest seller—there is definitely a sense in which her discovery marked a moment in her life and signals the development of a feminist consciousness (broadly defined as a certain awareness of gender identity combined with a critical position in respect to misogyny and patriarchy and a conviction that things can be changed). There is no denying that increasing individualization at all levels of society has caused the loss of a sense of collective action and political projects. This is equally true for ideas of improvement, emancipation, and modernization, the responsibility of which has largely been shifted to the individual, whose “human rights,” as Bauman argues, are redefined as “the right of individuals to stay different and to pick and choose at will their own models of happiness and fitting life‐style” (2000;2005, 29). In this deregulated and privatized sociopolitical context that knows no common cause, re‐vision can only fail to formulate enabling fictions for a better future for all. Yet in its capacity to speak to individuals, it can still draw them into visions of community and collectivity. Re‐vision may thus not be the lifeline that is to haul us out of patriarchy any more, but as a structure of address that engages readers into contemplating differences, it remains one of the ways in which we keep sane and critical and thinking, moved by the stories of long‐forgotten lives into participating in an open public sphere.<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important proponents, is thus linked by the Comaroffs forward to colonialism and to contemporary globalization, and backward in time to Part of this article was presented in a much earlier version at the Twentieth Anniversary Conference of the Journal of Southern African Studies, York, 1994; I would like to thank the participants as well as those who subsequently commented helpfully, including David Maxwell, Norman Etherington, Ed Wilmsen, and Paul Landau. For reading the current essay, my particular thanks to Catherine Desbarats, Eric Jabbari, James Ron, and Michael Wasser, as well as to Tim Rowse, Desley Deacon, Ann Curthoys, and John Docker for helpful suggestions. I am of course solely responsible for the content. The research for this essay was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. 1 Jean Comaroff and John L.

Missionaries were, in effect, agents of a first wave of globalization. The missionary movement was an early exemplar of a transnational global movement, while the intellectual claims of missionaries to universality paralleled the modernist claims of a globalizing colonialism. The struggles over the texture and composition of everyday life that took place on the frontiers of colonial society in nineteenth-century southern Africa therefore tell us something not only about the nature of colonialism but also about modernity and its considerable discontents, as well as about the resistance of the colonized to the European colonial project. In this sense, a quest for origins informs the narrative structure of both books.2 Indeed, one of the reasons that this seminal text engages us so closely is its concern with the narrative of dispossession and resistance, with a beginning and therefore, implicitly, some hope for an end-an only ambivalently postmodern narrative, in fact, despite some alarm in southern Africanist circles over Of Revelation and Revolution as a postmodern nail in the coffin of materialist history.3 This focus lends moral urgency to the Comaroffs' consideration of the distant initial encounters between white missionaries and the southern Tswana in the early nineteenth century. Volume 2, for example, opens with a striking vignette: Tswana soldiers refuse to defend the white regime in 1994, as Afrikaner patriots launch a last-ditch raid on Bophuthatswana. As homeland structures crumble around them as they write, the Comaroffs acknowledge that endings and beginnings are never entirely neat. "And yet in many respects, the narrative of Tswana colonization had completed itself, finally running its course from Revelation to Revolution."4 Doubtless the authors would now adopt a less utopian position, but their enthusiasm for revolution and for endings is important, and typical of South African historical writing from the decades before the end of apartheid.5 2 Catherine Desbarats, "Essais sur quelques elements de l'6criture de l'histoire am6rindienne," Revue d'histoire de l'Ameriquefranqaise 53, no. 4 (Spring 2000): 491-520, provides an interesting model, inspired among others by Paul Ricoeur, Hayden White, and Kerwin Lee Klein, for the reading of various historical approaches to the colonial encounter as forms of narrative romance, given the inescapable narrativity of the historical text. Susan Newton-King, also drawing on Ricoeur, similarly reflects on the inescapable imposition of an artificial order on colonial encounters by the historian of colonialism.

These authors take a variety of positions on the issues of whether or not the Comaroffs are postmodern and whether or not the rise of postmodernism in post-apartheid South African academic historical scholarship has been a positive development in a field that was previously (and in many ways still is) passionately materialist in approach. 4 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: xiii. 5 The original title of the series was reportedly From Revelation to Revolution, planned at a time before the release of Nelson Mandela. In a recent conversation with Homi Bhabha, however, John Comaroff is considerably less sanguine about the end of apartheid in South Africa and popular enthusiasm for Mandela outside South Africa, which he sees as a last gasp of modernist optimism in AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 436 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh In a similar vein, at the heart of Volume 1 is a crucial chapter, "Through the Looking Glass: Heroic Journeys, First Encounters." This chapter sets out to explore "the initial meeting of two worlds, one imperial and expansive, the other local and defensive."6 In marvelously evocative detail, the authors describe the initial entry of envoys of the London Missionary Society (LMS) in 1816 into the Tswana capital, Dithakong (seen by the missionaries themselves as a sacred journey into the land of Satan), a subsequent meeting, and the complex negotiations that took place throughout over the terms of the mission. A key metaphor is furnished by the mirror that the LMS envoy John Campbell presented as a gift to the Tswana chief, Mothibi, symbolizing the Western effort to reconfigure Tswana consciousness and the Tswana notion of the self. These initial encounters prefigured the colonial encounter to come: "the square enclosure and all that 'took place' at the center of the most public of Tswana spaces was ominous, foreshadowing a methodical reconstruction of their symbolic map."7 The Christian missionary project, this chapter further suggests, was from the start central to the creation of the dialectical oppositions of colonialism, ironic in view of its claim to erase difference. For the Comaroffs, the colonization of the Tswana thus began (although it certainly did not end) with the word, in the sense both of Bible and of cultural text, with the advent of white Protestant missionaries and their claims to possess the revealed divine word-albeit a word made flesh, clothed in material power. The roots of colonization were in a series of knowledge claims and a set of hegemonic cultural discourses, which would bolster the later seizure of land and of labor. Many scholars have explored the linkage between knowledge claims and colonial power, an issue that has long lain at the heart of postcolonial scholarship and that occupies an increasingly central place in the study of imperialism from a diversity of perspectives.8 Nonetheless, Of Revelation and Revolution furnishes a particularly influential and important statement of the position, in part because it provides a great deal of flesh on the bones of a theoretical model of cultural colonialism. The work moves from the field of discourse alone to examine in great detail concrete material struggles over the remaking of everyday life, including Tswana efforts to resist cultural colonialism. More controversially, perhaps, Of Revelation and Revolution also attempts to make explicit the links in southern Africa between a postcolonial setting.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 437 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne political, economic, and cultural colonialism-fields the authors argue are in any case impossible to disaggregate.9 The programmatic claims that lend Of Revelation and Revolution its force also, however, cause some interesting tensions in the book. The need to make linkages and the Comaroffs' explicit commitment to the exploration of large-scale processes lead the authors to oversimplify in places. Not only that, but the imperatives of a dialectical method push the Comaroffs at times (despite their parallel stress on indeterminacy and their very explicit engagement with the costs and benefits of a dialectical analysis, especially in Volume 2) into tighter methodological corners than they might themselves like. The links between early nineteenth-century cultural colonialism and late nineteenth-century political colonialism are not as direct or as ontologically indissoluble as the Comaroffs assume they are, while the relationship of "modernity" to colonialism furnishes matter for debate, with considerable contemporary implications. The very boldness of the Comaroffs' arguments has indeed contributed to a mixed reception among scholars of southern African history and of religion in Africa, with some enthusiastically welcoming the methodological innovation of the Comaroffs and others casting doubt in a number of ways. In the second volume of the series, the Comaroffs seem to me to have backed down somewhat from some of their bolder claims, despite their spirited engagement with the critics. This in itself provides an interesting case study of the evolution of ideas during a turbulent decade in South African history. In what follows, I would like to engage with this important work in several ways. First, I want to lay out my understanding of the theoretical guidelines in the opening volume, with particular attention to the issue of hegemony and power. Second, I want to provide an alternate reading of the opening encounters between Tswana and missionary, focusing on other intermediaries and on the fact that, even before the advent of European missionaries, the region was already affected by colonialism. I shall use this example to ask whether a dialectic model does not in some ways oversimplify complicated situations and make it hard to account for fudging across the fault lines. I shall further ask whether the result is not a rather muted account of individual agency and an attenuated depiction of the multiple uses of mission Christianity, both as language and as practice. This is not, however, to deny the latent authoritarian potential of much missionary activity, particularly in a colonial context. Third, I also want to gesture, albeit sketchily, toward some issues associated with narrative and chronology, suggesting that the schematic narrative about "modernity," industrialization, and globalization that undergirds both volumes, though provocative and important, also offers a number of hostages to fortune. These include an undue stress on the capacity of missionaries to induct converts into the global economy by changing their consciousness; rather, I see converts struggling to adapt to an overpowering global economy, among other things by trying to use Christianity in a variety of ways, with greater or lesser degrees of success. Having said all that, does this fact-mongering matter?-What are the Comaroffs doing that might go beyond reading the content of particular 9 Colonialism was simultaneously a "process in political economy and culture," and these dimensions were "indissoluble aspects of the same reality, whose fragmentation into discrete spheres hides their ontological unity."

Throughout, I want to take up some concerns of African historians and anthropologists with questions of narrative, voice, and agency in Of Revelation and Revolution. THE INITIAL CHAPTER OF THE FIRST VOLUME is a careful theoretical exposition. Although the authors rather cheerfully direct those with little stomach for theoretical discussions to skip theirs and, en bon bricoleur, to pick up the narrative at a later point, the opening discussion of anthropological concepts is in fact crucial for an understanding of what both this book and its later companion seek to accomplish. I would accordingly like to pause upon it. The stated goal of the work is to present an anthropology of the "colonial encounter," in this case between British Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana, with the larger implication that the missionaries acted as the cultural arm of colonialism, while the dilemmas of the Tswana in their confrontations with colonialism mirrored, if they obviously did not precisely reproduce, the experience of other colonized African groups in South Africa. The Comaroffs state that they hope that their discussion of this particular mission will accomplish three other things: to anticipate later modes of consciousness and struggle in South Africa; to look at an example of historical processes that were happening across Africa and indeed much of the non-Western world; and to examine analytic issues to do with the "nature of power and resistance." With reference to this latter objective: How, precisely, were structures of inequality fashioned during the colonial encounter, often in the absence of more conventional, more coercive tools of domination? How was consciousness made and remade in this process? ... How were new hegemonies established and the "ground prepared," in [Antonio] Gramsci's phrase, for formal European political control? ... Even more fundamentally, how are we to understand the dialectics of culture and power, ideology and consciousness that shape such historical processes?'1 From the vantage point of 1991, the Comaroffs placed their project into a historiographical framework that has since changed considerably, in no small part due to their own work."1 At the time, the Comaroffs castigated anthropologists for 10 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 6. 11 Among many possibilities, some works of particular importance to southern Africa include Paul Stuart Landau, The Realm of the Word: Language, Gender and Christianity in a Southern African Kingdom (London, 1995); Henry Bredekamp and Robert Ross, eds., Missions and Christianity in South African History (Johannesburg, 1995); Pier M.

The sheer diversity of recent approaches to the history of mission Christianity, a growth field, is impossible to capture in a footnote but is suggested by works such as David Maxwell and Ingrid Lawrie, eds., Christianity and the African Imagination: Essays in Honour of Adrian Hastings (Leiden, 2001); Nicholas Thomas, "Colonial Conversions: Difference, Hierarchy and History in Early Twentieth-Century Evangelical Propaganda," in Hall, Cultures of Empire; Susan Thorne, Congregational Missions and the Making of an Imperial Culture in Nineteenth- Century England (Stanford, Calif., 1999); Peter van der Veer, ed., Conversion to Moderities: The Globalization of Christianity (London, 1996); Robert W.

Historians paid more attention to missions but in the 1960s and 1970s often focused on the theoretically crude question of "whose side were the missionaries really on?" By the 1980s, mission history had been more fruitfully incorporated into work on such long-term processes as colonial conquest, capitalist expansion, state formation, and proletarianization. The methodological innovation of the Comaroffs in the early 1990s was, however, to underscore how much this new approach was itself limited by its "preoccupation with political economy at the expense of culture, symbolism, and ideology."12 They echoed the 1986 claim of Terence Ranger that most of the historiography of early missions to that point had overestimated the political and economic factors in its expansion-in a manner, according to the Comaroffs, stemming ultimately from oppositions between mind and matter at the ontological roots of our social thought.13 In rejecting a narrowly political-economic approach, the authors believed they could better answer the questions of why it was that missionaries succeeded in effecting broad social, political, and economic changes without substantial material resources (a question that, of course, assumes that this was accomplished by missionaries). What was needed, the Comaroffs claimed, was a study of consciousness: of why people articulated belief in certain things, why they took others for granted, how colonialism and consciousness were inextricably intertwined. It is in this sense that missionaries were most clearly colonial agents: they sought to remake the lifeworld of the Tswana, indeed, to colonize their consciousness. They did not necessarily seek directly and simplistically to incorpo- rate the Tswana into an unequal colonial world: they had dreamed instead of a "global democracy of material well-being and moral merit," in the Comaroffs' phrase.14 Nonetheless, their actions contributed to building an empire of inequality. This claim rests on the additional argument that the missionaries were the products of post-Enlightenment modernity, creations and agents of rationalization in the Weberian sense. Similarly, Tswana interlocutors made a variety of unexpected uses of the evangelical message, and of evangelical attempts to remake their world, again with unpredictable results. In sum, the encounter between colonial evangelism and the southern Tswana can best be described as a "long conversation," a continuing process in the course of which "signifiers were set afloat, fought over, and recaptured on both sides of the colonial encounter."15 Over the course of this conversation, the Tswana came to conceive of themselves as constituting a separate, Translating the Message: The Missionary Impact on Culture (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1989); and V. Y. Mudimbe, The Invention of Africa: Gnosis, Philosophy, and the Order of Knowledge (Bloomington, Ind., 1988). The Currents in World Christianity Project, at the University of Cambridge, has also since 1996 lent considerable impetus to the scholarly study of missions. A longstanding African literature reconsiders missions and the truth claims of missionaries, often from a theological perspective: for example, J. N. K. Mugambi, From Liberation to Reconstruction: African Christian Theology after the Cold War (Nairobi, 1996). Many works by African scholars are less well distributed in the West than they might be, given material constraints. From a wide variety of directions, missionary activity has become a newly invigorated area of research since the 1990s, although some of the more difficult underlying issues are perhaps not adequately discussed in all the literature. 12 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 8. 13 Terence Ranger, "Religious Movements and Politics in Sub-Saharan Africa," African Studies Review 29 (1986): 1-69. 14 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 12. 15 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17-18.

At the same time, the "forms" of the "European worldview" became inscribed on the "African land- scape": "not only did colonialism produce reified cultural orders, it gave rise to a new hegemony amidst-and despite-cultural contestation."16 Throughout this discussion, the Comaroffs reject the poststructuralist claim that all meanings are equally tenuous and open to contestation, regretting the episte- mological hypochondria and consequent intellectual immobility to which postmod- ern critiques have given rise in academia-even as the authors uphold some of the central insights of such critiques, notably their insistence that the indeterminacies of meaning and action be addressed by scholars.17 What poststructuralists cannot address is the basic question of how some meanings get widely accepted over significant periods of time by those against whose interest it is to believe them. This is the problem of hegemony, raised by Gramsci (however sketchy his discussion in the Prison Notebooks) and developed by many social theorists.18 The Comaroffs offer a solution, though over-schematic in the literal sense of the word. They see human consciousness as existing on a spectrum from "hegemony" to "ideology." At the hegemony end of the spectrum, one finds the taken-for-granted inscribed in everyday life-those beliefs that are not questioned because they are not even noticed as beliefs. At the other end, one finds articulated ideology, which is available for debate and which often tries to bring into consciousness the hegemonic beliefs of earlier stages. Culture in general is the "space of signifying practice, the semantic ground on which human beings seek to construct and represent themselves and others-and hence, society and history."l9 Somewhat oddly, hegemonic concepts are described as "constructs and conventions that have come to be shared and naturalized through a political community," while ideology is "the expression and ultimately the possession of a particular social group, although it may be widely peddled beyond."20 This psychological structure seems artificial and unwieldy; it is unclear why the province of the hegemonic idea should be the political community (a tricky concept to define in any case), while ideology is described not only as the product of communities (rather than at least sometimes of individuals) but as the province of the social rather than, say, political or even self-consciously intellectual groupings. The definition of the political is murky here, as it is throughout the book, despite (even sometimes because of) the painstaking effort of the authors to demonstrate the deeply political nature of the everyday stuff of life; what is lacking here and elsewhere is a willingness to limit and define the nature of the political in such a manner as to make it meaningful to call something political in the first place. Be that as it may, this construction of group political psychology permits the Comaroffs to draw conclusions that are critically important for their overall project. Indeed, the reconstruction of struggles over the stuff of everyday life that takes pride of place in the second volume depends ultimately on this theoretical 16 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 18. 17 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17. 18 Antonio Gramsci, Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci, Quentin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith, trans.

Given the place of hegemony and ideology on an ever-changing spectrum, the two are constantly fluid; meanings are always being made and remade, as ideology challenges hegemony to reveal itself, and it is in the inchoate, fluid space between hegemony and ideology that human consciousness is at its most creative. Given that hegemony is constructed largely through the "assertion of control over various modes of symbolic production: over such things as educational and ritual processes, patterns of socialization, political and legal procedures, canons of style and self-representation, public communication, health and bodily discipline and so on," the realm of "symbolic production" is (presumably) political because it is a site for power struggles. This means both that the "symbolic production" is political and that resistance to modes of symbolic production that generate hegemony is political. Modes of resistance run across as wide a spectrum as modes of control, with at one end organized protest and other movements readily recognized as political by the West; at the other end are "gestures of tacit refusal and iconoclasms, gestures that sullenly and silently contest the forms of an existing hegemony."21 It is thus in this light that missions must be seen. They sought to extend hegemonic control over indigenous peoples by changing their worldviews to a point that new ways of behaving and seeing the world were completely internalized. Resistance to the specific forms of Christianity was also resistance to the message behind the signs. In the purest sense, resistance to Christian forms was resistance to the content of capitalism and to the global capitalist system; this is indeed a critical plank of Jean Comaroff's fascinating (if not uncontroversial) reading of African independent churches as quintessentially subversive because they appropriated and yet subverted Christian forms, in her important 1985 study Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance.22 Christian missions must also be re-read. Their gestures and ritual must be analyzed in order to see how missionaries were attempting to change far more than religious allegiance, acting as emissaries of modernity and economic transfor- mation. Finally, conversion was inextricably political, and as such a suitable site for political competition between colonizers and the colonized. The extremely rich remainder of this book and its successor volume work out the implications of these theoretical positions through a quite brilliant analysis of the nineteenth-century "colonial exchange" between the southern Tswana and the Nonconformist missions to them run first by the London Missionary Society (pioneers in the field) and then by their later-arriving brethren, the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society. An additional important project of the authors throughout this study is to demonstrate the importance of an imagined Africa to the British sense of themselves and more broadly to the construction of modernity. As the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2, as part of a series of seven propositions about colonialism, "colonialism was as much involved in making the metropole, and the identities and ideologies of colonizers, as it was in (re)making peripheries and colonial sub- 21 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 31. 22 Jean Comaroff, Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance: The Culture and History of a South African People (Chicago, 1985).

A final critical point is that the authors see the interaction between missionary and Tswana as a form of dialectic between two key groups of interlocutors, dependent on the notion of difference. In the second volume, the Comaroffs acknowledge with more force than in Volume 1 the existence of overlap on the ground, and they reemphasize that the idea of difference was created by the dialectical process, despite some merging of lifeways on the ground and the mutual influence of Tswana and British. Note their comment that "neither 'the colonizer' nor 'the colonized' represented an undifferentiated sociological or political reality, save in exceptional circumstances."25 Since the end product of the colonial encounter was so clearly the production of difference and a series of deeply embedded dialectical oppositions, the Comaroffs nonetheless argue that this is the most productive optic through which to view the early nineteenth-century encounter between European mission- aries and Africans. This model is furthermore essential to their theoretical account of the formation of hegemony. ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE FOUND MOST PERPLEXING about the work of the Comaroffs is, nevertheless, the question of the extent to which it is appropriate to describe the Tswana encounter with Christianity as a form of dialectic. This question implies the ancillary question of who the agents of the dialectic were at given moments. On the face of it, these are tendentious concerns, since colonialism was so clearly in many ways a dialectic between colonized and colonizer, just as colonialism clearly generated reified views of colonizer and colonized alike. Missionaries themselves usually understood their activities in dialectical terms. Yet I think one can ask whether a dialectical approach to the history of Christianity in colonial contexts 23 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 22. 24 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 86. Those influenced by the Comaroffs in this respect include David Chidester, Savage Systems: Colonialism and Comparative Religion in Southern Africa (Charlottesville, Va., 1996); Leon de Kock, Civilising Barbarians: Missionary Narrative and African Textual Response in Nineteenth-Century South Africa (Johannesburg, 1996); Doug Stuart, "'Of Savages and Heroes': Discourses of Race, Nation and Gender in the Evangelical Missions to Southern Africa in the Early Nineteenth Century" (PhD dissertation, Institute of Commonwealth Studies, University of London, 1994).

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 443 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne does not fail to capture some aspects of social and political reality. This is above all because of the rapidity with which Christianity was out of the hands of the missionaries and settlers who brought it, the corresponding importance of non- Europeans in the spread of Christianity, the multiplicity of uses to which diverse interest groups of all ethnicities put Christianity as both a language and a practice, and the political and cultural complications of regions with multiple power players. These issues are brought out by a re-reading of the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana that occupy so key a role in the first volume of Of Revelation and Revolution. I should add that I made similar comments about the opening phases of the mission in an unpublished conference paper after the publication of Volume 1. The Comaroffs respond generously to this paper in Volume 2, as they do to a number of other critics, using the occasion to clarify and amplify their understanding of a dialectical approach. I do not want to beat a dead horse. Nonetheless, I think there are some useful differences of interpretation at stake, and so will abuse the Comaroffs' patience by briefly recapitulating a potential alternate reading of these opening gambits, before returning to the wider issue of different approaches to mission history.26 Let me first make a comment about regional issues. The lands of the southern Tswana were disrupted by colonialism, drought, hunger, and regional conflict well before the formal advent of missions. Furthermore, as Johannes du Bruyn has underscored, the lands inhabited by the southern Tswana were so profoundly affected by the Cape Colony to the south that it is problematic to frame a discussion of cultural colonialism primarily in terms of Europe and the Transvaal. In particular, the colonial firearms frontier moved with great speed, was highly destructive, and was arguably more important earlier than the Comaroffs suggest. Many different armed bands, some of them ethnically mixed, decimated peaceful groups in conflict situations exacerbated by hunger.27 Arguments about the regional context for evangelical missions to the Tswana are also implicit in a much wider body of literature about the so-called mfecane (or difaqane)-terms that have been much disputed by historians. Traditionally, the mfecane was a term given to the widespread wars, famines, and refugee movements that shook (and temporarily depopulated) much of the interior of southern Africa in the early nineteenth century, the impact of which on the Tswana the Comaroffs date from 1822. There is no space here to explore that debate, although it will be helpful to know that a 26 My re-reading of the opening encounter is based on my own work on LMS archives, which I consulted primarily with the aim of writing about contestation over the uses of Christianity within the Cape Colony and with a focus on Khoesan not Tswana uses of Christianity. It seems to me fruitful, however, to unite diverse perspectives on a very complex subject. Elizabeth Elbourne, Blood Ground: Colonialism, Missions and the Contest for Christianity in the Cape Colony and Britain, 1799-1853 (Montreal, 2002). There were four LMS delegations to the Tswana to establish a mission, not two as the Comaroffs have it. 27 Johannes du Bruyn, "Of Muffled Tswana and Overwhelming Missionaries: The Comaroffs and the Colonial Encounter," South African Historical Journal, no. 31 (1994): 294-309; Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 275-76. On Tswana views of the firearms frontier, see Robert Moffat to Richard Miles, Lattakoo [Kuruman], December 5, 1827, in Isaac Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman: Being the Journals and Letters of Robert and Mary Moffat, 1820-1828 (London, 1951), 274. Other letters in this collection describe frequent deadly raids throughout the 1820s, in which a wide variety of often ethnically mixed groups preyed on one another. On Cape influence, see also Johannes du Bruyn, "James Read en die Thlaping, 1816-1820," Historia 35 (1990). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 444 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh critical issue is whether or not covert slave trading from the Cape Colony and Portuguese territories was at the root of disruptions that have more traditionally been ascribed to the many conquests of the Zulu kingdom in the region of what is now Natal. The point I want to emphasize here is not only the great disruption in the region but also the plausibility of historian Neil Parsons's argument that Tswana territory had already been subject since the seventeenth century to political unrest and the large-scale movement of populations. Parsons in fact suggests that the roots of disruption and state formation in the area may well lie in destabilization that considerably antedated the 1820s and may in turn be linked in at least some way to eighteenth-century slave trading to the north and the rise of the predatory Cape Colony to the south.28 Scholars also tend to see later Afrikaner settler colonialism in the region as part of the same broad processes. All this calls into question the determinative impact of mission Christianity in an already destabilized region. Maybe political colonialism did precede cultural colonialism after all? How might we need to reconceptualize the Christian/Tswana encounter if we think of it as taking place in some sense in a frontier zone, or even a borderland, with multiple players, already characterized by cultural admixture, politically influenced uses of Christianity, and political turbulence? The Comaroffs are of course sensitive to these hugely important issues. I think nonetheless that they could emphasize regional complexity more and the power of missionary Christianity somewhat less in their discussion of the roots of material change (at both ends of the nineteenth century), as well as pay more attention to the implications for their overall theoretical argument of the fact that Africans tried to experiment in response to very difficult local conditions. It is also important that the missionaries entered as potential power brokers in a turbulent environment but were initially weak, able to manipulate power if and only if they could make the right alliances. With these types of broad issues in mind, the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana, so well described by the Comaroffs, might be re-read as conversations between a number of actors. Four LMS delegations traveled between 1813 and 1817 to the southern Tswana settlement known to the missionaries as Lattakoo (later Dithakong) to try to persuade the Tswana to accept missionaries. It is perhaps symbolically appropriate that none of these delegations was exclusively white. In addition to the delegations' African members, even the missionaries themselves included a black West Indian man and a Welsh speaker. Neither, come to that, was the Tswana polity entirely "Tswana." The Thlaping polity was relatively multi-ethnic; the chief Mothibi, for example, was half !Kora (a Khoekhoe-speaking group) and (like others of the chiefly lineage) married a !Kora woman. More significantly, the Europeans were not the only, or even the most important, players promoting an evangelical mission. Key from a Tswana perspective were regional actors, the Griqua (as they 28 Julian Cobbing, "The Mfecane as Alibi: Thoughts on Dithakong and Mbolompo," Journal of African History 29, no. 3 (1988): 487-519; Caroline Hamilton, ed., Mfecane Aftermath (Johannesburg, 1996), including Neil Parsons, "Prelude to Difaqane in the Interior of Southern Africa c. 1600-1822," 323-49; Neil Parsons, "Kicking the Hornets' Nest: A Third View of the Cobbing Controversy on the Mfecane/Difaqane," address to the University of Botswana History Society, Gabarone, Botswana, March 16, 1999 (available online through the University of Botswana History Department web page, at http://ubh.tripod.com/ub/np.htm). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 445 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elboume eventually came to be known), some of whom acted as patrons of the early LMS mission to the Tswana. The Griqua were clusters of settlers in the region of Khoekhoe descent, some of whom had white fathers and Khoesan mothers, and many of whom had migrated from the Cape Colony, epitomizing the remaking of identity in the wake of colonialism. Groups spearheaded by Griqua had established regional hegemony through their access to arms and horses. They provided important trade links with the Cape Colony and were sources of trade goods for the Tswana. The Griqua were already using Christianity in a variety of complicated ways, as a token of equality with white settlers, as justification for what Robert Ross has termed "sub-imperialism" with regard to the unconverted Tswana, and indeed as a basis for their reconstituted polities. Alliances with missionaries gave these emergent polities potential access to diplomacy and markets, including the arms trade, in addition to spiritual concerns. Indeed, on the way to Mothibi's settlement, British LMS inspector Campbell had helped compose a formal written constitution for a Griqua group, reflecting the symbolic uses of the language of law. The language of Christianity was already on the loose in the interior, in other words, and subject to interpretation in Griqualand as much as in the seminaries of Europe.29 The (Khoekhoe) !Kora had also been exposed to Christianity and were also competing by the 1820s to obtain guns and horses from the Cape Colony. The decision of Mothibi and his counselors about whether to accept an LMS mission was thus complicated by the fact that the LMS came under the protection of the powerful Griqua Kok clan. During a second LMS delegation to the Tswana (overlooked by the Comaroffs), for example, Adam Kok presented newly arrived missionaries to Mothibi and acted as their translator. Mothibi was anxious not to offend the powerful Kok family, but worried because his own people had since turned against the mission. In fact, he eventually sent these missionaries away altogether. When two missionaries told Mothibi that one of them "wrought in wood, and one that was to come wrought in Iron, that we would do all the work for him in that way that he wanted," Mothibi was pleased and told Kok "he could not think of rejecting those that came with or through the medium of him." When the missionaries pursued the issue of teaching, however, Mothibi worriedly told Kok that "he would not be instructed, and if A. Kok should endeavour to press it sharply upon him, and his refusal cause a variance between them, he said that he would rather take the flight from Lattakoo, with people." Kok had to reassure Mothibi that the Griqua leader would not force the Tswana chief to relocate if the Thlaping 29 This discussion both here and below draws on Robert Ross, Adam Kok's Griquas: A Study in the Development of Stratification in South Africa (Cambridge, 1976); Elizabeth Elbourne and Robert Ross, "Combating Spiritual and Social Bondage: Early Missions in the Cape Colony," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa; Alan Barnard, Hunters and Herders of Southern Africa: A Comparative Ethnography of the Khoisan Peoples (Cambridge, 1992), 156-75, 193-94; Martin Legassick, "The Northern Frontier to c. 1840: The Rise and Decline of the Griqua People," in Richard Elphick and Hermann Giliomee, eds., The Shaping of South African Society, 1652-1840 (Middletown, Conn., 1988), 358-420; Nigel Penn, "The Orange River Frontier Zone, c. 1700-1805," in Andrew B.

If missionaries were initially dependent on Griqua intermediaries, they were also materially dependent for travel and translation on Khoesan hired in the colony. The Khoekhoe and San had long borne the brunt of brutal colonial subjugation and were in many cases more receptive to conversion than groups beyond the Cape Colony. The Comaroffs indeed have a wonderful discussion of the occlusion of such intermediary figures from missionary accounts of putatively solitary heroic jour- neys.31 I would go further than the Comaroffs, however, and suggest that at least some of these companions saw themselves as fellow missionaries. On the first delegation, Campbell was accompanied by a number of Khoesan Christians from the Cape. Their prayers and preaching had made a pilgrimage route of their journey through a country of which they saw themselves as taking spiritual possession. They were active in trying to persuade Tswana individuals to accept missionaries.32 In 1814, a synod of the southern African LMS missionaries had "set aside" in a religious ceremony several men of Khoesan descent to act as LMS agents in the interior, several of whom, including Griqua leader Andries Waterboer, subse- quently played important roles in the politics of Transorangia. Cupido Kakkerlak, a product of Eastern Cape mission schools whose letters reveal a passionate spirituality, also itinerated in the region, attempting, albeit with little success, to evangelize among the !Kora. These men were employed by the LMS. As the Comaroffs point out, the society would devote much energy to reining in and controlling "native agents" after the earliest years of the mission. Nonetheless, evidence from the Cape suggests that there was also considerable evangelical activity by converts who were not formally paid by missionary societies, including elephant hunters such as Hendrik Boesak or long-range wagon drivers. In addition, as mission stations became more like churches and congregations fought for independence from missionary control around the mid-century mark, congregations had more authority, not less. My point is that evidence from elsewhere in southern Africa suggests that Christianity was spread by people with long-range contacts other than missionaries, presumably not necessarily in orthodox form. The central- ity of Khoesan people (and later other Africans) to European-led missions to the Tswana suggests a wider oral evangelical culture that the written records would not completely reflect.33 Be that as it may, the importance of Khoesan agents to the Tswana mission is most clearly exemplified by the fourth delegation to Lattakoo, led by a former 30 Robert Hamilton to LMS Directors, Griquatown, April 28, 1816, London Missionary Society Papers, South Africa Correspondence-Incoming, 6/3/C, Council for World Mission Archives, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (hereafter, LMS-SA).

Read brought with him an unusually large group of people of varied ethnic origins, mostly Khoesan, including, more problematically, his own Khoekhoe wife, Elizabeth Valentyn, and his pregnant former mistress, a San woman, Sabina Pretorius, whom he claimed to have met by accident on the road. At least ten Khoesan men and six Khoesan women accompanied Read, all of whom were church members and some of whom were "zealous persons."34 It is indeed possible that the Khoesan of the Cape Colony saw this as a Khoesan mission to the Tswana, brokered by their kin among the Griqua. In any case, once Robert Moffat took over the Lattakoo station in 1821 from Read (disgraced for his adultery), he would fight successfully to diminish the influence of the Khoesan group from the Cape Colony, whom he then firmly wrote out of the history of the station. He dismissed several for immorality, despite the resistance, in which women played prominent roles, of members of the group. Moffat also found himself opposed by Griqua factions, many of whom resented his power-mongering presence.35 Before the late 1810s, the earliest LMS agents in southern Africa were not particularly good or even very enthusiastic apostles of capitalist cultural practices, mostly because they were so poor themselves and so looked-down-upon by many respectable members of colonial society. More than a few also tended to believe in dreams, to hear the personal voice of God, or to look for the imminent end of the world. Those missionaries who were closest in time to the Enlightenment, in sum, acted least like the bourgeois agents of respectability described by the Comaroffs as quintessential exemplars of the rationalizing project of modernity. The colonial unrespectability of early missionaries was compounded by the fact that perhaps a third of them married African women before 1817, while several were involved in sexual scandals. Others took high-profile political positions that were unpopular among settlers. The Comaroffs pick up the story as Moffat, in common with many of his fellows, was urgently trying to reclaim the moral high ground and to reinvent the mission as visibly respectable and as focused on "civilization." A lot of this is more about the internal history of the LMS than about African Christianity; we certainly in general need more of the latter and perhaps less of the former. Nonetheless, it argues for the importance of local detail, and for the centrality of fractures within as well as between groups. It also points forward to ways in which converts would later need to perform "civilization" and "respectability" in order to maneuver on the colonial stage, not solely because their consciousnesses had been colonized. From the start, tensions among evangelicals themselves were fueled by anxiety over the rapid removal of Christianity from the control of white missionaries. This tension was arguably innate to a type of evangelical Christianity based on textual interpretation and the notion of divine inspiration, as well as being the product of Tswana reconstruction of Christian forms. Certainly, missionaries soon lost control even of "orthodox" Christianity. Among the northern Tswana, Paul Landau has brilliantly documented the use of Christianity by junior royals to challenge existing authority in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in ways that escaped 34 LMS-SA, 6/4/A: James Read to Joseph Hardcastle, Bethelsdorp, August 7, 1816. 35 See Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman.

Among the southern Tswana, Thlaping elites also exploited divisions among missionaries to their own political ends. In 1842, for example, Tswana elite men successfully appealed to LMS superintendent John Philip to fire missionary Holloway Helmore for excessive interference in congregational affairs, including deposing Mothibi's son as a deacon.36 Missionaries to the Tswana experienced other humiliations. The coherent Tswana group targeted by the mission decamped, to be replaced by a more motley group of refugees. The mission was battered by raids from various groups, could not protect its members, and was not successful at all until it started picking up displaced persons in the 1830s. A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS arise from this type of re-reading. At a macro level, the region was already turbulent and populations were mobile, so Christianity scarcely arrived as the harbinger of globalization in anything other than an ideological sense. This raises in turn the thorny and ultimately unanswerable question of whether Christianity would have had the capacity to colonize minds without the prior disruption of material conditions. We are back at the difficult issue of how determinative "culture" is by itself. Perhaps in the end, this rejigging of chronology strengthens the Comaroffs' fundamental argument about the inextricability of "culture" and material struggle. It does nonetheless pose all the more sharply the question of how Christianity-and religious innovation, more broadly defined- functioned in a frontier zone in a manner that was independent of the machinations of white missionaries.37 Also at the "macro" level, the Tswana were not entirely "local," nor were they unused to cultural difference. In a multi-lingual, multi-religious environment, were missionaries really needed to contextualize "Tswana custom"? Missionary papers record Mothibi making distinctions between !Kora, Tswana, and colonial Khoekhoe customs, for example. I would not want to deny the importance of local identity, or to exaggerate the degree of long-range contacts of the southern Tswana, in contrast to the remarkable global reach and global identity claims of the early missionary movement. There are issues of tremendous importance raised by that contrast. But it also seems important that there were other regional interlocutors who were of greater material importance initially to the Tswana than the Europeans, and with whom they already had the kind of cultural interchanges that might have permitted the type of self-consciousness about "Tswana" identity that the Comaroffs see as the fruit of the "long conversation." This is also a way of asking about what the southern African interior looked like before formal European colonialism and whether the communities of the region were really as settled as they appeared. There are echoes here of an older debate about whether the encounter with the "macrocosmic" claims of the "world religions" Christianity and Islam shattered the 36 Landau, Realm of the Word; Elbourne, Blood Ground. On Helmore's dismissal, see LMS-SA, 19/2/A: James Read to LMS Directors, Philipton, June 3, 1843. The LMS Directors overturned the dismissal and censured Philip. 37 An interesting point of contrast is provided by Janet Hodgson, "A Battle for Sacred Power: Christian Beginnings among the Xhosa," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa.

As Terence Ranger has argued, whatever the intellectual issues at stake, African societies, at least in the southern African interior, have to be recognized as also "macrocosmic" in the sense that they had long-range contacts, exchanged ideas over large swathes of territory (as the rapid spread of prophetic movements suggests), and rubbed up against a wide variety of different groups.38 The relative mobility of different communities was also a factor in breaking down localism. This type of approach, to my mind, decenters the European missionary-at least until the missionary came backed up by a colonial economy and a colonial army. The power exerted by the conditions of the "frontier zone" of the region is represented by the fact that even missionaries were compelled by material circumstances to take on features of African polities. The Comaroffs highlight the vision of Kuruman mission head and former gardener Robert Moffat, and his wife Mary, like that of many early nineteenth-century Nonconformist missionaries, as one of an unrealistic rural idyll, in which they sought to remake Africa in the image of a vanishing and imagined rural utopian Britain. One could, however, go further in considering the contradictions of Kuruman. Robert Moffat acted in many ways like an African leader as well as like a nostalgic Scot, and he needed to do so because of the material conditions of the frontier. In the 1820s, he proved unable to retain the allegiance of existing chiefs, for whom he was too clearly a competitor. As the refugee crisis accelerated, however, Moffat was able to gather together dispossessed people. The price of their admission was allegiance to the religion of the leader, since religion was used to rebuild communities. The currency of power was people. In similar ways, the control of women and their reproduction was important to the maintenance of the power of the patriarch, whether African chief or mission station head-Moffat even went so far, for example, as to attempt to discipline publicly Ann Hamilton, the wife of his colleague Robert Hamilton, for refusing to sleep with her husband.39 Moffat was more a part of the African frontier world than he might have liked to admit. A further critical point raised by this case study is that Africans transmitted Christianity more effectively than missionaries did. The centrality of Africans to the spread of Christianity means that much of the early history of the mission is unrecoverable. It is often unclear what kinds of Christianity were spread orally, for example. In other parts of southern Africa, prophetic figures emerged from time to time to use aspects of the Christian message in a context that suggests how quickly its language became unhinged from missionary guardianship. For example, Xhosa prophet and war hero Makanda Nxele (Makana), who led a Xhosa attack on the colony in 1819, had an earlier flirtation with the LMS; he was refused the right to work as a native agent when he insisted that there was a god for the white man and a god for the black man, and that he himself was related to Jesus Christ. The examples could be multiplied, as the Comaroffs would certainly agree.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 450 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh between orthodoxy as the missionaries perceived it and African prophetic innova- tion were fluid and could be crossed in both directions, explaining the anxiety of white missionaries to bring Christianity back under control. In contrast to the Comaroffs, who emphasize the orthodoxy of the Nonconformists (whom they see in rather stereotypical, indeed Victorianist, terms), I would contend that this anxiety was familiar from debates within the European churches as well; after all, Methodism had once been perceived from within the citadels of Anglican orthodoxy in ways similar to Nonconformist views of African ecstatic innovation.40 If in the early days of missionary activity, Christianity was never fully in the control of the white missionaries who had brought it and only became popular once it was spread mostly by Africans and then transformed in the process, what does this imply about how we might conceptualize the study of colonial missions? I have suggested in the past that the messy scenario I outline above, with its complications and its fudging across the fault lines, calls into question the utility at the micro level of a strict dialectical approach to the history of colonial Christianity. The ghost of French structuralist understandings of G. W. Hegel's master-slave dialectic seems to me to hover over and to constrain the first volume. In response, however, the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2 that I have too conventional an understanding of their view of dialectical processes. A dialectic is not a "formal, abstract, or strictly teleological movement through time and space," in a Hegelian sense. Rather, it is a "process of reciprocal determination; a process of material, social and cultural articulation-involving sentient human beings rather than abstract forces or structures."41 Colonialism is dialectical because it creates binary understandings of difference and depends on the idea of opposites; it is also presumably dialectical because colonial interaction shapes both the colonized and the colonizer in new ways. Returning to the issue at the end of Volume 2, the Comaroffs reiterate (although this seems to me a somewhat different take) that by "dialectics" they mean "the mutually transforming play of social forces whose outcome is neither linear nor simply overdetermined." Defined thus, they add, "it is hard to imagine how colonial history could be regarded as anything else."42 In a weak sense, this is undeniable. Furthermore, on this model, it may not matter that the early encounter between missionaries and Tswana was so much messier than a "dialectical" account would suggest. The Comaroffs' point is precisely that out of difference and mess colonialism created binary opposites. At the same time, the exact nature of this process is often hard to capture. It is interesting to hear John Comaroff raise, in a recently published transcribed conversation with Homi Bhabha, what he terms the question of theory related to "the old Manichean opposition between colonizer and colonized, those 'iteratively marked,' positionally conflated points of reference around which the human geography of empire is so widely imagined. How, other than purely by descriptive insistence, does one displace the crushing logic of binarism in terms of which 40 Among many possibilities, see Deborah Valenze, Prophetic Sons and Daughters: Female Preaching and Popular Religion in Industrial England (Princeton, N.J., 1985). 41 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 29. 42 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 410. AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 451 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne colonial worlds are apprehended and narrated?"43 I think this is a genuine point of tension for the Comaroffs, and quite rightly for many others. Perhaps my own discomfort arises from the difficulty of defining who the agents of dialectic are. In the end, the Comaroffs are interested in doing a historical anthropology of colonialism, more than of religion in colonial contexts. In this optic, the fault line of interest is that between colonized and colonizer. Religious belief did not, however, adhere to that fault line, even though both colonized and colonizers mobilized religion to the ends of power struggle. Nor of course was Christianity itself static. At the same time, the very notion of ethnic difference was still in the process of being worked out more broadly well past the early era of industrialization; therefore it was incorporated differently into the views of colonial evangelists at different times. From the point of view of the Comaroffs' overall narrative structure, this leads us away from the Enlightenment and onto the terrain of more immediately nineteenth-century colonial concerns. On this model, colonial conquest and the need to maintain and justify white rule shaped the mid- nineteenth-century culture of white Christianity. The end was not contained in the beginning but formed by colonial processes. Be that as it may, it is instructive that the Khoesan themselves were not able indefinitely to maintain the interstitial status to which Christianity gave them some access. By the early 1850s, many living in the Cape Colony were forced to choose between the colonial binaries of "black" and "white," in the 1850-1853 frontier war in which many people of Khoesan descent rebelled to fight against the "white" colony, as "race" became the determinant of colonial identity.44 The example also underscores the importance of "black" and "white" as colonial binaries arguably of more importance than "English" and "Tswana." All this should not, however, lead us to read the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in terms of the mid-nineteenth. There is a basic problem here that dogs the Comaroffs throughout the books. Christianity is both text and practice, and therefore difficult to pin down. Not only that, it also permits and contains a wide variety both of practices and of different interpretations of its central themes. As text, Christianity became a free-floating signifier. As a practice, it was fought over bitterly by those who wanted to benefit from it. It is therefore difficult to identify Christianity clearly with one side of a dialectical or even dialogic model. This is all the more problematic because it is hard to define Christianity clearly, other than by appeals to authority. There was considerable scope for Africans to reinvent Christianity even from the beginning of the mission described by the Comaroffs. In some ways, this is precisely the Comaroffs' point: the signs of Christianity were fought over by competing ethnic groups. The Comaroffs nonetheless cannot bring themselves to see acceptance of Christianity in its unadulterated mission form as anything other than a defeat for 43 Bhabha and Comaroff, "Speaking of Postcoloniality," 22. 44 Elbourne, Blood Ground, 345-76; Robert Ross, "The Kat River Rebellion and Khoikhoi Nationalism: The Fate of an Ethnic Identification," Kronos: Journal of Cape History/Tydskrif vir Kaaplandse Geskiedenis 24 (November 1997): 91-105.

This position ultimately obscures complexity. EVENTUALLY, ONE MUST CONFRONT the type of question raised by Leon de Kock, about disciplinary conventions and the fetishization of the archive.45 De Kock argues that historians have spent too much time in their reaction to this wonderful book looking for factual flaws. To put the question in its boldest form, are the details really that essential to the overall project? Perhaps less tendentiously, what are the Comaroffs doing that goes beyond the reading of the words of colonists? The Comaroffs are important precisely because they move beyond words to decipher the gestures of people in the past. They put an anthropologist's emphasis on ritual and performance. They add thereby a crucial dimension to our reading of culture-bound historical archives. The Comaroffs' understanding of performance goes well beyond the staged performances of religious rites (although they acknowledge at the same time that people used the framework of religious ritual as a springboard for their own acting out of emotions and ideas). The missionaries are described as performing civilization, in the hope of educating the Tswana to adopt Western cultural practices through the power of display. In response, the Tswana performed noncompliance or acted out cultural bricolage. The tangible display of the body interests the Comaroffs, just as the material suffering of the colonized body that we readers know is to come provides a moral template for our reading of the early nineteenth century. The authors are particularly interested in space and the disposition of the body in space: their analyses frequently return, like the apartheid state itself, to issues of the control of the movement of African bodies.46 The Comaroffs are in some ways mistrustful of the self-interested and one-sided colonial text and find more solidity in the unspoken exchanges of bodily perfor- mance. It is this approach that both furnishes the greatest richness of the books and yet at the same time has excited unease in some interlocutors. If the evidence that remains of Tswana actions is mostly accounts of their physical activity, does that not place the reporter (the anthropologist, the historian, or even the reader) in the privileged position of interpreting Tswana actions, leaving the Tswana themselves rarely free to speak directly in their own voice? Is this even an accurate assessment of the nature of the historical record, or are there more extensive Tswana records? J. D. Y. Peel and Terence Ranger have both queried the absence of Tswana 45 De Kock, "For and Against the Comaroffs." 46 For example, Volume 2 tellingly argues that integral to the late nineteenth-century struggle over African labor was a further struggle over the "distribution of people in space and, concomitantly, their passage across the social landscape." This is a typical discussion of space that appropriately reflects the struggle of the apartheid state to control the physical body, just as slavery had earlier lent mastery of the body to the slaveowner.

The Comaroffs have responded that community historical narrative was not a genre espoused by the Tswana. They argue, furthermore, that the quest for "narrative" is elitist: it is "a short step from the stress on narrative to the history of elites, thence to elitist history."48 The issue remains uneasily unresolved. For Paul Landau, the Comaroffs themselves have a culturally constrained view of what constitutes "genuine narrative." They pay "little attention to genealogy, song, Tswana conversation, letters, political speech, tales, myth or church charters- because they are not 'genuine' narratives. Consequently Tswana people's ideas of fulfillment and transcendence do not show themselves in either volume."49 Even the Tswana intellectual and politician Sol Plaatje's great novel Mhudi, which draws on Tswana traditions about the difaqane, has been brought into the fray: for the Comaroffs, the fact that Plaatje himself claims that he could only gather material in fragments suggests that the southern Tswana indeed did not have a tradition of sustained historical narrative as late as the early twentieth century, even though Mhudi is more conventionally seen as a reflection at least to some extent of more sustained Tswana oral tradition.50 There is another critical debate at work in these discussions of agency and voice. The Comaroffs are very clear that missionary activity was part of the victimization of Africans. Much recent scholarship on southern African Christianity emphasizes instead the agency of Africans in using and reshaping Christianity to their own ends, as the focus has shifted away from missionaries and onto African Christians. In some ways, the Comaroffs want to restore a sense of moral indignation at the ways in which colonial missions did change the consciousness of Africans in a damaging fashion. Ironically, this may involve seeing people as victims who did not necessarily see themselves that way at the time-another issue of authorial voice. The Comaroffs' anger represents nonetheless an important strand of longstanding protest across the colonized world at the "colonization of the mind."51 It is impossible to deny that many Christian missionaries had a profoundly negative 47 J.

Furthermore, as Peggy Brock has persuasively argued, missionary institutional structures affected the degree of control missionaries could exert over congregations, and these structures were affected by indigenous social arrangements as well as by state power.53 I would further contend, in ways there is not space to elaborate on fully here, that shame was a key element of colonial control. Mission education could and did reinforce this. At the same time, Christianity could also provide a language through which to reclaim dignity and deny the shaming process. I think it is important in sum to see Christianity as a language with many possible uses. Conversion, for example, fulfilled a wider and more flexible range of functions than is suggested by the Comaroffs' reduction of it to a symbolic field of struggle over capitalism. A reading that focuses too exclusively on Christianity as a language of cultural domination rather than a language with a multiplicity of possible meanings pays too much attention to the Western roots of Christianity and not enough to the multiple uses to which Africans very quickly put it. I make this comment in awareness of the extent to which the Comaroffs emphasize the need to explore African perspectives through every possible means, and the extent to which they clearly do this. However, conversion was even more of an empty signifier than the Comaroffs suggest, and some of these significations did not have a lot to do with rational capitalism. On the other hand, conversion was also an act, with attached rituals and beliefs, and this is important for understanding what the act meant in the immediate rather than long-term sense. Even if I am not completely at ease with a victimization model, I would want to add that these were and are enormously complicated processes. They had deep and often painful implications for many. This demands humility from any historian. Undergirding much of the above has been a historian's concern with chronology, which, while justified, cannot do full justice to the rich ferment of ideas in these remarkable books. The Comaroffs in fact comment on what they see as different disciplinary conventions and their inherent costs and benefits. They see real and longstanding differences, as they remark at the end of Volume 2, between the ideal type of a more conventional historian and the archetypal historical anthropologist: "differences between the ideographic and the nomothetic, between the effort to arrive at the fullest possible description of events in their infinite particularity and the desire to pick out general principles across time and space." The latter approach, they underscore, "demands a certain boldness of abstraction" and is "inherently risky."54 Although one would hope that historians are not as painstak- ingly antiquarian and abstraction-averse as this implies, there is some justice to the 52 A wonderfully instructive example of the ambiguities of Christian liberal control of the education system in South Africa, just before apartheid, is furnished by Shula Marks, ed., Not Either an Experimental Doll: The Separate Worlds of Three South African Women (London, 1985). 53 Peggy Brock, "Mission Encounters in the Colonial World: British Columbia and South-West Australia," Journal of Religious History 24, no. 2 (June 2000): 159-79. 54 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 411.

The very manner in which they offer up a multitude of bold ideas, fizzing with possibility, also ensures that they offer a number of hostages to fortune. The Comaroffs are, for example, probably the most influential of recent scholars to argue for tight linkage between missionary activity, "modernity," "Enlighten- ment," and globalization. As Brian Stanley points out, this is also a question that has been much debated in the past few years by Christian theologians and mission theorists, with theologians paying particular attention to the damage done by the universalist truth claims of mission Christianity.55 More broadly, the Comaroffs are participating in a vast debate about modernity and postmodernity among social, political, and cultural theorists that it would be foolhardy to venture upon here. Their contribution is both important and vexed: important because they show the culturally constrained nature of claims to "modernity," vexed because despite everything they reify the truth claims of modernity and have too neat a view of the "Enlightenment," despite substantial historical debate on the utility of the concept. In so doing, they exaggerate the long-term influence of mission Christianity on the material subjugation of the Tswana, particularly by minimizing the impact of illiberal forces and overemphasizing cultural change. This could be true, however, and the significance of the Comaroffs' analysis of practice still be undimmed. The Comaroffs see "modernity" as "always historically constructed." It is in their view "an ideological formation in terms of which societies valorize their own practices by contrast to the specter of barbarism and other marks of negation."56 The Comaroffs link modernity to a view of the self as a rights-bearing atomistic individual, ultimately the "fully fledged bourgeois subject." They further associate modernity with a wide-ranging series of cultural and economic practices, including but not limited to dependence on a worldwide market, industrialization, the use of money, the use of "advanced" agricultural practices, the promotion of individuated space, and a sense of the body as private.57 It is part of the great richness of the Comaroffs' approach that they so fruitfully link cultural and economic practices, refusing to prioritize one over the other. At the same time, this view of modernity is slippery-and this is both its richness and an occasional source of frustration. The Comaroffs move between presenting the truth claims of modernity-its "text," if one likes-and the concrete material practices that advocates saw as characterizing the modern. The authors' desire not to take the truth claims of missionaries at face value make it difficult for them to spell out what, if any, were the irreducible material practices that defined modernity. If there weren't any, however, what was the material force behind the cultural claims and practices of missionaries? Yet it is arguable that at least some of what the Comaroffs identify as the 55 Brian Stanley, "Christian Missions and the Enlightenment: A Reevaluation," in Stanley, ed., Christian Missions and the Enlightenment (Grand Rapids, Mich., 2001), 1-2.

There are echoes here of the great debates between radical and liberal historians in 1970s and 1980s South Africa, split over the origins of apartheid.58 For the "radical" school, liberalism, in both its ideological and economic sense, contributed to the economic domination that was at the root of apartheid. Radical historians argued that late nineteenth-century British capitalism precipitated and anticipated many features of South African society under apartheid, just as the Comaroffs here blame nine- teenth-century British liberal ideas about such things as money, markets, the individuated self, and the primacy of certain gender roles for the mental prepara- tion of the Tswana for labor oppression. Indeed, in their 2000 article "Millennial Capitalism: First Thoughts on a Second Coming," the Comaroffs explicitly link what they term the "Age of Revolution" (1789-1848) to the current "Age of Millennial Capitalism" with their similar anxieties and ontological challenges.59 This article makes explicit the magical, mystical elements of neoliberalism, and its culturally constrained forms, in contrast to neoliberals' claims to rationality and access to universal truth, just as Of Revelation and Revolution describes culturally constructed views of "modernity" and a "modern" economy. This is very helpful. Nonetheless, I think it would also be useful in Of Revelation and Revolution to be more explicit about actual intellectual debates among and between people: to have more ideology in places and less hegemony. The argument made by many, that early twentieth-century white liberals in practice came to support racist segregationist policies, while in ideological terms liberalism's support of the free market economy and nonviolent political action left it with little space to mobilize opposition to apartheid, all adds up to a trenchant and at least partially justified critique. By leaving out of the picture the intellectual shifts in liberalism (and among the opponents of liberalism) on the ground in the nineteenth century (and implicitly in the twentieth), however, the Comaroffs, like other authors, conflate several ills into one. Disciplinary specialists might want to throw further darts at the Comaroffs' narrative superstructure. Must industrialization and by implication modernity really begin in 1789? This is very French. What might be the impact of the questioning by economists of the linearity and suddenness of industrialization in Britain, which now looks more like an extended messy process than a "revolution" within neat chronological parameters? What difference does it make that the evangelical movement had many roots in seventeenth and eighteenth-century continental pietism? If Protestantism is the necessary condition of capitalism, where does this leave Catholic countries (not least France)? The point I want to close on is, however, that of tragedy. If there is, as I have suggested, an implicit narrative of origins that runs throughout Of Revelation and Revolution and lends the work its moral passion, this is not, for all that, a straightforward linear narrative of beginnings and ends. Rather, it is marked by 58 Christopher Saunders, The Making of the South African Past: Major Historians on Race and Class (Cape Town, 1988), describes the liberal/radical split. 59 Jean Comaroff and John L. Comaroff, "Millennial Capitalism: First Thoughts on a Second Coming," Public Culture 12, no. 2 (2000): 334.

The Nonconformist missionaries who labored so intensely to change the daily lives of Africans in order to induct them into the "modern" economy did not foresee the devastating consequences of that economy for the Tswana peasantry (as might be said of some of the missionaries' modern counterparts, development workers). At the same time, the Comaroffs write as though missionaries inducted the Tswana into the global market and colonized their consciousness in a way that made their engagement more likely. It seems to me just as possible that the global market and related economic coercion came crashing into the lives and consciousness of the Tswana in a way about which they could do little, particularly as their contact was frequently mediated by coercive legislation on the part of the colonial state.60 Missionaries reflected the efforts of other Westerners to moralize the market: to see it as a force for moral good. In this, they shared the ambiguities (and guilty conscience?) of nineteenth-century liberalism. It does not take a great leap of the imagination to find contemporary parallels in the neoliberal discourse, and of course the Comaroffs are right that this putatively universalist creed contains deeply embedded culturally specific assumptions, as did nineteenth-century Anglo- American liberalism itself.61 If nonetheless market expansion is relatively inevita- ble, then is it not appropriate to ask on what terms this expansion might be the most moral? Or is the most appropriate response full-fledged resistance? Must the global marketplace necessarily be bad, on average, for Africa? From a somewhat different point on the ideological spectrum, one might also ask whether in fact Africa is incorporated into the global market on the equal terms supposedly demanded by neoliberal economics. These are clearly issues beyond the scope of this article, but not without historical parallels. In late nineteenth and early twentieth-century terms, the Tswana, it could be argued, were crowded out of an agricultural market in which many were making profits and farming more effectively than whites, in fact, in order to favor white farmers artificially and in order to bolster labor for the mines, again through "artificial" restraints on movement, through the theft of land, through racially targeted taxation, and through coercive legislation. This antici- pated many of the later strategies of apartheid.62 It is not as clear to me as it is to the Comaroffs that the questions some missionaries and Africans were asking about the possibility of a just economy were not the right ones, even if the culturally constrained answers they gave were so obviously, hopelessly wrong. I do not have answers to these questions either-merely some sympathy with the misguided quest for certainty in a rapidly changing, brutal, and deeply uncertain economic universe. 60 This is a point also made by Landau, "Hegemony and History." 61 Uday Mehta, Liberalism and Empire: A Study in Nineteenth-Century British Liberal Thought (Chicago, 1999); Mehta, "Liberal Strategies of Exclusion," in Stoler and Cooper, Tensions of Empire, 59-86. 62 Ted Matsetela, "The Life Story of Mma-Pooe: Aspects of Sharecropping and Proletarianization in the Northern Orange Free State 1890-1930," in Shula Marks and Richard Rathbone, eds., Industrialization and Social Change in South Africa (New York, 1982), 212-37; Charles Van Onselen, The Seed Is Mine: The Life of Kas Maine, a South African Sharecropper, 1894-1985 (Cape Town, 1996). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh I HAVE SUGGESTED THROUGHOUT THIS ESSAY that the Comaroffs present nineteenth- century missionaries as fairly powerful figures, able to effect changes in the consciousness of Tswana interlocutors, despite the resistance of many. In contrast, I see Christianity as important but, with some important exceptions, not necessarily white missionaries themselves. I also suggest that the linkages between political and cultural colonialism are often unclear in Of Revelation and Revolution, and that the role of "cultural colonialism" is overdetermined. If it is possible to guess about such counterfactuals, I suspect that at least some of the missionaries whose work has been scrutinized by the Comaroffs would ironically have preferred the Comaroffs' account of their activities to mine, however doubtless upset they would have been at the implication that their preaching laid the groundwork for the Tswana's entrapment within enslaving capitalist systems. But the Comaroffs do give the missionaries credit for a coherent, rationalizing, globalizing system that taught one universal truth. They also recognize the missionaries' own belief that they might instill into their converts the necessary principles of "civilization" to transform totally their supposedly primitive economies and to move them rapidly up the scale of human development toward settled commercial societies. My own interpretation, while recognizing the tremendous importance of the universalizing project as a mode of domination, calls into question the capacity of Christianity to convey as effectively as it would have liked a message of unifying orthodoxy, or indeed the overall ability of missionaries to accomplish their objectives. From the very beginning of the activity of Christians in Africa, as elsewhere in the world, Christianity was out of control, unorthodox, and an available subject for reinter- pretation in light of the needs of its interlocutors. Ironically, in sum, it is not always wise to take missionaries at their word.

Abstract: Ibid., p. 111. Even Riffaterre's approach to the structuring unsaid of textual writing can be seen to represent on its own terms a shift from the ontology of narrative toward its epistemology at the level of form rather than content. By the deliberate provocation of his title, his semiotic narratology is interested not just in the structural essence of fiction as art but in its specific
            truth:a story's immanent signifying patterns in their subtextual disclosure.<br>

Abstract: I conclude, then, that the task of theological ethics and, more broadly, the humanities and, if I can be bold, more broadly still the university itself is to examine carefully and critically and from multiple perspectives—including the religions—what it means to be and to live as responsible human beings within the vulnerabilities and complexities of forms of life. When we within our several disciplines respond to this task with all the vitality and resources at our disposal, then, I believe, knowledge will indeed grow from more to more, and life will be increased without the illusions of power or servitude to the tyranny of idols.<br>

Abstract: Readers without solid background knowledge of French film and colonial history may have some difficulty navigating through Eades's tightly packed, allusive prose, especially since no index of any kind is provided. This absence is difficult to understand in a work of serious scholarship aimed at academic readers, as is the press's decision to invest in numerous glossy still‐frame illustrations that add nothing substantive to the analysis. However, the extensive, thematically organized filmographies and bibliographies that conclude the volume should prove very useful to all readers by providing a starting point for further reading and research.<br>

Abstract: The text covers a lot of ground, delving into many of the touch points between theology and human rights and endeavoring to demonstrate how those points can be sources of mutual enrichment rather than conflict. At times the comprehensive scope of the text, which draws on the insights of so many, makes it a challenging read and leaves the reader wanting more development and illustration of the fruits of the author’s argument. Overall, the text is an important contribution to the constructive engagement between theology and human rights discourse and is a serious challenge to those in either camp who would peremptorily reject the insights of the other.<br>

Abstract: Closely related to the philosophical problem of consciousness of time was the question of the meaning of time and duration in psychology and in literature. Although Mooij mentions William James's notion of “specious present” in passing, he fails to explicate James's perception of time, which attempted to provide an empiricist account of our temporal concepts through the influence of John Locke (p. 197). Apart from this caveat, the book's strength lies in its perceptiveness and breadth of interpretation of the history of the concept of time. Mooij's accuracy in comprehending and in transmitting the essence of such difficult and complicated philosophies is remarkable.<br>

The relocation and opening of the files of the former Dirección Federal de Seguridad [Federal Security Bureau] in the former prison comes along with the return of victims and victimizers, only now they come back as ghosts of things past. The novel works with the binomial jail/archive, featuring Lecumberri as a live space from which to begin a search for justice and truth, without sinking into melancholy or victimhood.<br>

Abstract: Framed in such a way, the early movements of Mahler's Second Symphony—characterized by the alternation between halting sections that dissolve almost as soon as they begin and long-breathed melodies that seem to unfold effortlessly—suggest the melancholic subject's struggle between despair in the face of abject meaninglessness and a manic euphoria, neither of which addresses the loss. By contrast, the text in the symphony's final movement, adapted by Mahler from Friedrich Klopstock's chorale on the resurrection of the dead, encourages true remembrance of the deceased as a figure beyond death. Heard as a musical enactment of mourning, the final movement suggests that the dead who are mourned are resurrected through remembrance. Forcing us to acknowledge Mahler's death on some level, the final movement completes the work of mourning by engendering the composer's own resurrection in our memories as we witness each performance of his Second Symphony.<br>

Abstract: The L.D.S Church's use of commemorative rituals and narrative history to simultaneously adapt and maintain identity is not unique, but it is uniquely available to analysis because of the immediacy of the change and the Saints' devotion to record-keeping. Thus, the drama of LDS survival during the Progressive Era illuminates age-old religious strategies for adaptation to social norms, which strategies preserve the faithful's confidence in the timelessness of their god's moral and ecclesiastical order. More narrowly, these events in American church history are critical for understanding how the civilly disobedient Saints finally accepted the rule of federal law without losing their religion.<br>

Abstract: Memoria Abierta's work responds to the need for a dialogue in Argentina among human rights organizations, the government, and civil society that will stimulate the formation of a collective memory about the history of State-led terrorism in the country. Processing documents, testimonies, and images related to the history of illegal repression in Argentina (c. 1974–1983), and creating a topographical reconstruction of the locations where State-led terrorism occurred poses diverse ethical, technical, and political problems regarding the recollection, description, transmission, and diffusion of the materials of memory. This article describes some of these challenges and how they affect and are shaped by the work of Memoria Abierta.<br>

Abstract: Recent study of the nature of textuality as such opens new insights for the study of the Bible. Although individual parts of the Bible have oral antecedents, the Bible as a whole has existed only as a text, and a unique kind of text, folded back on itself out of communal memory as no other book has been. A text is a monument. Textuality establishes a special relationship between discourse and death. Spoken words are exchanges between living persons. The text presents its message as well if its author is dead as it does if he or she is alive. Print is even more bound to death than writing is. In comparison with oral performance-delivery of an oration, song-a text physically has certain special alliances with past time. All texts come out of the past. Literature as text is psychologically retrospective: its effects typically include an element of nostalgia. Because of its future orientation, culminating in the closing words of Revelation, "Come, Lord Jesus" (as against typical narrative closes such as "They lived happily ever after"), the Bible has an unusual relationship to textuality: it is not literature in the way other texts are. Typical narrative plot structures existence retrospectively: the story is organized back from the conclusion. This retrospective organization is maximized by writing, which tightens plot and makes more of re-cognition, a kind of return to the beginning (the past) and hence a cyclic pattern. In addition to being related intimately to death, writing and print are also limitlessly fecund, the central forces in the evolution of consciousness, once they appear. The fecundity of writing and print, like other fecundity in human existence, is achieved by passage through death. "Unless the grain of wheat dies." The Word of God in the Person of Jesus Christ is conceived of by analogy with the spoken word. The Father speaks the Word, the Son (eo verbum quo filius); he does not write the Word, who would then by biblical attestation be not life but death: "The letter kills, but the spirit [pneuma, breath, producer of speech] gives life." The Son passes through death to resurrected life. The written text, also God's word, must also be resurrected-by interpretation, by being inserted into the lifeworld of living persons. Hermeneutics is resurrection and in common Christian teaching demands faith. Study of the textuality of the Bible-which presumes but is not the same as study of the text of the Bible-opens many new theological questions and / or gives new contours to old questions.<br>

Abstract: Creativity is seen as inherent in the developmental potential of the individual and of society as well. This "yen for becoming" is felt at all ages, and is in fact recognized as associated with the realization of the profoundest aspirations of man. Its origin is detected in early childhood. It is deeply rooted in the associative trend of thought and action, a trend which tends to perpetuate itself in the direction of unending abundance and novelty. The process assumes passage from awareness to memory, and even to the subconscious. The thought of the moment dips into the past, awakens memories, even those seemingly forgotten, reactivates all that is pertinent for the creation of new structures. It is believed that this tendency is essentially dynamic, endowed with energy which drives toward endless realizations. Nothing dies in the subconscious, as Freud pointed out. Each past experience is apt to return into consciousness and engage in a double process of homogenization and heterogenization, of convergent and divergent currents. Here the combinations, or commutations and permutations, are indefinite, an array which defies any computer. Creativity calls into play all energized experiences, present and stored, cognitive and affective, perceptual and conceptual, sensory and motoric, verbal and non-verbal, taxonomic and functional, real and symbolic; it constantly provokes new patterns. The richer the content of experience, the greater the possibility of innovation. The creative construction starts with the activation of readily available knowledge, the elements of which trigger related material in the memory and the subconscious. The movement is derived from active associations that continue to connect the units, and is oriented toward specific goals, leading to eventual syntheses, which may be expressed in either action or discourse. Here we face an unfurling, which coincides with interpretation, the unlocking of the new meaning built from the past upon the first meaning. This event, really never-ending, is a basic condition of life; it stimulates the spirit in a posture of perpetual emergence.<br>

Abstract: Anecdotal evidence suggests that many qualitative researchers have had the experience of discovering that their informants had told them lies. This is quite different to those instances where faulty memory, subjective perception, partial or erroneous knowledge, a desire to give the researcher what they think they want, or even where a 'personal myth' comes in to play, because a lie is a conscious and deliberate intention to deceive. What should researchers do when they discover that they have been misled? What are the implications for qualitative methodology and its practitioners in the light of the criteria for good practice outlined in the Tooley Report? This article draws on two examples of informants who lied, in order to explore some of the questions and issues that can arise. It suggests, tentatively, that generic criteria may not always be sufficiently sensitive to cope with complexities of social life.<br>

Abstract: In this introduction to a selection of case studies on the theme "the past in music" I offer a few thoughts on the nature of the past and the role of memory in constructing historical narrative, with reference to the way in which these concepts have been theorized by historians, archaeologists, anthropologists and ethnomusicologists. In reviewing the different ways in which echoes of the past can still be heard in the music of the present, I consider the capacity of music to evoke, embody and transform the past and, by so doing, to act as a medium for history and its interpretation.<br>

Abstract: This paper explores the interactive relationship of memory and history during the ethnographic research process, using as its case study interviews with Syrian Jews about a hymn (pizmon) repertory. The paper uses strategies of the new historicism as well as concepts from psychology, literary theory and anthropology to explore ways in which ethnomusicologists are instrumental both in eliciting memories and in constructing historical narratives.<br>

Abstract: In "The Magic Mountain," the only literary text by Thomas Mann in which German anti-Semitism is an object of satire, it remains uncertain whether a number of individuals are to be considered Jewish, or not. These uncertainties are symptomatic of the novel's protracted genesis, and especially of Thomas Mann's lifelong, historically and biographically conditioned efforts to distance himself from the anti-Semitic typologies evident in his early work. The most prominent of the relevant individuals in "The Magic Mountain," Dr. Krokowski, exemplifies this phenomenon. The various characteristics attributed to Krokowski evoke the continuing memory of a literary figure through whom Thomas Mann had previously only intended to relieve his anti-Semitic resentments. Thus Krokowski has a dual significance, representing Thomas Mann's early anti-Semitism and his later and vigorous, but nevertheless not entirely successful, attempts to overcome it.<br>

Abstract: Beginning with Maurice Halbwachs's theory of collective memory and the great body of sociological, historical, and political-science literature on war and aggression that postdates Halbwachs, the author attempts to identify the elements of aggressor—victim memory through a detailed analysis of the 1994 Rwandan genocide. In participant and third-party narratives of the genocide, it is possible to observe a commemorative quality in the campaign of mass murder. The author suggests that the persistence of post-traumatic culture and the failure of dialogue can lead people to kill in remembrance of earlier aggression: in such cases, "acting out" substitutes for "working through," with horrifying consequences.<br>

Abstract: Using the example of former Yugoslavia, specifically the Serbian and Croatian nations, this article examines the transformation of collective memory of aggression and victimhood by focusing on the content of national narratives. The article begins by examining narratives developed at the founding of Yugoslavia and proceeds to trace the reinterpretation of these narratives as a function of their political instrumentality—especially in Serbia and Croatia—for respective nationalist projects. In the end, the article provides tools with which to frame two questions: first, whether political and social stability is being created at the cost of forgetting and repression; second, whether a "policy of remembrance" is socially "desirable" in practice. Both forgetting and an instrumental "policy of remembrance" based on the power of revelation perpetuate aggressor—victim divisions: what is needed, rather, is a stable, systematic process of remembrance and reconciliation.<br>

Abstract: Chile's collective memory has been brutalized by state-implemented terrorism. This historical process has resulted in, among other things, a "torn collective memory." The history and memory of the period of so-called popular power (1970-1973) continue to be largely unknown. Oral history allows us to begin a slow process of historical reconstruction as well as to reflect on the construction of militant memories.<br>

Abstract: The dictatorship in Chile perpetrated massive human rights violations for 17 years, causing a rupture in social processes and engendering fear in the population. Data being gathered in an ongoing participatory action research study of the población (shanty-town) La Pincoya show that while memory can be debilitating to most persons, it may empower others. Memories of the practices of the military regime continue to cause fear in some of the population, affecting community cohesion and participation in local organizations. This has led to the dismantling of social networks in the community, robbing members of their ability to be the protagonists of their own lives.<br>

Abstract: This book of collected papers, published by the DFG-Sonderforschungsbereich Erinnerungskulturen ("Memory Cultures") at the Justus Liebig University of Gießen, gives a broad overview of approaches and results of memory research within various disciplines. Despite many interesting insights, the book offers no general framework by which the different aspects analyzed by the authors could be classified and related to one another. Thus, the shortcomings of memory studies, from a cultural perspective and understood as an interdisciplinary, multidimensional research program, become visible.<br>

Abstract: In many parts of the world, excavations of British military sites have unearthed material reflecting lifeways in the British Empire. Specifically, studies of historical ceramics and glass have greatly advanced our understanding of status and material expression. This study highlights the current body of knowledge on British military crested ceramics, contrasting the rarity of archaeological finds with their abundance in documentary sources. An elemental stylistic analysis reveals that these crests expressed regimental affiliation as the fundamental unit of self-identification. Symbolic interpretation of these crests stresses their active role in the socialization of officers and structuring collective memory, particularly through the mess institution.<br>

Abstract: Experiences that do not fit squarely into known categories pose a challenge to notions of organizational learning that rely primarily on scientific or experiential approaches. Making sense of, responding to, and learning from such unusual experiences requires reflection and novel action by organizational actors. We argue that narrative development processes make this organizational learning possible. By developing narratives, organizational actors create situated understandings of unusual experiences, negotiate consensual meanings, and engage in coordinated actions. Through the accumulation of narratives about unusual experiences, an organization builds a memory with generative qualities. Specifically, through narratives, actors evoke memories of prior unusual experiences and how they were dealt with, and this generates new options for dealing with emerging unusual experiences. We outline a framework detailing how narrative development processes enable organizational learning from unusual experiences and conclude by summarizing how this approach differs from and yet builds upon scientific and experiential approaches to learning.<br>

Abstract: Controlling for insecurities depends on a capacity to make inferences on the basis of experiences about the past, yet the use of knowledge about the past for anticipating and predicting future threats is highly problematic. This article examines the problem of governing individuals on the basis of what is available about their past deeds and social networks in governmental and commercial archives. It highlights the tension between administrative and private narratives about individuals, the former being constructed on the basis of minute details collected and stored about individuals since birth, and the latter referring to the accounts individuals offer of themselves. By applying the notions of ipse and idem identity developed by Paul Ricoeur, the article examines the two-way flow between memory and identity and the consequent concern that administrative narratives are blind to the ethical renewal of individuals, to the capacity of Man to extricate himself from the shackles of his past. To prepare the ground, the article considers some inherent limitations of biopolitics, pointing out that although biopolitics was classically concerned to govern both individual bodies and the body politic, administrative and governmental limitations have led states to govern the "average citizen" rather than individuals in their "individuality."<br>

Abstract: This paper serves as an introduction to this special edition of the International Journal of Historical Archaeology on the theme of archaeology, memory and oral history. Recent approaches to oral history and memory destabilise existing grand narratives and confront some of the epistemological assumptions underpinning scientific archaeology. Here we discuss recent approaches to memory and explore their impact on historical archaeology, including the challenges that forms of oral and social memory present to a field traditionally defined by the relationship between material culture and text. We then review a number of themes addressed by the articles in this volume.<br>

Abstract: The method adopted in this study of Meir Shalev's poetics involves the simultaneous application of two complementary theories: the theory of literary mythopoesis (based on Aleksei Losev's personalistic theory of myth) and the theory of the origins of signs, language and culture developed by Eric Gans. It is shown that images of incorporated memory in the novel function as synergetic mechanisms both of turning signs into personalities and of turning personalities into signs. The unity of the body and memory representations appears to be the prominent feature of Shalev's postmodern fiction, which serves as the significant step in the development of magical realism in Israeli literature.<br>

Abstract: Classroom discipline systems are considered as patriarchal moral systems focused on hyper-individuality and dependent upon rules, consequences, and principles focused through authoritarian structures. Three example systems (Assertive Discipline, Glasser's Control Theory, and Discipline with Dignity) are critiqued using Noddings' analysis of evil and Welch's liberation theology. As an alternative grounding, freedom of responsibility is proposed, moved foward through Noddings' mediation and care and Welch's dangerous memory and solidarity with oppressed peoples. Les différentes approches à la discipline dans la salle de classe sont considérés comme des systèmes patriarcaux et moraux qui ont pour but de brimer l'individualité. Ces systèmes ont également comme bases des règlements, des conséquences et des principes imposés par des structures autoritaires. A la lumière de l'analyse de Nodding sur le mal et de la théologie de la libération de Welch, nous critiquons trois systèmes de discipline: "Assertive Discipline, Glasser's Control Theory, Discipline with Dignity." Comme alternative nous proposons plutôt une approche dite "liberté responsable" qui s'inspire des concepts de médiation et de soin de Nodding et des concepts de mémoire dangereuse et de solidarité des opprimés de Welch.<br>

Abstract: This article interprets John Sayles' 1996 film Lone Star as a reflection on how a community whose history is steeped in violence, such as the US, should seek to manage its difficult cultural memory. A conceptual triad of love, justice, and tragedy utilised to interpret the film's last line, 'Forget the Alamo.' It is concluded that the memory of a troubled past can only serve as the basis for responsible public life when we, like the characters in Lone Star, choose to remember with a charity that liberates both our ancestors and our selves from having to play out the roles of hero or villain.<br>

Abstract: Miroslav Volf has provocatively argued that redemption necessitates forgetting (1996, 2006). Yet, Volf's claims insufficiently consider the narratival configuration of memory. This essay utilises Paul Ricoeur's work on mimesis in order to challenge Volf's case for forgetting. The author advances Ricoeur's philosophical description of forgiveness toward a theological account of divine forgiveness as re-narration, gift-giving funded by trinitarian abundance.<br>

Abstract: Un autre exemple de trivialité : au début de son texte, Badiou évoque un conflit, une
« guerre abstraite » actuellement en cours entre vision juive et vision chrétienne de l'histoire;
et donc, selon lui, la Mémoire... s'inscrit dans cette rivalité pour conquérir la « direction spiri-
tuelle du camp "démocratique" ». Et attention, Ricœur vise à « rien moins qu'une victoire »!
Le déclin de l'influence chrétienne et le brio de la pensée juive au sens large (sans garantie de
durée!) dans la culture française et européenne sont patents, mais ce constat accrédite-t-il une
vision paranoïaque de la vie intellectuelle? D'autres exemples dans le Siècle, op. cit., par
exemple une parole d'un poème de Celan inspiré de la mémoire d'Auschwitz, rapportée par
Badiou aux slogans des manifestants de décembre 1995 pour leur retraite, à Roanne-Trifouillis-
les-Oies : « Tous ensemble, tous ensemble, ouais! » (p. 139).<br>

Abstract: By establishing a parallel between the cycle of Lumière films and the Age of the Enlightenment ("siècle des lumières"), the author identifies the pensive character of the films' images as well as the aesthetic of the visible world they display. She then examines the transformation of a time-image into a memory-image in the Lumière films, arguing that the films are not only offer time-images, that is, residual images of the past, but have become images-as-memory in the contemporary spectator's mind.<br>

Abstract: This article considers two revenants – a man and a ghost – who haunt the Fann Psychiatric Clinic in Dakar, Senegal. Following Derrida's assertion that haunting is historical, I take seriously the concept of haunting and insist upon its relevance to anthropological inquiry. As a mode of storytelling that comes from a particular way of apprehending the world, I argue that anthropology might give credence to specters as social figures and assign ethnography the task of chasing after ghosts, not simply for the poetic spaces they may open up but out of a concern for justice and responsibility in the past, present, and future. My own ethnographic encounter with the two revenants described here has generated questions about the often taken-for-granted equivalence of the real and the true. Likewise, it has encouraged me to interrogate the unpredictable (and oftentimes uneasy) cohabitation of memory and history, both within the Fann Clinic and beyond.<br>

Abstract: Les monuments voués à la guerre abondent en Russie, comme dans de nombreux autres pays. Ils font partie du paysage, tout en le caractérisant. Ces monuments font appel au passé et aux souvenirs. Ce faisant, ils définissent l'appartenance. Et tout en remémorant le passé, ils cherchent également à déterminer l'avenir. Le fait de se souvenir d'une guerre est un acte politique en soi. On se souvient, et en se souvenant on se définit au sein de sa communauté, de son pays et du monde. À tout le moins, c'est le cas dans l'Europe de l'Est et la Russie. Le territoire a été envahi maintes fois au cours des derniers siècles et cela a entrainé le développement d'une mémoire sélective, une « curation » de la nation. Nous étudions ici les souvenirs de la Russie afin de démontrer comment les monuments et les musées de guerre définissent non seulement le passé, mais également le présent et les rêves que l'on forge pour l'avenir. War monuments are abundant in Russia; they are part of the landscape, while defining the terrain. Calling to the past and bringing forth memories, they define belonging, commemorating the past while shaping the future. Remembering a war is a political act and, in remembering, we define our place in our community, country and the world. Such is the case in Eastern Europe and Russia whose territories have been invaded many times over the centuries, which has led to development of a selective memory, the "curation" of the nation. This article explores memories of Russia to demonstrate how monuments and museums of war define the past, present and dreams for the future.<br>

Abstract: Since their arrival in France in the early 1960s, former settlers of Algeria have developed an array of private and public "sites of memory" projects that have remained unnoticed in wider French society or have been interpreted uncharitably. This article offers a new perspective on these projects. Informed by Maurice Halbwachs' concern with the material supports for collective memory and Sigmund Freud's insights on loss, I reinterpret them as stages in a work of mourning, and offer new insights on the wider question of France's relationship to its colonial past.<br>

Author(s): Grethlein Jonas<br>
Abstract: This book examines Greek engagements with the past as articulations of memory formulated against the contingency of chance associated with temporality. Based on a phenomenological understanding of temporality, it identifies four memorializing strategies: continuity (tradition), regularity (exemplarity), development, and acceptance of chance. This framework serves in pursuing a twofold aim: to reconstruct the literary field of memory in fifth-century BCE Greece; and to interpret Greek historiography as a memorializing mode. The key contention advanced by this approach is that acts of memory entailed an "idea of history" that was articulated not only in historiography, but also in epinician poetry, elegy, tragedy, and oratory. The book offers a rich account of poetic conventions and contexts through which each of these genres counterbalanced contingency through the use of exemplary and traditional modes of memory. This fine analysis highlights the grip of the present on the past as a significant feature of both historiographical and nonhistoriographical genres. The essay argues that this work fills a disciplinary gap by extending the reflection on memory to a new period, Greek antiquity. The retrospective positioning of this period at the outset of Western historical thought brings Grethlein's investigation to the center of debates about memory, temporality, and the meaning history. In engaging with the book's argument, the essay suggests that historiographical memory emerged in Greece not as a first-order encounter with time, but as a second-order encounter with forgetting. This confrontation marked a certain separation of historiography from other memorializing genres. Whereas poetic and rhetorical memories were posited against contingency, historiography sought to retrieve those aspects of the past that may otherwise have been irretrievably lost and forgotten. In doing so, it formulated the historiographical imperative as a negation of forgetting that problematized the truth-value of memory and the very act of remembering the past.<br>

Abstract: Ces réserves sont ponctuelles, en voici quelques exemples. Comme tout binôme, et il n'est pas
le seul dans le livre, le terme de contre-mémoire risque de produire l'impression d'opposition
mécanique ce qui n'est sûrement pas l'intention de l'auteure. Sur un autre registre, malgré tout
mon respect pour l'héritage intellectuel de Pierre Bourdieu, je ne suis pas convaincu par les efforts
de Christine Chivallon d'appliquer son appareil conceptuel à l'analyse du travail de la mémoire.
Puisque son érudition est très impressionnante, l'absence des travaux de Nathan Wachtel surprend
d'autant plus. L'Invention du quotidien de Michel de Certeau est citée, mais je n'ai trouvé aucune
mention de son concept opératoire de « propre », à mon avis très pertinent pour la démarche de
l'auteure. J'estime également que le concept de « lieu de mémoire » de Pierre Nora est trop rapidement
jugé inopérant pour sa recherche.<br>

Abstract: In Matter and Memory, Bergson examines the relationship between perception and memory, the status of consciousness in its relation to the brain, and more generally, a possible conjunction of matter and mind. Our reading focuses in particular on his understanding of the evanescent presence of the present and of its debt vis-à-vis the "unconscious" consciousness of a "virtual" past. We wish to show that the Bergsonian version of a critique of "the metaphysics of presence" is, for all that, an offshoot of a Platonic type of metaphysics. It is true that Bergson departs from traditional stand-points on the side of a self-sufficient and original present and a form of presence to which the transparency of consciousness would confer the character of immediate evidence. All the same, it can hardly be claimed that his rehabilitation of the past and the unconscious opens up new perspectives on how forgetting and death are bound up with the work of memory.<br>

Abstract: In From Beast to the Blonde, Marina Warner studies the status of fairy tales as historical documents which
give an account of women's daily experiences, as they illustrate their particular rites of passage and the relevance
of maternal figures in their lives. The resonance of Mother Goose is taken by Warner "either as a historical source,
or a fantasy of origin" which she can trace into ancient traditions, like the Islamic or the Christian, and which
adds credibility to the stories (1994, xxiii).<br>

Abstract: This paper compares Maurice Halbwachs's theory of collective memory to the most typical articulation of group memory in France before the twentieth century, especially from the late sixteenth century to the end of the eighteenth century. It argues that the twentieth-century notion of collective memory, largely based on Halbwachs's work, differs significantly from earlier articulations of this concept and that these two conceptions are modeled on two different types of personal memory. Finally, it suggests that, given these differences, we should question whether our modern concept of collective memory is a useful tool in analyzing early modern French texts.<br>

Abstract: The trial of Adolf Eichmann, in 1961, is generally considered a turning point in the history of Holocaust memory because it brought the Holocaust into the public sphere for the first time as a discrete event on an international scale. In the same year, Jean Rouch and Edgar Morin's film Chronicle of a Summer appeared in France. While absent from scholarship on memory of the Nazi genocide for over forty years, Chronicle of a Summer contains a scene of Holocaust testimony that suggests the need to look beyond the Eichmann trial for alternative articulations of public Holocaust remembrance. This essay considers the juxtaposition in Chronicle of a Summer of Holocaust memory and the history of decolonization in order to rethink the "unique" place that the Holocaust has come to hold in discourses on extreme violence. The essay argues that a discourse of truth and testimony arose in French resistance to the Algerian war that shaped and was shaped by memory of the Nazi genocide.<br>

Abstract: Cognitive psychologists studying the reading process have developed a detailed conceptual vocabulary for describing the microprocesses of reading. Modified for the purposes of literary criticism, this vocabulary provides a framework that has been missing from most literary-critical investigations of the history of literate practice. Such concepts as the production of a coherent memory representation, the limitations of working memory span, the relation between online and offline reading processes, the landscape model of comprehension, and the presence of standards of coherence allow for close attention to general patterns in reading and to the ways that individual readers modify them. The interpretation of Victorian responses to the poetry of Robert Browning provides a case study in the adaptation of cognitive models to the history of reading. Such an adaptation can reveal not only reading strategies used by historical readers but also those fostered by the discipline of literary criticism.<br>

Abstract: Beckett's "Three Dialogues with Georges Duthuit" poses two distinct difficulties for the reader: the revelation of artistic process or creative energy and the resistance to representation with its implication of objectification. The first may be defined in terms of a three-stage operation resulting in a depiction of sublimation or creative force. Without recourse to psychohistory, one may explore the second in terms of the paradoxical obsession with evocative memory evident throughout Beckett's work. Of this, a disturbance in object representation, understood in the psychoanalytic sense, may be the source.<br>

Abstract: This paper demonstrates how, in a southern Irish setting, differences based on the historic struggles between Protestantism and Catholicism are perpetuated and communicated. It outlines the background and identifies modes of speech indicating unexamined assumptions grounded in the collective memory of the past. It analyses the ways in which the irruption into everyday communication of this emotional legacy reproduce difference, and examines Protestant perceptions that Catholics see them as incapable of possessing an authentic national identity. It shows how the process results in Protestant exclusion from the imagined nation and the category of 'Irishness'.<br>

Abstract: This article returns to research material initially gathered and used for an oral history project. Adopting a sociology of memory perspective, it analyses why and how the former internees at the annex camps of Drancy in Paris only rarely gave accounts of their internment to their families or in public. Following upon the work of Maurice Halbwachs, it studies the role of ties to groups and how they evolve over time in the expression of memories by the individuals concerned.<br>

Abstract: Proceeding from an ethnographical study of Cerro Alegre in Valparaiso (Chile), and in the light of the recent registration of this neighbourhood as a World Heritage Site in virtue of its illustrious xix
         thcentury, the author examines the presence and imprint at the heart of social relations of an underground memory of the Pinochet dictatorship from 1973 to 1990. The paper highlights how becoming a World Heritage Site can trigger and exacerbate conflicts linked to the dictatorship period and which, re-emerging from the social underground to which they had been confined, are played out again on the neighbourhood council.<br>

Abstract: In this article, I look at the ways in which contested memories, imagined communities, and social ressentiment are embraced and filtered by Slovenian and Italian youth as postmemory and transformed into symbolic weapons that exclude, make demands, or simply provoke. Drawing on fieldwork conducted in the Italo—Slovenian border area of Trieste, I analyze two settings in which these symbols are used: a soccer match between Slovenia and Italy played in the summer of 2002 at which a mysterious banner provoked diplomatic tensions and the everyday graffiti war waged on the walls of the city of Trieste.<br>

Abstract: Unification in 1990 intensified the latent preoccupation with memory in Germany. Günter Grass' recent novels testify to the divisive nature of collective remembrance, which is also reflected in the debate surrounding the Berlin Holocaust Memorial. Grass describes a number of derailed monumental endeavors, such as the memorial cemeteries of Unkenrufe, the Fontane statue in Ein weites Feld, and the neo-Nazi Web site of Im Krebsgang. These texts suggest that a memory culture which cultivates monumental representation can be coopted for political purposes. In Grass' literary world, the search for immortality in materiality ultimately eclipses any self-reflective perspective on the past.<br>

Abstract: El surgimiento de una identidad aymara entre la población indígena del norte grande de Chile es un fenómeno reciente, como lo han demostrado algunos investigadores en los últimos años. En este artículo se aborda el vínculo problemático que se establece entre indentidad y memoria como parte de este fenómeno nuevo en el que los sujetos involucrados, principalmente aymaras urbanos, sienten la necesidad de articular una memoria representativa de ese colectivo amplio que es el pueblo aymara, planteándose, al mismo tiempo, el desafío de construirla, o como sus promotores sostienen, de "conocerla" y "descubrirla". El análisis tiene como punto de partida las tensiones que cruzan este proyecto y cómo éstas se reflejan en los documentos producidos por distintas organizaciones aymaras a partir de los años noventa. Nuestro interés se concentra en aquello que los sujetos dicen acerca de la memoria aymara (nivel de metamemoria), los esfuerzos desplegados en su construcción y los recursos utilizados en este intento. The emergence of an Aymara identity among the indigenous population in the northern part of Chile is a recent phenomenon, as some researchers have shown in the last few years. This paper discusses the difficult link between identity and memory as a part of a new phenomenon, where the concerned individuals, mainly urban Aymara, feel the necessity of articulating a memory that would represent this broad collective group, the Aymara people. At the same time, they assume the challenge to build this memory, or, in their own words, to "know" and "discover" it. The analysis focuses on the tensions that exist in this effort and on the way in which these tensions appear in the writings of different ethnic organizations since the nineties. Our interest centers on what the subjects say about Aymara memory (the level of metamemory), as well as on the efforts they put on its construction, and the resources they use.<br>

Abstract: This essay explores the drama of selfhood and the attendant problem of ethics in Brian Friel's Faith Healer. Drawing from the tenets of Freudian psychoanalysis, I scrutinize the protagonist's narrative identity through fissures created by the discrepancy between his story and the other two characters' versions. These crevices register the protagonist's post-traumatic affects for an uncanny home, which, intertwined with his equally uncanny talent to become the place of trauma, compels him to return time and again instead of acknowledging its loss. Symptomatically, in his fixation on an uncanny home in order to disavow its loss, the protagonist sutures his privation, to such an extent that he not only bars memory exchange with other characters, but appropriates them into a master narrative. Given the fact that the three characters' stories are addressed to invisible auditors who converge with the play's actual audience, the healer's final act of authority is limited as long as it is subject to the audience's interpretation of his memory narrative. In its appeal to the audience's decision on ethical justice for the healer's narrative imagination among multiple proposals, this play is an exercise of poetical ethics of memory.<br>

Abstract: Oral traditions can contain elements of historical evidence and convey meaning. The narrative pattern of oral epics serves not merely as "a mnemonic device" that aids in recalling significant historical events but makes meaningful connections to the cultural experience of identity politics. On Cheju Island, a volcanic island located some fifty miles below the southernmost tip of the Korean peninsula, the indigenous sense of identity and history is expressed and accentuated in the fate of the shrine deities who are portrayed as exiles in shamanic epics such as ponhyang ponp'uri. The tragic heroism in the cliché of exile and return of the shrine deities recapitulates the historical identity of Cheju people as "exiles at the frontier." After Cheju Island lost political autonomy as an independent kingdom, Tam-ra, in the early twelfth century, the Cheju people's cultural memory of isolation and redemptive desire for liberation from the mainland state's domination becomes intelligible and justifiable textually through the heroic acts of exiled deities.<br>

Abstract: Over the past few years, the relationship between landscape and the body as two physical entities mutually informed through performance has been increasingly interrogated by cultural geographers. Similar issues about memory, embodiment and performativity have been raised in the social sciences, yet often obliterating the material specificities of place and landscape. This paper reconsiders the relationship between landscape and memory in terms of embodied, visual and spatial practice, rather than as a contested cultural politics of heritage and identity (as it has been generally understood in cultural geography after the so-called 'cultural turn'). Drawing on Nora's 'memory places' and on the Deleuzian notion of 'ontological past', as well as on recent writing on historical geographies of exploration and travel, the paper explores the spatial re-activation of Classical historical memory by nineteenth-century British officers and travellers to Aegean mountain peaks through their embodied and site-located practices of climbing, surveying or simply 'gazing'.<br>

Abstract: In order to give an account of the Congolese tragedy since independence, the inhabitants of Haut-Katanga often resort to four different narratives: the abandonment by Belgium; the biblical curse on Africans; the conspiracy of Western capitalism; or the alienation of life powers by Whites. Though these four stories offer different scenarios, they are all constructed with two types of actors - Whites and Congolese people. This article suggests that this racial/national frame finds its origins in colonial and national ideologies, which have left their mark on Haut-Katanga, and that it continues today to structure the narratives through which people remember their post-colonial history. Collective memory and racial/national identity are reciprocally constituted in these stories, but in different terms. They offer, accordingly, different ways of influencing the present.<br>

Abstract: Great Basin ethnography contains little information concerning rock art, suggesting that much of it is pre-Numic. The presence of historic rock art, however, should permit differences between pre-Numic and Numic populations to be identified. Anthropological theory suggests pioneer groups use ritual to socialize the landscape. Rock art may also be associated with colonizing groups to secure access to new resources. Numic populations seem to have responded to pre-Numic rock art through modification of the art. Once the landscape had been re-socialized rock art was generally avoided. This explains why rock art production became sporadic, and memory of it lost. /// La etnografía de Great Basin contiene poca información del arte rupestre, sugiriendo que mucho del este arte en roca es pre-Numic. La presencia del arte rupestre histórico debe identificar diferencias entre poblaciones pre-Numic y Numic. La teoría antropológica sugiere que grupos pioneros realizaron rituales de socialización en el paisaje. El arte rupestre estaría asociado con la colonización de grupos, para afianzar acceso a nuevos recursos. Las poblaciones Numic parecen haber respondido al arte pre-Numic a través de la modificación del arte. Una vez que el paisaje se había resocializado, el arte rupestre generalmente se evitó. Esto explica porqué la producción del arte rupestre fue esporádica, y su memoria se perdió.<br>

Abstract: Despite the abundance of psychological studies on trauma related ills of descendants of historical trauma, and the extensive scholarly work describing the memory politics of silenced traumatic pasts, there has yet to emerge a critical analysis of the constitutive practices of descendants of historical trauma. This article presents an ethnographic account of a support group for descendants of Holocaust survivors, proposing that the discursive frame of intergenerational transmission of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and support group based narrative practices allow descendants to fashion their sense of self as survivors of the distant traumatic past. The discursive frame of transmitted PTSD acts as both a mnemonic bridge to the past and a mechanism of identity making, as participants narratively reemplot their life stories as having been personally constituted by the distant past. A close ethnographic reading of on-site discursive practices points to how culture ferments to produce narratives, practices and ultimately carriers of memory to both sustain and revitalize historical grand narratives and the cultural scenarios they embed.<br>

Abstract: Memory, persistence, and cultural transmission are hot topics in anthropology today. Contributing to an increasing anthropological interest in youth agency, in this article I invite readers to look at youth as a crucial site for understanding issues of religious memory and cultural transmission. In the past five decades, Bulongic people (Guinea-Conakry) have undergone significant religious changes caused by the introduction of Islam, which has led to the official disappearance of pre-Islamic rituals. In this article, I explore how young Bulongic remember a pre-Islamic past that they have never experienced. I argue that, to understand how they assimilate and perpetuate this religious heritage, one must examine the subtle processes of intergenerational transmission through which their memories are dynamically shaped.<br>

Abstract: Assia Djebar's most recent text, "La femme sans sepulture," returns to the site of colonial history to represent the voice of resistance hero Zoulikha, a haunting figure of the author's own personal history represented only nominally in her corpus until now. Representing Zoulikha's return in Algeria as a spectral revisitation, Djebar's text examines both the potential and the vicissitudes of representing colonial violence and resistance through the spectral domain and thus engages critically with tendencies of postcolonial theory to promote haunting as a mode of historical reinscription. Djebar's text explores how haunting relates to cultural and postcolonial memory through an investigation of the issues surrounding the inscription of Zoulikha's story of resistance and torture within the colonial context, and thereby queries the relation between the haunting memories of colonial violence and contemporary civil warfare in Algeria. This article explores, in particular, how Djebar's work engages critically with the spectral aura that haunts both postcolonial place and theory.<br>

Abstract: This article argues that the depiction of murderous mothers in three early-seventeenth-century texts both contests and expands earlier notions of motherhood and female power by highlighting the effects of maternal memory. The pamphlet (1616) and broadside (1624) I examine both stress the disruptive potential of the forgetting of maternal duty, while the play, John Ford's Love's Sacrifice (1633), represents three mothers who remember their maternal duties through murder. All of these texts showcase a "new" mother construct where memory is the centerpiece, emphasizing the power of this ambiguous figure who can both create and destroy.<br>

Abstract: Memory brings the past into the present. It is a feature of human temporality, contingency, and identity. Attention to memory's psychological and social importance suggests new vistas for work in religious ethics. This essay examines four recent works on memory's importance for self-interpretation, social criticism, and public justice. My focus will be on normative questions about memory. The works under review ask whether, and on what terms, we have an obligation to remember, whether memory is linked to neighbors near and distant, how memory is related to justice and forgiveness, and whether memory sits easily with the kind of relationships that allegedly characterize life in democratic public culture.<br>

Abstract: Closely linked to the increase in psychotropic pill consumption, forgetting and remembering emerged from devastated social scenarios as a new local idiom among poor youth in the late 1990s and the new millennium. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork carried out during the years of the deepest economic crisis in Argentina (2001-03), I argue that psychotropic pill consumption is associated with not only deteriorating economic conditions but also changes in the quality and price of cocaine, and in the scarcity and subsequent change of status of medications during the economic breakdown. Taking into account developments in the field of memory studies, I examine the relationship among political economy, social memory work, and changing drug-use practices. Regarding memory as a social practice, I argue that the growth of psychotropic pill consumption in the late 1990s can be understood through the interplay of Paul Ricoeur's notions regarding different kinds and levels of forgetting. By analyzing changing survival strategies, social network dismantlement, changing mortality patterns, and abusive police repression, I discuss how social fragmentation engendered by structural reforms has modified social memory work.<br>

Abstract: The attempt to write extreme violence, or to reco[r]d[e] traumatic cultural memory - the representation of horror - tests both the representational capacity of language and the rationality of subjecthood. Much narrative endeavour is spent trying to narrativise or 'structure' horror into story. However, because traumatic memories resist the narrative framework of the novel, questions are posed not only about the reliability of the narrator's memory and his/her ability to narrate a credible story, but also about the suitability of the fictional form of the novel to represent historical events such as extreme violence. How does language in narrative, with its insistence on order and sequence, 'capture' the destructuring nature of violence? Where is the subject or the idea of rational subjectivity in these de-structuring acts of violence? I will attempt to address these issues through a critical 'reading' of Moses Isegawa's novels Abyssinian Chronicles (2000) and Snakepit (2004). In these novels, Isegawa recasts and reenacts a period of recent Ugandan history marked by violence and chaos, emanating from the dictatorship of Idi Amin. However, both novels stretch the limits of 'factual' or historical credulity, reminding the reader that they are in fact works of historical fabrication. I am of the view that the narrative endeavour in these two novels is not only to record the chaotic events experienced during the years before and after the fall of Idi Amin, but to recode, through the tropes of language (symbol, imagery, and metaphor), the devastating effects of those years on the literary landscape of Uganda.<br>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to analyze how Brazilian trade unions are using social memory as a tool to build up workers' collective identities, in an attempt to fight the fragmentation resulting from the impact of the industrial restructuring of the 1990s. We will draw upon two ongoing programs conducted by the ABC Metal Workers Union (SMABC) and the Oil Workers Union of Brazil's state oil company Petrobras (Sindipetro). The SMABC and Sindipetro have recently been addressing the issue of workers memory with social and public projects. These projects are building up memories, which in spite of being institution-based are also collective, framed by the unions through the use of new types of communication and electronic media.<br>

Abstract: This paper is the text of an inaugural lecture given as Professor of Modern History in the University of Oxford on 7 November 2008. It arises from a research project entitled Around 1968: Activism, Networks, Trajectories', which involves a team of historians examining samples of activist networks in fourteen European countries, in order to understand ways of becoming an activist, being an activist and making sense of activism. The key terms of this project are transnationalism – tracing resonances and interactions between activists and activist networks across frontiers – and subjectivity – using oral testimony to understand the phenomenon of activism. The framing and presentation of the project incited a rethink of the methods of oral history, not least because the project originated in Oxford, where scepticism persists about the credibility of oral history as a discipline. To persuade this audience of the power of oral history, the approach was taken to locate it at the confluence of three recent developments which have impacted on the study of history as a whole: the linguistic turn, memory studies, and interest in subjectivity, intersubjectivity and the unconscious. These reflections are then used to illuminate evidence drawn from French activists interviewed in the course of 2007 and 2008.<br>

Abstract: The essay discusses the passage from an ideological, patriotic and anti-fascist memory of the deportations and the extermination to what the author describes as the "ethnic" memory of the Shoah, which has played, and continues to play, a central role in constructing the European historical narrative as that narrative depicts the Jews as Europe's "other". Theoretical reflection on memory is intertwined with historical analysis of the period between 1945 until the end of the twentieth century. Two, binary perspectives are featured, one, which examines memory from a cognitive point of view and the other, which examines memory from a cultural, ideological, moral and political perspective. These perspectives come to the fore in memoire-literature, movies, plays, historiographie and philosophical debates, which illustrate the two perspectives and their articulation, as well as they justify the essay's periodization.<br>

Abstract: Since its first publication, A Costa dos Murmúrios has attracted the critics' attention to the paradox of the explicit denial of its own authority over the historical facts that are part of the narration and its implicit, if qualified, affirmation of the same authority. This article also focuses on the sort of subliminal tension but from the angle of the literary construction of emotions, rather than examining either the poetics of historiographic metafiction or the role of memory in the narration of the past. Analyzing various aspects of A Costa dos Murmúrios (such as the predominant points of view, the structure of the narrative, the disintegration of the characters' identities, the emotional impact of a few vivid scences, the personalization of national events), a case is made for reading this novel as an intimate chronicle of historical facts.<br>

Abstract: À partir de discours suscités par la présence d'un cimetière d'esclaves à la Guadeloupe, l'auteur dégage une diversité de registres de mémoire, qui servent à présenter une trame de compréhension de l'univers antillais. L'absence d'un méta-discours communautaire est interprétée en rapport avec une démultiplication des orientations collectives. Discourses induced by the presence of a slave cemetery in Guadeloupe show the diversity of memory levels that enable to understand the Caribbean world. The absence of a community metadiscourse on this cemetery reflects a splitting of the collective memory. Diskurse, die durch die Anwesenheit eines Sklavenkirchhofs in Guadeloupe hervorgerufen wurden, lassen eine Vielfalt von Erinnerungsregistern erscheinen, die ermöglichen, die Antillenwelt zu verstehen. Das Fehlen eines gemeinschaftlichen Metadiskurses über diesen Friedhof drückt eine Zersplitterung der kollektiven Erinnerung aus.<br>

Abstract: La sociabilité méridionale offre l'occasion d'un débat pluri-transdisciplinaire dont l'auteur, à la suite des historiens et des ethnologues, a tenté d'établir une typologie. Il s'agira d'approfondir la dimension politique dont certains cercles de villages font preuve, tant par leur action au sein d'une démocratie participative que par un ensemble de pratiques recourant à la notion de légitimité. Parmi ces mécanismes de contre-pouvoir, le patrimoine politique dont le cercle est le symbole recouvre la notion d'un imaginaire qui trouve à la fois ses sources dans l'histoire locale et dans la mémoire nationale. The southern sociability offers the opportunity of a pluri-transdisciplinary debate of which the author, following historians and ethnologists, tried to establish a typology. The purpose here is to better define the political dimension of some village circles revealed both through their action within a participative democracy and a set of practices appealing to the notion of legitimacy. Among these counterpower mechanisms the political heritage symbolised by the circle covers the notion of imagination rooted both in the local history and the national memory. Die südfranzösische Geselligkeit bietet die Gelegenheit einer inter- und transdisziplinären Debatte. Der Autor hat versucht, deren Typologie zu erstellen, dabei Historikern und Ethnologen folgend. Es handelt sich hier darum, die politische Dimension näher zu bestimmen, die einige Dorfkreise durch ihre Tätigkeit innerhalb einer partizipativen Demokratie sowie durch eine Gesamtheit von Praktiken aufzeigen, die den Begriff der Legitimität in Anspruch nehmen. Unter diesen Gegenkraftsmechanismen umfasst das durch den Kreis symbolisierte politische Erbe den Begriff der Vorstellungswelt, die in der lokalen Geschichte und dem nationalen Gedächtnis gewurzelt ist.<br>

Abstract: Entrepris depuis un quart de siècle, le démantèlement de l'industrie lourde lorraine (mines et sidérurgie) touche à sa fin. À partir de la comparaison entre le dernier événement en date, la fermeture spectaculaire de la dernière mine de charbon, et la mise en scène, une décennie plus tôt, de la dernière coulée d'une usine de la Lorraine sidérurgique, l'auteur s'interroge sur les finalités patrimoniales de telles célébrations. Présentant quelques moments du traitement culturel — patrimonial, mémoriel... — de la crise industrielle lorraine, depuis les symptômes photographiques d'une mémoire empêchée jusqu'au musée très « contrôlé » en passant par la monumentalisation controversée de restes industriels, il met l'accent sur la lutte des représentations qui se noue autour de la construction de la « Lorraine industrielle » en objet-frontière patrimonial. Cet article souhaite ainsi contribuer à une anthropologie politique de l'institution de la mémoire. The dismantling of the heavy industry in Lorraine that is under way since a quarter of century (mines and iron and steel industry) is nearing its end. When comparing the latest event — the spectacular closure of the last coalmine — with the staging of the last casting in an iron and steel factory of Lorraine ten years earlier the author questions about the patrimonial aims of such celebrations. He shows some sequences of the cultural treatment (patrimonial, memorial) of the industrial crisis in Lorraine, from the photographic « symptoms » of a hindered memory to the highly « controlled » museum and to the industrial remains turned into historic buildings, a largely controversial fact. In this context he stresses the conflicting representations of « industrial Lorraine » as a patrimonial Boundary Object (abstract or concrete, that several actors can appropriate as they like). This article is meant to contribute to a political anthropology of memory institution. Die Zerschlagung der lothringischen Schwerindustrie (Bergwerken und Eisen- und Stahlindustrie) geht zu Ende. Der Autor vergleicht das jüngste Ereignis, die spektakuläre Schliessung der letzten Kohlenbergwerks, mit der Inszenierung des letzten Giessens einer lothringischen Eisenhütte zehn Jare früher und fragt sich über die patrimonialen Finalitäten solcher Zelebrationen. Er zeigt einige Zeitpunkte der kulturellen Behandlung der lothringischen industriellen Krise (bezüglich des Erbes und Gedächtnisses), von den photographischen Symptomen eines verhinderten Gedächtnisses über die industriellen Resten, die nun unter dem Denkmalschutz stehen, was sehr umstritten wird, bis hin zu dem höchst « kontrollierten » Museum. In diesem Kontext hebt er die Kämpfe hervor, die um die Repräsentationen der Konstruktion des « industriellen » Lothringens als ein patrimoniales (abstraktes oder konkretes) « Grenzobjekt » entstanden, das sich mehrere Akteure nach Belieben aneignen können. Das Ziel dieser Artikel ist, zu einer politischen Anthropologie der Gedächtnisinstitution einen Beitrag zu leisten.<br>

Abstract: Dédié à l'étude du rôle de l'intelligentsia roumaine dans la mise en œuvre des politiques mémorielles, cet article met en évidence trois fonctions de la mémoire : l'accréditation mémorielle de la reproduction démocratique des élites culturelles du communisme, la mise en cause historique de la mémoire d'une résistance intellectuelle anticommuniste et finalement le rôle de la mémoire du communisme dans la rhétorique identitaire de divers groupes de l'intelligentsia. Studying the responsibility of Romanian intelligentsia in the implementation of memorial politics, this article examines three complementary questions : memorial accreditation of democratic conversion of communist intelligentsia, historical contestation of intellectual resistance against communist regime, and eventually, the role of communist memory in the intelligentsia's contemporary rhetoric of identity. Drei Aufgaben der Erinnerung hebt dieser Artikel, der sich der Rolle der rumänischen Intelligenzija bei der Umsetzung einer Erinnerungspolitik widmet, hervor : die dauerhafte Festschreibung der demokratischen Reproduktion der kulturellen Eliten des Kommunismus ; das Infragestellen der Erinnerung der Intellektuellen im antikommunistischen Widerstand und letztlich die kommunistische Erinnerung, in ihrer sich selbst beschreibenden Rhetorik verschiedener Gruppen der rumänischen Intelligenzija.<br>

Abstract: Au Brésil, le récit officiel concernant la mémoire de l'esclavage différe nettement de la vision des leaders du mouvement noir contemporain, notamment à propos de la situation et des conditions de vie des Afro-Brésiliens à Rio de Janeiro. Ce mouvement demande à l'État et à la société brésilienne de reconnaître les conditions misérables dans lesquelles les esclaves ont été laissés après l'abolition de l'esclavage, mais aussi la contribution des esclaves à la construction de la société, de l'économie et de la culture brésiliennes et enfin le racisme dont les Afro-Brésiliens sont encore l'objet. Aujourd'hui, des décisions juridiques tendent à favoriser une égalité effective, permettant ainsi l'émergence d'une image positive de la culture afro-brésilienne. This article discusses the difference between the official account on the memory of slavery in Brazil and how contemporary black movement's leaders, notably in Rio de Janeiro, see the Afro-Brazilians' situation and living conditions. This movement, which seeks to reveal in public space the memory of slavery and its consequences, claims Brazilian State and society to recognize not only the miserable conditions under which former slaves were left after the abolition of slavery, but the contribution of the slaves to the construction of Brazilian society, economy and culture and also that Afro-Brazilians are still the object of racism. If in today's Brazil, the public debate on reparations comprises a legal aspect of rectification, by creating measures aiming to provide effective equality, this discussion also takes the form of symbolic fight, in which one of the objectives is to build a positive image of the Afro-Brazilian culture. In Brasilien weicht die offizielle Berichterstattung über die Wahrnehmung der Sklaverei vor allem in Bezug auf die Situation und Lebensbedingungen der Afro-Brasilianer in Rio de Janeiro stark ab von der Sichtweise der Führer der zeitgenössischen « Schwarzen-Bewegung ». Die Bürgerbewegung fordert von der brasilianischen Regierung und Gesellschaft die Anerkennung der schlechten Lebensbedingungen unter denen die Menschen seit der Abschaffung der Sklaverei leben. Sie verlangen ebenso die Einbeziehung der ehemaligen Sklaven in den gesellschaftlichen, wirtschaftlichen und kulturellen Prozess sowie die Anerkennung des Rassismus, dem Afro-Brasilianer noch immer zum Opfer fallen. Die derzeitige Rechtsprechung scheint eine tatsächliche Gleichheit zu fördern und trägt so zur Entwicklung eines zunehmend positiven Bildes der afro-brasilianischen Kultur bei.<br>

Abstract: Le combat juif pour la mémoire du génocide et la reconnaissance finalement obtenue sont devenus un modèle et un cadre référentiel pour d'autres populations persécutées. Mais l'ampleur de cette effervescence mémorielle suscite à son tour des réactions critiques. Quant au modèle, il est parfois contesté de façon virulente par la dérive minoritaire d'une compétition victimaire. Après avoir rappelé le processus à travers lequel ce phénomène mémoriel s'est progressivement imposé, on analysera son rôle référentiel, les critiques qu'il soulève et les controverses dont il fait l'objet. The Jewish fight for the genocide's memory and the recognition it eventually reached have become a model and a referential frame for other persecuted people. Yet in return some react critically to this rising memorial effervescence. As victims compete and minorities conflict, the Shoah model is in itself more and more contested. This article retraces how this memorial phenomenon has progressively settled and analyses its referential, yet controversial, role. Der jüdische Kampf um eine kollektive Erinnerung an die Vernichtung und ihre letztliche Anerkennung sind im Laufe der Zeit zu einer Art Modell und zu einem Bezugsrahmen für andere verfolgte Bevölkerungsgruppen geworden. Jedoch erzeugt die Omnipräsenz der Erinnerungen vielfach auch Kritik. Das Erinnerungsmodell wird von Seiten bestimmter Minderheitenströmungen innerhalb des herrschenden « Opferwettbewerbs » oftmals heftig angegriffen. Zunächst analysiert dieser Artikel den Prozess der Durchsetzung des Phänomens des Sich-Erinnerns, im Anschluss daran wird seine Referenzwirkung diskutiert sowie die Kritik und die Debatte die es hervorruft.<br>

Abstract: Partant du constat que les faits sociaux de mémoire sont portés par des actes de communication, il s'agit ici de dégager les pratiques qui alimentent les formes de « l'agir » socio-mémoriel, aujourd'hui présent en France et ailleurs. Quels processus sont a l'œuvre dans des situations post-génocidaires, souvent aussi post-migratoires, comme dans la Shoah (« Khurbn » en yiddish) par exemple ? Dans le cas d'Ashkénazes, il s'agit d'une reinscription qualitative au sein des cartographies de la parenté, mais aussi d'une reconnexion avec des périodes antérieures au genocide et à l'ethnocide à travers des événements culturels. Since the work of memory cannot exist without inter-subjective exchanges, this paper introduces in the study of memory the concept of « social acting » created by Weber. Attempting to point out the plurality of the practices that feed the various forms of socio-memorial movements present today in France and elsewhere. Which are the processes taking on a very particular aspect in post-genocidal as in post-migratory situations such as after the Shoah (Khurbn in Yiddish) ? In the case of the Ashkenase, these processes are also post-ethnocide and consist in a qualitative re-inscription within genealogical mapping and simultaneously in the long development of a history in which the genocide constitutes a memorial screen as well as actions of re-inscribing and re-connecting with cultural markers associated to periods antedating the genocide and ethnocide. Da Erinnerungsarbeit nicht ohne das Betrachten von zwischenmenschlichem Austausch und sozialer Praxis erfolgen kann, soll im Rahmen dieses Artikels das Webersche Konzept des « Sozialen Handelns » in die Untersuchung von Erinnerungen einbezogen werden. Ausgehend von der Tatsache, dass soziale Erinnerungen durch Kommunikation ausgedrückt werden, möchte dieser Artikel die Vielfalt der Praktiken zeigen, die heute in Frankreich und anderswo die Vielzahl der gesellschaftlichen Erinnerungsbewegungen prägen. Die Erinnerungsprozesse verdeutlichen vor allem die soziale und zeitliche Beziehung zum Anderen. Besonders interessant zu analysieren ist sind Post-Shoah-(Khurbn auf Jiddisch) und Post-Auswanderungs-Erinnerungenen. In diesem Artikel richtet sich das Augenmerk vor allem auf Ashkenasische Juden aus Deutschland, Zentral-und Osteuropa, deren Situation nach dem Ethnozid betrachtet wird. Dabei ist eine qualitative Wiederaufnahme der Lebenspraxis der Elterngeneration zu beobachten ; ebenso wie ein Anknüpfen im Rahmen bestimmter kultureller Riten an die Zeit vor dem Völkermord.<br>

Abstract: The social production of the space appears like creation when elements are demonstrated that originate social relations and that are transformed as well by these relations. The purpose of the present text is to make a series of observations on some of the theoretical dimensions that approach the phenomenon of the territory and the memory through it temporary space in a vision that leaves from the geographic thing for the interdisciplinary thing. La producción social del espacio se presenta como creación cuando se evidencian elementos que originan relaciones sociales y que a su vez son transformados por estas relaciones. La finalidad del presente texto es hacer una serie de observaciones sobre algunas de las dimensiones teóricas que se acercan al fenómeno del territorio y la memoria a través de lo espacio temporal en una visión que parte de lo geográfico a lo interdisciplinar.<br>

Abstract: This paper looks at how "official" memories are produced in state-sponsored public spaces and how a multi-ethnic, multicultural north-east India responded to it. Official memory sites like museums, monuments and memorials not only reflected but also shaped ethnic relations to a great extent. The emerging states in the region have assiduously favoured the historical imagination of a politically dominant community, which is masculine, and remains persistently insensitive to the marginal "others" in the state. This, on the one hand, encouraged the dominant community to assimilate and thereby produced ethnonationalism around that notion of shared pasts. On the other, it generated a sense of neglect in the minorities who responded with vernacular memorials to embody their historical imagination and likewise developed their own ethnic nationalism around it. This parallel rise to prominence of often competing ethnonationalisms within the region, or sometime within the state, has thereby produced violent forms of contestation often dangerously imbued with fissiparous tendencies.<br>

Abstract: Le rapport qu'entretiennent histoire et mémoire à l'école est complexe et ambigu. Jusqu'aux années quatrevingt-dix, il a surtout été posé comme la relation, légitimée ou dénoncée, entre savoirs historiques, histoire scolaire et mémoire nationale. Dès les années soixante, le débat prend en compte le rapport entre le récit national et des histoires régionalistes qui revendiquent une place dans la culture scolaire, au nom des identités et du droit au passé. Cette dernière acception prévaut largement à l'heure actuelle mais cette fois au nom des minorités dépossédées de leur histoire, dès lors qu'elle n'a pas d'expression publique. Dans ces débats, la mémoire serait la forme d'une histoire parallèle, occultée et clandestine ; de leur côté les historiens tendent à distinguer histoire et mémoire. L'histoire scolaire, elle, admet l'histoire mais non les mémoires comme savoir de référence légitime ; pourtant les commémorations et le « devoir de mémoire » s'y invitent de plus en plus fréquemment. De telles évolutions interrogent les composantes de la discipline scolaire : au premier chef les finalités et les contenus mais aussi les pratiques, inégalement connues dans ce domaine et, finalement, les apprentissages souvent plus espérés qu'avérés. The connection that exists at school between history and memory is complicated and ambiguous; it is source of debate and demands which recently intensified with public and political uses. School history accepts history but not memories as good legitimate reference. And yet commemoration ceremonies and the "duty to remember" are more and more in the schools. Such changes question the elements of that school subject: its purpose of building identity and citizenship, its contents and their changes, its teaching practices, not really evenly known in this field, and finally the learning that is more often wished for than actually delivered. La relación que mantienen historia y memoria en la Escuela es compleja y ambigua; alimenta debates y reivindicaciones que recientemente han sido avivados por los usos públicos y políticos de la historia y de la memoria. La historia escolar admite la historia pero no las memorias como saber de referencia legítimo; sin embargo las conmemoraciones y el "deber de memoria" se invitan cada vez más frecuentemente. Tales evoluciones interrogan los componentes de la asignatura escolar: las finalidades identitarias y cívicas, los contenidos y sus renovaciones, las prácticas, desigualmente conocidas en este campo, y finalmente los aprendizajes a menudo más esperados que comprobados. Das Verhältnis zwischen Geschichte und Gedächtnis in der Schule ist komplex und mehrdeutig. Es gibt den Anlass zu Debatten und Forderungen, die die öffentlichen und politischen Anwendungen des Gedächtnisses und der Geschichte neulich haben aufleben Tassen. Die Schulgeschichte duldet die Geschichte aber nicht die Erinnerungen als Maßstab gebendes Wissen, während Gedenkfeier und "Erinnerungsgebot'' (Aufarbeitung der Vergangenheit) immer öfter daran teilhaben. Eine solche Entwicklung stellt die Komponenten des Schulfachs Geschichte in Frage: über seine Zwecke, was die Identitätsfrage und den Bürgersinn betrifft, über den Inhalt und seine Veränderungen, über Praktiken, die in diesem Gebiet oft ungenügend bekannt sind, und schließlich über das tatsächliche Erlernen, das oft eher erhofft als erwiesen ist.<br>

Abstract: Cette note de synthèse souligne la spécificité de la discipline enseignée. L'histoire scolaire occupe une position originale dans le champ des didactiques par la complexité de ses références (production savante, auto-référence scolaire et usages publics de l'histoire). Tendus entre une transmission de connaissances consensuelles et la recherche d'une posture critique, les objets d'histoire enseignés demeurent soumis à des questionnements renouvelés au gré de la demande sociale comme le montrent les récents débats autour des questions mémorielles vives et concurrentes. L'histoire enseignée apparaît ainsi comme un mixte articulant représentations sociales, savoirs privés et connaissances validées. Depuis une quinzaine d'années, des travaux ont permis de mieux cerner le « penser en histoire » et les processus cognitifs spécifiques en jeu dans la classe (temps historique, conceptualisation, problématisation, construction de schemes explicatifs). Des recherches contextualisées ont permis d'explorer les pratiques professionnelles effectives et d'en modéliser le fonctionnement « normal » : une discipline qui privilégie la transmission de savoirs disant la réalité du passé et attachée à la neutralité du texte enseigné ; une discipline qui peine à mettre en cohérence des finalités intellectuelles ambitieuses (outiller le citoyen actif dans la cité de demain) et des activités dans la classe souvent cantonnées à la mémorisation, au repérage et à la catégorisation. Aussi voit-on se dessiner dans les travaux actuels, une problématique centrée sur les écarts entre les intentions et les pratiques. En articulant la notion de soumission aux règles du « contrat didactique » avec les autres modèles théoriques des sciences humaines et sociales mobilisés au sein des équipes de recherche, les travaux menés de manière encore trop dispersée, laissent apparaître des acquis importants qui pourraient être pris en compte dans la formation des enseignants This paper underlines the specificity of the subject taught. School history holds a special position in didactics due to the complexity of its references (scholarly production, self referencing and public use of history). Set in between passing consensual knowledge on and seeking a critical position, school history objects are still under new questioning that changes with social demands as recent debates on actual competing questions related to memory show it. Therefore school history seems to be a blend of social representations, private knowledge and proven knowledge. For fifteen years, works have enabled us to better define "historical thinking" and the specific cognitive processes that are involved in class (historical time, conceptualization, problematization, construction of explanatory schemes). Conceptualized research have allowed to explore real professional practices and model their "normal" functioning: a subject that favours passing on knowledge telling the truth about the past and being attached to using neutral documents; a subject that has difficulty to coherently link ambitious intellectual purposes (preparing active citizens for tomorrow's world) to class activities often limited to memorizing, recognizing and sorting. That is why we can see a problematic develop which is centered on the difference between intentions and practices. Connecting the notion of adherence to the rules of the "didactical contract" to the other theoretical models of human sciences developed within the research team., the work -done in a still too unfocused way -reveals some important acquired knowledge which could be taken into account in teacher training programmes. Esta nota subraya la especificidad de la disciplina enseñada. La historia escolar ocupa una posición original en el campo de las didácticas por la complejidad de sus referencias (producción sabia, autorreferencia escolar y usos públicos de la historia). Divididos entre una transmisión de conocimientos consensúales y la búsqueda de una postura crítica, los objetos de historia enseñados permanecen sometidos a interrogaciones repetidas a merced de la petición social como lo muestran los debates recientes en torno a las cuestiones relativas a las memorias vivas y competidoras. La historia enseñada aparece así como una mezcla que articula representaciones sociales, saberes privados y conocimientos validados. Desde hace unos quince años, ciertos trabajos permitieron delimitar mejor el "pensar en historia" y los procesos cognoscitivos específicos en juego en la clase (tiempo histórico, conceptualización, problematización, construcción de esquemas explicativos). Investigaciones contextualizadas han permitido explorar las prácticas profesionales efectivas y modelizar su funcionamiento "normal": una disciplina que privilegia la transmisión de saberes que dicen la realidad del pasado y apegada a la neutralidad del texto enseñado; una disciplina a la que le cuesta poner en coherencia finalidades intelectuales ambiciosas (preparar al ciudadano activo en la ciudad de mañana) y actividades en la clase a menudo limitadas a la memorización, la localización y la categorización. Por eso se ve dibujarse en los trabajos actuales, una problemática centrada en las diferencias entre las intenciones y las prácticas. Articulando la noción de sumisión a las reglas del "contrato didáctico" con los otros modelos teóricos de las SHS movilizadas en el seno de los equipos de investigación, los trabajos llevados de manera todavía demasiado dispersada dejan aparecer experiencias ¡mportantes que podrían tomarse en consideración en la formación de los docentes. Dieser Bericht unterstreicht die Besonderheit des Schulfachs Geschichte. Geschichte in der Schule hat eine originale Stellung im Feld der Didaktik wegen der Komplexität ihrer Referenzen (wissenschaftliche Schriften, Referenz für sich selbst in der Schule und öffentliche Benutzung der Geschichte). Zwischen der Verbreitung konsesueller Kenntnisse und der Suche nach einer kritischen Haltung hin-und hergerissen, sind die Lehrinhalte in Geschichte nach wie vor je nach sozialer Anfrage einer ständigen Fragestellung ausgesetzt, wie neulich die Debatten um lebhafte und entgegengesetzte Gedächtnisfragen. Die Geschichte als Schulfach erscheint also als eine Mischung zwischen sozialen Vorstellungen, privatem Wissen und bewährten Kenntnissen. Seit etwa 15 Jahren haben einige Arbeiten es ermöglicht, das „Denken in Geschichte” und die kognitiven Prozesse besser einzuschätzen, die in der Schule auf dem Spiel stehen (historische Zeit, Konzeptualisierung, Problematisierung, Bildung erklärender Schemata). Kontextualisierte Forschungsarbeiten haben es erlaubt, die tatsächlichen Berufspraktiken zu erforschen und „normalen” Betrieb zu modellieren: ein Schulfach, das die Übertragung von Kenntnissen, die die Realität der Vergangenheit beschreibt und großen Wert auf die Neutralität des unterrichteten Textes legt; ein Fach, das sich Mühe gibt, ehrgeizige intellektuelle Zwecke (den aktiven Bürger in der Stadt von morgen mit Werkzeugen bewaffnen) mit Aktivitäten in der Klasse in Kohärenz zu bringen, die sich oft auf Memorisierung, Markierung und Kategorisierung begrenzen. Auf diese Weise kann man in den heutigen Arbeiten beobachten, wie eine Problematik auftaucht, im Mittelpunkt derer die Diskrepanz zwischen Absichten und Praktiken steht. In dem man den Begriff der Unterwerfung zu den Regeln des „didaktischen Vertrags” mit den anderen theoretischen Modellen (in den Sozial-und Geschichtswissenschaften) kombiniert, die in den Forschungsteams benutzt werden, lassen die bisher auf noch zu verstreute Weise geführten Arbeiten wichtige Erwerbungen erkennen, die in der Lehrerausbildung berücksichtigt werden könnten.<br>

Abstract: The article asserts that a search for truth ought to be carrying out in such a way as to preserve or enhance solidarity. It demonstrates the necessity and the difficulties of making atrocious and traumatic historical events legally accountable. The necessity and difficulties have been recently fuelled by the trends towards the openness of modern identity and the growing importance of human rights, both of them demanding settling conflicts in the context of the multiplication of particularistic memories, yet without undermining social solidarity constructed on liberal foundations. The article argue that because of the hybrid nature of the task, unresolved tensions between memory and history, the erosion of the state's ability to impose unitary and unifying framework of memory, there is no simple and quick solution to tensions between memory, solidarity, and therefore to manage these strains we need to rely a plurality of contending narratives and civility of rules.<br>

Abstract: This article examines social memories in France over the last 10 years. There has been a significant amount of 'memory work' during this period, concerning various aspects of French history, including the World Wars, but predominantly postcolonial issues: the Algerian War, the legacy of slavery, memories of Empire and memories of Immigration in particular. The 'devoir de mémoire' (duty to remember) and 'work of memory' (Paul Ricœur) have taken on greater, and controversial, proportions. While President Jacques Chirac was for some the 'président du devoir de mémoire' (President who championed the duty to remember), President Nicolas Sarkozy seems intent on ending what he sees as the trend towards 'repentance'. After a discussion of the wider memory culture in France, this article focuses on collective and social memories of the Franco-Algerian War (1954-62) Through an analysis of various 'vectors of memory' (Henry Rousso) it argues that the recent upsurge in 'memory work' in France is very much anchored in the present postcolonial social context in France. That memory work is however largely symbolic and in some ways unsatisfactory. It shows that much of the recent work of memory has been only belatedly and partially undertaken by the State, and with civil society in some ways yet to follow.<br>

Abstract: This article seeks to address how Lebanese youth are dealing with the legacy of civil war (1975-90), given the national backdrop of official silence, persisting injustice, and competing memory discourses. Drawing on Marianne Hirsch's concept of postmemory, it explores the memory of a generation of Lebanese who have grown up dominated not by traumatic events but by narrative accounts of events that preceded their birth. This residual form of memory carries and connects with the pain of others, suffusing temporal frames and liminal positions. The article examines how postmemory is mediated and transformed through the mnemonic lenses of visual landscapes and oral narratives. Consideration is given to the dynamic production of "memoryscapes"—memories of violence localized in particular sites—and to narrative constructions of the past implicated in the ongoing search for meaning, historical truth, and identity. This article seeks to challenge pervasive notions of Lebanese postwar amnesia and of a generational detachment from the residual effects and future implications of war recollections.<br>

Abstract: As oral historians, we devote a great deal of time to painstakingly designing our projects, cognizant of the fact that our research requires us to interact with human beings in often intimate ways. For this same reason, though, our careful methodology and meticulously designed projects are constantly being tested. This article is a reflection on some of the ethical and methodological challenges that the authors faced during their life story interviews with Holocaust survivors in Montreal, Canada. In particular, it explores three major themes: the elaborate process of learning to "share authority" and build trust with interviewees; the limitations of "deep listening" and their implications; and the struggle to deal with contentious politics, such as perceived racism, that emerged out of some interviews. Reflection on these methodological and ethical challenges not only opens up a wider and important discussion among researchers about how practice relates to theory but also teaches us about our interviewees. For example, what does an interviewee's refusal to engage deeply about his or her past tell us about how they formed their identity in the aftermath of mass violence? Challenges, such as this one, are part of the story. They shed light on questions of narrative formation, the identity politics that result from survival, and how individual memory interacts with dominant narratives about atrocity. They force us to recognize that both our interviewees—and ourselves—are human beings, and not just collections of stories.<br>

Abstract: When conceived as the presence of the past, memory can be said to pervade the music of Maurice Ravel. The number and range of these acts of musical memory -including illeces modelled on the medieval ballade, the Renaissance chanson, the Baroque tombeau, the Classical sonatine and the Romantic poème, among others -seem at first glance to testify to a uncomplicated relation between past and present which, upon closer review, is revealed to be problematic. One of the most complex and captivating artistic testaments to what Andreas Huyssen has called 'twilight memory' -not only in Ravel's music, but in Western modernism as a whole - is the eighth and final waltz of his illano suite Valses nobles et sentimentales (1911). In this waltz, which Ravel entitled 'Éilllogue', the hope of making the past present is reborn with each of its numerous thematic recollections, only to be dashed repeatedly by the melancholy knowledge of its impossibility. In the present study, affinities between the Éilllogue's musical behaviours and philosophical accounts of memory by Bergson, Jankélévitch and Nora are explored, along with the compositional precedents established by Beethoven, Schumann, Debussy and others.<br>

Abstract: In this paper, we attempt to show the fruitfulness of the theory of communicative action for memory studies. Specifically, we intend to demonstrate that concepts characteristic of the discipline, such as "history," "memory," and "dialogue," reflect three types of universal validity claims: "memory" formulates claims to authenticity, "history" formulates claims to truth, and "dialogue" formulates claims to Tightness. Thus, it is possible to introduce a seminal Habermasian notion of rationality that rests on validity claims. This notion can serve to integrate, enrich, and identify blind spots in memory studies. Our purpose is to demonstrate the relevance of collective memory to social cohesion (cultural reproduction, social integration, and socialization) and the public sphere (its development and atrophy, rationalization, and colonization).<br>

Abstract: This article inquires into the social memory of Ferdinand Marcos and of his dictatorship in the literature written in the Language of his home region, the Ilocos, in the period since his downfall in the 1986 People Power Revolution. The novels Saksi ti Kaunggan (1986-1987) by Juan S. P. Hidalgo Jr. and Dagiti Bin-i ti Kimat (1995) by Clesencio B. Rambaud are used as indicators of changing narrative social memories of Marcos in llokano literature. Hidalgo's novel exemplifies the llokano writers' "loyalist" memory of Marcos, whereas Rambaud's novel indexes attempts to reassess Marcos and the legacies of his dictatorship. This article seeks to contribute to the literature on the social memory of Marcos's military regime; looks into the braiding of literature, memory, and the nation; and examines the constitution of memory in gender.<br>

Abstract: This article discusses the options that narrative and language have in their attempts to capture or describe traumatic experience and death. It concentrates on two prose texts by Karel Čapek, Obyčejný život and Povětroň, and the first phase of Freudian psychoanalysis, pointing at generally distinguishable limits and distortions that arise when narrative and language come in contact with trauma and death. Contrary to the current trend within „trauma studies“ , the article does not deal with autobiographical records of traumatic experience. It rather tries to point out that thinking consistently about the connection between memory, language and trauma tends to blur and question the traditional distinction between fiction (understood as a work of imagination) and autobiography (taken as a description of real events). It also tries to show that psychoanalysis arrives, explicitly and implicitly, at a similar conclusion. The last part of the article poses the question what the resulting relationship between the outside (narrated, written Story) and the „inner“ experience is like, and to what extent the structure of this dyad can also be questioned.<br>

Abstract: The article advances an interpretation of the self as an imaginary object. Focusing on the relationship between selfhood and memory in Sartre's The Transcendence of the Ego, I argue that Sartre offers useful resources for thinking about the self in terms of narratives. Against interpretations that hold that the ego misrepresents consciousness or distorts it, I argue that the constitution of the ego marks a radical transformation of the conscious field. To prove this point, I turn to the role of reflection and memory in the creation of the self. Reflection and memory weave past, present and future into a consistent and meaningful life story. This story is no other than the self. I propose to understand the self as a fictional or imaginary entity, albeit one that has real presence in human life.<br>

Abstract: In societies coming to terms with historical injustices, public apology has recently emerged as a potent trend. This is particularly true of France, where the state served as a catalyst for a wave of public apologies for acts of intolerance committed during the Second World War. Following Jacques Chirac's 1995 official apology for Vichy's anti-Semitic policies, various groups in civil society publicly atoned for their particular Vichy roles in discrimination against Jews: the medical profession, the law bar, the Catholic Church, and the police. How does public apology, as distinct from court trials, historical commissions, and reparations, affect contemporary France's reconciliation with its past? This article also analyzes how apologizing for Vichy has created demand for an official French apology for the Algerian War. By 2006, the politics of memory in French society decidedly shifted attention from Vichy to post-colonialism: in both cases, the apology turn imposes new dynamics of remembering and forgetting.<br>

Abstract: In July 2004, a young woman claimed that she had been attacked on the Paris urban railway system by four Maghrebins and two Africans and that the discovery that she might be Jewish had intensified the character of the attack. For a number of days, the French media were dominated by the case and leading politicians condemned it. The events drew attention to a number of issues concerning culture and identity in contemporary France and the role played in constituting this identity of history and memory. However, it also displayed how the constitution of identity is a selective process in which different elements may be dealt with, either in different ways or omitted altogether. This article explores how in attempting to come to terms with the legacies of anti-Semitism, other areas of history and memory have been neglected, including the legacy of France's colonial empire, and, in particular, her relationship with Algeria.<br>

Abstract: In a first section, the renewed interest in historical consciousness among social scientists and historians is discussed, which resulted in a clearer understanding of how historical memory functions and of the diverse ways in which historians use references to the past. Against this background, Paul's use of history in the letter to the Galatians is analysed in a second section. The apostle is not interested in recording the past, but develops, in the light of his own experiences in preaching the gospel among gentiles, an alternative perspective on Israel's past. By taking the figure of Abraham as his point of departure, he argues for a more inclusive understanding of Israel's history, which enables him to provide a theological justification for the equal status of gentile believers in the community of faith.<br>

Abstract: Recent research on collective memory suggests that commemorations of difficult pasts take either a multivocal or a fragmented form. I suggest these forms exist as ideal types for the initial commemoration, but the commemorative field, as a whole, remains dynamic over time, effectively shifting between forms. This study traces the creation, maintenance, and transformation of collective memory of the May 4, 1970 shootings at Kent State from 1970 to 2013 using archival sources, media accounts, and participant observation. In examining the commemorative field at Kent, I theorize the existence of a third commemorative form—the integrated commemorative field, which allows for the expression of divergent narratives and the maintenance of separate commemorative spaces while simultaneously enhancing social solidarity through shared meta-narratives that stress overarching values, like human rights or scientific inquiry.<br>

Abstract: The persecution, flight and murder of European Jews in the first half of the twentieth century and the profound social and political transformations that decisively affected European cities in the final decade of the 20th century have radically altered urban 'Jewish landscapes'. New stakeholders and institutions emerged with their own networks, goals and interests, and have constructed, staged and marketed 'Jewish culture' anew. The resultant Jewish spaces are being constituted in an urban space located at the intersection of ethnic representation, collective memory, and drawing on an imagined material culture, which includes architectural, physical and digital spaces (e.g. synagogues, Jewish quarters). This Europe-wide process is closely related to the delicate politics of memory and to discourses on the authenticity of cities. This article analyses how the image of 'Jewishness' plays an increasingly important role in the marketing of historical authenticity that cities and their tourism affiliates are undertaking.<br>

Abstract: The article examines the phenomenon of communist/post-socialist nostalgia, with a focus on Slovenia and Poland, through the central issue of identity, memory and the concrete manifestations of nostalgia. The emergence of a somewhat distinct 'Eastern European' identity and the East--West divide in historical and cultural terms is explored throught several historical events of the European project between the World Wars. The revival of the communist brands, commercial products, symbols, music and film is the core of the communist 'renaissance', witnessing mainly the need for encountering the past, the selevtiveness of memory and the right and emotional need to value one's own personal history and past.<br>

Abstract: Until about 2005, it was hard to find any publication about literature during the communist era or any important work concerning this period. Since then, this astonishing silence has given way to the publication in Bulgaria of several novels and hybrid writings. In the meantime occured not only literary, but also political and social events which changed the issue: isn't the real problem in Bulgaria today no longer the institutional, generational, historiographical or literary silence, but the dilemna between the collective or individual responsability? To cope with these problems, the author takes into account both the works of Paul Ricoeur concerning the excess of memory and the excess of oblivion, the blocked memory, manipulated memory, abusively controlled or obligated memory, and two emblematic books concerning the communist past as seen in the State Security files: The Watched Man by Vesko Branev, and Surveillance and Conditioning: the literary prose of the State security by Žerminal Čivikov.

Date: 10 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): Corner James<br>
Abstract: This essay is about the crisis of creativity and meaning in contemporary Western culture and how the use of modern landscape and architectural theory works to perpetuate an excessively "hard" or neutral world—a world in which culture can no longer figure or recollect itself. A brief critique of three predominant approaches toward contemporary theory is presented: positivism, the use of paradigms, and the Avant-Garde. In different ways, each approach derives from modern techno-scientific thinking and invariably seeks closure, certainty, and control. The built landscapes that result often suffer from an equally closed explicitude: a stifling immanence where all is exposed and nothing is left to imagination. The essay suggests an alternative strategy grounded in the tradition of hermeneutics. Here, theory is something ever-open, permitting a free association of ideas through the mechanics of situational interpretation and metaphor. Hermeneutics provides the basis for a landscape architectural theory that transcends pictorial image and historical style by critically engaging contemporary circumstance and tradition. The landscape itself is a hermeneutic medium and becomes the ground for such an endeavor, enabling the remembrance, renewal, and transformation of a cultural tradition. The author argues that a hermeneutic approach to the theory and practice of landscape architecture is a way of returning to our designed landscapes the powers of the everyday and the revelatory—the grounds of memory and hope.<br>

Abstract: In sixteenth-century France, the triumphal entry was closely tied to the notion of collective memory. This article defines the concept of collective memory as it is articulated in sixteenth-century texts, retraces the history of the relationship between this notion and the triumphal entry, and, in analyzing several texts tied to entry ceremonies, explores how such texts address triumphal entries' role in the production of collective memory—as opposed to its preservation, which is the typical focus in discussions of the relationship between collective memory and historiographical or poetic works during this period.<br>

Abstract: This essay explores a phenomenon familiar to archivists: the seamless moment of time and space within the remembering process when communities become aware of and must confront the fragility of public memory and make decisions about the management and preservation of their information resources. This decision point has recently been called the documentary moment. The authors' exploration of this concept focuses on the theories, strategies, methodologies, and processes formerly employed and now emerging at Library and Archives Canada (LAC) to facilitate the disposition of government's information resources. They also examine the challenges presented by the digital age on the documentary moment and whether corresponding philosophical or methodological changes to current institutional strategies, including macro-appraisal, are required.<br>

Abstract: The 1990s and 2000s saw a memory and remembrance boom at both the national and supra-/transnational level. Crucially, many of these emerging memory frames were not simply about a glorious and heroic past, as in, for example, traditional nationalist narratives. Rather, groups started to narrate their symbolic boundaries in a more inclusive way by admitting past wrongdoings. In this article, we look at a corpus of so-called 'speculative speeches' by leading politicians in the European Union and, against the aforementioned historical background, analyse their representations of Europe's past, present and future. By utilising the discourse-historical approach in critical discourse analysis, narrative theory and elements of Reinhart Koselleck's conceptual history (Begriffsgeschichte), we illustrate how, first, a 'new Europe', based on admitting failure, is narrated. However, second, we also show that such a self-critical narration of a 'bitter past' is, paradoxically, transformed into a self-righteous attitude towards Europe's 'others'.<br>

Abstract: The paper argues that the development of recording data over the following five thousand years can be regarded as chapters in a basically continuous narrative. This continuity explains why Plato s reflections on the oral and the written, and Aristotle's remarks on memory and reminiscence, are still relevant in our globalised world. In the conclusion, the paper comments on Paul Ricoeur s attempt to bridge the gap between memory, history, and forgetting, as well as on its controversial political implications.<br>

Abstract: This essay analyzes the relationship between text and image in La destructión delreino by Miguel Gutiérrez, with photographs by Julio Olavarria. The essay argues that the authors perform a critical type of memory work that allows their art, here photography and narration, to become a method for mourning and moving beyond the impasse produced by the guilt and the sense of loss experienced by the social subject in times of trauma.<br>

Abstract: Can a historical event, such as Partition, be understood as an action that "resulted" from complex, wide forces of history or also as an event continually brought into being by the play of subject memories? A relationship of complementarity exists between the problems internal to history and the demands and desires of memory, so much so that together they form integral parts of a single operation, the historiographical operation. Yet memory sometimes appears the obverse of history making. Human action, as this article remonstrates, sometimes overcomes the bounds of passivity imposed by memory and this is also what determines history.<br>

Abstract: To discuss the practice of memory and its relations to politics, social scientists rely on three kinds of practices - memorialising, memorising and the act of remembering/forgetting. The commemoration of "1857" is unique in that official celebrations of the event have been instituted even as 1857 continues to refigure in myths and endures as a symbol of popular resistance. The articles in this special issue address the seeming contradictions and complexities that "remembering" 1857 involves, and the tension that prevails between different kinds of recall.<br>

Abstract: Drawing on the theoretical insights of Paul Ricoeur this paper investigates the geographies of public remembrance in a post-conflict society. In Northern Ireland, where political divisions have found expression through acts of extreme violence over the past 30 years, questions of memory and an amnesty for forgetting have particular resonance both at the individual and societal level, and render Ricoeur's framework particularly prescient. Since the signing of the Belfast Agreement in 1998, initiating the Peace Process through consociational structures, discovering a nomenclature and set of practices which would aid in the rapprochement of a deeply divided society has presented a complex array of issues. In this paper I examine the various practices of public remembrance of the 1998 bombing of Omagh as a means of understanding how memory-spaces evolve in a post-conflict context. In Omagh there were a variety of commemorative practices instituted and each, in turn, adopted a different contour towards achieving reconciliation with the violence and grief of the bombing. In particular the Garden of Light project is analysed as a collective monument which, with light as its metaphysical centre, invited the populace to reflect backward on the pain of the bombing while at the same time enabling the society to look forward toward a peaceful future where a politics of hope might eclipse a politics of despair.<br>

Abstract: The Hebrew Bible depicts interpretation as a continual process of losing and finding, of forgetting and remembering. Texts are lost and found, and in the Joseph story (Gen. 37-50), Joseph himself is abandoned and recovered, with all memory of him repressed until it is dramatically recalled. His story demonstrates that repression is the condition of interpretation, and that interpretation-not resurrection-holds forth the promise of a future life. Nonetheless, the repeated losses that punctuate the Joseph narrative have inspired the opposite conclusion: that Joseph is a type of Jesus, that his descents and ascents prefigure the final one. Typology, a mode of biblical interpretation that prevailed during the early church, has enjoyed a recent revival in the context of literary studies; but I argue that the typological language of "fulfillment," of shadows and truth, is alien to Hebraic-and postmodern-understandings of textuality.<br>

Abstract: The conflict between formalist thinking and theories that view texts in their historical contexts serves as a starting point for the introduction of a cognitive view of literature. From this perspective language has full referential powers. The "referent" splits into two entities, however: things-in-themselves (in their material identity), which we cannot know, and things in their coded form, which are perceptually accessible. Readers' mnemonic potentials, a consequence of the bonding of perception and language, are adduced to show that texts originate in past interpretations of other texts and in personal experience and that consequently social forces and historical events are subsumed in the individual memory. In the cognitive light, memory becomes the ultimate metaphor, and the epistemological claim of realism regains its compelling force.<br>

Abstract: Historiography in Francoist Spain (1939-75) sought to affirm the morally and historically correct role of the regime within the flow of Spanish history. As an important vehicle of dissidence, the novel of memory stands in sharp contrast to Francoist history: it explores the past largely eschewed or appropriated by the regime and contests the so-called truths that Franco shaped through the discourse of myth. This essay examines the role of subjective memory as a challenge to historiography and discloses the narrative strategies novelists used to counter the government's myths. Unlike Francoist historiography, the novel of memory lays out history as a series of disruptions and undermines the referential illusion of truth and wholeness in our understanding of the past.<br>

Abstract: Embodied memories of terror and violence create new meaning and reorder the world, but in doing so they encompass the inexplicable aspects of cultural processes that have allowed the world one lives in to become an unspeakable place, hostile and death-ridden. In this article, we examine the narratives of Cambodian refugees' experiences of the Khmer Rouge regime against the backdrop of an ethnographic study of older Cambodians' lives in an inner-city neighborhood. The stories from this study of 40 Cambodians between the ages of 50 and 79 illustrate the relationship between bodily distress and memory, and between personal history and collective experience. These narratives reveal how people strive to create continuity in their lives but under certain circumstances are unable to do so.<br>

Abstract: Because so many anthropologists have lost their senses of the smells, sounds, and tastes of the places they study, the major theorists of spirit possession have failed to consider relationships between bodily practices and cultural memory and countermemory. By regarding spirit possession in West Africa sensuously as an embodied practice, the author reveals the phenomenological arena in which cultural memory is fashioned and refashioned to produce and reproduce power.<br>

Abstract: Public history sites like the West Indian Museum of Panama and the Miraflores Visitors Center have different approaches to narrating the Panama Canal story, ranging from tales of man’s triumph over nature and celebratory discourses of nationalist victories, to testimonies of the racial histories silenced by official renderings of the past. Given the important role of museums as educational institutions, sites that inform public opinion, and representational platforms for national tourism, this article explores the relationship these institutions forge between visitors and canal history. Through a comparative analysis of the narratives and experiential strategies at each site, I evaluate the degree to which Panamanians are cast as spectators in grandiose histories of triumph, or as agents, responsible for shaping the past, present and future. In contrast to these physical sites, I consider how The Society of Friends of the West Indian Museum of Panama constructs a living past through memory practices that challenge the petrified histories traditionally found in museums.<br>

Abstract: Historians are dumb witnesses to a culture wrangling with itself about its criminal past if they only narrate the sequence of historical controversies such as those that have dotted the German public landscape since the Holocaust. They need to be alive to the subterranean biblical themes flowing beneath the surface froth of events, linking past and present through the continuity of German political emotions that are necessarily collective and therefore sensitive to anxieties about accusations of collective, inherited sin. This article argues that the guilt/shame couplet so common both in public German and academic discourses about postwar Germany cannot account for the intergenerational transmission of moral pollution signified by Holocaust memory. In order to understand the dynamics of German political emotions, it is more useful to employ an alternative couplet: stigma and sacrifice.<br>

Abstract: This article examines the formative role of the World War II experience in shaping politically relevant memories in postwar Italy. Rather than considering the past a legacy or a heritage—something abstract, malleable and susceptible to serving political interests—the focus here is on the meaning-giving power of memories and symbols in the historical evolution. The birth of Italian democracy after the war was preceded by disruptive events that could have divided the nation. This article illustrates how contested and fragmented interpretations of critical events were structured by and through the dimension of cultural memory, which sustained social and political imaginations, eventually shaping characters and outcomes of the Italian political transformation.<br>

Abstract: On the face of it, the legacy of the 1798 rebellion in the northeastern Irish counties of Antrim and Down seems to be a paradigmatic case of “collective amnesia.” Over the course of the long nineteenth century, growing identification of the Protestants of the area with unionism, loyalism and Orangeism, fortified through opposition to the rise of nationalism amongst Catholics, encouraged public effacement of discomforting memories of the mass participation of Protestants, in particular Presbyterians, in republican insurrection. However, the uncovering of a “hidden” (or perhaps relatively low-profile) popular historiography grounded in oral traditions reveals continuous obsessive, though characteristically ambivalent, local preoccupation with remembrance of the rebellion. Acknowledging that forgetting is not the antithesis, but an integral component, of memory, this case study of what appears to be an Ulster
         lieu d'oubliconceptualizes “social forgetting” as the outcome of multi-layered relationships between oblivion and remembering.<br>

Abstract: This article discusses the results of focus group interviews with members of three different Catholic communities in Poland: the Radio Maryja Family from Rzeszów, epitomizing the so-called “Closed Church,” the intellectuals from Lublin associated with the late Archbishop Życiński, who exemplify adherents to the “Open Church,” and the Club of Catholic Intelligentsia from Kraków, which adopts a middle position between these two groups. The analysis reveals that although the groups constitute varying “communities of memory” with different perceptions of the Polish national past and relations between Poles and Jews, there are no significant differences in their memory of Auschwitz. The qualitative study of these three Catholic communities confirms the results of surveys which show that over the past years in Poland the Jewish meaning of Auschwitz has gained precedence over the Polish and Catholic meanings.<br>

Abstract: Fitzgerald's nostalgic style, though, set an example of how a nostalgic narrative could be structured, and in its aftermath it was used by such different authors as Evelyn Waugh in
      Brideshead Revisited(1945), Anthony Burgess inA Clockwork Orange(1962) and the works of Kazuo Ishiguro. The author's own later work employs it as well. The technique of using the reader's textual memory in order to evoke a phenomenological nostalgic experience is very evident in both versions ofTender Is the Night(the 1934 original, and Malcolm Cowley's 1951 restructuring). In the 1951 version, the structure of the narrative closely follows the pattern of happiness and reflection. An early description of a Swiss valley communicates an awe of life and nature: “The sun swam out into a blue sea of sky and suddenly it was a Swiss valley at its best—pleasant sounds and murmurs and a good fresh smell of health and cheer” (9). In the transitory third book, “Casualties: 1925,” the tone has changed from appreciative to melancholic, as in this description of the small town of Amiens: “In the day-time one is deflated by such towns, with their little trolley cars of twenty years ago crossing the great grey cobble-stoned squares in front of the cathedral, and the very weather seems to have a quality of the past, faded weather like that of old photographs” (138). At the end of the novel both Dick and Nicole Diver become obsessed with youth and the past as well as with time: “for Nicole the years slipped away by clock and calendar and birthday, with the added poignance of her perishable beauty” (228). Toward the end of the novel, Nicole's last sight of Dick—“her eyes followed his figure until it became a dot and mingled with the other dots in the summer crowd” (386)—forces the reader to reflect in a reversed movement. Instead of vanishing like Dick, this image suggests a backward recollection of what was a Swiss valley “at its best.”<br>

Abstract: Even in her familial tone, and perhaps because of it, Jabbeh Wesley never forgets that the healing and meaning-making function of grief and mourning, as painful as grief and mourning are, is not to be avoided. Rather, as DuBose argues, based on the painful experience of his wife's miscarriage, as “‘child’ and ‘parent’ disappeared, our bodies and our society
      dys-appeared, and our connections and hopes re-appeared” (374). Jabbeh Wesley attaches the reappearance of the hopes for the healing and reconstruction of her Liberian world to people's ability and willingness to truly experience the painful process of grief and, perhaps informed by that cathartic experience, allow compassion and empathy to guide their relationship to others.<br>

Abstract: The point here is that whoever I am in terms of my personal identity and my capacity or incapacity to identify myself through sortal terms as a being in the world with others, I will have no doubt who is in pain or who will have the pain.

Abstract: In 1986, however, SPEP's present mission statement could not have been conceived. Many important issues and questions remained unrecognized or simply ignored. But the opening before the organization was now a “postmodern” one, and a hallmark of what is called postmodern thought is its requirement that it transform in the force of its own lack of founded stability. I believe that 1986 began a series of developments that is turning SPEP toward ways of thought and life that cannot be labeled postmodern. I doubt that this turning constitutes a midlife crisis for SPEP in its fiftieth year. But it does highlight for me the fact that I have been giving a historical narrative that has to do with continuities in the dissolution of continuities, that I have not been—if I may put it this way—postmodern in an orthodox manner, although I have refused to give an unambiguous meaning to the term that has played a major role in organizing this essay. I do not know whether this discussion is postmodern, post-postmodern, or modern, and I do not care. I do care, however, about the openings that SPEP has provided for collegiality, conflict, unresolved differences, transformations, and sites for presentations, discussion, and critique. In my experience, in its own organizational development and travail, it has occasioned changes in the lives of many philosophers (mine among them). I expect that its indeterminate opening now—its continuing transformations in the interaction of many differences—will continue to surprise, irritate, and change those of us who participate in its opportunities. I close with a sense of beginning and an acknowledgment of the strangeness of the continuity that a series of beginnings provides: continuity without substance, continuity coming to pass.<br>

Abstract: I want to conclude with one more argument from my own work. I have very often argued that philosophers of technology, regarding the expectations of society and their own traditions and habits, may come “too late” to technologies. They too often undertake their reflections
            afterthe technologies are in place. Rather, I argue, they should reposition themselves at what I call the “R&D” position where technologies are taking developmental shape, in think tanks, in incubator facilities, in research centers. Only then can truly “new” and emerging technologies be fully philosophically engaged.<br>

Abstract: We at SPEP have never been modern and have made a good living off the critique of modernism and of its binary oppositions. But I think that the business as usual of Continental philosophy will have to be expanded to include a critique of the opposition of the human and the nonhuman, of
            physisandtechne, and of “Continental philosophy” and “science.” For the truth is that we have been a party to the science wars. That is why I think that the work of Catherine Malabou is exactly the sort of work that SPEP and Continental philosophy generally will have to do in the future.
                  We have yet to admit how deeply inscribed the human is in the nonhuman and the technical. We have yet to appreciate that being-in-the-world is not only historicized, gendered, and incarnate but also both a neural and a galactic event, of both microscopic and macroscopic proportions. Can it be of no interest to “philosophy,” can there be nothing to “wonder” about, that our bodies are literally made of stardust? We have yet to realize how deeply interwoven is the imagination of speculative physics with the wonder of the philosophers. If the best we can do is to protect our turf by saying that science does not think, the sciences will steal our thunder, that is, our wonder, right out from under us. Science does think, and science wonders, because wonder is the piety of thought. That is a matter to which SPEP, and Continental philosophers generally, whether they have taken a theological turn or are running in the opposite direction, should give more thought.36

Abstract: Second, how do we account for the fact that the processes of public memory are both created by individual choices and nurtured in collective contexts? Many scholars have productively addressed this question by unpacking specific examples in which individuals or groups vie to control public memories. The critical framework I recommend offers a more systematic approach to this issue. To view representations of the past through the nested lenses of rhetoric, public memory, and the agential spiral is to focus on how human beings—individually and in groups—forge connections with people of other times through the medium of public agency. The agential spiral, derived from my reading of Ricoeur's “threefold mimesis,” aims to pinpoint three moments in the construction of narratives in which human action is represented and reinterpreted within a temporal structure. As a critical framework, the agential spiral helps us to view the creation of public memories at three key moments and to see the process as a coiling whole. Using this tool, we can better understand why certain memories persist in certain societies and how those memories powerfully connect people across time as well as space.<br>

Abstract: What is left unsaid in this article about the relationship between utopia and rhetoric could certainly fill the pages of many books. The range is especially rich when we turn to contemporary rhetorical theorists who specifically address society as a value to be combined with a remembered or imagined better place, as in Nedra Reynolds's
      Geographies of Writingor bell hooks'sBelonging: A Culture of Place.
               Just as constitutive rhetoric (that is, cumulative discourse that contributes to building the structure of human society) has been important in the works of theorists often cited by utopists as crucial to their work, so the utopian impulse continues to be inherent in the way rhetoricians see their subject. To persuade verbally or visually, we must have our own idea of what is socially better, and we must also be able to imagine what our audience believes to be better. The function of utopia, then, may be less philosophical and ideological at its root than it is linguistic in a pragmatic sense. As Kenneth Burke has written of human beings, we are “the symbol-making, symbol-using, symbol-misusing animal … rotten with perfection.”38

Abstract: Milan Kundera has described this kind of comedy as echoing a joyous, life-affirming laughter—“the serious laughter of angels expressing their joy of being.”
      
               But that is not to suggest that there is anything divinely pious in this position: if Joyce is an angel, then he is one, like Stephen Dedalus, who will not blindly or uncritically serve.168
            
               In commenting upon an earlier version of this article, Patrick Parrinder spoke of “the difficult relationship between Utopia and comedy.” This relationship is problematized by the fact that Utopia rarely seems able to laugh at itself or therefore to offer the liberating possibilities of comedy. Joyce's later writing, however, appears to advance the rare chance of a pluralist, ambiguous, and dynamic vision of Utopia: a Utopia that might be sustained into futurity—a Utopia that still has room for dreamers and for democrats. But is it still possible that we can call this realm of radical openness, this flux of possibilities, this resolutely material site, Utopian? And do we really need to? This kind of Utopia is not a category or a frame but a direction, a progress, a confluence of streams of consciousness and of unconsciousness, flowing into the river of life: not just a symbolic river but a real one too, the Liffey, the great Anna Livia Plurabelle herself. Or as Joyce put it, more succinctly (and more joyously), it is simply “Lff!”169

Abstract: Familial
         memoryis indispensable to individual memory. By recounting memories, the individual gains greater control over them, integrating them within self-identity. These functions are undermined by theRepublicanfamily's fear of reprisals for articulating a counter-discourse in theFrancoist New State, and the personal history of Sunta, the narrator inAlfons Cervera's
               
                  , is bereft of supportive socio-cultural frameworks. Sunta resolves this situation through the medium of narrative memory, which effects a retrospective uncovering of memory traces through images of the past, allowing her to revisit an inadequately assimilated childhood from an empowered position.El color del crepúsculo<br>

Abstract: This essay argues that some recent Holocaust films introduce a new attitude towards memory that moves beyond the notion of postmemory while remaining committed to the project of remembering the past and creating an ethical response. The films by Marceline Loridan-Ivens and Robert Thalheim focus on future generations and their ability to relate to the Holocaust in an ethical way that avoids the problems of traumatization and commodification that mark earlier Holocaust film and commercial cinema, respectively.<br>
