  Securing a Vibrant Democracy from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt16wd0hf">Invoking the Invisible Hand</a><br>
  Abstract: In this famous passage from
                  The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith employs a powerfully evocative metaphor that bursts through his prose to escape the confines of political economy and obtain the status of a common sense. Resonating across national contexts and historical eras, the metaphor of the “invisible hand” has spoken to many people as an intuitive description of how the world works and an unparalleled prescription for ethical individual action. The invisible hand artfully captures the spirit of a market ethics by insisting that in working for oneself, an individual works for the good of others. The invisible hand<br>

  Abstract: My route forward with Proust begins with the madeleine. Girard cites the madeleine as a preliminary revelation for Proust—a “first glimmer of novelistic grace” for the novel that is to come—and Kristeva also begins her reflections on Proust with the madeleine.¹ However, because Kristeva draws out elements of this metaphor of which Girard takes no notice after he sets aside his early interest in affective memory and sensory experience, her observations can enhance Girard’s mimetic theory. Reflecting on the madeleine from a perspective grounded in Kristeva’s corporeal hermeneutics, I demonstrate how an augmented mimetic theory can offer a<br>

In a phrase that draws together many lines of his thought, he speaks of “the conversation that we ourselves are” (TM378).¹ Although “understanding a text and reaching an understanding in a conversation” appear to be very different (TM378), Gadamer’s analysis enables the insight that describing “the task of hermeneutics as entering into dialogue with the text” is “more than a metaphor” (TM368).

  Abstract: Leibniz displayed a special alertness to the metaphor of

Far from being something merely mechanistic, the organic body of the monad—which we have seen to be intimately tied to place—is a “living being” or “divine machine.”¹ Since every monad is in effect a world filled with monads at increasingly minuscule levels, organicity extends to everything in the end: “There is a world of creatures, living beings, animals, entelechies, souls, in the smallest particle of matter.”² Hence every bit of matter can be compared to a pond filled with<br>

  Book Title: Figures of a Changing World: Metaphor and the Emergence of Modern Culture-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): BERGER HARRY<br>
  Abstract: Figures of a Changing World offers a dramatic new account of cultural change, an account based on the distinction between two familiar rhetorical figures, metonymy and metaphor. The book treats metonymy as the basic organizing trope of traditional culture and metaphor as the basic organizing trope of modern culture. On the one hand, metonymies present themselves as analogies that articulate or reaffirm preexisting states of affairs. They are guarantors of facticity, a term that can be translated or defined as fact-like-ness. On the other hand, metaphors challenge the similarity they claim to establish, in order to feature departures from preexisting states of affairs. On the basis of this distinction, the author argues that metaphor and metonymy can be used as instruments both for the large-scale interpretation of tensions in cultural change and for the micro-interpretation of tensions within particular texts. In addressing the functioning of the two terms, the author draws upon and critiques the work of Friedrich Nietzsche, Roman Jakobson, Christian Metz, Paul Ricoeur, Umberto Eco, Edmund Leach, and Paul de Man.<br>

  Abstract: My account of metaphor and metonymy in the preceding chapters suggests that if the difference between them is fluid, if it is weak in purely structural terms, it can be strengthened by contextualization. But a more serious problem confronts the effort to keep metaphor and metonymy apart. I’ve called them two fundamental tropes, or figures, and this means that I have already taken for granted a prior distinction: the distinction between the literal (or proper) and the figurative uses of language.<br>

  Abstract: This thematic fourth Supplementum to Ancient Narrative, entitled Metaphor and the Ancient Novel, is a collection of revised versions of papers originally read at the Second Rethymnon International Conference on the Ancient Novel (RICAN 2) under the same title, held at the University of Crete, Rethymnon, on May 19-20, 2003.Though research into metaphor has reached staggering proportions over the past twenty-five years, this is the first volume dedicated entirely to the subject of metaphor in relation to the ancient novel. Not every contributor takes into account theoretical discussions of metaphor, but the usefulness of every single paper lies in the fact that they explore actual texts while sometimes theorists tend to work out of context.<br>

  Abstract: Aristotle says that metaphor is ‘the application of a word that belongs to another thing: either from genus to species, species to genus, species to species, or by analogy’.¹ Studies of metaphors in specific texts – such as those considered in the present volume – are, on the whole, served well by the sort of definition Aristotle offers. But that Aristotelian definition, in presupposing that proper names belong to their objects, raises some awkward questions about naming and essence. And those questions become more threatening if the metaphors to be considered are found in fiction. Ken Dowden’s chapter raises the<br>

Technically, this allowed the camera, which stays behind inside the cloister, to watch her cross the threshold and walk down the alleyway into the unknown.

  Abstract: Given the prominence Heidegger accords to poetry throughout a
                  Gesamtausgabethat now extends to 102 volumes, his discussions of figurative language are, at first glance, most conspicuous for their scarcity. Metaphor in particular is dismissed over four lapidary and categorical pronouncements. If this might be taken to demonstrate that Heidegger was simply uninterested in questions of metaphor, and of figurative language more generally,¹ one should nevertheless note that these pronouncements lie at the crux of his attempts both to think thealetheiccapacity of artworks, and to “undergo an experience with language” (OL 57/159).

  Book Title: Translating Investments: Metaphor and the Dynamics of Cultural Change in Tudor-Stuart England-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: The title Translating Investments, a manifold pun, refers to metaphor and clothing, authority and interest, and trading and finance. Translation, Latin translatio, is historically a name for metaphor, and investment, etymologically a reference to clothing, participates both in the complex symbolism of early modern dress and in the cloth trade of the period. In this original and wide-ranging book, Judith Anderson studies the functioning of metaphor as a constructive force within language, religious doctrine and politics, literature, rhetoric, and economics during the reigns of the Tudors and early Stuarts. Invoking a provocative metaphorical concept from Andy Clark's version of cognitive science, she construes metaphor itself as a form of scaffolding fundamental to human culture. A more traditional and controversial conception of such scaffolding is known as sublation-Hegel's Aufhebung, or raising,as the philosophers Jacques Derrida and Paul Ricoeur have understood this term. Metaphor is the agent of raising, or sublation, and sublation is inseparable from the productive life of metaphor, as distinct in its death in code or clich. At the same time, metaphor embodies the sense both of partial loss and of continuity, or preservation, also conveyed by the term Aufhebung. Anderson's study is simultaneously critical and historical. History and the theory are shown to be mutually enlightening, as are a wide variety of early modern texts and their specific cultural contexts. From beginning to end, this study touches the present, engaging questions about language, rhetoric, and reading within post-structuralism and neo-cognitivism. It highlights connections between intellectual problems active in our own culture and those evident in the earlier texts, controversies, and crises Anderson analyzes. In this way, the study is bifocal, like metaphor itself. While Anderson's overarching concern is with metaphor as a creative exchange, a source of code-breaking conceptual power, eac~<br>

Lanham’s definition is a cogent synthesis abstracted from classical and Renaissance sources, and I have annotated it as such, along with reference to Patricia Parker’s provocative analysis of definitions of metaphor and catachresis from classical times to the<br>

  Book Title: Between Chora and the Good: Metaphor's Metaphysical Neighborhood-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): BIGGER CHARLES P.<br>
  Abstract: Plato's chora as developed in the Timaeus is a creative matrix in which things arise and stand out in response to the lure of the Good. Chora is paired with the Good, its polar opposite; both are beyond beingand the metaphors hitherto thought to disclose the transcendent. They underlie Plato's distinction of a procreative gap between being and becoming. The chiasmus between the Good and chora makes possible their mutual participation in one another. This gap makes possible both phenomenological and cosmological interpretations of Plato. Metaphor is restricted to beings as they appear in this gap through the crossing of metaphor's terms, terms that dwell with, rather than subulate, one another. Hermeneutically, through its iswe can see something being engendered or determined by that crossing.Bigger's larger goal is to align the primacy of the Good in Plato and Christian Neoplatonism with the creator God of Genesis and the God of love in the New Testament.<br>

This resembles both the crossings of hermeneutics and metaphor.¹ We must now go beyond these in approaching the Good, though the beyond is always under an ontological pall.<br>

  Book Title: Thinking Through the Imagination: Aesthetics in Human Cognition-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Jones Jude<br>
  Abstract: Use your imagination! The demand is as important as it is confusing. What is the imagination? What is its value? Where does it come from? And where is it going in a time when even the obscene seems overdone and passe? This book takes up these questions and argues for the centrality of imagination in human cognition. It traces the development of the imagination in Kant's critical philosophy (particularly the Critique of Aesthetic Judgment) and claims that the insights of Kantian aesthetic theory, especially concerning the nature of creativity, common sense, and genius, influenced the development of nineteenth-century American philosophy. The book identifies the central role of the imagination in the philosophy of Peirce, a role often overlooked in analytic treatments of his thought. The final chapters pursue the observation made by Kant and Peirce that imaginative genius is a type of natural gift (ingenium) and must in some way be continuous with the creative force of nature. It makes this final turn by way of contemporary studies of metaphor, embodied cognition, and cognitive neuroscience.<br>

  Book Title: Cathedrals of Bone: The Role of the Body in Contemporary Catholic Literature-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Waldmeir John C.<br>
  Abstract: The metaphor of the Church as a bodyhas shaped Catholic thinking since the Second Vatican Council. Its influence on theological inquiries into Catholic nature and practice is well-known; less obvious is the way it has shaped a generation of Catholic imaginative writers. Cathedrals of Bone is the first full-length study of a cohort of Catholic authors whose art takes seriously the themes of the Council: from novelists such as Mary Gordon, Ron Hansen, Louise Erdrich, and J. F. Powers, to poets such as Annie Dillard, Mary Karr, Lucia Perillo, and Anne Carson, to the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright John Patrick Shanley. Motivated by the inspirational yet thoroughly incarnational rhetoric of Vatican II, each of these writers encourages readers to think about the human body as a site-perhaps the most important site-of interaction between God and human beings. Although they represent the body in different ways, these late-twentieth-century Catholic artists share a sense of its inherent value. Moreover, they use ideas and terminology from the rich tradition of Catholic sacramentality, especially as it was articulated in the documents of Vatican II, to describe that value. In this way they challenge the Church to take its own tradition seriously and to reconsider its relationship to a relatively recent apologetics that has emphasized a narrow view of human reason and a rigid sense of orthodoxy.<br>

  Book Title: Reading the Allegorical Intertext: Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: Judith H. Anderson conceives the intertext as a relation between or among texts that encompasses both Kristevan intertextuality and traditional relationships of influence, imitation, allusion, and citation. Like the Internet, the intertext is a state, or place, of potential expressed in ways ranging from deliberate emulation to linguistic free play. Relatedly, the intertext is also a convenient fiction that enables examination of individual agency and sociocultural determinism. Anderson's intertext is allegorical because Spenser's Faerie Queene is pivotal to her study and because allegory, understood as continued or moving metaphor, encapsulates, even as it magnifies, the process of signification. Her title signals the variousness of an intertext extending from Chaucer through Shakespeare to Milton and the breadth of allegory itself. Literary allegory, in Anderson's view, is at once a mimetic form and a psychic one-a process thinking that combines mind with matter, emblem with narrative, abstraction with history. Anderson's first section focuses on relations between Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and Spenser's The Faerie Queene, including the role of the narrator, the nature of the textual source, the dynamics of influence, and the bearing of allegorical narrative on lyric vision. The second centers on agency and cultural influence in a variety of Spenserian and medieval texts. Allegorical form, a recurrent concern throughout, becomes the pressing issue of section three. This section treats plays and poems of Shakespeare and Milton and includes two intertextually relevant essays on Spenser.How Paradise Lost or Shakespeare's plays participate in allegorical form is controversial. Spenser's experiments with allegory revise its form, and this intervention is largely what Shakespeare and Milton find in his poetry and develop. Anderson's book, the result of decades of teaching and writing about allegory, especially Spenserian allegory, will reorient thinking about fundamenta~<br>

  Book Title: Missing Link-The Evolution of Metaphor and the Metaphor of Evolution<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): DONALDSON JEFFERY<br>
  Abstract: We look for missing links in the sciences and humanities, but the essential missing link - metaphor - is always in front of us. In Missing Link, Jeffery Donaldson unites literary criticism and evolutionary and cognitive science to show how metaphor has been with us since the beginning of time as a seed in the nature of things. With examples from centuries of poets, critics, philosophers, and scientists, he details how metaphor is a chemistry, an exchange of energies forming and dissolving, and an openness in the spaces between things. He considers the ways in which DNA learns how to liken things that have been, how mutation makes errors and then tries them on, and how evolution is hypothesis - nature's way of "thinking more." The mind is a matrix of relations: neural synapses cascade into ever-changing pathways and patterns. Metaphor is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. It is the unbroken thread between matter and spirit. Whether offering analysis of a turn of phrase or chemical reaction, Missing Link presents a vision of literature that is also a vision of the cosmos, and vice versa. It enters the debate between evolution and religion, and challenges scientists, literary theorists, and religious advocates to rethink the relations between their disciplines.<br>

  Abstract: We are nearing the point where two ends meet. One is the end of the book. The other is the end of the metaphoric unfolding that we have been tracking throughout. That end is, in plainest terms, metaphor, the enabling and embodying initiative that like the dog in Rilke’s “Orpheus. Euridyce. Hermes” scampers impatiently to the next rise, where it appears to see views still farther beyond, even while it waits for us to catch up with it.<br>

  Abstract: Whatever one makes of Rousseau’s view of the motivation and speech of early humans, the relationship between the literal and the figurative remains controversial. If one makes the plausible assumption that with metaphor and irony the direct, literal, or “ordinary” meanings do not by themselves make sense of the tropes, it is no surprise to feel set adrift in search of a way to meaning. And, in part, it is just such wanderings that have led many to set their compasses mistakenly on the author’s intention.

  Book Title: Keeping the Feast-Metaphors of Sacrifice in 1 Corinthians and Philippians<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Patterson Jane Lancaster<br>
  Abstract: Patterson uses cognitive metaphor theory to trace the apostle Paul's use of metaphors from the Jewish sacrificial system in his moral counsels to the Philippians and the Corinthians. In these letters, Paul moves from the known (the practice of sacrifice) to the unknown (how to live in accord with the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ). Patterson illustrates that the significant sacrificial metaphors in 1 Corinthians and Philippians are not derived from Jewish sacrifices of atonement, but rather from the Passover and sacrifices of thanksgiving. Attention to these metaphors demonstrates that imagery drawn from these sacrifices shapes the overall moral counsel of the letters, reveals more varied and nuanced interpretations of sacrificial references in Paul's letters, and sheds light on Paul's continuity with Jewish cultic practice.<br>

  Book Title: God's Wounds-Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of the Divine Suffering, Volume 2. Evil and Divine Suffering<br>

  Author(s): Pool Jeff B.<br>
  Abstract: This book constitutes the second volume of a three-volume study of Christian testimonies to divine suffering: God's Wounds: Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of Divine Suffering, vol. 2, Evil and Divine Suffering. The larger study focuses its inquiry into the testimonies to divine suffering themselves, seeking to allow the voices that attest to divine suffering to speak freely, then to discover and elucidate the internal logic or rationality of this family of testimonies, rather than defending these attestations against the dominant claims of classical Christian theism that have historically sought to eliminate such language altogether from Christian discourse about the nature and life of God. This second volume of studies proceeds on the basis of the presuppositions of this symbol, those implicit attestations that provide the conditions of possibility for divine suffering-that which constitutes divine vulnerability with respect to creation-as identified and examined in the first volume of this project: an understanding of God through the primary metaphor of love (God is love); and an understanding of the human as created in the image of God, with a life (though finite) analogous to the divine life-the imago Dei as love. The second volume then investigates the first two divine wounds or modes of divine suffering to which the larger family of testimonies to divine suffering normally attest: (1) divine grief, suffering because of betrayal by the beloved human or human sin; and (2) divine self-sacrifice, suffering for the beloved human in its bondage to sin or misery, to establish the possibility of redemption and reconciliation. Each divine wound, thus, constitutes a response to a creaturely occasion. The suffering in each divine wound also occurs in two stages: a passive stage and an active stage. In divine grief, God suffers because of human sin, betrayal of the divine lover by the beloved human: divine sorrow as the passive stage of divine grief; and divine angui~<br>

  Author(s): Pool Jeff B.<br>
  Abstract: This book constitutes the first volume of a three-volume study of Christian testimonies to divine suffering: God's Wounds: Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of Divine Suffering, Divine Vulnerability and Creation. This study first develops an approach to interpreting the contested claims about the suffering of God. Thus, the larger study focuses its inquiry into the testimonies to divine suffering themselves, seeking to allow the voices that attest to divine suffering to speak freely, to discover and elucidate the internal logic or rationality of this family of testimonies, rather than defending these attestations against the dominant claims of classical Christian theism that have historically sought to eliminate such language altogether from Christian discourse about the nature and life of God. Through this approach, this volume of studies into the Christian symbol of divine suffering then investigates the two major presuppositions that the larger family of testimonies to divine suffering normally hold: an understanding of God through the primary metaphor of love (God is love); and an understanding of the human as created in the image of God, with a life (though finite) analogous to the divine life - the imago Dei as love. When fully elaborated, these presuppositions reveal the conditions of possibility for divine suffering and divine vulnerability with respect to creation.<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter I focus on the significance of frontier in the history of social anthropology, especially fieldwork in the Amazon supported by the Institute of Social Science (ISS) of the University of California at Berkeley (UCB). I understand that subventions for scholarly research in the western part of the United States resonate in the scientific field of moving-frontier theories. ISS supported projects on “economic and cultural boundaries,” relocating to the social domain the former biological metaphor of botanical germination. This institute supported projects that went beyond domestic U.S. issues, embracing social problems in other countries such as Mexico and<br>

  Book Title: In a Different Place-Pilgrimage, Gender, and Politics at a Greek Island Shrine<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Dubisch Jill<br>
  Abstract: In a Different Placeoffers a richly textured account of a modern pilgrimage, combining ethnographic detail, theory, and personal reflection. Visited by thousands of pilgrims yearly, the Church of the Madonna of the Annunciation on the Aegean island of Tinos is a site where different interests--sacred and secular, local and national, personal and official--all come together. Exploring the shrine and its surrounding town, Jill Dubisch shares her insights into the intersection of social, religious, and political life in Greece. Along the way she develops the idea of pilgrimage-journeying away from home in search of the miraculous--as a metaphor for anthropological fieldwork. This highly readable work offers us the opportunity to share one anthropologist's personal and professional journey and to see in a "different place" the inadequacy of such conventional anthropological categories as theory versus data, rationality versus emotion, and the observer versus the observed.<br>

  Abstract: In the Anastenaria religious healing is brought about by the transformation of a person’s relationship with Saint Constantine from a negative one involving illness and suffering to a positive one involving health and joy, a transformation that takes place when a person becomes an Anastenaris and acquires the supernatural power of the Saint. A person’s relationship with Saint Constantine can, therefore, be seen as a powerful metaphor for the person’s social, psychological, and physiological condition. The Anastenaria provides people who are in a weak, vulnerable, or subordinate position with a spirit idiom that they can use to gain power over<br>

  Author(s) Jeal Roy R.<br>
  Abstract: As we saw in chapter 1,¹ since the earliest centuries of the church, interpreters have acknowledged the imagistic or metaphorical nature of the book of Revelation, although they disagree about what this characterization means. This suggests that bringing the insights of metaphor theory to bear on Revelation would be an appropriate and fruitful endeavor, especially contemporary theories of metaphor that emphasize the cognitive nature of this phenomenon. This is not to suggest that scholars have ignored discussions about metaphor in their work on Revelation; rather, there has been little systematic analysis of the metaphorical language in the text.

  Author(s): Hinlicky Paul R.<br>
  Abstract: This book explores why the metaphor of the church as a family is insufficient. Taking up Arendt’s notions of action and her criticism of privatization, the author examines community, relation, and human subjects through the work of Bonhoeffer and Stăniloae. Synthesizing Bonhoeffer and Stăniloae, Christian calling is unfolded not only as acting for others, but also with others as Trinitarian participatory response—response to the words and deeds of the three divine Persons acting in communion.<br>

  Abstract: Up until this point, I have concentrated on the church’s familial metaphor separately from reflecting on Christian action, which is embodied in it, and its challenges. In this final chapter, I will place the church’s understanding expressed in the family metaphor within the context of its calling to a specific kind of action—in terms of communal and common action. What is reflected in it? Is the church compared to a family still pertinent or does Christian acting of equals delineate another metaphor of the church?<br>

  Abstract: Ezekiel 16, the problematic narrative of Jerusalem as YHWH’s adopted daughter and faithless wife, has been richly illuminated for contemporary readers by way of postcolonial theory and postmodern literary approaches to metaphor and gender.¹ These interpretations have helped modern readers move from initial feelings of revulsion and shock at this tale of YHWH’s violent punishment of daughter/wife Jerusalem to a more complex assessment of its symbolic treatment of the city’s destruction. To be sure, nothing can dispel the tale’s unsettling violence; nevertheless, it has become possible to appreciate how the narrative’s use of metaphor and gender allowed its ancient readers<br>

  Book Title: Light and Death-Figuration in Spenser, Kepler, Donne, Milton<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: Light figures being; darkness, death. Bridging mathematical science, semantics, rhetoric, grammar, and major poems, Judith H. Anderson seeks to negotiate writings from multiple disciplines in the shared terms of poiesis and figuration rather than as cultural opposites. Analogy, a type of metaphor, has always been the connector of the known to the unknown, the sensible to the infinite. Anderson’s study moves from the figuration of light and death to the history of analogy and its pertinence to light in physics and metaphysics, from Kepler to Donne, Spenser, and Milton. Topics proliferate: creativity, optics, the relation of literature to science, the methodology of thought and argument, and the processes of narrative, discovery, and interpretation.<br>

  Abstract: Metaphor and the Slave Tradeprovides compelling evidence of the hidden but unmistakable traces of the transatlantic slave trade that persist in West African discourse. Through an examination of metaphors that describe the trauma, loss, and suffering associated with the commerce in human lives, this book shows how the horrors of slavery are communicated from generation to generation.Laura T. Murphy's insightful new readings of canonical West African fiction, autobiography, drama, and poetry explore the relationship between memory and metaphor and emphasize how repressed or otherwise marginalized memories can be transmitted through images, tropes, rumors, and fears. By analyzing the unique codes through which West Africans have represented the slave trade, this work foregrounds African literary contributions to Black Atlantic discourse and draws attention to the archive that metaphor unlocks for scholars of all disciplines and fields of study.<br>

We can see the relevance to a theory of myth of Saussure, Gadamer, and Lacan, on the one hand, and Levi-Strauss and Barthes on the other.

  Abstract: La presente Tesis estudia las relaciones entre la ciencia y la poesía. Nuestro trabajo aborda el modo en que el conocimiento científico modula la creación literaria, así como algunos de los procedimientos del pensamiento literario. Las hipótesis de investigación reposan sobre dos niveles de la escritura de Lorand Gaspar: la dimensión epistemológica del discurso poético y su valor cognitivo. A partir del análisis de un corpus literario se propone una metodología de estudio que atiende a la complejidad epistemológica y cognitiva de la enunciación poética. Tres apartados teóricos organizan la investigación de algunos de los procesos del pensamiento poético: percepción, emoción y metáfora. Lo anterior se enmarca en una argumentación que favorece la transdisciplinariedad mediante estrategias de análisis literario que integran consideraciones de carácter interdisciplinar.This thesis studies the relations between Science and Poetry.

  Author(s): Thatamanil John<br>
  Abstract: Spiritual Grammar identifies a genre of religious literature that until now has not been recognized as such. In this surprising and theoretically nuanced study, F.

Reading The Grammar of Hearts (Nahw al-qulūb) by the great Sufi shaykh and Islamic scholar 'Abd al-Karīm al-Qushayrī (d. 1074) and Moralized Grammar (Donatus moralizatus) by Christian theologian Jean Gerson (d. 1429), Longo reveals how both authors use the rules of language and syntax to advance their pastoral goals. Indeed, grammar provides the two masters with a fresh way of explaining spiritual reality to their pupils and to discipline the souls of their readers in the hopes that their writings would make others adept in the grammar of the heart.<br>

DuPrel, Schemer, and Saint-Denys anticipated recent rating systems of dream bizarreness by calling attention to the positive and negative sides of dreaming. Dreaming tends always toward a delirium syndrome, but the corresponding impairment of verbal-reflective thinking allows a positive release of visual-spatial metaphor and intuition, the frames or modules of mind that are based on a relative simultaneity of expression.

  Book Title: Faulkner-Masks and Metaphors<br>
  Publisher: University Press of Mississippi<br>
  Author(s): Hönnighausen Lothar<br>
  Abstract: Honnighausen examines Faulkner's interviews and photographs for the fictions they perpetuate. Such Faulknerian role-playing he interprets as a mode of organizing experience and relates it to the crafting of the artist's various personae in his works. Mining metaphor as well as modern theories on social role-playing, Honnighausen examines unexplored aspects of image creation and image reception in such major Faulkner novels as

  Abstract: The pronouncement of the nineteenth century philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche as transmitted through the deconstructive spirit of Jacques Derrida and the casual remark of the contemporary American poet Tom Whalen on a writer’s pleasure in role-playing mark the wide range of this book’s theme. It contains cognitive, ethical, and aesthetic aspects, centering on masks and metaphors and comprising the sociopsychic implications for Faulkner’s readers of his personae and his imagery. Nietzsche’s replacement of truth by metaphor accords well with his conviction that the modern artist can best be understood as a wearer of masks (“around every complex spirit a mask continually<br>

  Book Title: Interpreting Interpretation-The Limits of Hermeneutic Psychoanalysis<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Saks Elyn R.<br>
  Abstract: Psychoanalytic interpretation, according to the hermeneutic view, is concerned with meaning rather than facts or causes. In this provocative book, Elyn R. Saks focuses closely on what hermeneutic psychoanalysis is and how the approaches of hermeneutic psychoanalysts differ. She finds that although these psychoanalysts use the same words, concepts, images, and analogies, they hold to at least five different positions on the truth of psychoanalytic interpretations. Saks locates within these five models the thought of such prominent analysts as Roy Schafer, Donald Spence, and George Klein. Then, approaching each model from the patient's point of view, the author reaches important conclusions about treatments that patients not only will-but should-reject.If patients understood the true nature of the various models of hermeneutic psychoanalysis, Saks argues, they would spurn the story model, which asks patients to believe interpretations that do not purport to be true; that is, the psychoanalyst simply tells stories that give meaning to patients' lives, the truth of which is not considered relevant. And patients would question the metaphor and the interpretations-as-literary-criticism models, which propose views of psychoanalysis that may be unsatisfying. In addition to discussing which hermeneutic models of treatment are plausible, Saks discusses the nature of metaphorical truth. She arrives at some penetrating insights into the theory of psychoanalysis itself.<br>

  Book Title: On the Nature of Consciousness-Cognitive, Phenomenological, and Transpersonal Perspectives<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): HUNT HARRY T.<br>
  Abstract: What is the relation between mystical experience and ordinary consciousness, between the principles of modern physics and the patterns of perception in all moving creatures, between our human self-consciousness and the more primary sentience of protozoa? This book pursues an inquiry into consciousness that ranges from ancient Greece to empirical neuro-psychology to the experiential traditions of introspection and meditation. Harry Hunt begins by reviewing the renewed interest in ordinary consciousness and in altered and transpersonal states of consciousness. He then presents competing views of consciousness in cognition, neurophysiology, and animal psychology, developing a view of perceptual awareness as the core of consciousness potentially shared across species. Hunt next brings together the separate strands of neo-realist approaches to perception and thought, the phenomenology of imagery and synesthesia, and cognitive theories of metaphor. He develops an original cognitive theory of mystical experience that combines Buddhist meditative descriptions of consciousness and Heidegger's sense of Being. In relating both of these to James J. Gibson's views on perception, he avoids the various "new age" supernaturalisms that so often blight the transpersonal literature. Other themes include the relation between consciousness and time; the common perceptual-metaphoric rooting of parallels between consciousness and modern physics; and the communal basis of transpersonal states as reflected in a sociology of mysticism and a reinterpretation of parapsychological research.<br>

  Book Title: Allegory and Philosophy in Avicenna (Ibn Sina)-With a Translation of the Book of the Prophet Muhammad's Ascent to Heaven<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Heath Peter<br>
  Abstract: Islamic allegory is the product of a cohesive literary tradition to which few contributed as significantly as Ibn Sina (Avicenna), the eleventh-century Muslim philosopher. Peter Heath here offers a detailed examination of Avicenna's contribution, paying special attention to Avicenna's psychology and poetics and to the ways in which they influenced strains of theological, mystical, and literary thought in subsequent Islamic-and Western-intellectual and religious history. Heath begins by showing how Avicenna's writings fit into the context and general history of Islamic allegory and explores the interaction among allegory, allegoresis, and philosophy in Avicenna's thought. He then provides a brief introduction to Avicenna as an historical figure. From there, he examines the ways in which Avicenna's cosmological, psychological, and epistemological theories find parallel, if diverse, expression in the disparate formats of philosophical and allegorical narration. Included in this book is an illustration of Avicenna's allegorical practice. This takes the form of a translation of the Mi'raj Nama (The Book of the Prophet Muhammad's Ascent to Heaven), a short treatise in Persian generally attributed to Avicenna. The text concludes with an investigation of the literary dimension Avicenna's allegorical theory and practice by examining his use of description metaphor. Allegory and Philosophy in Avicenna is an original and important work that breaks new ground by applying the techniques of modern literary criticism to the study of Medieval Islamic philosophy. It will be of interest to scholars and students of medieval Islamic and Western literature and philosophy.<br>

  Abstract: The metaphor is not new: the cinema, like a cobweb, traps the spectator’s gaze. This quasi-hypnotic preoccupation of the image rules nowadays contemporary Hollywood production, and more specifically what forms today a type of film as precise as large, the blockbuster. If the analysis of these extremely popular, very big budget entertainment films, produced in the heart of new intermediality, can be based mainly on questions of intertextuality,¹ it can also, far from any definitive definition, be fuelled by a rich and complex network of notions which carries along in its modern rush the term of attraction.<br>

But certainly all the arts reveal time-space as lived in human experience. Dance does this through movement imagery, through structured figures of movement, in time-space.

  Abstract: Michel Tournier is a writer who explores complex philosophical questions in the guise of concrete, imagistic narratives. This comprehensive study privileges the notion of literary reference, by which the world of text is understood or experienced in metaphorical relation to the world outside of it. Metaphor, in the context of Tournier’s fiction, shows how the fantastic merges with the real to provide new perspectives on many diverse aspects of the modern world: the Crusoe myth, Nazism, the value to society of art and religion, and the nature of education. This book elucidates an aesthetic of Tournier’s fiction that encompasses the writer’s stated ambition to ‘go beyond literature’.<br>

As we have seen, Paul Ricoeur argues convincingly inLa Métaphore vivethat metaphor is a cognitive tool, that it helps in certain circumstances to articulate our experience of the world. Ricoeur’s analysis is anchored to the established phenomenological precepts of Kant and Husserl, for in order that metaphor may refer, its transgressive character must ultimately be tamed by the master discourse of philosophy. However, according to Jacques Derrida’s deconstructive practice, the philosopher’s discourse is itself shot through with metaphor. It<br>

We think of animals and people as migrating, sometimes by choice, sometimes by instinct, sometimes by compulsion. Migration is movement, but not just any movement. It is movement across geographical, national and/or cultural boundaries or differences. So, migration requires difference of some sort. We rarely speak of someone or something as having migrated if no change or adaptation was required, although of course at some level every move is by definition a change.

  Abstract: The political theory community, if fluid and marginally unstable, has some sense of identity and cohesion; and it is this which has made possible the political and religious metaphor that has been interlaced with the argument. This metaphor may be extended a little further in order to take stock and to suggest the nature and significance of what I now propose to discuss.<br>

  Abstract: Classical political thought is often understood as hostile to the disruptions, irrationalities, and banalities of quotidian experience: unity and order are taken to be its goals. In a much-quoted passage in Plato’s
                  Republic, musical harmony is used as a metaphor to describe the self and the city (401d–e, 432a); Aristotle praises genteel moderation and confines political theory to the variegated but contained sphere of rule; Cicero wrote his ownRepublic, which had its own memorable musical metaphor for concord (2.69). But as we saw in chapter 1, Cicero also theorizes political action as a contest, seeing the republic as<br>

My title is meant to underscore that challenge rather than to exaggerate the importance of the turn of the century, useful only as a metaphor for possible continuities and discontinuities in the near future. As well, it is a risky attention-getting device, in that any generalization is a construct and can be suspected of trying to impose a common metanarrative on a community that may not even perceive itself as a community.

  Abstract: In the history of Being presented by postmodernity, does Christianity represent a

This seems to be one of the most meaningful demands put forth in the reflections of Gianni Vattimo, especially in the wake of his philosophical proposal that finds anouvertureunder debate in the metaphor of weak thought, in the sense that it radicalizes a form of reflection that is (seemingly) closer to deconstruction. The issue appears even more intriguing if it is limited to the relation between philosophy and religion. There is a well-known irreconcilability<br>

  Book Title: Diasporic Feminist Theology-Asia and Theopolitical Imagination<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Kang Namsoon<br>
  Abstract: How do we navigate the question of identity in the fluid and pluralist conditions of postmodern society? Even more, how do we articulate identity as a defining particularity in the disappearance of borders, boundaries, and spaces in an increasingly globalist world? What constitutes identity and the formation of narratives under such conditions? How do these issues affect not only discursive practices, but theological and ethical construction and practice? This volumes explores these issues in depth. Diasporic Feminist Theology attempts to construct feminist theology by adopting diaspora as a theopolitical and ethical metaphor. Namsoon Kang here revisits and reexamines today’s significant issues such as identity politics, dislocation, postmodernism, postcolonialism, neoempire, Asian values, and constructs diasporic, transethnic, and glocal feminist theological discourses that create spaces of transformation, reconciliation, hospitality, worldliness, solidarity, and border-traversing. This work draws on diverse sources from contemporary critical discourses of diaspora studies, cultural studies, ethnic studies, postmodernism, postcolonialism, and feminism and feminist theology from a transterritorial space. This book is a landmark work, providing a comprehensive discourse for feminist theology today.<br>

It is naïve and dangerous to imagine sin with clear boundaries. And yet, in the sins we narrate against creaturely difference, there seems an inextricable relationship between sin and power. Perhaps no concept has received greater attention in postmodern discourse than that of power, and here no figure has loomed larger than Michel Foucault. Attending to the power

  Abstract: The International Rhetoric Culture Project has stated in its theoretical outline that “just as rhetoric is founded in culture, culture is founded in rhetoric.” The first part of this chiasmus can readily be accepted, since cross-cultural research on speaker performance, memory techniques, social expression of emotion, practical reasoning, and the interrelation between speaking styles and political organization have provided abundant evidence that rhetoric is culture-specific. Extensive research in folklore studies, the ethnography of speaking, and linguistic anthropology have also proved this claim over and over again, the most spectacular cases being the use of parallelism and metaphor (e.g., Fox 1988,<br>

  Abstract: When we return from resignation to the world of society, we turn to a certain tradition of justice and injustice, though the principles by which people attempt to derive laws from claims of reason often obscure the idea that justice itself may be a tradition. But what does it mean to say that there is a tradition of modern justice? And what are its insufficiencies? Kafka’s question might not even be posed in reference to justice but only in reference to punishment, which surely must be something different, even metaphorically.

And, indeed, it seems true that in thinking and in expression, metaphor (one constitutive element of all worldviews) is ubiquitous and inescapable.

Within the same essay, Yumeno went on to elaborate the comparison:<br>

  Abstract: By comparing objects of science, such as the brain, the galaxy, the amoeba, and the quark, with objects of humanistic inquiry, such as the poem, the photograph, the belief, and the philosophical concept, Volney Gay reestablishes a fundamental distinction between science and the humanities. He frees the latter from its pursuit of material-based progress and restores its disciplines to a place of privilege and respect. Using the metaphor of magnification, Gay shows that, while we can investigate natural objects to the limits of imaging capacity, magnifying cultural objects dissolves them into noise. In other words, cultural objects can be studied only within their contexts and through the prism of metaphor and narrative.<br>

It was the dream of a world where there is no territory without sovereignty, in other words, no one distanced from the rules of the state (Thompson 1994; Anderson 1997). Subsequent history seems to flatly disprove this prediction. Piracy has stopped being a historical curiosity or a simple metaphor.

  Book Title: Reading the-The Literary Aims of a Theravada Buddhist History<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Scheible Kristin<br>
  Abstract: Reading the Mahavamsaadvocates a new, literary approach to this text by revealing its embedded reading advice (to experiencesamvegaandpasada) and affective work of metaphors (the Buddha's dharma as light) and salient characters (nagas). Kristin Scheible argues that theMahavamsarequires a particular kind of reading. In the text's proem, special instructions draw readers to the metaphor of light and thenagas, or salient snake-beings, of the first chapter.Nagasare both model worshippers and unworthy hoarders of Buddha's relics. As nonhuman agents, they challenge political and historicist readings of the text. Scheible sees these slippery characters and the narrative's potent and playful metaphors as techniques for refocusing the reader's attention on the text's emotional aims. Her work explains theMahavamsa's central motivational role in contemporary Sri Lankan Buddhist and nationalist circles. It also speaks broadly to strategies of reading religious texts and to the internal and external cues that give such works lives beyond the page.<br>

  Book Title: Textual Cultures: Cultural Texts-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Treharne Elaine<br>
  Abstract: The dynamic fields of the history of the book and the sociology of the text are the areas this volume investigates, bringing together ten specially commissioned essays that between them demonstrate a range of critical and material approaches to medieval, early modern, and digital books and texts. They scrutinize individual medieval manuscripts to illustrate how careful re-reading of evidence permits a more nuanced apprehension of production, and reception across time; analyse metaphor for our understanding of the Byzantine book; examine the materiality of textuality from Beowulf to Pepys and the digital work in the twenty-first century; place manuscripts back into specific historical context; and re-appraise scholarly interpretation of significant periods of manuscript and print production in the later medieval and early modern periods. All of these essays call for a new assessment of the ways in which we read books and texts, making a major contribution to book history, and illustrating how detailed focus on individual cases can yield important new findings.

  Book Title: The World as Metaphor in Robert Musil's 'The Man without Qualities'-Possibility as Reality<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Grill Genese<br>
  Abstract: Robert Musil, known to be a scientific and philosophical thinker, was committed to aesthetics as a process of experimental creation of an ever-shifting reality. Musil wanted, above all, to be a creative writer, and obsessively engaged in almost endless deferral via variations and metaphoric possibilities in his novel project, 'The Man without Qualities.' This lifelong process of writing is embodied in the unfinished novel by a recurring metaphor of self-generating de-centered circle worlds. The present study analyzes this structure with reference to Musil's concepts of the utopia of the Other Condition, Living and Dead Words, Specific and Non-Specific Emotions, Word Magic, and the Still Life. In contrast to most recent studies of Musil, it concludes that the extratemporal metaphoric experience of the Other Condition does not fail, but rather constitutes the formal and ethical core of Musil's novel. The first study to utilize the newly published Klagenfurt Edition of Musil's literary remains (a searchable annotated text), 'The World as Metaphor' offers a close reading of variations and text genesis, shedding light not only on Musil's novel, but also on larger questions about the modernist artist's role and responsibility in consciously re-creating the world. Genese Grill holds a PhD in Germanic Literatures and Languages from the Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York.<br>

                  On the Musically Beautiful (1854) and in many of his reviews.¹ That he rarely reflects on this practice is revealing of the underlying assumptions of Hanslick’s aesthetic thinking, his musical preferences and antipathies. These unreflected, apparently self-evident paradigms are particularly relevant to the intellectual horizon of an author and his epoch. On the one hand, there is the tradition of German idealism<br>

  Abstract: According to Northrop Frye, English-Canadian literature is marked by a five-century-long oscillation between the romantic tendency, on the one hand, moving in the direction of myth and metaphor and their formulaic units, and the realistic tradition, on the other hand, moving in the opposite direction, displacing or adjusting such improbable formulas so as to produce verisimilitude (Frye 1976, 36–37). English-Canadian cultural production can thus be situated at opposite extremes. In the period between 1918 and 1967, a large part is grounded in the themes and motifs of the folktale, in the structures of the mythopoeic or marvelous, and in<br>

  Abstract: In the opening pages of

A biography is like an autopsy because it literally opens up the individual to ‘investigate, understand, describe, and explain what may have seemed obscure, strange, or inexplicable’ (Lee 2009, 1). Conversely, the metaphor of the portrait suggests that biographies can capture the character of a subject, bringing a person to life through ‘attention to detail and skill in representation’ (Lee 2009, 2).

Abstract: A musical metaphor might help illustrate the point. John Coltrane’s bebop improvisation of the song “My Favorite Things” is easily recognizable both as “Coltrane” (style) and as “My Favorite Things” (language, or code). No one would ever mistake it for Julie Andrews’s smooth, sweet singing of the same tune in the film
         The Sound of Music, even if the basic themes are the same. When looking for the realm of free agency, theorists often turn to interaction—Alexander and Smith point to the creative ad hoc–ing that people do, to get from the code to the enactment of the code. But after only a few notes, a music lover will easily recognize Coltrane’s style. Just as Coltrane’s “Favorite Things” was simply not an unpatterned, ad hoc variation, so group styles are not just loose, superficial, or ad hoc interpretations of stable, constant collective representations.<br>

Author(s): Duranti Alessandro<br>
Abstract: In my role as historian of Americanist anthropology, I have long mused over the disproportionate influence of a small number of linguistic anthropologists over the discipline as a whole. Duranti cites two recent American Anthropological Association presidents who are linguistic anthropologists: I note that Jane Hill crosses into cultural as well as biological anthropology and Don Brenneis is difficult to identify solely as linguistic or cultural anthropologist. My own explanation tends toward the rhetoric of continuity within the three variants of linguistic anthropology. Because we are not contentious among ourselves, moving comfortably across both the subdisciplines of anthropology and the disciplines of the social sciences and humanities, linguistic anthropologists are often identified as effective mediators and synthesizers. The seminal role of Edward Sapir in the Rockefellersponsored interdisciplinary social science of the interwar years provides an early exemplar; Sapir persuaded his colleagues that Chicago sociology and psychology/psychoanalysis were not in conflict but explored different sides of a single coin (his metaphor). He had moved beyond descriptive and historical linguistics as handmaidens to ethnology into the psychological reality of the phoneme and the theory of culture.<br>

Abstract: On the other hand, the computer also makes it possible to visualize all dysfunctioning in the mechanical body (the computer is reflexive or says something about itself), for example,

It therefore also precludes the possibility of mobilizing the assistants and allowing the human body or the mechanical body to be repaired, as well as all possibility of writing.53As I observe Hawking orchestrating the functioning of his extended body through the mediation of the computer, I cannot help but think of the materialization of the “pilot in his vessel,” a metaphor used by Descartes to describe the difficult union of body and soul:
               
         Nature likewise teaches me by these sensations of pain, hunger, thirst, etc., that I am not only lodged in my body as a pilot in a vessel, but that I am besides so intimately conjoined, and as it were intermixed with it, that my mind and body compose a certain unity. For if this were not the case, I should not feel pain when my body is hurt, seeing I am merely a thinking thing, but should perceive the wound by the understanding alone, just as a pilot perceives by sight when any part of his vessel is damaged; and when my body has need of food or drink, I should have a clear knowledge of this, and not be made aware of it by the confused sensations of hunger and thirst: for, in truth, all these sensations of hunger, thirst, pain, etc., are nothing more than certain confused modes of thinking, arising from the union and apparent fusion of mind and body.

Abstract: Beginning in the early 1960s, and punctuated by Foucault’s 1966
         Les mots et les choses(The Order of Things) and his 1969L’archéologie du savoir(The Archaeology of Knowledge and the Discourse on Language), poststructuralist critiques of truth claims and the imperialism of global history, a rethinking of the certainty of words and concepts in an “archeology (that is, a deconstruction) of the social sciences” struck at the heart of long‐standingAnnalisteprinciples.91Whether studying social control, discipline, power, or sexuality, old assumptions were dissected and new agendas initiated. The 1976Il formaggio e i vermi(The Cheese and the Worms) by Carlo Ginzburg and the 1979 launching ofmicrostoriaby Ginzburg, Carlo Poni, and Edoardo Grendi—practiced in France by Le Roy Ladurie in his 1975Montaillouand 1979Carnival in Romans—fostered a new kind of ethnographic history of everyday life that focused on the individual.92“The revival of narrative,” whether from Lawrence Stone’s famous 1979Past and Presentarticle or Paul Ricoeur’s 1983–85Time and Narrative,was to restore the story to history and to return to the event, as Pierre Nora had called for in his 1974 essay inFaire de l’histoire.
            93Pierre Bourdieu’s 1979La distinctionpushed for a reconciliation between events and structure.94By emphasizing that systems of oppositions are not stable structures but are constantly in the process of becoming, being made and remade, Bourdieu’s project to understand how social reality is constructed gets us closer to incorporating practice and perception with objective categories and suggests a way of bridging the gap between the endless details of one thing after another and causal explanation. This list of keyAnnalisteideas and methods derived from theMéditerranée’s problematic could include sharp criticism like that of François Dosse; the constructive response of Jacques Revel on theAnnalesparadigms, the social sciences, and the construction of the social; Pierre N~<br>

Abstract: A situation of radical pluralism combined with an automatic instinct to define oneself in oppositional terms thus threatens to turn a tradition inside out. In overdefining itself in this way, a theological tradition suppresses those internal theological tensions that, like the creative tensions of metaphor that generate new dimensions of meaning, are productive of theological insight. Tensions that once could be readily found within the tradition are now apparent—at least initially—only outside of it. A theological tradition that has unintentionally suppressed sources of creative theological tension within itself in an effort to define itself vis‐à‐vis others will be forced now to cross interreligious boundaries in order to reappropriate such tensions.
         64This generation of theological insight from tensions spanning religious boundaries is precisely the aim of the defamiliarization procedure outlined above. Defamiliarization thus functions as an antidote to the tendency toward hyperdefinition that results from a situation of radical pluralism.<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur gets the relation of critique and reason right, in Bourgeois’s eyes, as a philosopher who sees imagination tied to thinking at the boundary (not limit) of reason. In a chapter examining Derrida’s views on “sign, time, and trace” (chap. 7), Bourgeois elaborates Derrida’s view that Edmund Husserl’s distinction between meaningful expression and sign depends on a stable borderline between primary and secondary memory (or retention and recollection) in his theory of “the living present” (or duration), which, Derrida asserts, is phenomenologically unavailable. In light of this analysis, Bourgeois draws an interesting contrast between Derrida’s insistence on a discrete closure of meaning and Ricoeur’s theory of language and imagination based in a view of the living present of meaning and experience that refuses such discrete closure. Once more, however, Bourgeois overreaches when he attempts to identify these accurately drawn contrasts with the limit/boundary distinction. In Bourgeois’s reading of Ricoeur, imagination does not produce reason from below (as in Heidegger); rather, “reason itself limits knowledge to experience from above, putting the imagination in a central position both in knowledge and thinking” (p. 131). A productive imagination of living metaphor takes place at the boundary of reason, allowing the living present in meaning and action to escape deconstruction’s critique while still incorporating a positive relation to alterity. Nevertheless, Bourgeois may be drawing the wrong conclusion about these contrasts, for it seems possible to read both Ricoeur and Derrida as seeking to work at the boundary (not limit) of reason and to think somehow the presentation of the Idea in the Kantian sense. Whereas Ricoeur’s theory of metaphor and narrative allows him to present the semantic content of the Ideas of Reason positively, these remain for Derrida (as for Kant) unrepresentable, or “the impossible.” This problem has been Derrida’s enduring concern since h~<br>

Abstract: There is nothing particularly new or different about the politics Haraway articulates if one compares it to the strategies of the New Left in the sixties, to different versions of French poststructuralist theory, or to some versions of postcolonial theory in their postmodern, discursive guise. As Michael Ryan suggests, the New Left’s strength was precisely its diversity and diffuse nature. He argues that the binarism posited between a unified, authoritative, effective politics and ineffective anarchy is simplistic: “It is possible to combine a sense of commonality amid diversity, firmness of resistance, and aggressivity of attack with a plurality of different struggles” (
         1982, 216). Similarly, Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe’s (1985, 167–71) ideas of resistance are based on radical pluralism, the blurring of frontiers, and the unsutured character of the social. For Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari (1983, 76), the schizophrenic (like the cyborg) ruptures wholeness and puts disjunctions to affirmative use: “He is and remains in disjunction.” Deleuze and Guattari’s later concepts, such as rhizomatic thought and nomadism, are similar attempts to name disruptive ontologies. Finally, Haraway’s politics has much in common with Homi Bhabha’s (1994, 11, 207–9) valorization of interstitial and border spaces as sites for solidarity, and with his celebration of hybridity as a metaphor for postcolonial writing, colonial discourse, and colonized identities.9<br>

Abstract: Ibid., 83. For Tesauro, the metaphor of the saint as shield is of great relevance. If in
            SympathyMaurice and the shroud are the shields of the Catholic Savoy family, inEdipo(Oedipus, 1661), Tesauro’s interpretation of Seneca’s tragedy, Oedipus is the shield that prevents the divinity from exerting his power of purification. In Tesauro’s tragedy, Oedipus holds a long monologue on the “voracious plague” that afflicts the city of Thebes. A praetor replies to the Oedipus that the heavens are merciful because “they oppose your [Oedipus’s] virtue like a shield against their own furor.” See Emanuele Tesauro,Edipo, ed. Carlo Ossola (Venice: Marsilio, 1987), 1.1, verse 4, 79, and verses 47–48, 80. We could thus say that, for Tesauro, Maurice is a sort of anti‐Oedipus who has made himself into a lucid mirror of the shroud (the shield reflecting divine will). The saint’s body is a transparent surface reflecting and “actualizing” the “symbol” of the shroud. By contrast, Oedipus’s ignorance of his sins is a darkened, blind shield that prevents the divinity from shining through.<br>

Abstract: Could perhaps my “Goethe‐Schiller” site have acquired some collective significance, at least as a sign or a name, since it utilizes a public historic monument and a monumental metaphor? Theoretically this is not impossible, although it is most unlikely, even as I make it public with this text. It may be borrowed, but it is too idiosyncratic, too ironic, too much a parody of conflated layers of historical memory from different national contexts to be turned successfully into a shared historical site and memory. This, of course, poses the question of the relationship between the personal and the collective.<br>

Abstract: This religious capability for moral narration also finds hermeneutical resources in the feminist theological ethics of Sallie McFague. McFague’s “metaphorical theology” shows that the fight against violence and oppression in this world is inherently metaphorical, parabolic, storied—and hence a world‐transforming practice. For McFague, “metaphors shock, they bring unlikes together, they upset conventions, they involve tension, and they are implicitly revolutionary.”
         32Poetic language and “tension” not only name difference, according to McFague, but also introduce into moral relations a “liminal” dynamics that opens up harmful differences to radical restructuring.33The metaphor of God as Mother, for example, disrupts and challenges traditional patterns of patriarchy by opening up possible new human meaning and relations. The restructuring of moral society is not a flight from the poetics of metaphors—and, I would add, narratives—but rather their ever more radically inclusive refiguration. Indeed, McFague uses female imagery of God to reimagine the very inclusiveness of humanity in God’s image: “As theimago dei, we are called to mother, love, and befriend the world, both other human beings and the earth.”34<br>

Abstract: The significance of human relatedness to God as
         imago deiand the extent of human access to divine power is made explicit in Moses’s second theophany. After being taught of “worlds without number” and shown the earth and all its inhabitants, Moses asks “why these things are so.” God answers: “this is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.”74With this reply, Smith rejected 1,500 years of Christian theological anthropology by making God ontologically related to creation. God is both defined as Father and glorified as God by the capacity and purpose to engender the divine life in humans. To Smith, “Father God” is not only a metaphor for expressing divine love, but is definitive of God and indicative of human possibility, even human capacity to receive the divine nature.<br>

Abstract: For the theory of models and qualifiers, see Ian T. Ramsey,
            Religious Language(London: Macmillan, 1957), esp. chap. 2. Theological qualification need not imply an attenuation of cognitive meaning as assumed by the positivist critics of theological language in the original “theology and falsification” debate. Rather, if the theory of models and qualifiers is understood in terms of a tension or interaction theory of metaphor, then the theological qualification described by Ramsey can be seen as a mechanism for the creation of meaning. For a critical, although appreciative, use of Ramsey’s theory, see Paul Ricoeur,Paul Ricoeur on Biblical Hermeneutics, Semeia 4 (Missoula, MT: Scholars Press, 1975), 119–24; see also David Tracy,Blessed Rage for Order(Chicago, 1996), 121–23.<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Abstract: The chapter “Nobody's Weakness” closes with Arthur ruminating gloomily (and rather opaquely) about how “it might be better to flow away monotonously, like the river, and to compound for its insensibility to happiness with its insensibility to pain” (
            LD,p. 200). Though “flow away” seems at first only a metaphor, so abstract and disembodied is the reverie that there is a kind of phantasmal grammatical alternative trickling into the melancholic drift of the prose. In this way that second infinitive of compensation or complementation may also faintly evoke a sense that Arthur indeed wishes to mix materially with the lethal waters, literally (and more idiomatically) to “compound … with” them.<br>

Vidal notes the irony that this first International Congress of Filmologie took place simultaneously with the Cannes festival, where all the critics had gone. An additional irony came from the journal's compositor, who placed Vidal's article above a report on activities of several ciné‐clubs, graphically opposing two ways of approaching the same phenomenon.<br>

Abstract: Understanding the play of metaphor is therefore critical to understanding the last instructions. As Ricoeur might see it, the ritual actor has suspended his literal reference (the 9/11 hijackers are not really seventh‐century jihadists fighting Meccan polytheists) in order to allow a metaphorical reference (their motives are the same!) to emerge when he reads and follows the last instructions. At the same time, he had to preserve the ordinary vision (twenty‐first‐century hijacker) in tension with the figurative one (seventh‐century holy warrior) in order to grasp the ancient relevance of the contemporary situation. Based upon the repeated invocations of primordial battles and detailed ritual preparations (i.e., praying, purifying, blowing Quranic verses), it would appear to be the figurative vision that gave the ritual actors their motivating punch.<br>

Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: This vision of Judaism as opposed to paganism, as a no to the discourse of blood and soil is perhaps best expressed in a little essay also from 1961, “Heidegger, Gagarin, and Us.” Here Judaism emerges less as a positive tradition than as a rejection of other alternatives. Lévinas plays on the French anti-Semitism of the late nineteenth and twentieth century that linked Jews to cosmopolitanism, technology, and universalism in order to reclaim these qualities as a part of Judaism's mission in the world, a mission that calls into question loyalty to land. “One's implementation in a landscape, one's attachment to
         Place,” Lévinas writes, “is the very splitting of humanity into natives and strangers.”11Judaism's passivity and weakness are figured as the source of its importance, an importance that Lévinas uses the model of Gagarin's flight into space to symbolize. Gagarin's brief freedom from the earth is compared to what he refers to as Judaism's freedom with regard to place.12This little essay, which is transparently a response to some of Heidegger's postwar writings against technology, such as his 1950 essay “Das Ding,” focuses on the metaphor of rootlessness as a way to signal that Judaism offers an alternative message to Heideggerian nostalgia. It is this vision of Judaism that Blanchot clearly found so compelling, and it is a vision to which he will try to press Lévinas to remain loyal, a loyalty that for Blanchot entails revoking paradoxically an attachment to Judaism itself.<br>

Abstract: It is a truism to state that there are as many Augustines as there are interpreters or, in any case, schools of interpretation.
      
            His work could be called an1
         opera aperta, albeit in quite a different sense from the way this expression was meant by its inventor, Umberto Eco.
            Eco's use of this phrase mainly concerned modernist works, such as Joyce's2
         Ulysses, whose very structure allows the reader to find his way in the labyrinth of the artwork without ever arriving at—or, for that matter, departing from—one single, fixed level of meaning. The metaphor of theopera apertaopened up a peculiar combination of structure and randomness, the latter made even more mysterious by modernism's emphasis on austerity of form. While it cannot be denied that for Joyce the fact that every line and every word were meticulously planned and put in their proper place was the precondition for the emergence of riddles and clues, thus widening up the scope of language and meaning, for Augustine things seem to be quite different inasmuch as the flow and width of his discourse is in place right from the beginning. In his case, randomness seems to be part of the structure of the discourse itself, to the extent of beguiling Henri-Irénée Marrou—still the most prominent historian of Augustinian rhetoric—into accusing Augustine of a lack of rhetorical skills: “Saint Augustin compose mal.”
            Fortunately, Marrou retracted this accusation in a later edition of his book:3
         
            One wonders whether this new appreciation of Augustine's style, being part of aI took for incapacity or indifference what was in fact conscious discretion, calculated flexibility, expressive deformation, brought about by adroit maneuvering. I took for barbarism or decadence what was in fact the supreme sophistication of an art that was completely in control of its own techniques and in search of subtle effects.

Abstract: This tensional approach enables new possibilities for the field. As David Jasper recognizes, literature is no longer (to quote John Wesley) the “handmaid of piety” (5). Accordingly, the field is not limited to art and literature that are explicitly theological or religious, nor is it limited to literature and theology within the Christian traditions. Literature can now both instruct and deconstruct theology. For Jasper, theology is no longer tenable without literature. Invoking Emmanuel Lévinas as well as Ricoeur, Hass helps us to understand why: theology needs the apophatic power of metaphor to redescribe reality and to confront the other that cannot be reduced to any single discipline. Alana Vincent reminds us that this is not easy, nor is this work ever done, but this is what makes the work so valuable. Interdisciplinary inquiry confronts us with insurmountable uncertainties and ambiguities, but these challenges are constructive opportunities to reflect upon the limits of our knowledge, our boundaries, and our disciplines.<br>

Abstract: Like the first three chapters of Genesis, the story of Eve’s dream retains the power to surprise us on any given rereading by virtue of what it does not say. There is no mention of a voice, satanic or otherwise, and whatever Satan does here it involves treating Eve more as medical subject than as coy mistress. “Inspiring venom” might be read as a metaphor for “speaking evil words,” but the language of animal spirits in fact asks us to see something very different. Satan is inspiring Eve—literally pouring noxious matter into the porches of her ears. This attempt at material defilement has some causal relation to the dream voice as Eve articulates it the following morning, but in connection with what other catalysts we cannot say. We have no ground for asserting that Satan spoke, scripted, or serenaded. But such is the nature of Eve’s dream—always seducing us into making our own “additions strange” to Milton’s elliptical account.<br>

Abstract: The very centrality of its questions to literary studies may be the greatest handicap for
   Translating Investments.Words That Matter, especially in its recovery of grammatical theory, had more surprises page-for-page. Here the big ideas are perforce more familiar, the innovations more incremental. The reward, however, is a fine sense of metaphor as a cultural project across an especially broad range of terrain in early modern England. Anderson insists, and teaches us to insist, on the local, historical conditions of metaphor’s torpor and vitality, how writers thought about and went about killing and quickening the trope she calls “the scaffolding of human culture” (216).<br>

Abstract: The words of Pierre Reverdy may be recalled here: “L’image est une création pure de l’esprit…Plus les rapports des deux réalités rapprochées seront lointains et justes, plus l’image serait forte—plus elle aura de puissance émotive et de réalité poétique” (quoted in
            Henry 1971, 57). Concerning the way the links established by metaphor not only provide a form of conceptual explanation but synthesize a new representation of the world, Borges remarks: “No existe una esencial desemejanza entre la metáfora y lo que los profesores de la ciencia nombran la explicación de un fenómeno. Ambas son una vinculación tramada entre dos cosas distintas, a una de las cuales se la trasiega en la otra…[/]Su tumba son de Flandes las campañas / Y su epitafio la sangrienta luna[/] En frases como las anteriores, la realidad objetiva—esa objetividad supuesta que Berkeley negó y que Kant envió al destierro polar de un noúmeno inservible, reacio a cualquier adjetivación y ubicuamente ajeno—se contorsiona hasta plasmarse en una nueva realidad. Realidad tan asentada y brillante, que desplaza la inicial impresión que la engendró”(
                  Borges 2002, 114–15).<br>

Abstract: This paper seeks to bridge two aspects of Fronto's letters, erotics and rhetoric, by demonstrating that Fronto himself merges the two areas in his discourse with Marcus Aurelius about their relationship. Whereas some letters suggest an unequal relationship based on power, others encourage the identification of Fronto with Marcus. Fronto achieves this identification by structuring their relationship itself as a metaphor in which he and Marcus are equated and linked by epistolary bonds. I close by discussing why the epistolary genre in particular is an apt site for the merger of metaphor and love.<br>

Abstract: Walter Pater's theoretical "come-back" over the past forty years or so has been dominated by the competing claims of the new historicism and deconstruction, both of which discover prescient forerunners of their own, seemingly mutually exclusive, theoretical concerns in Pater's aesthetic criticism and in his historical novel Marius the Epicurean (1885). Yet despite their obvious differences, both critical approaches share one thing in common: the same post-humanist denigration of the trope of metaphor in favor of the seemingly more ethically responsive (because inclusive) trope of metonymy. In this essay I observe how the new historicism's and deconstruction's privilegings of metonymy as the prime trope of difference poses an immediate problem for ethical thought that, largely under the influence of Alain Badiou, has become increasingly cognizant of the need for a workable conception of sameness (or universality), traditionally supplied by metaphor. Accordingly, this close reading of the metaphorical dialectic of one of Pater's surprisingly underread Imaginary Portraits, "Sebastian van Storck" (1887), explores the basic charge against metaphor-namely, that it is an essentially "theological" trope insofar as it invariably pre-posits the "identity" that it modestly claims to have merely discovered. Employing the central figure of Sebastian's idealism- equation-I venture that, once rethought as a relation not of identity but of equivalence, metaphor is capable of shouldering the rhetorical burden of similarity without relinquishing its ethical claim as a primary producer of new differences in the world and is, hence, deserving of a central place in a post-deconstructive ethics.<br>

Publisher: The University of California Press<br>
Issue: ncl.2012.67.issue-1<br>
Date: 6 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: This essay argues that Emily Dickinson’s poetry intervenes in the broad cultural assessment of epistemology provoked by the evolutionary debates of the 1860s. While scholars have begun to explore the thematic correspondences between Dickinson’s poetry and some aspects of this cultural conversation, this essay examines the ways in which her intervention occurs at the level of poetic form and is in fact profoundly dependent upon form. Specifically, it analyzes a set of her poems from the early 1860s through the early 1870s in which she uses the dual structure of metaphor to elicit a way of thinking about truth that is aligned with the empirical methods of research that were widely embraced in the mid nineteenth century; however, in the face of an increasingly contingent notion of truth, Dickinson’s way of thinking significantly revises cultural assumptions about what those methods might yield. The metaphors examined here amplify the distinctions between two material entities—lightning and fork, or sunset and lilac, for example—rather than merging them or leaping beyond them to stable, transcendent meaning. What Dickinson plays with is the possibility of a revised version of revelation or truth, one that is not only derived from the observation of material difference through the two parts of a metaphor, but that is more radically contingent on the perpetuity of such dual perception. Altogether, Dickinson’s metaphors are both critical and recuperative, as they contribute to the dismantling of fixed truth while embracing the limited revelations made possible by—
         onlymade possible by—sustained process.<br>

Author(s): Gross Daniel M.<br>
Abstract: Abstract: Vico's theory of metaphor is best understood as a monster in the tradition of classical rhetorical invention. It is the mutant offspring of metaphor characterized as "necessary" (an "ear" of com, for example) and metaphor characterized in terms of analogy. From the perspective of his method. Vico marries these apparently incompatible forms inherited from Aristotle and thereby identifies a third type of linguistic metaphor. I argue that the metaphor identifies a stipulatory definition taken out of context. In order to situate this claim, I outline Vico's genetic analysis and elaborate in general terms what metaphor and definition share. Most importantly. Vico insists that beings, actions, and events are linguistically identifiedin some particular diseursive context. Indeed, in many cases that context alone determines whether the expression can be called a definition or a metaphor. Like Cicero's ideal jurist, Vico's hero employs motivated words and realizes possibilities available to common sense. Henee Vico's theory of metaphor is both "constructivist"—language has the power to makes things—and "humartist"—it must do so in a form appropriate to history and culture. Vico's theory is consequently important to us because it challenges the proper/figurative distinction championed in the philosophy of language and adds a pragmatic dimension to contemporary views of metaphor at work in literary theory.<br>

Author(s): Newman Sara<br>
Abstract: In the
         Rhetoric, Aristotle identifies "bringing-before-the-eyes" as a capacity that is crucial to metaphors because it allows rhetors to actualize actions immediately before audiences, leading those audiences to insight. Because this description suggests that metaphors activate cognitive mechanisms on the part of their listeners, "bringing-before-the-eyes" has been considered a key element within Aristotle's theory and the nexus of that approach to metaphor and contemporary conceptual ones. Yet, no study has probed these claims to any degree. Accordingly, this paper examines Aristotle's references to "bringing-before-the-eyes" as well as to two associated concerns,energeia/actualization and sense perception. This examination demonstrates that "bringing-before-the-eyes" is not explicitly cognitive but instead a perceptive capacity. In this, Aristotle's theory anticipates recent approaches to language because it allows the audience to participate in the persuasive process at a level that extends its role beyond the traditional Aristotelian understanding that it is the target of emotional appeals.<br>

Author(s): Schulman Robert<br>
Abstract: The metaphor of the teacher as expert is gaining saliency. This article reassesses the appropriateness of that metaphor through a theoretical and historical critique which points out that expertise has been used to buttress professional privilege and to widen the distance between those who know and those who do not. The article examines expertise as a general social phenomenon and then analyzes the appropriateness of the conception of the expert teacher. The author concludes that the metaphor is questionable because it diminishes the moral and social responsibilities of teachers and tends to turn students and the wider public into passive receivers of expert service.<br>

Abstract: Narrative structures are readily available in our culture and people automatically draw on them in most meaning-making activities. The research interview is one of many such activities. Narrative structures influence how informants remember their experience and subsequently tell researchers about it in an interview. Researchers also draw upon narrative structures because they hear and understand in narratives. Informal or implicit interpretation as opposed to explicit interpretation are discussed. The "iceberg" metaphor is used to describe the two kinds of interpretation. The tip of the iceberg is explicit interpretation, which is what researchers write in their research reports. The biggest part, however, is informal interpretation. It is out of sight and usually unexamined because it is built into the strategies researchers employ to make sense of data.<br>

Publisher: National Art Education Association<br>
Issue: i256677<br>
Date: 1 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Schwaller De Lubicz William<br>
Abstract: This paper follows two purposes: the first to unpack some of the artistic cargo of symbols as distinct from the more conventional aspects of them (e. g., their ability to refer to other things or events, and their ability to communicate ideas), and the second to show, by means of contrasts, the actual workings of Interpretation Theory as it could be applied to the analysis of art-making and art-viewing. For the first purpose, the author draws material from philosophy, dramatic writings, linguistic theory, and statements of artists in an analytic search for the often intractable character of the artistic image. For the second purpose, the author demonstrates, through the use of logic and the poetic metaphor, how a particular form of hermeneutic inquiry can be applied to assist an understanding of the assumptions upon which research is often built.<br>

Article Title: Metaphors in the Design Studio<br>
Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
Issue: i262169<br>
Date: 11 1, 1985<br>
Author(s): Ulmer David<br>
Abstract: The study of metaphor provides valuable insights into the workings of thought and understanding. This article addresses the important question of what the study of metaphor has to say about the design process and design teaching. We include the findings of a series of studies involving architectural design students who were asked to report on their own design experience and that of colleagues in the context of specific projects. Our conclusions are that (1) there is a close relationship between design and metaphor that provides insights into effective design education; (2) metaphor operates through privilege, directing concern and the identification of difference; and (3) design involves the generation of action within a collaborative environment in which there is the free play of enabling metaphors.<br>

Article Title: Mythophiles' Dyscrasia: A Comprehensive Definition of Myth<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263722<br>
Date: 12 1, 1977<br>
Author(s): Zahan William G.<br>
Abstract: The very definition of myth is problematic today; here narrow, partial, "monomythic" definitions are rejected in favor of a complex, inclusive one, the seventeen items of which are then discussed. A mythological corpus consists of a network of myths, which are culturally-important imaginal stories conveying, by means of metaphor and symbol, graphic imagery, and emotional conviction and participation, the primal, foundational accounts of the real, experienced world, and humankind's roles and relative statuses within it. Mythologies may convey the political and moral values of a culture, and provide systems of interpreting individual experience within a universal perspective, which may include the intervention of suprahuman entities, as well as aspects of the natural and cultural orders. Myths may be enacted or reflected in rituals, ceremonies, and dramas, or provide materials for secondary elaborations. Only a polyphasic definition will provide appreciation of their manifold roles within a society.<br>

Abstract: J. Hillis Miller, using a metaphor reminiscent of Kayser's, quoted earlier,

vented personality who is often granted within the looking glass world of the novel
certain unique powers, powers of ubiquity in space and time, powers of direct
access to other minds" (1968: 2-3).

Author(s): Yizhar Tamar<br>
Abstract: How is metaphor possible? How is it interpreted? What is the place of the phenomenon of metaphor in a theory of meaning and in semantics? The following assumptions guide this study: (1) There is a semantics of metaphor; (2) metaphors are governed by rules that, in turn, govern the process of accepting and interpreting metaphorical utterances; (3) one theory should be able to deal with three kinds of metaphors-poetic metaphors, dead metaphors, and ordinary-discourse metaphors which are not completely dead, frozen, inventive, or innovative; (4) metaphors have a logical-semantic basis; (5) all modularities of language should be taken into account (age, exposure, dialect, context, open textures of meanings, etc.); and (6) a theory of metaphor should yield criteria for evaluating the beauty and value of metaphors.<br>

Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i303097<br>
Date: 4 1, 1963<br>
Author(s): Wellek Chanita<br>
Abstract: This paper discusses the relationship between the Interaction theory of metaphor and Gestalt psychology. Interaction theory views the metaphor as a whole (gestalt), created by an interaction between its primary and secondary subjects. Moreover, this paper develops Interaction theory to require a full contextual analysis of the poetic metaphor embedded within its poetic text. We illustrate this Gestalt-Interaction approach by focusing on a particularly complex poetic text having multiple metaphors (Dylan Thomas's Sonnet VII, from his "Altarwise by Owl-Light" sequence). A representation employing primary semantic fields clarifies the underlying structure of the metaphor chain comprising the text.<br>

Article Title: Extended Metaphor in Automobile Fan Discourse<br>
Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i303122<br>
Date: 10 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): Yates Ingrid<br>
Abstract: This article investigates the use of extended metaphor in automobile fan discourse. It starts out with a definition of extended metaphor as literary, consciously sustained metaphor, and goes on to redefine it as consciously sustained but not exclusively literary; extended metaphor can also be found in consumer discourse. The article proceeds to describe the body of automobile fan discourse, its text types and communicative functions. Next, the article gives an overview of the most frequently used metaphorical concepts by which cars are represented. Particular attention is paid to those concepts that humanize or animate the car. Against this background, a text from the magazine Car & Driver that lobbies against safety legislation for sport utility vehicles is then analyzed. It is shown that the author skillfully employs two extended metaphors to argue his cause: CARS ARE CREATURES, THESE CREATURES ARE MALTREATED, and CONSUMER RIGHTS ACTIVISTS ARE MALTREATERS OF CARS. These concepts are sustained throughout the text through both lexical choices and grammatical patterns. It is shown that the metaphorical concept THE CAR IS HUMAN/ANIMATE is a powerful tool of the ideology of automobilism that is consciously drawn upon and reinforced in a specific text.<br>

Article Title: When Is Metaphor? The Idea of Understanding in Theories of Metaphor<br>
Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i303096<br>
Date: 12 1, 1982<br>
Author(s): Tourangeau Raymond W.<br>
Abstract: My purpose in this article is to describe how and why theories of metaphor vary in the ways they do. I argue that theories of metaphor differ precisely because they emphasize different temporal stages in the process of understanding metaphorical expressions. The different temporal points at which theories propose that a metaphor has been understood, ranging from the first milliseconds of processing to extended, reflective analysis, distinguish rival accounts of metaphor. In this respect, metaphor theories do not necessarily compete with one another, but can best be evaluated through an appreciation of the specific time-course that underlies metaphor understanding. My discussion reviews some of the major theoretical approaches to metaphor and reveals their (mostly implicit) assumptions about the time-course of interpretation. I suggest that most theories of metaphor draw unjustified conclusions about the entire time-course of metaphor understanding because of the particular temporal stage of understanding that each attempts to describe. Thinking about metaphor in terms of the time-course of comprehension should permit much of the theoretical pluralism presently seen in the multidisciplinary study of metaphor.<br>

Article Title: Metaphor: From Fixedness and Selection to Differentiation and Creation<br>
Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i303096<br>
Date: 12 1, 1985<br>
Author(s): Zinchenko Benny<br>
Abstract: By and large, most models of metaphor entertained in contemporary cognitive literature assume that metaphor is a relationship between two given entities whose attributes are defined prior to the relationship established between them. The metaphoric sense is produced through the selection of a subset of these attributes. In this paper I take issue with this view. My discussion is couched in the consideration of four basic cognitive assumptions: (1) the fixedness assumption, (2) the selectional assumption, (3) an assumption about the primacy of constituents over wholes, and (4) an assumption about meaning and interpretation. Against these assumptions I consider metaphors taken from literary texts, the semantics of non-metaphoric linguistic expressions, judgments of similarity, synesthesia, and patterns in both child development and the evolution of culture. An outline for an alternative view of metaphor is then presented, which is couched in the broader context of nonrepresentational psychology. In addition, the functional significance of metaphor is discussed and a pluralistic perspective on metaphor is proposed.<br>

Abstract: J. Martin and R. Harr&: "There is, however,
one role which metaphor performs and which simile, precisely by virtue of its grammatical
form, cannot. This is to supply a term where one is lacking in our vocabulary, the process
of catachresis. .... In the language of the linguists, catachresis is the activity of filling lexical
gaps. Simile cannot, for reasons of syntactic form, be easily used in catachresis. One may
say of the voluble guide 'He's just like Cicero used to be,' but the catachretical form will be
'He's a cicerone' " (1982: 101)<br>

Article Title: Dying between the Lines: Infinite Blindness in Lessing's "Laokoon" and Burke's "Enquiry"<br>
Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i303121<br>
Date: 7 1, 1984<br>
Author(s): Wellbery Adam<br>
Abstract: The essay studies the ways in which death-the word, the concept, and the friction between word and concept-informs aesthetic programs of Lessing and Burke. Both writers turn (and return often) to death as a kind of artistic touchstone and, in doing so, illustrate divergent schools of Enlightenment aesthetic thought. Lessing wants to define and maintain, if only conceptually and only pragmatically, the borders between spatial and temporal representation; Burke, to collapse the borders between space and time, if only imaginatively and momentarily. Lessing, in both the Laokoon and How the Ancients Represented Death, although nervous about the slipperiness of the word death, seems to embrace death's certainty; it is an end, the end, the limit to end all limits. Burke, on the other hand, treats death as "the king of terrors"; he opens himself, at least nominally, to the "obscurity" of death, to the possibility of the infinite. Beneath the surface, though, Burke is profoundly ambivalent about giving up finite, spatialized representation in favor of a potentially infinite temporal flow, and his treatment of Milton's "universe of death" is a fascinating study in this ambivalence. This essay closely studies the tropes-blindness, for instance-with which Lessing and Burke approach death and suggests that their strategies are at root more similar than may appear. Both find themselves in a linguistic predicament, and death becomes for both a metaphor for the strife between natural and arbitrary signs.<br>

Author(s): Westphal Merold<br>
Abstract: The first part of the essay explore's three features of Wolterstorff's account of God as a performer of speech acts: (1) the claim that God literally speaks, suggesting that this claim needs something like a Thomistic theory of analogy as an alternative to univocity and mere metaphor; (2) the claim that speaking is not reducible to revealing; and (3) the political implications of these claims, especially in relation to Habermasian theory. The second part focuses on the theory of double discourse, which seeks to make sense of the notion that God speaks to us through the human voices of prophets, apostles, and especially of Scripture, and seeks to show that a fuller account of the speech act by which God deputizes or appropriates human speech is needed. The final section suggests that Ricoeur and Derrida are not the threat to his theory that Wolterstorff takes them to be and that their emphasis on the text, rather than the author, makes sense in contexts where we have only the text to consult.<br>

Abstract: Children, who are composers of meaning rather than merely handlers of art materials, proceed by strategies of generative praxis that include fictive play and autobiography and involve judgment that is critically reflective and imagination that is productive. The view of things that leads an art teacher to believe that a child is making meaningful art is one in which a child's judgment is a sign, or even a criterion of thoughtful involvement. When this reflective judgment is manifested, you see that a child is guided by an inner critic of their work, and the claim that "Michael is making art" says it all. As I interpreted the long self-sustained efforts of children composing artist books, I became most aware of the way in which children's desire to represent their stories merged with drawing and a developing schema in the same way lived experience and metaphor interchange and generate each other. This interchange is the living ground of the inner critic in children's meaningful art.<br>

Abstract: En considérant la théâtralité moins comme l'essence du théâtre, lui-même haut lieu de la mimésis, que comme sa condition d'émergence, nous voulons mettre en évidence ce qui pourrait la révéler par-delà le texte et la scène: altérité, imprésentabilité, féminité. Bien que liée intimement au lieu et au jeu de la représentation, impliquant acteurs, spectateurs et décors, la théâtralité se présentera plus comme un lieu de créativité, un espace transitionnel où se joue (de) la vérité. On en en mesurera l'enjeu à travers une relecture intertextuelle de La naissance de la tragédie et de fragments posthumes de la même période, en interrogeant la légitimité d'un instinct théâtral qui serait l'une des formes essentielles du Kunsttrieb dont le destin est de procéder à une métaphorisation de « Dionysos agissant » et à une poétisation dévoilante de la vérité dont l'acteur deviendra finalement l'interprète en cela même qu'il en joue sur le mode de l'absence et qu'il ouvre un texte vers cet autre qui ne s'y présente jamais comme tel. Considering theatrality less as the essence of theatre, which is the high place for Mimesis, than the condition of its emergence, we would like to bring to force what could express it above text and performance: alterity, impresentability, feminity. Even if it seems closely related to place and acting of the representation, including the actors, the spectator and the setting, theatrality will prove to be a place for creativity, a transitional space in which truth can be performed. We will assess its stakes through a second intertextual reading of The Birth of Tragedy and of posthumous extracts from the same period; we can at the same time wonder over the legitimacy of a theatral instinct which would be one of the essential forms of the « Kunstriels »; its fate is to act as a metaphor of an « acting Dionysos » and to a revealing poetisation of truth for which the actor eventually turns out to be the interpret in so far as he plays on it on being absent ~<br>

Abstract: Cet article s'efforce de montrer comment le roman de John Barth LETTERS opère une réorientation radicale de la relation classique entre histoire et fiction. Glissant de la représentation incertaine du réel dans la fiction — et de l'Histoire dans l'histoire — à la notion plus productive du réel comme fiction, LETTERS utilise le discours de/et sur l'Histoire comme une métaphore de la fiction qui éclaire de façon précieuse le fonctionnement du récit. This essay attempts to show how John Barth's novel LETTERS radically reorients the classical relationship between history and fiction. Shifting from the uncertain representation of the real inside the fiction — and of History within the story — to the more productive notion of the real as a fiction, LETTERS uses the discourse of/and about History as a metaphor of fiction which sheds valuable light on the functioning of the narrative.<br>

Abstract: The work of literary structuralists, particularly Roland Barthes, provides sharper insights into ethnomethodology than symbolic interactionism, labeling theory, or phenomenology. Further, it suggests that the metaphor of text may be fruitful for analysts of everyday life. Greater theoretical benefits derive from that metaphor, however, if one applies it using the ideas of literary theorists outside the structuralist tradition.<br>

Publisher: Humboldt State University<br>

Author(s): Jacobs Anton K.<br>
Abstract: This essay suggests Friedrich Nietzsche has a contribution to make to the theoretical enterprise of social science. Contemporary theorizing, reflecting an increased attention to language, has been focusing on the dialogical mode of production and, of course, on hermeneutics. This has led to a renewal of interest in Friedrich Nietzsche. In this essay, two alternative models of the hermeneutic circle are examined: one arising out of the work of the school of Konstanz; the other associated primarily with the work of Juergen Habermas. The former presents a circular image of the "conversational" situation; the latter portrays a time schedule of the process based on the psychoanalytic process of therapy. Nietzsche's contributions are suggested to be significant, in the first model, in regard to the mode of production and, in the second, the stage of the quasi-naturalistic turn. Nietzsche's way to truth is through constant and relentless criticizing. In contrast to the rationalistic practices of Western philosophy, Nietzsche exercised an art of interpreting based on the use of metaphor and aphorism. This practice seems to reflect Nietzsche's concern to communicate truth in a world he saw as inherently ambiguous and dynamic, thus, rendering propositional truth impossible. Nietzsche radically challenges the rational foundations on which we stand. Thus he presents us with a mode of knowledge production that reclaims traditions lost to science. In addition, Nietzsche shows, by word and example, that his existential approach offers a way to see life as a text and source for quasi-naturalistic forays toward understanding. In this way Nietzsche shows that the traditional concept of knowledge is a pseudo-concept by revealing the intimate and inseparable connection between life and knowledge. Knowledge is rooted in life; it is a manifestation of concrete psychological and political realities. Consequently, it makes sense not to ignore life as a source for explanation when examining~<br>

Abstract: The aim of this essay is to define the nature of the metaphor in Berdiczewski's novel Miriam (1921). For this purpopse I examine the short story included in Miriam about the scholar who was studying a book entitled The Gate of Heaven. Comparing this story with other literary texts which present a hero who stands in a mystical or philosophical sense before the gate of Heaven illuminates the historic-generative essence of the above metaphor. Using the theoretical and methodological system developed by three scholars (P. Ricuer, D. Schon and B. Indurkyia) to follow the metaphorical process, I attempt to show that Berdiczewski's metaphors are not only figures of speech; they form our essential cultural and historical cognition (tolada in Hebrew). I therefore suggest applying to Berdiczewski's metaphor the form 'historic-generative metaphor.'<br>

Abstract: The paper examines the process of figurative reading in the presence of a marker (like / as), namely the unique cognitive impact caused by shaping figurative expressions as similes. The solution is sought through theoretical discussion and analysis of relevant excerpts from Hebrew poetry. Recently Bethlehem argued that a simile does not necessarily indicate the presence of resemblance of some sort; the simile only presents itself as such via its marker, like/as, but actually it can bear a variety of figurative relations, of which metaphoric relations are only one possible option. Consequently, simile has only coincidental relations with metaphor, if any (Bethlehem, 1996: 1997) First I address this criticism, trying to reinforce the widespread view that a simile is indeed a sub-type of metaphor, and that there is no fundamental difference between them, that is, comprehension processes in metaphor and simile are basically similar. Next I distinguish the simile from the literal comparison in a new comprehensive way. Finally I try to identify and study the special impression a figurative expression might create as a result of being shaped as a simile. Despite this basic sameness of simile and metaphor, the marker's presence in a simile has its unique cognitive effects, accumulating to a distinctive impact. I analyze the unique cognitive effects potentially evolved during the construction process of the simile's meaning. In this analysis this paper reexamines central issues pertaining to similes, their essence, and the cognitive processes they trigger in readers. Among these I focus on a problem never thoroughly explored so far: the essential nature of the coexistence of similarity and dissimilarity (without working against each other) in both metaphor and simile.<br>

Date: 7 1, 1993<br>
Author(s): Gordon Rae Beth<br>
Abstract: "La dérive d'une vie," that of the hero in En rade, is metaphorized by the dérive of narrative, composed of a complex network of metaphors. In 1893, Paul Souriau proposed that metaphor makes a fleeting representation pass into the unconscious. Dreams and hysteria, states in which the unconscious holds sway, are of considerable importance in this text. An analysis of the way that metaphor works will shed light on the relationships between dream and reality, and between consciousness and the unconscious in general. The double fil of extended metaphor is also metaphorized as a bifurcating road, the road of narrative and the labyrinthine path the hero's thoughts take. In fact, route or chemin is not only a metaphor for the text and for extended metaphor itself, but also for the complex pathways of the nerves and brain. If the road or path of narrative is also a representation of nerves/brain, then retracing these pathways of metaphors would be a way of following the text's attempt to dissect the brain and uncover the links between dream and reality, the double sphere of activity that characterizes this novel.<br>

Author(s): Grossman Kathryn M.<br>
Abstract: Set in the exiled poet's "marginal" home in the Channel Islands, Les Travailleurs de la mer (1866) elaborates a vision of creative potential. Science, dreams, meditation, natural forces, physical prowess, selfess devotion, even death—all serve as vehicles for expanding the boundaries of our universe, both internal and external. The protagonist, Gilliatt, avails himself of these multiple modes of transport to challenge our notion of the humanly—and inhumanly—possible. Transcending his own limits to conquer a wide array of "monsters," he links the motifs of movement and displacement in Hugo's hypertropic narrative to the transpositions of metaphor, the sublime, and political exile.<br>

Abstract: In the complex field of agricultural biotechnology, is there an approach that Christian ethicists can use to evaluate competing claims, multiple goods, and human rights issues in this important arena where humans and natures are intertwined? This paper is an attempt to apply Gibson Winter's three root metaphors (organic, mechanistic and artistic) as an ethical analysis that describes key socio-historical patterns in Western society and deciphers moral landscapes that undergird different forms of agricultural biotechnology. The paper also explores five key principles of the emerging "artistic" root metaphor that could guide more appropriate application and use of agricultural biotechnology.<br>

Abstract: In 'Anti-Latomus' (1521), Luther defined the concept of metaphor from a Christological viewpoint, thus touching upon the relationship between the word of God and the word of man, theology and aesthetics. In his later work 'Vom Abendmahl Christi. Bekenntnis' (1528) an eschatological frame of reference determines his interpretation of the words of institution as metaphorical but real speech.<br>

Abstract: While Christian theologians use the expression of a "center" of the Old Testament, Jewish texts employ the metaphor of the "white interspace" between the letters of the Hebrew bible. This Jewish hermeneutics accounts for polysemy and exegetical pluriformity, but at the same time — from the perspective of the oral Torah — strives for a halakhic reading of biblical texts.<br>

Author(s): Krause Cyprian<br>
Abstract: The Bacchae by Euripides can be read as a heuristic laboratory for the transfer between the Greek "tragic" and the Christian "metatragic", since Euripides distances himself from the unstilled myth of the tragic which consits of Dionysian versus Apollinian duality. What is being sought is a new metatragic hermeneutics, which can only be found in the Chalcedonian relationship between "undivided and unmixed representation", since it is only in a Christologically substantiated statement the wish is actually (and not only seemingly) fulfilled that "Dionysos speaks the language of Apollo, and Apollo, finally, the language of Dionysos" (Nietzsche). This new kind of metatragic hermeneutics, whose substructures are denoted as "mysterium" and "metaphor", is attained by the poetic reinterpretation of the death of "Pentheus", who now becomes a type of Christus Patiens.<br>

Abstract: The article replies to the polemic by Nicholas Onuf. It defends a particular conceptualisation of metaphor distinguishing between conceptual metaphors and metaphorical expressions and explaining why metaphors are unidirectional. Following this, performativity of speech is addressed. Then metaphors of European integration are discussed. Finally, the case for metaphorical analysis is put in terms of ontology, epistemology and methodology.<br>

Author(s): Woodward Gareth<br>
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to present the elements of a radical humanist critique which suggests that the discipline of organization theory has been imprisoned by its metaphors, and to stimulate an awareness through which it can begin to set itself free. The paper explores the relationship among paradigms, metaphors, and puzzle solving showing how organization theory and research is constructed upon a network of assumptions that are taken-for-granted. The metaphorical nature of theory and the implications of metaphor for theory construction are examined. A theoretical and methodological pluralism which allows the development of new perspectives for organizational analysis is suggested. While orthodoxy is based upon a few metaphors characteristic of the functionalist paradigm, metaphors characteristic of other paradigms, which challenge the ground assumptions of orthodoxy, are shown to have much to offer.<br>

Article Title: Text as action, action as text? Ricoeur, λογοσ and the affirmative search for meaning in the 'universe of discourse'<br>
Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24049943<br>
Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Scott-Baumann Alison<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur placed a great deal of importance upon text and the interpretation of text. Bell accepts this by virtue of his extended analysis of the story of Babel, and I hope to offer ways of extending and developing Bell's arguments to incorporate the ethical demands that Ricoeur placed upon text, upon our interpretation of text and upon action as a form of readable text. This will not include a commentary on discourse analysis, which I am not qualified to give. Ricoeur differed from the structuralist tradition in that he saw the relationship between language and life as taking a dialectical form: debate that presumes the possibility of altering one's position by grappling with different views, and often taking inspiration from Hegelian dialectics, with their contrasting polarized views and the eventual attempt at affirmative common ground. The term λογοσ (logos) was first used in a philosophical way by Heraclitus to give us the principle of order and knowledge, and yet for Heraclitus the world was dominated by conflict and change. Ricoeur studied this tension within logos between order and disorder, partly by his writing about language and his work on signs and symbols, partly through metaphor and narrative and also through his insights on translation. For him, all these are facets of the need for both Explaining and Understanding as forms of interpretation of language, ethics and action. Ricoeur's work on logos provides us with an approach that asks whether ethics controls language or vice versa or both and how this fits in with structuralism and later movements. For Ricoeur, signs (words, texts) are not the centres of our perceptual experience. At the heart of our perception are our motivations and our actions, for which we must take responsibility in a sort of provisional affirmation that we will keep trying. In so doing we must doubt (be suspicious of) our own motives just as much as those of others, and see action as a form of readable text.<br>

Issue: i24439308<br>

Author(s): ESS CHARLES<br>
Abstract: I expand the metaphor of computing as philosophical laboratory by exploring philosophical insights gleaned from examining computer-mediated communication (CMC) technologies in terms of the cultural values and communicative preferences they embed, as well as their interactions with the values and preferences that define diverse cultures in which the technologies are deployed. These empirically grounded data provide new insights for debates in philosophy of technology, notions of the self, and epistemology. This approach to utilizing data drawn from the cultural encounters facilitated by CMC technologies further suggests more ambitious ways of making philosophical use of CMC venues as a laboratory for testing and refining basic claims and hypotheses. The approach also uncovers other grounds that should encourage philosophers to become interdisciplinarians – not only for the sake of perhaps developing new sorts of insights and even forms of knowledge but also in order to shape and contribute to a global ethic and a Socratic education needed to sustain cultural diversity as CMC envelops the globe.<br>

Abstract: Quoted in M. H. Abrams, The Mirror and the Lamp: Romantic Theory and the Critical Tra-
dition (New York: Oxford University Press, 1953), 60. No less illustrative is the quote from Yeats
that Abrams chose as his book's epigraph: "it must go further still: that soul must become its own
betrayer, its own deliverer, the one activity, the mirror tum lamp." It is to be regretted that Richard
Rorty—the author of Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature—never pronounced about the preference
of Romanticists for the metaphor of the lamp to that of the mirror, for quite a lot depends on this.<br>

Abstract: In Colombia, society has come to be organized in terms of a division between those with and those without links to narcotrafficking. This moral boundary recently experienced a symbolic disturbance with the entrance on the country's cultural scene of Andrés López López, a former Colombian drug trafficker, and his El cartel de los sapos (2008). An examination of the discursive and political strategies employed in this book, in which drug trafficking is referred to through the metaphor "bacteria," allows us to understand the construction of a narrator who calls attention to the hypocrisy of the government and society regarding the reincorporation of narcotraffickers into civilian life while provoking a national debate on the difference between history and fiction. En Colombia, la sociedad ha llegado a organizarse en términos de una división entre aquellos que tienen y no vínculos con el narcotráfico. Este límite moral experimentó un reciente disturbio simbólico con la entrada de Andrés López López, un ex-narcotraficante colombiano, y su libro El cartel de los sapos (2008) en la escena cultural del país. Un análisis de las estrategias discursivas y políticas empleadas en este libro, en el que el tráfico de drogas se define a través de la metáfora de la "bacteria," nos permite entender la construcción de un narrador que devela la hipocresía gubernamental y social con respecto a la reincorporación de los narcotraficantes en la vida civil al mismo tiempo que provoca un debate nacional sobre la diferencia entre historia y ficción.<br>

Date: 1 1, 2006<br>

Abstract: It is common to represent the history of American psychiatry by comparing it to a pendulum. In this metaphorical rendering, psychiatry has swung back and forth between extremes of emphasis on psyche (life events and inner conflict ruling etiological thinking, talk therapy dominating treatment) and soma (biochemical sources dominating etiological thinking, somatic treatments dominating treatment). This article argues that, while this metaphor is suited to capturing certain aspects of American psychiatric history, it distorts others by, for example, exaggerating the extent of dogmatism on either side and obscuring continuities in psychiatry's history. The article looks specifically at the reception by psychoanalysts to the introduction of electroconvulsive therapy. It shows that psychoanalytic views of ECT were diverse and more receptive to ECT than the pendulum metaphor might lead us to believe.<br>

Abstract: This article examines Gadamer's claim that language is fundamentally metaphorical from the perspective of Ricoeur's complementary analysis of metaphor. I argue that Gadamer's claim can only be understood in relation to a broader understanding of metaphor in which metaphor is not regarded as secondary to literal meaning. From this context one is better able to understand the connection Gadamer makes between language and ontology, which is found in his statement "Being that can be understood is language."<br>

the comparison or simile theory of metaphor (the so called réduction théories) whereas diaphors
provide the basis for the interaction theory.<br>

universal history into four periods, associated with the tropes of metaphor, synecdoche,
metonymy, and irony (in Scienze Nuova (1744, third édition), par. 400-411), is the
apparent source of this peculiar categorial framework adopted by Kenneth Burke and
(altered) Northrop Frye. Hayden White claims these tropes are the 'transformational
system built into Foucault's conception of the succession of forms of the human sciences,
even though Foucault appears not to know that it is there.'! Cf. Hayden V. White, 'Foucault
Decoded: Notes from Underground', in History and Theory 12 (1973): 45. This judgment
may apply to Hayden White himself.<br>

Abstract: Dieser Aufsatz greift auf die Forschungen des Altgermanisten Friedrich Ohly zurück, der die Geisteswissenschaften durch eine metaphern-orientierte Forschung neu stimulieren wollte: Metaphern, so Friedrich Ohly, seien nicht Restbestände, sondern Grundbestände menschlichen Lebens. Besonders die religiöse Sprache komme nicht ohne Metaphern aus. So sei die Beziehung zwischen Gott und den Menschen allein metaphorisch zu versprachlichen. Im vorliegenden Beitrag wird der metaphern-orientierte Zugang von Friedrich Ohly auf die Metapher „Gotteskind“ bzw. „Gotteskindschaft“ angewendet. Näherhin analysiert der Beitrag die Prägekraft der Metapher „Gotteskind“ bzw. „Gotteskindschaft“ mit Blick auf die Taufliturgie und die Tauftheologie der Alten Kirche. Unabhängig von seinem biologischen Alter – so geben sich die Jesus-Anhänger von Anfang an überzeugt – wird der Christ jung in der Taufe und bleibt jung, wenn er seine Taufberufung in Treue bewahrt. So seien als Schlüsselgedanken des vorliegenden Aufsatzes hervorgehoben: erstens die Taufe als geistliche Geburt und Anfang der Kindwerdung; zweitens die metaphorische Rede von der Taufeucharistie als Milch, welche als lebenslängliche geistliche Speise für die Gotteskinder gilt (1 Petr 2,2). This article examines the research of Friedrich Ohly, a medievalist who sought to stimulate spiritual understanding through thought which explored the significance of metaphor. For him, metaphors were not merely the remains, but parts of the active inventory of human life. Religious language, in particular, could not do without them. The relationship between God and man could be articulated only by metaphoric means. In this article Ohly's approach is applied to the metaphor of 'God's Child', or 'Divine Filiation'. The article seeks to analyse the power of the impression of the metaphor itself with a view to the baptismal liturgy and baptismal theology of the ancient Church. From the very beginning Christians had been convinced that new believers be~<br>

Abstract: La métaphore kantienne du « grand jeu de la vie », dont nous sommes tous partie prenante en tant que nous sommes citoyens du monde, obligés d'affronter les quatre questions fondamentales : « Que puis-je savoir? Que dois-je faire? Que m'est-il permis d'espérer? » et : « Qu'est-ce que l'homme? » qui, d'après Kant, récapitulent les grands intérêts de la raison humaine dans une optique cosmopolitique, cette métaphore nous offre un excellent fil conducteur pour analyser les rapports complexes entre religion et raison philosophique. Contrairement à ce que prétend la vulgate contemporaine, nous n'avons pas encore fini d'explorer la « fonction méta » en ses quatre dimensions essentielles de la « trans-ascendance », de la « trans-descendance », de la « trans-passibilité » et de la « trans-possibilité » qui, même si elles trouvent une expression différente dans le champ religieux et dans le champ de la réflexion philosophique, donnent infiniment à penser à la religion comme à la philosophie. Kant's metaphor of the "big game of life", to which all humans partake insofar as they are citizens of the world confronted with the four fundamental questions: "What can I know?, What ought I do?, What may I hope for?" and, last but not least: "What is man?", which according to Kant summarize the major interests of Human reason in a cosmo-political perspective, offers an excellent thread for analyzing the complex relationships between Religion and Philosophy. As opposed to what many contemporary thinkers pretend, we have not yet finished pondering the "metafunction" in its fourfold dimensions: "trans-ascendance", "transdescendance", "trans-passibility" and "trans-possibility" which, although they find a different expressions in the religious field and in the field of philosophical thought, invites to rethink both religion and philosophy.

Abstract: In her interpretation of Freudian psychology Madelon Sprengnether conceives the figure of the spectral
mother as the recurrent metaphor of the presence of the absent, prompted by memory. The mother's body
becomes in his view the locus of desire and endless return; its loss the necessary step for ego formation: "The
mother's body becomes that which is longed for yet cannot be appropriated, a representative of both home
and not home, and hence, in Freud's terms, the site of the uncanny. As both origin and Other, the preoedipal
mother escapes the equally devastating effects of idealization and erasure, allowing for the possibility of maternal
discourse as well as a non-phallocentrically organised view of culture" (Sprengnether 1990, 9).<br>

Abstract: "Like a house's balcony, I overlook whatever I desire." At first glance, this line by the late Palestinian poet Mahmud Darwish may not seem to bear multiple or complex meanings. A daring attempt at interpretation, however, can show that this simple metaphor is capable of bearing and provoking various philosophical ideas. To achieve this end, the interpretation invites the ideas of several theorists of metaphor and imagery, including Bachelard, Derrida, Heidegger, Ricoeur, Nietzsche, and Deleuze, in approaching Darwish. «أطل كشرفة بيت، على ما أريد ». للوهلة الأولى، لا يبدو هذا السطر الشعري للشاعر الفلسطيني الراحل محمود درويش قابلاً لأن يحمل معاني متعددة أومعقدة. على أن محاولة أكثر جراة في التأويل قد تظهر أن تلك الاستعارة البسيطة قادرة على استفزاز أفكار فلسفية عديدة. ومن أجل الوصول إلى تلك الغاية، فإن التأويل الذي تقوم عليه هذه المقالة يستدعي أفكاراً لمنظرين متنوعين حول الاستعارة والصورة، بمن فيهم باشلار وهيديجر وريكور ونيتشه ودولوز .<br>

Author(s): Winograd William B.<br>
Abstract: This article draws on the philosophical concept of the hermeneutical circle to explore the cultural viewpoints that underlie the meanings expressed by consumers. Phenomenological interviews were conducted with adult female consumers. The interviews are interpreted first by the identification of an exemplary image or event that we describe as a symbolic metaphor. We show that these symbolic metaphors highlight key personal meanings that each participant ascribed to her consumer experiences. We then use a hermeneutic logic known as intertextual analysis to show that these personal meanings reflect more general cultural viewpoints that are implicitly conveyed in language. These intertextual interpretations offer insights into the sociocultural meanings that underlie skeptical, nostalgic, and pragmatic consumer orientations. A concluding discussion is given to key implications and areas for future research that follow from this hermeneutic approach.<br>

Article Title: The New Historicism of Stephen Greenblatt: On Poetics of Culture and the Interpretation of Shakespeare<br>
Publisher: Wesleyan University<br>
Issue: i342982<br>
Date: 10 1, 1952<br>
Author(s): Shakespeare Jan R.<br>
Abstract: This essay on the much acclaimed critic Stephen Greenblatt deals extensively with the New Historicism he developed and for which he coined the name "Poetics of Culture." Contrary to many older interpretive methods and schools that tend to see historical and literary texts as autonomous entities, Poetics of Culture seeks to reveal the relationship between texts and their sociohistorical contexts. Cultural Poetics assumes that texts not only document the social forces that inform and constitute history and society but also feature prominently in the social processes themselves which fashion both individual identity and the sociohistorical situation. By means of an economic metaphor, Greenblatt explains how texts and other symbolic goods, by circulating in a society via channels of negotiation and exchange, contribute to the distribution of social energy, by which he means the intensities of experience that give value and meaning to life and that are also indispensable to the construction of self-awareness and identity. The beating heart, as it were, of this whole process of circulation is identified as a dialectics of totalization and differentiation, as a powerful social force that oscillates between the extremes of sameness and otherness. In several books Greenblatt has elaborated the various aspects of this Poetics of Culture, such as the circulation of social energy, the dialectics of totalization and differentiation, and the process of self-fashioning. This essay discusses some problems of this interpretive method and argues, in comparing it to a more traditional hermeneutics, that social energy, self-fashioning, and the earlier mentioned dialectic are only phenomena in Greenblatt's interpretation of texts and are not actual parts of sociohistorical contexts. Poetics of Culture, in spite of its radical claims, is a genuine hermeneutics operating in a more or less traditional vein.<br>

Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i25501821<br>
Date: 1 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Emery Jacob<br>
Abstract: Andrey Bely's novel "Petersburg" (one of the high points of Russian literary modernism and a rough analogue to James Joyce's Ulysses) repeatedly claims that parent and child, being of the same flesh and blood, share an ambivalent identity. At the same time, because the novel opens by invoking a major character's genealogical relation to Adam, the book implies that this kin identity is universal and can be applied to the entire human race. This essay analyzes the role of kinship metaphor in "Petersburg", demonstrating that tropes of parent-child identity facilitate the novel's dizzying metaphoric conflation, that they form a kind of metafictional mirror in which the novel probes its own nature as a work of the imagination, and that Bely's theory and practice of metaphor touch on broader philosophical issues of figure and fictionality.<br>

Abstract: It is important to maintain the distinction between the experience of turmoil
and not getting tangled in it. The contemplative is not exempt from the experience
of inner turmoil (a term which necessarily covers a vast semantic field: from polit-
ical power struggles to gossip at table to interior trials) and, in fact, is often more
vulnerable to it. In his book, House of Wisdom (New York: Harper and Row,
1985), John S. Dunne expresses this through the metaphor of a storm: an impor-
tant leg of the spiritual journey is moving through the storm into its eye and then
Walking with this storm in order to remain in the still simplicity of its eye.<br>

Abstract: Theatricality remains only of ancillary importance to Montesquieu's larger points
on justice and self-interest, however, and it is removed from other topics in the Persian
Letters, despite the efforts of Hundert and Nelles to stretch the metaphor to its breaking
point. See E.J. Hundert and Paul Nelles, 'Liberty and Theatrical Space in Montesquieu's
Political Theory: The Poetics of Public Life in The Persian Letters', Political Theory, 17

Issue: i325476<br>

Author(s): Vidler Ken<br>
Abstract: I focus on Nietzsche's architectural metaphor of self-construction in arguing for the claim that postmodern readings of Nietzsche misunderstand his various attacks on dogmatic philosophy as paving the way for acceptance of a self characterized by fundamental disunity. Nietzsche's attack on essentialist dogmatic metaphysics is a call to engage in a purposive self-creation under a unifying will, a will that possesses the strength to reinterpret history as a pathway to "the problem that we are". Nietzsche agrees with the postmodernists that unity is not a pre-given, however he would disavow their rejection of unity as a goal. Where the postmodernists celebrate "the death of the subject" Nietzsche rejects this valorization of disunity as a form of Nihilism and prescribes the creation of a genuine unified subjectivity to those few capable of such a goal. Postmodernists are nearer Nietzsche's idea of the Last Man than his idea of the Overman.<br>

Article Title: The Metaphor as a Mediator Between Semantic and Analogic Modes of Thought [and Comments and Reply]<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: i327931<br>
Date: 3 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Crocker J. Christopher<br>
Abstract: Anthropologists have overlooked the importance of the metaphor in human culture. Core etaphors can help us identify ultimate cosmic constructs underlying a given social or religious world view. But, even more centrally, metaphors can serve as key data in our attempts to understand how a cultural system adapts to and incorporates sensated experience from the physical world. Metaphors thus provide both a "reality" principle and a "tool" for change. Their special status rests on the way in which a metaphor moves between two different types of thought (Fernandez, CA, 1974). A variety of comments which E. R. Leach and C. Levi-Strauss have made on this issue are summarized, and it is pointed out that both men have underestimated the possibilities for images to develop meaning at the level of affect and motor experience alone, without recourse to opposition or to categorical contrast. Along similar lines, it is argued that many authors mistakenly attempt to isolate metaphoric from metonymic thought. This is taken as a false problem, and the continuity of a process which uses both paradigm contrast and analogic continuity is seen as fundamental. The paper concludes by suggesting that the contemporary theological and anthropological approaches to metaphor are roughly complementary. It is hoped that they will come to interact. Fernandez's article is seen as a useful step in this direction.<br>

Publisher: Higher Education Press and Springer<br>
Issue: i27823295<br>

Author(s): Yiyu Liu<br>
Abstract: The essential significance of scientific metaphor lies in applying the general metaphorical theory to specific interpretations and elaborations of scientific theories to form a methodology of scientific explanation. It is a contextual grasp of objective reality. A given metaphorical context and its grasp of the essence of reality can only be valid when the context is continually restructured. Taking the context as a whole, the methodological characteristic of scientific metaphor lies in the unity of understanding and choice, experience and concepts, semantic structures and metaphorical domains, rationality and irrationality. As a form of thinking based on reasons, scientific metaphor plays an important role in invention, representation, explanation, evaluation, and communication. 𱆅𣎘𸕄𡥇𰍀𦐒𶄶𤡇𠁁𢌒𤅸𣕘𙥨𳌤𰍀𸕄𡥇𩜂𵝰𤈒𩦒𠄐𱆅𣎘𩜂𵝰𰍀𠡕𠌇𵊙𷌢 𡙄𵠨𦄦𠀓, 𰀁𧒒𤐘𥄄𙥨𱆁𱆅𣎘𵊙𷌢𰍀𦁁𧡡𵝰𤘅𤠙. 𣐧𦅙𣕅𣑘𵉦𣑔𢌒𰍀𙥨𱆁𵠡𢙙𡉰 𥈦𥕩, 𡒂𦍷𵠡𢙙𰍀𙦁𦀩𷌥𦔀, 𥅥𳀡𲑳𣑐𸕄𡥇𵠡𢙙𰍀𣎄𢌒𡑐𠡔𥈦𥕩𣑔𢌒𦐒𶄶𰍀 𦍷𥤨𤘕. 𱆅𣎘𸕄𡥇𰍀𦁁𧡡𵝰𩌅𤑉𴤠𩘖𠀦: 𩜂𵊙𙦂𶡳𥌡, 𲑣𹕤𙦂𧀐𤕥, 𵠡𠁁𲑧𦔀𙦂 𸕄𡥇𢒕, 𩜂𤘕𙦂𸝐𩜂𤘕𰍀𲑹𙥨. 𠌖𠀦𙥨𱆁𦍷𩜂𰀁𥔒𩜂𰍀𤘅𲔀𤐘𤌵, 𱆅𣎘𸕄𡥇𠡕𦍷 𡑗𦄦, 𴤠𤑉, 𵠨𦄦, 𵞀𠈕𡑐𠄲𧥩𱕡𦁁𸝔𰍀𷌥𵈁𡅑𳀡.<br>

Abstract: من مواقع متباينة وسياقات مختلفة وﺭﺅﻯ شتى، قدم ثلاثة من كبار مفكري القرن العشرين ثلاث محاضرات عن الجامعة: الأولى، محاضرة مارتن هيدجر (۱۸۸۹ـ۱۹۷٦)، وهي عبارة عن خطاب توليه رﺋﺎسة جامعة فرايبورج الألمانية عام ۱۹۳۳، وعنوانها ((التأكيد الذاتي للجامعة الألمانية)). والثانية، محاضرة جاك دريدا (۱۹۳۰ـ۲۰۰٤) بعنوان ((الجامعة بلا شروط))، وقد ألقاها في جامعة ستانفورد بكاليفورنيا عام ۱۹۹۸. والثالثة، محاضرة ٳدوارد سعيد (۱۹۳٥ـ۲۰۰۳) بعنوان ((عن الجامعة))، وقد ألقاها في الجامعة الأمريكية بالقاهرة عام ۱۹۹۹. تنطلق المحاضرات الثلاث جميعاً من أزمات تاريخية تلوح في الخلفية لتحفز أحلاماً بجامعة حديثة. وتعتمد المقالة تحليل مفهوم الجامعة، في المحاضرات الثلاث، بوصفه مفهوماً مجازياً . This article explores three lectures on the concept of the University given by three leading twentieth-century intellectuals from different perspectives and in a variety of contexts: Martin Heidegger's 1933 inaugural address as Rector of the German University of Freiburg "The Self-Assertion of the German University", Jacques Derrida's 1998 lecture "L'université sans condition" given at Stanford University, California, and Edward W. Said's 1999 lecture at the American University in Cairo "On the University". All three lectures emanated at critical historical junctures that necessitated re-envisioning the modern university. The author analyzes the concept of the university as metaphor in the three lectures.<br>

Publisher: Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland<br>
Issue: i330183<br>
Date: 3 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Ohnuki-Tierney Emiko<br>
Abstract: Most symbols are polytropic as well as polysemic in that their multiple meanings in various contexts functions as different types ot trope. This article pursues the complex nature of polytropes through a formulation of synecdoche as an interstitial trope between metaphor and metonymy, and demonstrates how the two conceptual principles of analogy and contiguity, that define metaphor and metonymy respectively, are interdependent and interpenetrated, rather than of basically different natures as presented in the biaxial image of structural linguistics. The analogic thought expressed in methaphor involves movement and temporality, just as does the discursive thought of metonymy. The interpenetration of the two modes of thought is demostrated through an analysis of the process of objectification of what, throughout history, has been a dominant symbol of self in Japanese culture: the monkey. As a polysemic and polytropic symbol, the monkey takes on different meanings, and functions as different tropic types, sequentially or simultaneously, as actors use and/or interpret the symbol in varying historical and social contexts.<br>

Publisher: Sage Publications<br>
Issue: i212608<br>
Date: 8 1, 1942<br>
Author(s): Pepper Chunglin<br>
Abstract: This paper considers some aspects of the early history of the American contribution to the International Biological Programme (IBP), ecology's only venture into 'Big Science'. It is argued that American ecologists were successful in obtaining generous funding for the IBP from the US Congress, thanks to a shared understanding of the way in which controlling nature was to be accomplished, expressed in the metaphor of the 'cybernetic machine'. To support this argument, a literary analysis is performed on Congressional documents, on scientific and popular books and papers by ecologists, and on writings of the environmental movement. The paper explores how a dominant representation of nature, or mentalité, is brought about, and its political effects.<br>

Author(s): SHORTLAND MICHAEL<br>
Abstract: Sigmund Freud's work continues to attract interest from philosophers, analysts and historians, and the earliest formulation of his theory of the unconscious and the 'seduction hypothesis' have recently received particular attention. While Freud's intellectual debt to such figures as Darwin, Nietzsche, Helmholtz and Brücke has been well documented, the influence of Heinrich Schliemann on him and his work is little known. The purpose of this paper is to explore the ways in which Schliemann's work helped Freud fashion himself as an 'archaeologist of the mind' and how, in the crucial year 1896, it enabled him to construct and present his new ideas. The paper also explores Freud's interest in collecting and suggests how and why Freud's debts to archaeology are not, as commonly thought, visible in the so-called 'archaeological metaphor of mind', but present in other areas of his life and writing.<br>

Publisher: University of Wisconsin Press<br>
Issue: i30154135<br>
Date: 12 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Statkiewicz Max<br>
Abstract: The article resituates Ricur's theory of métaphore vive in the contemporary context of the so-called "cognitive revolution." The latter denomination is highly misleading. There is nothing revolutionary about the cognitivist study of metaphor as a general pattern of thought; just like the discipline of rhetoric that was already on the decline in l8th century Europe, it is conservative in its validation of everyday, ideologically charged language as the model for all language, including that of poetry and art. Riceur’s conception of "live metaphor," on the other hand, does justice to the "revolutionary" character of poetic language, its function of breaking the order of "commonplaces we live by"—and are ruled by. A "poem in miniature," metaphor constitutes the model for any "poietic," creative imagination. Resulting from a clash, disturbing the common everyday language, live metaphor (and poetry in general) projects a world in such a way as to render strange and thus question the world we live in.<br>

Publisher: University of Wisconsin Press<br>
Issue: i30161639<br>
Date: 12 1, 1993<br>
Author(s): Wiegmann Reinhilde<br>
Abstract: Hugo Friedrich's use of mostly negative terms for the description of modern lyrics in Die Struktur der modernen Lyrik (1956) results to a large extent from a static concept of metaphor as substitution and from an implicit acceptance of the "given order of things." Though Friedrich asserts that this terminology is descriptive rather than pejorative, it impacts his interpretation of poetry. Based on Paul Ricoeur's Die lebendige Metapher(1986), this article reexamines one of Friedrich's examples, Rimbaud's "Marine." This poem provides in exemplary fashion a depiction of the metaphoric process of creative, poetic metaphors: transformation as a succession of destruction and production in the realm of land and sea. The tension and play between sameness and difference inherent in the metaphoric paradigm reveals in "Marine" a dynamic process rather than a stable order violated as Friedrich's concept of similarity suggests.<br>

Publisher: Northeastern Political Science Association<br>
Issue: i362393<br>
Date: 7 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): Somers Rudra<br>
Abstract: Since contending methodological perspectives and different types of research products are founded on irreconcilable philosophical assumptions, the sharp, recurrent debates over social science research methods are likely to be fruitless and counterproductive. This article begins by exposing some of the philosophical assumptions underlying the most recent calls for a unified social science methodology and seeks to help develop a common appreciation of how different kinds of methods and research products advance our understanding of different aspects of social life at different levels of abstraction. Such commonly posited dichotomies as deductivist/inductivist logic, quantitative/qualitative analysis, and nomothetic/idiographic research products are shown to obscure significant differences along a continuum of strategies through which context-bound information and analytic constructs are combined to produce interpretations of varying degrees of complexity or generality. Durkheim's conception of "organic solidarity" in a social "division of labor" serves as a useful metaphor here to capture the complementary roles performed by various research products as well as the trade-offs arising from the strengths and weaknesses of various methodological approaches (ranging from formal and statistical approaches to various case-based and interpretive approaches). Thus, sharp claims regarding the strengths and limitations of particular methods are transformed into elements of an overarching agnostic understanding of the trade-offs and complementarities among these methods. Finally, a distinctive role is identified for an ideal-typical "middle-range" comparative-historical approach in fostering greater communication among a more inclusively defined community of methodologically diverse social scientists.<br>

Article Title: Semantic Innovation: Arithmetical and Algebraic Metaphors within Narratives of Learning<br>
Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i277383<br>
Date: 10 1, 1980<br>
Author(s): Wilden Dave<br>
Abstract: This paper examines a theoretical perspective on the ways in which children progress in learning mathematics. It suggests that there is a difficulty in associating teaching discourses with the mathematics they locate. This can result in an incommensurability between alternative perspectives being offered. The paper resists attempts to privilege any particular account but rather demands an analysis of these discourses and their presuppositions. In developing these themes the paper invokes Ricoeur's analysis of time and narrative as an analytical approach to treating notions such as transition, development and progression in mathematical learning. His notion of semantic innovation is introduced. This embraces both the introduction of a new metaphor into a sentence or the creation of a new narrative which reorganises events into a new 'plot'. The notion is utilised in arguing that the shift in the student's mathematical development from arithmetic to first order linear equations with unknowns reconfigures the contextual parameters governing the understanding of these mathematical forms. It is also utilised in showing how alternative approaches to accounting for such transitions suit different and perhaps conflicting outcomes. For example, demonstrating awareness of generality or performing well in a diagnostic test featuring the solution of linear equations.<br>

Abstract: The natural science model has fostered fragmentation among the human sciences, leaving them ill-equipped to address matters of public policy which demand more holistic approaches. This paper proposes a science of political ethics which could encompass factual, normative, and value materials. Ricoeur's processes of guessing, explanation, and comprehension are used to develop a theory of interpretation for the new science. The work of art is used as the metaphor for interpreting societal processes.<br>

Abstract: Recent work on conventional metaphor together with reinterpretations of classic studies of "soul substance" and mana are examined to assess the dangers of overinterpretation--the attribution of nonexistent theologies and metaphysics--by ethnographers. In our project of cultural translation, are we prone to attribute deeper salience to other peoples' way of talk than they in fact imply?<br>

Author(s): van Gennep Paul M.<br>
Abstract: A distinction is drawn between theatricality and dramaturgy as modes for interpreting social and religious life. By means of theatricality scholars tend to analyze life as "theater," as "playacting" or "role-playing." Theater is viewed as a metaphor for what "actually" occurs in life. By contrast, dramaturgists interpret life as essentially dramatic in its interpersonal and collective aspects, whether the drama is significant or trivial, good or poor, "genuine" or "theatrical." But there are certain elements and conditions which must be present in order to increase the possibility of the deeper levels of drama. Religious, social and moral life do not routinely achieve these levels, but when it happens the participants and persons in the active audience can recognize the moment as extraordinary, perhaps as an event of awesome significance. It is within these moments that new religious and moral paradigms may arise. At such time role-playing and theatricality are eclipsed but do not totally disappear.<br>

Abstract: El objetivo del artículo es describir rasgos estructurales de la comprensión de metáforas mediante una comparación con la comprensión de otras culturas, tal como ésta ha sido comentada por Wittgenstein y Geertz. El fenómeno de estudio es la comprensión enfática (no básica) de metáforas fuertes (no de metáforas convencionales y muertas). La comparación entre ambos tipos de comprensión sirve para plantear y dar respuesta a tres preguntas desatendidas en la profusa literatura sobre la metáfora: 1) ¿En qué sentido nos sorprenden las metáforas fuertes? 2) ¿En qué sentido pueden ser profundas? 3) ¿En qué sentido hablamos de la riqueza de este fenómeno lingüístico? /// This paper sets out to describe the structural features of metaphor comprehension through a comparison with the process of understanding other cultures construed along the lines proposed by Wittgenstein and Geertz. The phenomenon under analysis is the emphatic (not basic) understanding of strong (not conventional or dead) metaphors. The comparison between understanding metaphors and cultures serves to raise and answer three questions that have been neglected in the vast literature on metaphors: 1) In which sense do strong metaphors surprise us? 2) In which sense can a metaphor be profound? 3) In which sense do we speak of the richness of this linguistic phenomenon?<br>

Abstract: Vico maintained that metaphor is a fundamental process of human mental life which bridges the gap between emotion and cognition. This Vichian perspective is reflected in areas of critical theory treating metaphor and other tropes, particularly their use in narrative. In psychology too, the significance of metaphor is increasingly recognized despite the Cartesian emphasis on literal thought and language in contemporary psychology's central paradigm, cognitive science. The paper compares the Cartesian and Vichian perspectives and suggests that the former limits the integrated treatment of cognition and emotion. This is illustrated with an example of how a child's feelings about a distressing situation are both revealed and changed in storytelling. The Vichian perspective is more appropriate to understanding this therapeutic interaction of cognition and emotion through metaphoric narrative play. This perspective has significant echoes in psychoanalytic and textual studies suggesting how sensitivity to the latent content of narrative metaphors offers both speaker and hearer a unique insight into the experience of the narrator.<br>

Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i40008393<br>

Author(s): Browne M. Neil<br>
Abstract: The doctrine of comparable worth is frequently denounced by economists as inefficient, unnecessary, unworkable, incredibly costly, and replete with unfortunate consequences for the same low-wage workers it alleges to be helping. This paper attempts to identify an explanation for both the vigor and content of economists' common antipathy toward comparable worth. The methodology of the paper is taken from Donald McCloskey's recent The Rhetoric of Economics and Feyerabend's epistemology of conversation. A content analysis of economists' criticisms of comparable worth reveals a much different methodology from that deified in the beginning chapters of Principles of Economics texts. Facts and empirical validation are not the primary bases responsible for their conclusions. The theoretical and empirical support for current relative wages is not solid enough to explain either the nearunanimity of economists' arguments or their vitriolic tone. This paper analyzes the fundamental role played by metaphor in guiding economists' analysis of comparable worth. Metaphor is treated in this paper as a pre-rational image that, much like Kuhn's paradigms, provides insight and establishes blind spots.<br>

Author(s): Fink-Jensen Kirsten<br>
Abstract: In this paper Kirsten Fink-Jensen suggests how a phenomenological-hermeneutic perspective can contribute to the knowledge of learning and teaching processes in music education in school The philosophical frame is Danish philosophy of life, represented by Knud Ejler Løgstrup, and Merleau-Ponty's philosophy of body, both pointing to the wholeness of mind and body in all kinds of actions. Within this framework interpretation is an epistemological, practical-hermeneutic activity based on different analytical methods. Phenomenologically, experiences of music are constituted in an intertwinement of personal, cultural, and local meaning. The challenge facing the teacher is then to understand what becomes meaningful to persons in a given situation. 'Bodily dialogue' is a metaphor of a hermeneutic process of understanding that highlights the importance of bodily aspects in the teacher's answer to a child's musical attuned articulations. This focus can facilitate children's learning processes and change and qualify the teacher's didactic reflections on the impact and progression of music lessons.<br>

Author(s): Renaud Michel<br>
Abstract: Este estudo dedica-se à teoria da verdade tal como se apresenta nas obras de Ricoeur entre 1947 e 1960. Procura-se sublinhar o vaivém entre uma compreensão ontológica da verdade, marcada antes de mais pelo pensamento de Karl Jaspers (1947), e uma compreensão fenomenológica da verdade centrada na teoria do juízo (1960). Contudo a análise da tensão entre a unidade do verdadeiro e a multiplicidade das filosofias permite elaborar o conceito de verdade como comunicação e de verdade como objecto de esperança. Procura-se então mostrar o fundamento desta esperança bem como a dimensão pela qual ela ultrapassa o universo da filsosofia. A conclusão sublinha que os desenvolvimentos ulteriores de Ricoeur (1960-1989) sobre a hermenêutica do símbolo, da metáfora e da narrativa ganham em serem relidos no horizonte das tensões do problema da verdade. /// Cette étude est consacrée à la théorie de la vérité telle qu'elle se présente dans l'oeuvre de Ricoeur entre 1947 et 1960. On cherche à souligner le va-et-vient entre une compréhension ontologique de la vérité initielement influencée par la pensée de Karl Jaspers 1947, et une compréhension phénoménologique de la vérité centrée sur la théorie du jugement (1960). L'analyse de la tension entre l'unité du vrai et la multiplicité des philosophies débouche cependant sur le concept de vérité comme communication et comme object d'espérence. On cherche alors à montrer le fondement de cette espérance ainsi que la dimension par laquelle elle dépasse l'univers de la philosophie. La conclusion souligne que les développements ultérieurs de Ricoeur (1960-1989) sur l'herméneutique du symbole, de la métaphore et du récit ont tout à gagner à être replacés et relus à l'horizon des tensions du problème de la vérité. /// This study pays special attention to the theory of truth elaborated in Ricoeur's work from 1947 to 1960.

Issue: i40014544<br>
Date: 4 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): King Roger J. H.<br>
Abstract: This essay presents a contextualist defense of the role of narrative and metaphor in the articulation of environmental ethical theories. Both the intelligibility and persuasiveness of ecocentric concepts and arguments presuppose that proponents of these ideas can connect with the narratives and metaphors guiding the expectations and interpretations of their audiences. Too often objectivist presuppositions prevent the full contextualization of environmental ethical arguments. The result is a disembodied environmental discourse with diminished influence on citizens and policy makers. This essay is a pragmatist call for more philosophical attention to locating speakers, audiences, and meanings in more intelligible "discursive spaces." © 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.<br>

Article Title: The Narrative Ethics of Leopold's Sand County Almanac<br>
Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
Issue: i40014552<br>
Date: 10 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Liszka James Jakób<br>
Abstract: Although philosophers often focus on the essays of Leopold's Sand County Almanac, especially "The Land Ethic," there is also a normative argument present in the stories that comprise most of the book. In fact the shack stories may be more persuasive, with a subtlety and complexity not available in his prose piece. This paper develops a narrative ethics methodology gleaned from rhetoric theory, and current interest in narrative ethics among literary theorists, in order to discern the normative underpinnings of the stories in Part 1. The narrative ethics approach sidesteps the need to ground the land ethic in ethical theory—which has been a reconstructive and problematic task for the philosophical interpreters of Leopold—and suggests, instead, that it emerges in Leopold's very effort to narrate his, professional, personal, and practical experience with nature. The involves examining the stories in terms of their emotional, logical and performative aspects. The result is an analysis that shows not only how these stories express normative claims, but also justify them. One conclusion of the analyses is that, in the narratives, there is less emphasis on the problematic notion of an over-arching "community" than in the prose pieces, and more emphasis on the metaphor of other living things as "fellow travelers" in the "odyssey of evolution." Second, the narratives take on an ironic attitude toward the ecological order, less discernable in the prose essays. The order itself may not be ethically admirable, but should be preserved since it makes possible any ethical relations within it. Thus, the narrative reading suggests some temperance to the usual holistic interpretation of his land ethic and its concomitant criticisms especially the charge of ecofacism. We should not take the land ethic imperative at its face value, in the sense that the good of the order itself is an intrinsic good. In the narratives, individuals are shown not merely to be means to the ecological whole,~<br>

Abstract: This essay analyzes the role of the "dead metaphor" within deconstruction and neopragmatism in an attempt to elucidate some of the surreptitious affinities between the two discursive formations that would constitute what Derrida has called a "pragrammatology (to come)." On the basis of a thorough metaphorological rereading of philosophical thought that extends from Vico, Nietzsche, and Heidegger to Blumenberg, Derrida and Rorty, this essay argues that deconstruction continues to generate new contexts of meaning and reference in the form of a pragmatism that has long been integral to its discursive identity. /// Este artigo analisa o papel da "metáfora morta" em meio à desconstrução e ao neopragmatismo em uma tentativa de esclarecer algumas das afinidades subreptícias entre as duas formações discursivas que viriam a constituir aquilo que Derrida chamou de "pragramatologia (a vir)". Por meio de uma revisão metaforológica do pensamento filosófico que parte de Vico, passando por Nietzsche e Heidegger até Blumenberg, Derrida e Rorty, este artigo defende que a desconstrução continua a gerar novos contextos de sentido e de referência sob a forma de um pragmatismo que integra já há muito a sua identidade discursiva.<br>

Abstract: The attempt to write extreme violence, or to reco[r]d[e] traumatic cultural memory - the representation of horror - tests both the representational capacity of language and the rationality of subjecthood. Much narrative endeavour is spent trying to narrativise or 'structure' horror into story. However, because traumatic memories resist the narrative framework of the novel, questions are posed not only about the reliability of the narrator's memory and his/her ability to narrate a credible story, but also about the suitability of the fictional form of the novel to represent historical events such as extreme violence. How does language in narrative, with its insistence on order and sequence, 'capture' the destructuring nature of violence? Where is the subject or the idea of rational subjectivity in these de-structuring acts of violence? I will attempt to address these issues through a critical 'reading' of Moses Isegawa's novels Abyssinian Chronicles (2000) and Snakepit (2004). In these novels, Isegawa recasts and reenacts a period of recent Ugandan history marked by violence and chaos, emanating from the dictatorship of Idi Amin. However, both novels stretch the limits of 'factual' or historical credulity, reminding the reader that they are in fact works of historical fabrication. I am of the view that the narrative endeavour in these two novels is not only to record the chaotic events experienced during the years before and after the fall of Idi Amin, but to recode, through the tropes of language (symbol, imagery, and metaphor), the devastating effects of those years on the literary landscape of Uganda.<br>

Abstract: In this article, an overview is given of Ricœur's ontological thinking. Although Ricœur never dedicated a whole book to the theme of ontology, it is present in most of hisarticles. In his study on the will he approached ontology initially through a strictly phenomenological method. After his analysis of the symbols of evil, in which hermeneutics was used as a philosophical instrument, he discovered the importance of linguistics in philosophical questions. Consequently, his thinking underwent a linguistic turn and evolved into a phenomenological hermeneutics. Through his dealings with ontology, it became clear that ontology is influenced by hermeneutics as well. A firm and stable ontology seems no longer conceivable and should be exchanged for a hermeneutical ontology that articulates being within the horizon of language. In this respect, Ricœur develops the concept of metaphor through which the 'seeing as' leads to a 'being as'. Although Ricœur acknowledges the dynamic and contingent character of being, his thinking aims at adimension beyond historical dynamics. However, in trying to clarify the problems of ontology, he discovers that it is not possible to solve the aporias of being. Still, language offers him an alternative opportunity to develop an account of being, namely narrativity, in which being is expressed in respect to its dynamic character and with the awareness that we always try to get a view on the whole from within.<br>

Abstract: Cet article s'interroge sur le statut à la fois épistémologique et ontologique d'un passé qui « a été » et dont les individus comme les sociétés retiennent le souvenir, mais qui, comme le langage ordinaire l'exprime, « n'est plus » . Toute une tradition de réflexion sur la conservation du passé par la mémoire depuis Platon et Aristote a voulu ramener la mémoire à la métaphore de l'empreinte. En revanche, cet article tente de montrer que la mémoire à plusieurs dont dépend la connaissance historique n'est pas simplement assimilable à ce topos traditionnel. Ce qui caractérise la mémoire plurielle et publique qui alimente le travail de l'historien, c'est le statut privilégié du témoignage, la possibilité de confronter différents témoignages les uns aux autres, dont dépend la crédibilité du récit historique. C'est ainsi moins la problématique d'une ressemblance entre récit et événements racontés — problématique de la trace, héritée d'une tendance traditionnelle à identifier la mémoire avec l'empreinte — que la confrontation de témoignages dans leurs différents degrés de fiabilité qui nous fait assister à l'événement raconté. Cette réflexion sur le décalage entre mémoire et histoire ouvre, dans la deuxième partie de cet article, à une analyse approfondie de la temporalité propre au passé qui fait l'objet du souvenir et conduit à une confrontation avec privilège accordé, dans la synthèse des trois modes du temps, chez saint Augustin au présent et, chez Heidegger, au futur. De cette manière, l'article tente de rééquilibrer la synthèse des temps en lui restituant un autre rapport au passé, que l'on ne saurait atteindre à partir d'Augustin ou de Heidegger. Libérer l'histoire du paradigme de la trace, de la métaphore de la mémoire comme empreinte, revient précisément à la restitution de ce mode de temporalisation du passé jusqu'ici esquivé : cet autre rapport au passé vise, conjointement à la mise en évidence du témoignage propre au travail de l'historien, à souligner la dette~<br>

Abstract: La définition kantienne du Gewissen associe deux schèmes interprétatifs anciens, celui de la voix et celui du tribunal, pour produire une invention dont le présent article essaie de mesurer la portée en même temps qu'il fait de cette réélaboration critique un vecteur de lecture des interprétations contemporaines. De manière presque inaperçue, c'est-à-dire sous l'apparence d'un héritage passivement transmis, Kant nous lègue un des problèmes les plus difficiles pour la philosophie pratique, celui de conférer du sens à la conscience morale. The kantian definition of Gewissen establishes a link between two lines of interpretation, one which draws on the simile of voice and the other on the metaphor of court. Through discussions of contemporary commentators, this article shows that the kantian definition deeply transforms the notion of Gewissen. In very discrete manner, in the guise of inheritance, Kant bequeathes us one of the most difficult problem of moral philosophy that is how to give meaning to moral consciousness.<br>

Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to show that so-called conventional metaphors play a twofold role in discourse. We distinguish two sub-groups of so-called conventional metaphors (semi-denatured and denatured metaphors) depending on whether or not we still perceive the conceptual contrast generated when the conventional metaphor was a genuine metaphor. On the one hand, the choice of some sample of denatured conventional metaphor reflects the same about our ideology as what the choice of a literally used expression does, the original conceptual contrast is not retrievable. On the other hand, the use of a semi-denatured metaphor exploits the recognition of an ideological change, its use reflects the consolidation of the conceptual restructuring that took place when it was a metaphor. Semi-denatured metaphors show how reality and ideology have been in part constructed by the metaphorical use of language.<br>

Abstract: In thought as well as in imagery, two of Auden's poems, "Death's Echo" and "Danse Macabre," appear to draw on such diverse manifestations of the medieval cult of death as lyric poems of memento mon, dialogues between the "quick and the dead," and the macabre tradition in morality plays. Combining the concept of the verbal icon (Wimsatt) with the principles of the theory of metaphor, as summarized by Ricoeur in The Rule of Metaphor (1977), the paper studies a selection of medieval poems and those of Auden as complex macro-vehicles and contrasts the possible tenors they are carrying.<br>

Abstract: Even though the European Union has become an "ever closer union" in economic and political terms, the problem of the emotional deficit of the EU identity calls for solutions. Metaphor offers an untypical yet interesting mechanism of overcoming the alien aura of the EU. Taking into consideration the cognitive value of metaphors, Antony Judge, the EU expert, designed the dynamic system of metaphors to articulate the new European identity. At the same time, in the candidate countries the alternative discourses of European identity emerge. Polish press makes use of the emotional potential of metaphors. With the help of metaphors Polish pubic discourse grounds the claim of the rightful and necessary belonging of Poland to the European Union thus engaging in symbolic politics. Moreover, through metaphoric images the relations between Europe and the "Self" are critically or ironically assessed. In an ambiguous period of accession negotiations these metaphors empowered Polish public to create their own conceptions of what the European identity is.<br>

Article Title: Bild Dir Deine Meinung. Die metaphorische Konstruktion des Terrorismus in den Medien<br>
Publisher: Nomos Verlagsgesellschaft<br>

Author(s): Spencer Alexander<br>
Abstract: Dieser Artikel möchte eine konstruktivistische Herangehensweise zur Erforschung des Terrorismus illustrieren. Er will zeigen, wie bestimmte metaphorische Konstruktionen des »Terroristen« in den Medien bestimmte Gegenmaβnahmen ermöglichen. Basierend auf Ansätzen aus der kognitiven Linguistik führt der Beitrag eine Metaphernanalyse von Artikeln der Bild-Zeitung durch und arbeitet fünf verschiedene konzeptionelle Verständnisseheraus: »TERRORISMUS IST KRIEG«; »TERRORISMUS IST VERBRECHEN«; »TERRORISMUS IST UNZIVILISIERT UND BÖSE«; »TERRORISMUS IST EIN NATUREREIGNIS« und »TERRORISMUS IST KRANKHEIT«. Hierbei zeigt der Artikel, dass Metaphern nicht nur Realität beschreiben, sondern aktiv teilnehmen an der Konstruktion der Welt, wie wir sie sehen, über sie denken und letztendlich auf sie reagieren. Indem Metaphern Verständnisse von einem konzeptuellen Bereich wie Krieg auf andere Bereiche wie Terrorismus übertragen, lassen sie bestimmte Gegenmaβnahmen angemessen erscheinen, während sie andere Möglichkeiten der Entgegnung von vorneherein ausschlieβen. This article wants to illustrate a constructivist approach to the analysis of terrorism. It wants to show how particular metaphorical constructions of the »terrorist« in the media make certain counter-measures possible. Based on approaches in cognitive linguistics the article conducts a metaphor analysis of the Bild newspaper and illustrates five different conceptual understandings: Terrorism Is War; Terrorism Is Crime; Terrorism Is Uncivilised Evil; Terrorism Is Natural and Terrorism Is Disease. Thereby the article shows that metaphors do not only describe reality but they actively take part in the construction of the world as we see it, think of it and ultimately react to it. By projecting understandings from one conceptual area such as war to a different area such as terrorism, metaphors make certain counter measures appear appropriate while other means are placed outside of the options considered sensible.<br>

Author(s): Waistell Jeff<br>
Abstract: This study investigates how business leaders dynamically narrate their aspirational ethical leadership identities. In doing so, it furthers understanding of ethical leadership as a process situated in time and place. The analysis focuses on the discursive strategies used to narrate identity and ethics by ethnic Chinese business leaders in Indonesia after their conversion to Pentecostal-charismatic Christianity. By exploring the use of metaphor, our study shows how these business leaders discursively deconstruct their 'old' identities and construct their 'new' aspirational identities as ethical leaders. This leads to the following contributions. First, we show that ethical leadership is constructed in identity talk as the business leaders actively narrate aspirational identities. Second, the identity narratives of the business leaders suggest that ethical leadership is a context-bound and situated claim vis-à-vis unethical practice. Third, we propose a conceptual template, identifying processes of realisation and inspiration followed by significant shifts in understanding, for the study of aspirational ethical leadership.<br>

Author(s): Cadiot Pierre<br>
Abstract: Predicative Metaphor (e.g. Max is a lion) is commonly construed as a problem of conceptual rupture in a cognitive framework, even if many philosophers and semanticists have already criticized this view. This text aims at showing that, for explaining why such predications are usual, grammatical and, in some sense, coherent, we need a internally much more flexible conception both of lexical and grammatical (the predication) meanings. They should not be confused with an unique (categorial) dimension, but should integrate an open "motif" stratum, anticipating and mixing up all possible "thematic" instantiations of the meaning. This is both a linguistic and philosophical matter.<br>

Abstract: This paper considers how companies use their own mass communication media to create, with the aid of metaphors, a legitimizing image of their practices. The analysis is based on the example of two banks, both of which undertook massive staff and cost reductions between 2001 and 2003. Downsizing measures like theirs are often met with resistance if they conflict with the interests, values or worldviews of stakeholders. Companies approach this threat of resistance by building a linguistic façade of legitimacy that suggests conformity with prevailing ideas of good or correct managerial conduct. Our metaphor analysis, which covers all publicly accessible texts of the two banks' own mass communication, identifies nine metaphoric concepts, which we further condense into three persuasive meta concepts: concealing metaphor, euphemistic metaphor, and urgency and control metaphor each fulfil different persuasive functions and vary systematically according to the conditions surrounding the managerial practice.<br>

Abstract: Depuis le Sakuteiki (Notes sur l'arrangement des jardins, XIe siècle) jusqu'aux jardins de daïmyôs de l'époque d'Edo (1603-1867), le jardin japonais est empreint d'une tendance marquée à référer les formes de ses constituants à des sites et à des paysages modèles dénommés « sites de renom » (meisho). Ce système de référence est appelé mitate, ce qui signifie littéralement « instituer par le regard ». Cela se rapporte, d'une part, au principe de la métaphore, et, d'autre part, au dynamisme fondamental des localisations dans l'écoumène, tel que l'illustrent le couple topos/chôra dans le Timée et la distinction que fait Nishida entre logique d'identité du sujet et logique d'identité du prédicat. Fron the Sakuteiki (Notes on the making of gardens, XIth c.) to daimyos gardens of the Edo period (1603-1867), the Japanese gardens display a prominent tendency to refer its material forms to paradigmatic places and landscapes, called « places with a name » (meisho). This system of reference was called mitate, which literaly means « instituting by seeing ». It is here related, on the one hand, to the principle of metaphor, and on the other hand to the fundamental dynamics of place in the ecumene, as illustrated by the couple topos/chôra in the Timaios and by Nishida's dictinstion between a logic of the identity of the subject and a logic of the identity of the predicate (or logic of place).<br>

Abstract: Patočka summarized his conception of style in the essay „Umění a čas" [Art and Time] (1966), in which he observes style over historie periods and its increasing departure from a priori, metaphysically ascertained and universally valid meaning. In modern art, style is established by the freedom of the Creative act; its centre of gravity shifts to the level of „signifier". Patočka's essay „O minulém rázu umìění" [Concerning the Former Nature of Art] (written 1965) helped to clarify „aesthetic attitude". In this essay, he develops an interpretational duet: a critique of Hegel's metaphysical starting point, which distances itself from the experience of modern art, and an appraisal of Hegel's interpretation of time, which remains inspirational. In accordance with it, Patočka the phenomenologist considers art the place of „destructive creation", of vivifying revelation, whose source is in man. The next part of the article calls attention to a lecture by Paul Ricoeur „Vyprávění, metafora a teorie interpretace" [Narrative, Metaphor and the Theory of Interpretation] (1987), in which Ricoeur introduced a modern hermeneutic approach to literary studies. What is most relevant here is the concept of the „double reference". The first aspect of reference relates to empirical reality; the second to the „productive reference", which designs a world created by the literary work. Semantic innovation in the narration of a story has a parallel in the semantic innovation of the metaphor. In both cases there emerges „the new, the as yet unsaid, the inexpressible - in language".<br>

Author(s): Gavey Nicola<br>
Abstract: Academic interest in applications of rhetoric to social issues is undergoing a revival. This paper develops a rhetorical analysis of discourse generated by men who have been recently violent towards women. The texts have been drawn from transcribed interviews with 14 men who had recently begun or were about to attend stopping violence programmes. Each 90-minute interview prompted the men on their views towards women, violence and relationships. A range of rhetorical devices within the texts were identified and their effect was analysed. This paper focuses on five devices: reference ambiguity, axiom markers, metaphor, synecdoche and metonymy. The strategic effects of each device are discussed with close reference to sample passages from the transcripts. The paper explores how these rhetorical devices resource discourses of male dominance and entitlement to power, and how these in turn resource men in their violence towards women. Increased sensitivity to the nuanced effects of the rhetoric is seen to improve understanding of how men justify, camouflage and maintain positions of dominance within relationships with women.<br>

Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>

Author(s): Parks Ward<br>
Abstract: Defined as "an act of cognition that schematizes two semantic fields and simultaneously effects and denies their rapprochement," metaphor as it appears in Lycidas is subdivided into three types, quantitatively distinguished. Ornamental metaphor is the minimal unit, consisting of a single metaphoric equation. Structural metaphors operate over larger poetic blocks, typically the extended clause. Governing the entire poem, the Lycidas/King metaphor bridges the real and fictitious universes in a metaphoric act characteristic of the pastoral elegy genre. Cutting across this three-tiered classification scheme is another typology based on metaphoric conjunction among the semantic features Human/Non-Human and Abstract/Physical. Accompanying tables present the results of the analysis.<br>

Article Title: Metaphor and the Subversive Process of Virginia Woolf's Essays<br>
Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113394<br>
Date: 12 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): Bishop Edward L.<br>
Abstract: What distinguishes Woolf's prose is not her famous penchant for simile, but her constant use of the less ostentatious, though more radical, verb metaphor. Combining these figures in strings, in which the verbs are consistent but the implied nouns contradictory, Woolf deliberately unsettles the reader, forcing him or her to consider not only the tenuous relations between the word and the world, but the contingent nature of phenomenal reality itself. Thus the view of life as something at once "very shifting" and "very solid" (expressed in the diaries and dramatized in the novels), pervades the essays, captured in the paradoxical relation "it is and is not" that Paul Ricoeur claims lies at the heart of metaphor. A close study of a paradigmatic essay, "On Not Knowing Greek," and of manuscript drafts in New York and Sussex reveals that this tension between shifting and solid extends to the syntax, which manages to be both extravagant and firmly anchored, and to the developing structure of the essay as a whole, which traces a movement of mind (a strategy James Farrell defines as specifically "feminine"), remaining defiantly heuristic and resisting the inherent closure of the formal essay. Thus, like her novels, Woolf s reviews and essays engage us in the process of perception even while inviting us to explore critically the operations of language in that perception.<br>

Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113412<br>
Date: 10 1, 1992<br>
Author(s): Stampfl Barry<br>
Abstract: Narratology may be thought of as a complicated system of conceptual filters that enact a severe formalist reduction upon the corpus of what may be thought and said about storytelling. According to Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan, this reductiveness needs to be expanded in order to attend more to language. One way of answering to her reformist prescription is a turn to the study of linguistic surface structure organized as a meditation on the metaphor of the filter. For Seymour Chatman this metaphor designates a character through whom a narrator elects to tell a story. For Max Black, "filter" is a trope for metaphoric process. Examining these senses of the filter in Henry James's short story "The Beast in the Jungle" leads to emphasis upon negations and belief qualifiers. In James's story, both turn out to be invaded by the logic of Freudian negation, itself a type of intrapsychic filtration.<br>

Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113423<br>
Date: 7 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): van Alphen Ernst<br>
Abstract: The difference between literal and figurative language becomes evident by comparing the Dutch novel The Journey of the Customs Officer to Bentheim (1983) by Willem Brakman with Proust's Remembrance of Things Past. Certain passages in the Dutch novel can be read either as literal or as metaphorical descriptions. The reader having a reading attitude which activates that frame of "reality" which is strictly separated from the frame of reference called "fiction and representation" will read crucial passages in this novel figuratively. The reader for whom fiction and reality are inseparable and situated on the same ontological level will read them literally. Both reading attitudes, the modernist aqd postmodernist ones, are personified in the two main characters of the novel. This twofold reading implies a critique of Hrushovski's descriptive method for the analysis of metaphor which is used throughout this paper. If the position of frames of reference is undefined in his theory, in his interpretive practice it becomes clear that for him frames of reference are situated in the text. Yet The Journey's ambiguity as to whether one or two frames is applicable undermines this position. It is up to the reader to differentiate or not hierarchically between reality and fiction.<br>

Abstract: Metaphorics, the movement and process of metaphor, is distributed in Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man as modes generating meaning in each of the novel's five chapters. Each of these modes is linked with the specific "historical" matrix in which it originates, a site which determines the metaphor's structure, its function, and the stylistic effects it produces.<br>

Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113435<br>
Date: 4 1, 1996<br>
Author(s): Doherty Gerald<br>
Abstract: Textual "neurosis" and textual "psychosis" have their rhetorical source in two different performances of metaphor. The distinction between the two forms of mental disturbance is highlighted in sexual narratives like Lady Chatterley's Lover that juxtapose sexual trauma and erotic wish-fulfillment in a dramatically opposi-tional way. In that novel, neurosis is triggered by libidinal repression and takes the form of the disfiguring metaphor. Psychosis, by contrast, is triggered by the orgasm, and takes the form of the hallucinatory metaphor: it trades in fantasies of mastery, wholeness, and omnipotence.<br>

Author(s): Maloney J. Christopher<br>
Abstract: Metaphors are expressions in artificial, contrived, alien languages, and we understand metaphors by constructing translation schemes linking our natural, literal languages to these theoretically contrived metaphorical languages. The relation between a literal natural language and a metaphorical contrived language is like the relationship between a natively known language and a system of subsequently acquired languages etymologically emerging from that basic natural language. This model for understanding metaphorically contrived language is kin to the familiar model explaining how speakers of a language such as Latin may come to decipher a language like Spanish through projecting to Spanish what they know of Latin without the aid of a translation manual. A metaphor is, thus, seen as a sentence in a nonnatural language, itself derived from and at least partially translatable with the natural, literal language of the metaphor's author or audience. Les métaphores sont des expressions relevant de langues artificielles, construites, étrangères et nous les comprenons en construisant des schémas de traduction reliant notre langue naturelle littérale à ces langues métaphoriques théoriquement construites. La relation entre une langue naturelle littérale et une langue métaphorique construite est analogue à la relation entre une langue acquise primitivement et un système de langues apprises ensuite et qui dérivent étymologiquement de cette langue de base. Ce modèle, qui permet de comprendre un langage métaphorique construit, est apparenté au modèle familier expliquant comment les gens qui possèdent une langue telle que le latin arrivent à déchiffrer une langue telle que l'espagnol en projetant sur l'espagnol ce qu'ils savent du latin sans recourir à un dictionnaire. Une métaphore est donc considérée comme une phrase d'une langue non naturelle, dérivée elle-même de et au moins en partie traductible dans la langue naturelle littérale de l'auteur de la métaphore ou de ses lecteurs~<br>

Abstract: An elaboration and defense of the "interaction view of metaphor" introduced in the author's earlier study, "Metaphor" (1962). Special attention is paid to the explication of the metaphors used in the earlier account. The topics discussed include: selection of the "targets" of the theory; classification of metaphors; how metaphorical statements work; relations between metaphors and similes; metaphorical thought; criteria of recognition; the "creative" aspects of metaphors; the ontological status of metaphors. Metaphors are found to be more closely connected with background models than has previously been recognized. Elaboration et défense de la « conception interactive de la métaphore » présentée par l'auteur dans une étude antérieure Metaphor (1962). Une attention particulière est vouée à l'explication des exemples de métaphores utilisés dans la précédente étude. Les sujets discutés comprennent: sélection des buts de la théorie; classification des métaphores; comment fonctionnent les énoncés métaphoriques; relations entre-métaphores et termes voisins; pensée métaphorique; critères de reconnaissance; les aspects « créatifs » des métaphores; le statut ontologique des métaphores. Les métaphores apparaissent comme étant plus étroitement liées à des modèles sous-jacents qu'on ne l'avait précédemment soupçonné. Es handelt sich um eine Ausarbeitung und Verteidigung der «interaction view of metaphor», die der Autor schon in einer früheren Arbeit, Metaphor (1962), vertreten hat. Besondere Aufmerksamkeit wird der Erklärung von Metaphern geschenkt, die in der früheren Betrachtung verwendet worden sind. Unter den diskutierten Fragen finden wir: Auswahl der «Ziele» der Theorie; die Klassifikation der Metaphern; die Art des Funktionierens von metaphorischen Aussagen; die Beziehungen zwischen Metaphern und Vergleichen; das metaphorische Denken; Kriterien für den Entscheid, wann wir es mit einer Metapher zu tun haben; die «schöpferischen» Aspekte von Metaphern; der ontologische Sta~<br>

Abstract: Avec l'avènement récent des neurosciences cognitives, le problème corps-esprit passait du registre traditionnel de la réflexion philosophique au domaine factuel de l'investigation scientifique. Une possible réduction de la pensée à ses infrastructures cérébrales rencontre cependant des ècueils d'ordre épistémologique considérables. C'est dans l'aval de ces problèmes impliquant le nouveau dialogue des neurosciences avec les réalités cliniques que s'inscrit l'étude présentée. Dans ce contexte de discussion sont abordés les fondements théoriques des neurosciences contemporaines comme la mise en perspective des recherches sur le cerveau dans le discours actuel des sciences humaines. Tout en considérant l'importance heuristique des recherches conduites sur les instances neurocognitives et sur la matérialité tissulaire des intégrations psychophysiologiques, les travaux présentés tendent à montrer que les relations fonctionnelles tissées entre le cerveau et la pensée ne sauraient se déchiffrer sur la base théorique des seules herméneutiques réductives. Si le tissu nerveux implique dans ses vecteurs de causalité la manifestation potentielle de comportements adaptatifs progressivement plus complexes, le tissu cérébral n'implique pas directement dans ses virtualités fonctionnelles la manifestation de l'esprit. A cet égard, les travaux abordés soulignent au niveau de la réflexion critique comme sur le plan de l'analyse factuelle que l'émergence de la pensée n'enracine pas sa nécessité dans la complexité des connexions neuronales. Arguments et propos qui tendent à réviser les nouveaux paradigmes neurophilosophiques de la vie mentale intéressant le substantialisme de la conscience et la dimension logistique de l'esprit. Some metaphysical aspects concerned with the mind-body problem are approached in these theoretical studies involving the new neuronal materialism.

Abstract: The problem being dealt with in this paper is whether a text has only one legitimate meaning, or no meaning at all. The question becomes even more acute when the contexts of sender and receiver are different. Polysemy and ambiguity are well-known obstacles to communication on the level of the word. The necessity of a general semiotic theory is stressed, and explains the difference between denotation and connotation. The functionality of metaphor in biblical language points to the interpretive value of polyvalency. The impression of unlimited indeterminacy created by the recent emphasis on the active role of the reader, is in a sense misleading since author and reader function as a textual strategy. On the other hand, the actualization of the textual expression as the content of the text by applying the various codes and subcodes, implies a continuous interaction between intensional and extensional approaches. In this respect topics, thematics, ideological and world structures are operative. Since interpretation and application are not to be separated in a pragmatic context, as is the case with the text of the Bible, there inevitably remains the possibility of multiple interpretations due to the interpreting and applying of the text of the Bible in a concrete situation. Yet this interpretation and appropriation should always be done as comprehension of the text and in continuity with the tradition.<br>

Abstract: The effect of a metaphor is based on a shift in expectancy and cannot be established in advance. Various proposals on the meaning of παιδαγωγός are considered in the light of Paul's argumentative strategy in Galatians 3. In the light of this strategy it is evident that Paul uses this metaphor to indicate the temporary and captive nature of the situation under the law. As a persuasive strategy this metaphor provides the reader with an unexpected view on the function of the law, as well as their own position, urging them to return to 'his' gospel.<br>

Abstract: The use of metaphor, transposed from small to large units of speech is analogical to the structuralist transfer of the laws of language organisation from units of levels below the sentence to units of an order above or equal to the sentence. The metaphor can be defined as a word in counterdetermining context. The unconventional contextual use of the metaphoric term creates a tension which can be explained in terms of the interaction view of metaphor. The metaphor functions as a contextual filter which selects, emphasises, suppresses and organises features of the principal subject by implying statements about it that normally apply to the subsidiary subject. The contextualisation of a text can be defined as a text in counter-determining context. The tension between text and contemporary context or discourse is reminiscent of the tension between vehicle and frame in the metaphor. The contextualisation functions as contextual filter of the text which selects, emphasises, suppresses and organises features of the context or discourse by implying statements about it that normally apply to the text in its conventional or original context or discourse. As an activity, the metaphor, as well as the contextualisation has socio-political significance since it is determined by the discourse of the reader or contextualiser.<br>

Abstract: The explication of contextualisation in terms of metaphor theory facilitates the utilisation of procedures of literary analysis, the idea of the model reader of a text, as well as the social analysis of discourses for the explication of the contextualisation of a text. The explication of the interaction between text and reader, or contextualiser in terms of metaphor theory explains some of the complexities involved in reading or contextualising texts. In the metaphoric interaction between text and reader the activity of contextualisation functions as a contextual or situational filter which selects, emphasises, suppresses and organises features of the discourse of the reader, implying statements about it that normally apply to the text. As a text in counter-determining context, the text is retroactively determined by the discourse which selects, emphasises, suppresses and organises features of the text, implying statements about it that normally apply to the discourse or context.<br>

Abstract: Since the Kantian revolution, metaphysical knowledge has been articulated by influential theologians in the language of analogy. In accordance with this tradition, the metaphor found in Luke-Acts, that God does live in houses, but not houses built by men, is explored by studying it as a root metaphor. A root metaphor in the theological sense can be defined as the most basic assumption we can make about man's existence and experience. In this article John H Elliott's proposal that 'temple' and 'household' in Luke-Acts articulate a contrast in social institutions is debated. I wish to argue that this 'contrast' does not really articulate a shift in social institutions, but rather a broadening of an existing social institution as the result of a changed symbolic universe. This shift in symbolic universe is studied against the backdrop of a tendency to broaden the temple as a theological symbol which had already started and which intensified during the Second temple period. It is shown that the temple, its sacrificial offerings and purifying rituals, were closely associated with the household, its meals and purifying ceremonies. Jesus also advocated the broadening of the concept temple/household. His view is reportedly conveyed by Stephen, Peter, James, and Paul.<br>

Publisher: The University of Wisconsin Press<br>
Issue: i40132187<br>
Date: 10 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): Corner James<br>
Abstract: This essay is about the crisis of creativity and meaning in contemporary Western culture and how the use of modern landscape and architectural theory works to perpetuate an excessively "hard" or neutral world—a world in which culture can no longer figure or recollect itself. A brief critique of three predominant approaches toward contemporary theory is presented: positivism, the use of paradigms, and the Avant-Garde. In different ways, each approach derives from modern techno-scientific thinking and invariably seeks closure, certainty, and control. The built landscapes that result often suffer from an equally closed explicitude: a stifling immanence where all is exposed and nothing is left to imagination. The essay suggests an alternative strategy grounded in the tradition of hermeneutics. Here, theory is something ever-open, permitting a free association of ideas through the mechanics of situational interpretation and metaphor. Hermeneutics provides the basis for a landscape architectural theory that transcends pictorial image and historical style by critically engaging contemporary circumstance and tradition. The landscape itself is a hermeneutic medium and becomes the ground for such an endeavor, enabling the remembrance, renewal, and transformation of a cultural tradition. The author argues that a hermeneutic approach to the theory and practice of landscape architecture is a way of returning to our designed landscapes the powers of the everyday and the revelatory—the grounds of memory and hope.<br>

Publisher: Universitätsverlag WINTER GmbH<br>
Issue: i40138275<br>
Date: 1 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): de Marco Alessandra<br>
Abstract: The present paper investigates Don DeLillo's 1972 End Zone, arguing that football is a metaphor for war and that DeLillo's analysis of football and its culture effectively constitutes a critique of the war mentality undergirding American society. In this novel DeLillo meditates on the historical process that historian Michael S. Sherry calls the "militarization" (xi) of the USA and that, since the 1930s, turned the country into a military and economic superpower allowing a war mentality to enter deep into the grain of American culture. The essay will read DeLillo's focus on language against Nicholas Abraham and Maria Torok's psychoanalytical theories on demetaphorization as the linguistic counterpart of melancholia and against Herbert Marcuse's notion of functional language as a linguistic behavior that facilitates the annihilation of critical thinking. Both functional language and demetaphorization allow militarization to enforce its own discourse. Suffering from melancholia, the novel's protagonists fall prey to incorporation, a process whereby they disavow death as the product of war and, with it, pain, suffering, and destruction. As a result, the novel offers a cautionary tale about the consequences arising from an excessive exaltation of war as a means through which a nation seeks to affirm its "apotheosis" (End Zone 162).<br>

Author(s): Matolcsy Kálmán<br>
Abstract: H. P. Lovecraft's texts deal with the cosmos providing words and mechanisms beyond words, such as analogy. Tracing the relationship between analogy and the poetic metaphor in the Lovecraftian text the paper turns to Paul Ricoeur's notion of the living metaphor as the embodiment of tension providing secondary referentiality. The essay argues that the ontological nature of analogy and metaphor supplies an indirect strategy to move towards the beyond, to transfer the unknown to the realm of the known. In this process, by referring to what is interstitial, void-like, and monstrous, this metaphorically active, poetic, and "ecstatic" Lovecraftian text becomes a "monster" in its own right: the indescribable and unnamable overflow into the world of representation, creating the monster-text.<br>

Abstract: The idea/metaphor of the world as a text, essential to the so called linguistic turn of human and social sciences, has a long intellectual history which originates, from the very beginning of Christianity, in Saint Paul's assertion of the presence of a double sense (literal and spiritual) in the Old Testament. Starting from this point, the present paper sets out to describe the development and consolidation of the tradition of Biblical exegesis and hermeneutics which in the 20th century gave rise to a variety of schools and trends that in one way or another maintain the fundamental thesis that reality is a text that is to be deciphered. The article also highlights that the original Christian sources did generate two other lines of intellectual tradition: a more temperate exegetical tradition prevailing in the Catholic world, and furthermore the current Western cultural belief that world is like a book (a belief which kept the terms of the comparison separated and did not confuse them).<br>

Abstract: Using a Freudian metaphor reinterpreted by Jacques Lacan, this essay argues that rhetoric is returning to the humanities. That return manifests itself in partial returns through topoi, truncated returns via the figure, fuller returns in feminist criticism, and in varying degrees of success, but always with the playful seriousness that is rhetoric's trademark.<br>

Abstract: Après une période de recherches homilétiques marquées par le paradigme de la crise, l'actuelle synergie de travaux dynamiques sur la prédication laisse supposer que l'on aborde le temps de la construction d'un nouveau modèle. l'article s'inscrit dans ce mouvement et propose d'envisager la prédication comme conversation et comme reconnaissance: conversation initiatique d'abord, puis herméneutique, en particulier par un travail d'intertextualité et de partage des voix. La dernière partie dégage la notion de reconnaissance, élément fondamental, pour ne pas dire «sacramentel», de la réception homilétique. Enfin, pour provoquer le dialogue entre texte biblique et réflexion homilétique, l'argumentation s'appuie sur la trame du récit des pèlerins d'Emmaiis (Lc 24,13-33), récit-métaphore d'un processus homilétique renouvelé. After a period of homiletic research marked by the paradigm of crisis, todays dynamic synergy on the subject of preaching suggests the construction of a new model. Along this line, Graesslé's article envisages preaching as conversation and as acknowledgment : first comes initiatory conversation, than hermeneutics, particulary by the effort to relate texts and separate voices. The last part draws out the fundamental, if not «sacramental», element of acknowledgment in homiletic reception. The web of the story about the disciples on the road to Emmaus (Luke 24,13-33), a metaphor for a renewed process of homiletics, is taken to provoke dialogue between the biblical text and homiletic reflection.<br>

Abstract: Tout au long de son œuvre, Henri Bergson s'est penché sur le temps du vécu qu'il nomme «durée», une notion qu'il a, des années durant, cherché à cerner. Du point de vue de l'énonciation de sa pensée surgit une difficulté: comment mettre des mots sur une notion qui a pour caractéristique d'échapper aux schèmes de penser habituels, de se soustraire aux filets du logos ? Si, comme il le souligne, «[l] a pensée demeure incommensurable avec le langage», il se doit d'ouvrir une nouvelle voie pour formuler malgré tout sa pensée en faisant appel à des ressources langagières proprement inhabituelles, voire étrangères à la philosophie. Pour dire le temps, le philosophe se doit de briser les cadres de la pensée conceptuelle. Ainsi, l'emploi de la métaphore, habituellement ressource du langage poétique, devient sous la plume du philosophe français un outil privilégié du philosopher, transcendant les concepts pour atteindre qu'il nomme l'intuition de la durée immanente à chacun de nous. In all his writings, Henri Bergson sought to define worked the notion of time lived, which he called duration. In the enunciation of his thought, emerges a difficulty: how to put words to a notion which characteristically escapes habitual schemas of thought and logical traps? If, as he claims, «thought remains immeasurable by language», we need, nevertheless, a new way to formulate his thought by calling upon unusual or even un-philosophical linguistic resources. In order to speak of time, the philosopher must expand the framework of conceptual thought. Thus, the use of metaphor, normally a poetical resource, becomes in the writing of the French philosopher an excellent tool for philosophy, going beyond the concepts in order to reach what he calls the immanent intuition of duration which each one of us has.<br>

Abstract: Metaphor, Vibration and Form identifies a process that underlies all ritual enactments. Whether it is Joseph Campbell's analysis of the Hero's journey, Victor Turner's theoretical and experiential interest in symbols, or Charles Laughlin's cycle of meaning, there is at work a particular kind of behavioral transformation system. It begins with the mind and the meanings provided metaphorically for symbols, then proceeds to an intense focus on symbolic sequences in meditation or in ritual dramas, so that the metaphor is taken into the body as physical experience. From this physical "ownership" of the metaphor, the properties associated with it are encouraged, socially and ritually, to come to the surface and be enacted in the form of everyday behavior. Questions of symbolic appropriation, the redundancy of symbol, and professional responsibility are addressed in the concluding remarks.<br>

Abstract: Par sa notion de « lecture » et de « décréation », Simone Weil ébauche une philosophie critique en tant qu'analyse perceptive du réel que nos jugements font éclater, à tout instant, en une infinité de textes valorisés. Guidée par la méthode reflexive d'Alain et de Lagneau, elle dépasse la problématique phénoménologique des actes interprétatifs dans une herméneutique métaphysique. Le désir constitue alors le fondement de toute métaphorisation du réel à partir d'une conscience gestuelle où les signes, les symboles et les concepts préfigurent une transcendance absente, mais néanmoins réelle. Saisir, à la suite de Kant, cette contradiction en tout objet, c'est fonder la pratique perceptive sur le modèle christologique qui remplit par excellence la fonction d'une « métaphore réelle ». L'exigence proprement philosophique d'une telle synthèse permet de reconnaître une valeur originale à S. Weil dans le débat moderne autour de l'élaboration du signifié. Through her ideas of « lecture » and « décréation », Simone Weil sketches out a critical Philosophy as well as a perspective analysis of that which is real which our judgments, at every moment, split up into an endless number of valued texte. Guided by the reflexive method of Alain and of Lagneau, she goes beyond the phenomenological problematic of interpretative acts into a metaphysical hermeneutic. Desire then constitutes the foundation of every métaphorisation of the real starting with a consciousness in wich signs, symbols and concepts foreshadow an absent, but nevertheless real, transcendence. Taking hold of this contradiction in every object, following upon Kant, is to establish the perceptive practice on the christological model which fulfills belter than any other the function of a "real metaphor". The properly philosophical demand of such a synthesis allows us to recognize an original value in Simone Weil within the modern debate concerning the elaboration of that which is signified.<br>

Abstract: The conflict between formalist thinking and theories that view texts in their historical contexts serves as a starting point for the introduction of a cognitive view of literature. From this perspective language has full referential powers. The "referent" splits into two entities, however: things-in-themselves (in their material identity), which we cannot know, and things in their coded form, which are perceptually accessible. Readers' mnemonic potentials, a consequence of the bonding of perception and language, are adduced to show that texts originate in past interpretations of other texts and in personal experience and that consequently social forces and historical events are subsumed in the individual memory. In the cognitive light, memory becomes the ultimate metaphor, and the epistemological claim of realism regains its compelling force.<br>

Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219832<br>
Date: 5 1, 1972<br>
Author(s): Yellin Peter A.<br>
Abstract: In his Narrative (1845), Frederick Douglass constructs a self based on conversion rhetoric and binary logic. In the greatly expanded My Bondage and My Freedom (1855), he complicates this textual self by both imitating and criticizing tropes conventionally used in the slavery debate, such as metaphors related to animals. Christianity, and manhood. Emphasizing the constructed nature of mimesis and metaphor, Douglass demonstrates his ability to escape the bondage of reductionist language even as he claims the power associated with linguistic mastery. This revision of self emerges from his experience of northern racism, manifested in his limited role in William Lloyd Garrison's organization. Douglass's renunciation of Garrisonian dogma and his entry into political action-including his striking textual reinterpretation of the United States Constitution-coincide with the stylistically "modernist" self of the second autobiography.<br>

Author(s): Walens Michael<br>
Abstract: This paper outlines an approach to historical narratives that replaces the atomism of actor and event with a model that stresses the integration of event, narrative, and historical practice. The notion of contact as an event is addressed in the context of the Northwest Coast. A Heiltsuk English narrative dealing with contact is analyzed in the light of Heiltsuk cultural data. The analysis centers on Jakobson's distinction between metaphor and metonymy and leads to the conclusion that for the Heiltsuk, contact with Europeans resulted in the acquisition of a linear historicity. Finally, notions of temporality are examined with respect to historical practice and North American Indian cultures.<br>

Abstract: This study describes the symbolic process by which individuals attempted to realize, in organizational form, their variant interpretations of an extended metaphor - community mental health. Their metaphoric construals were embedded in everyday discourse and were initially unrecognized by participants at a community mental health center. The metaphoric process, that is, the movement involving the emergence, interpretation, and realization of these metaphors, was mediated by the self-images of the participants. They had embarked upon an innovative project to realize, in part, an ideal sense of self. The latter was a key factor in the development of new construals of community mental health and the implementation of these construals.<br>

Issue: e90016177<br>
Date: 11 1, 2017<br>
Author(s): Soto Ana María Riveros<br>
Abstract: This study presents an interpretation of the configuration of the poetic subject in the books of poems El Primer Libro (1985) and Albricia (1988) by Soledad Fariña (1943), which understand a self in a continuous process of gestation and birth. This process serves the purpose of recomposing a disarticulated subjectivity lost in the framework of the political and cultural conditions imposed by the military dictatorship that ruled Chile in the 1970s and 1980s. By using a metaphor of a journey and searching for a new language, the subject attempts to access a primitive stage andfind its maternal self in order to confront the dominant power, by codifying and configuring herself through an otherness in a feminine body-text. However, this process of maturation and discovery is intervened and left incomplete by the impulse of modernity, thereby creating a deformed, dissociated and off-centered self, which aims at growing opposed to logos. This conflict turns the upcoming of the new self into a painful event, like giving birth, that stems from the subject's wounded and fractured body, intending to re-establish de selffrom its fragments, traces and memories.<br>

Publisher: American Society for Public Administration<br>
Issue: i240081<br>

Author(s): Wolf Larry D.<br>
Abstract: Since the founding of this nation, the theater metaphor has had an influence on political discourse. Politicians often invoke the metaphor when they enact political dramas to construct themselves in the image of leader. An argument is presented that former President Ronald Reagan and his political strategists made extensive use of this strategy and were effective in portraying public administrators as evil villains. It is also argued that supporters of the administrative state relied on the theater metaphor as well. In an effort to counter Reagan's negative image of villain, supporters responded by portraying public administrators as heroes and innocent victims. This article suggests that the theater metaphor is problematic when viewed from the perspective of public administration theory and practice. The images of villain, hero and innocent victims emanating from the theater metaphor are troublesome and deserve scrutiny.<br>

Abstract: This article analyzes “Rotología del poroto” by Pablo de Rokha. Our contention states that the bean works as a multiple and complex metaphor, allowing the poetic voice to refer to the nation, the working-class subjects and the political project of the revolution. Each of these categories takes place in a production context marked by the presence of the hacienda and the Cold War scenario. Additionally, the article analyzes how the poem, at the time of enunciation by the speaker, builds a counterpoint between the Chile of yesterday and today to articulate a social protest speech in favor of the working-class subjects of the national community.<br>

Article Title: Poetry Is Theft<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: complitstudies.51.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: In an infamous 1927 article, “Contra el secreto profesional” (“Against Professional Secrets”), Peruvian poet César Vallejo uses a similar metaphor to criticize the “false and epidermic” pan–Latin Americanism of Mistral, as well as the modish cosmopolitanism of other
         vanguardistawriters (including Borges). Echoing Emile Zola's “J'accuse,” Vallejo writes, “Acuso, pues, a mi generación de continuar los mismos métodos de plagio y de retórica de las pasadas generaciones, de las que ella reniega” (“I accuse, then, my generation of continuing the very same methods of plagiarism and rhetoric used by the past generations that they repudiate”).
               In direct opposition to the academicized poetic formulas borrowed from European Surrealism, Vallejo advocates particular elements of the Romantic ethic (notions of inspiration, honesty, authenticity, emotion, and the human), yet without drawing on its aesthetic. Vallejo's own poetry grows in part from an investigation of the linguistic function of “I,” that stuttering, fragmented convergence of energies. His poetry is not subjective, per se—it is an investigation of the61
            possibilityof subjectivity. His poems are shaped by a concern with the plasticity of language and the process of writing, ludic maneuvers, and a mix of registers (colloquial speech, and Peruvianisms romp with arcane scientific vocabulary) as he fashions a poetic form that corresponds to his sense of the contemporary.<br>

Abstract: The body invents some immaterial entities or gestures to take the place of the material loss; they include consolation, hope, and love, sometimes even hallucinations and fantasies. The memory of the departed keeps alive the grief of their loss and so confers the present with meaning. For Jabbeh Wesley, therefore, to write poetry is to make sense of the dysfunctional world of Liberia. The grief in her works comes with memory, sauntering like ghosts. Indeed, the persistence of ghosts is a metaphor for the persistence of the memory of the dead and for the attendant grief. This is particularly true in the poem “Ghosts Don't Go Away Just Like That,” from
         Where the Road Turns.<br>

Abstract: Throughout this discussion I have attempted to pay attention to geographical, spatial meanings as the material basis in our discussion. This is especially true in any study of diasporas since they involve movement through space over land and seascapes. Diasporas define orientations within situations of transculturation. They emphasize the religious meaning evoked from the transhumance capability of the human mode of being. Sacrality is often understood through vertical metaphors, with the gods and divine beings above, the human below, and the earth below. Along with this vertical metaphor, diasporic orientations bring to the fore the horizontal dimension of sacrality and the role of distance and movement in the revelation of sacrality and knowledge.<br>

Article Title: The Plight of Ethics<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: When the concept of responsibility moves into philosophy proper in the nineteenth century, it is not as an ethical concept but, rather, as a political one, which again refers to principles of law and government, specifically punishment, or what John Stuart Mill calls “punishability” and what F. H. Bradley calls “accountability” (see McKeon
      1957, 6–7). Paul Ricoeur traces this slippage in the juridical concept of responsibility as attribution to that of retribution through the termaccount, which links imputation to responsibility.
            In Ricoeur's terms, responsibility as accountability suggests “the idea of a kind of moral bookkeeping of merits and demerits, as in a double-entry ledger: receipts and expenses, credits and debits,” wherein “the metaphor of a balance book seems to underlie” both being accountable for and giving an account, in the sense of recounting (2000, 14). In other words, in its juridical origins, responsibility is a matter of calculation and accounting on the scales of justice such that punishments are compensations or payments for crimes committed. Ricoeur points out that responsibility owes its associations with payment to the theological context that takes us back to Saint Paul's interpretation of the crucifixion of Christ as payment for original sin.4<br>

Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Critical theory is a metaphor for a certain kind of theoretical orientation which owes its origin to Kant, Hegel and Marx, its systematization to Horkheimer and his associates at the Institute for Social Research in Frankfurt, and its development to successors, particularly to a group led by Jürgen Habermas, who have sustained it under various renditions to the present day. As a term, critical theory is both general and specific. In general it refers to that critical element in German philosophy, which began with Hegel's critique of Kant. More specifically it is associated with a certain orientation toward philosophy, which found its twentieth-century expression in Frankfurt.

Abstract: The movement from
            thentonow, so far as ethics and philosophy of religion are concerned, can be largely told in relation to five proper names: Ricoeur, Levinas, Kierkegaard, Derrida, and Marion. Paul Ricoeur was already part ofthen, but as he kept writing, so broadly and so deeply, he became more and more an inescapable part of thenow. The problem is that he did this in so many different ways that he could easily take up all my time and space and then some. Not just in such collections asThinking BiblicallyandFiguring the Sacredbut whenever he wrote about virtually anything, be it time and narrative, memory, metaphor, interpretation, translation, ideology, evil, justice, the self (as other), recognition, or whatever, he provoked our thought about either ethics or religion or both. So, with gratitude and apologies, I'll leave him as the one who has shaped ournow, so far as ethics and religion are concerned, in more different but deep ways than anyone else. He is in any case more important for the first revolution than for the second.<br>

Abstract: In this work, I argue that creative metaphors are formed when some persistent problem, caused by an inadequacy in preexisting knowledge, descends into the collective unconscious, is reconfigured unconsciously in novel ways, and then reemerges back into consciousness where the impasse is resolved by the metaphorical expression of new knowledge. To develop this position, I (1) review and critique some well-known language-based studies of metaphor, (2) summarize psychoanalytic and depth psychological approaches to the psyche as one way to overcome the shortcomings of the language-based scholarship, (3) relate C. G. Jung's account of the psyche and his related notion of synchronicity to creative metaphors, (4) graft a quantum physics approach to material reality back onto Jung's work as a provisional structure of the collective unconscious, and finally, (5) offer some suggestions about how creative metaphors might work psychologically.<br>

Article Title: Recovering Hyperbole:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.45.4.issue-4<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Approaching hyperbole is a difficult task, since it is and was so often dismissed as an obvious, offensive, and simplistic trope offering little to no theoretical insights. To use one of Quintilian's examples, “As he [Antony] vomited, he filled his lap and the whole platform with gobbets of food” (2001, 8.6.68). For many, there is no more to hyperbole than this type of obvious exaggeration, which is confirmed by its contentious history. Aristotle, for example, considers hyperbole “adolescent,” describing it as an aspect of metaphor in
         On Rhetoric, and he offers a significant critique of various types of excess in theNicomachean Ethics. Demetrius regards it as being oftentimes “frigid,” that is, indecorous (1995, 427), though he does highlight its utility for expressing the impossible. Although Pseudo-Longinus favors hyperbole—he places it in the elevated style, characterizing it as a useful trope for putting a “strain on the facts” and transporting one's audience to the sublime through intensepathos—he asserts that it may easily be “ruined by overshooting the mark” (1995, 285, 281). Hyperbole was often considered bombastic, associated only with epideictic rhetoric (where it functions quite well), and was aligned with excessive stylistic vices of the sophists.
               Indeed, hyperbole was often accused of1
            cacozelia, or “perverse affectation,” which results from insincerity or poor judgment and is “the worst faults of all eloquence” (Quintilian 8.3.56).<br>

Issue: shaw.34.1.issue-1<br>

Author(s): Einsohn Howard Ira<br>
Abstract: Furthermore, like Ricoeur, Shaw rejects the Pauline concepts of original sin and vicarious atonement. We enter the world spotless, Shaw believes, and no gentleman—Shaw's shorthand for the virtuous person, male or female—would ever allow an innocent other to pay for her misdeeds. The crux is not to ignorantly transgress to the heart's content and then brazenly appeal to a sacrificial scapegoat to wash away the dirt with unblemished blood and tears. Rather, as Jesus proclaims, the recalcitrant should have a change of heart and sin no more. For Shaw, “Christ stands in the world for that intuition of the highest humanity that we, being members of one another, must not complain, must not scold, must not strike, nor revile nor persecute nor revenge nor punish.”
         
               What most intrigues and inspires Shaw about Jesus is not his purported special status in the cosmic order among adherents of traditional Christianity, but the type of person he embodies in the flesh. Thus, he is, as Ricoeur views him, a paradigmatic metaphor, a timeless “intuition” in the Shavian lexicon, of precisely the kind of exemplary individual Shaw believes every child has the capacity to become in its maturity: a reverent adult who heeds Micah's (6:8)44
            
               admonition to do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with your God.45
            
               In Shaw's (as well as Ricoeur's) eyes, there is no means of remedying the world's ills other than discovering practical and compassionate ways of implementing politically the core of Jesus's message, which he takes to be the basic principles of Fabian socialism.46

Abstract: This paper presents the background, findings, and implications of a new line of research on the technical identification of linguistic metaphor. Inspired by the cognitive-linguistic approach to metaphor launched by Lakoff and Johnson, a new theoretical framework and operational definition has been developed for the identification of metaphorical expressions in authentic discourse. The paper presents a brief report of two reliability studies of the first stage of the approach, and spells out how it may be applied in linguistic, stylistic and rhetorical text analysis with reference to a poem by Alfred Lord Tennyson.<br>

Abstract: To provide a context for the essays published here, this introduction to the special issue on metonymy highlights a number of aspects of the cognitive-linguistic discussion of metonymy of the past twenty-five years. It briefly sketches the development of metonymy studies in poetics, linguistics, and philosophy, emphasizing that the cognitive-linguistic approach to metonymy of the past decades represents a return to the semantic views of metonymy advocated in structuralist semantics. This development was triggered by the extensive study of metaphor, but metonymy has now emancipated itself as an autonomous field of study that displays complex and unresolved relations with metaphor. This introduction also attends to the new insights added by cognitive linguistics to such a semantic approach to metonymy, suggesting that metonymy has indeed gone cognitive linguistic.<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: American rhetoric from Winthrop's “City on a Hill” to Reagan's “shining city” to Barack Obama's rhetoric of hope relies on underlying utopian metaphors. In campaign rhetoric, the use of such strategies is pervasive and often transcends political party. Some contemporary theorists might define the function of utopia in terms of cognitive metaphor or cognitive narrative, areas that have overlapped with rhetoric of late.
         
               However, for rhetoric to fulfill a functional definition of utopia for liberal humanists in utopian studies, utopia needs to be present not only in speeches and other forms of public persuasion but also in the canon of classical and liberal-humanist treatises on rhetorical theory—for this is where rhetoric itself is defined. And in fact, these theories do imply or even directly illustrate utopian societies as part of the underlying motive for practicing rhetoric.10<br>

Abstract: This article begins by considering the diverse ways in which Gilberto Freyre used his key concept of mesticagem and the different cultural fields to which he extended it — architecture, cuisine, sport, literature, urban studies, sociology and even sex. Noting the alternative concepts or metaphors in Freyre’s work — interpenetration, mixture, hybridity and so on — it goes on to discuss a metaphor that he did not use, although it has become popular since his time, ‘cultural translation’. A brief history of the idea of cultural translation and a consideration of its strengths and weaknesses leads to a casestudy of both the literal and the metaphorical translation of the western concept of liberty to Japan after the imperial restoration of 1868.<br>
