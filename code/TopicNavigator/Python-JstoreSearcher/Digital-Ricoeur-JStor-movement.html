  Abstract: The rhetorical texts of Salmon P. Chase are an ideal place to begin a consideration of slave power conspiracy discourse in the political mainstream, for Chase has been credited with fundamentally altering the nature of the antislavery movement: ʺThe American anti-slavery movement, which began as a moral crusade, eventually found that it would have to turn to politics to achieve its goals…. No anti-slavery leader was more responsible for the success of this transformation, and none did more to formulate an anti-slavery program in political terms than Salmon P. Chase of Ohio.ʺ Crucial to this transformation was Chaseʹs development of<br>

  Abstract: Fundamentalism is, at its essence, a church movement. By this I mean, as we have explored throughout this study, that Fundamentalist counterpublicity is intimately intertwined with narratives about the survival and status of the Fundamentalist church, a universal idealization of local believing communities. This idealization, in turn, conflates political and spiritual, public and private concerns in Fundamentalist rhetoric. The church marks the boundaries and exclusions of Fundamentalist identity, yet it also builds bridges between private belief and public action. It is in defense and propagation of the Fundamentalist church and the ideal of revivalism that the local church finds its<br>

  Author(s) MCARTHUR JO-ANNE<br>
  Abstract: In the nineteenth century, the dog and the horse were man’s best friends. Sagacious, affectionate, and loyal, dog and horse were represented as faithful and helpful creatures that had played key roles in the development of civilization. Frameworks like the animal protection movement enabled, and encouraged, the development and intensification of these affectionate ties. Yet in spite of these ties, the horse was systematically served up to the dog for dinner.<br>

  Book Title: To Become an American-Immigrants and Americanization Campaigns of the Early Twentieth Century<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hahner Leslie A.<br>
  Abstract: Pledging allegiance, singing the "Star-Spangled Banner," wearing a flag pin-these are all markers of modern patriotism, emblems that announce the devotion of American citizens. Most of these nationalistic performances were formulized during the early twentieth century and driven to new heights by the panic surrounding national identity during World War I. In
      To Become an AmericanLeslie A. Hahner argues that, in part, the Americanization movement engendered the transformation of patriotism during this period. Americanization was a massive campaign designed to fashion immigrants into perfect Americans-those who were loyal in word, deed, and heart. The larger outcome of this widespread movement was a dramatic shift in the nation's understanding of Americanism. Employing a rhetorical lens to analyze the visual and aesthetic practices of Americanization, Hahner contends that Americanization not only tutored students in the practices of citizenship but also created a normative visual metric that modified how Americans would come to understand, interpret, and judge their own patriotism and that of others.<br>

  Abstract: When the term

Perhaps not. Th e sacrifi ce of which the Girard school speaks applies to any social order—whether a political order, an ideological organization, a social movement, or such—not merely to an established religious tradition.¹ So, let us pose the question: What is the value of Girardian theory? Is it to illuminate the religious concept of sacrifice or to illuminate human nature in general?<br>

  Abstract: It is very difficult for an academic audience at the end of the twentieth century to imagine a time when the college preaching circuit was a way for theologians to influence large numbers of students and make a good income, or a time when listening to preaching was at least an occasional experience even for secular intellectuals. Religion remains an important legitimating device for the Republican Party and for what remains of the civil rights movement among African Americans, but religious symbols and themes—the sin of national pride, the tension between the

  Abstract: In chapter 4, we described the movement of the Palestinian people from a symbol system based to varying degrees on Arab, Islamic, and nationalist impulses toward a Palestinian Arab identity and movement rooted in myth. By 1937, the Palestinians had developed a symbol system that was based on ideological and mythic foundations that collapsed the scene (Palestine) and the agent (the Palestinian Arabs) into a consubstantiation. In this chapter, we examine the trajectory of Palestinian symbol use from the 1940s to 1960s.<br>

While revolutionary politics and traditional religious heritage separate them, the three social classes in afterlife associate in popular ritual practices. Although they constitute a hierarchy, the hierarchy that structures their relative values varies at different sites of memory. Their status changes between the state war memorial and the community temple, and the war heroes who occupy the symbolic center in the former are relegated to the margins, outside the village ancestors, in the latter.

  Abstract: American anthropology opened up a Pandora’s box the moment it specified culture as its object, simultaneously setting itself at a distance from the natural sciences and defining itself in contradistinction to both American cognitivism and French structuralism. By the 1980s, the discipline was engaged in a soul-searching movement to critically assess its object, its principal method, and the most current form of the write-up of research results. In 1986, two books appeared seeking to provide a focus for this wide-ranging debate:

  Book Title: Studying Global Pentecostalism-Theories and Methods<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): van der Laan Cornelis<br>
  Abstract: With its remarkable ability to adapt to many different cultures, Pentecostalism has become the world’s fastest growing religious movement. More than five hundred million adherents worldwide have reshaped Christianity itself. Yet some fundamental questions in the study of global Pentecostalism, and even in what we call “Pentecostalism,” remain largely unaddressed. Bringing together leading scholars in the social sciences, history, and theology, this unique volume explores these questions for this rapidly growing, multidisciplinary field of study. A valuable resource for anyone studying new forms of Christianity, it offers insights and guidance on both theoretical and methodological issues. The first section of the book examines such topics as definitions, essentialism, postcolonialism, gender, conversion, and globalization. The second section features contributions from those working in psychology, anthropology, sociology, and history. The third section traces the boundaries of theology from the perspectives of pneumatology, ecumenical studies, inter-religious relations, and empirical theology.<br>

  Book Title: Ostension-Word Learning and the Embodied Mind<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Engelland Chad<br>
  Abstract: Ostension is bodily movement that manifests our engagement with things, whether we wish it to or not. Gestures, glances, facial expressions: all betray our interest in something. Ostension enables our first word learning, providing infants with a prelinguistic way to grasp the meaning of words. Ostension is philosophically puzzling; it cuts across domains seemingly unbridgeable -- public--private, inner--outer, mind--body. In this book, Chad Engelland offers a philosophical investigation of ostension and its role in word learning by infants. Engelland discusses ostension (distinguishing it from ostensive definition) in contemporary philosophy, examining accounts by Quine, Davidson, and Gadamer, and he explores relevant empirical findings in psychology, evolutionary anthropology, and neuroscience. He offers original studies of four representative historical thinkers whose work enriches the understanding of ostension: Wittgenstein, Merleau-Ponty, Augustine, and Aristotle. And, building on these philosophical and empirical foundations, Engelland offers a meticulous analysis of the philosophical issues raised by ostension. He examines the phenomenological problem of whether embodied intentions are manifest or inferred; the problem of what concept of mind allows ostensive cues to be intersubjectively available; the epistemological problem of how ostensive cues, notoriously ambiguous, can be correctly understood; and the metaphysical problem of the ultimate status of the key terms in his argument: animate movement, language, and mind. Finally, he argues for the centrality of manifestation in philosophy. Taking ostension seriously, he proposes, has far-reaching implications for thinking about language and the practice of philosophy.<br>

As Wittgenstein demonstrated to philosophers the kinetic force of language in his apothegm “The meaning is in the use,” so Cunningham showed the world of modern dance that the meaning is in the action or movement.

  Abstract: Straussianism is the only professorial movement in the United States that has attained the standing of a public philosophy. Since at least the late 1970s, its proponents have not only played a significant role in the academy but have served as advisers to the president when a Republican holds office and as talking heads on news channels such as Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC when Republicans are in or out of office. The tendency is to counsel respect, in the name of civic virtue, for the presidency when a Republican holds office and to subject the incumbent to sharp critique<br>

  Abstract: Pragmatism originated as a movement that sought to clarify meaning in terms of action. We recall the phrasing of Peirce’s famous maxim: “Consider what effects, that might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object.”¹ The effort to clarify this maxim might be said to constitute the subsequent history of pragmatism. Whereas there was a tendency in pragmatism to interpret consequentialism in a positivistic sense, it was systematically avoided by its main developers, Peirce, James, Mead, and Dewey, because they<br>

  Abstract: The thought of the late Karl Jaspers, co-founder of the existentialist movement, has long exerted a powerful influence on world opinion. But, surprisingly, though translations of his writings have appeared in over 160 editions in 16 countries, his strictly philosophical work has hitherto been largely inaccessible to American audiences. Even where adequate English translations exist, the difficulties imposed by Jaspers' involved reasoning, intricate style, and ingenious neologisms are such that few unfamiliar with Continental philosophy can hope to acquire an understanding of his ideas on their own.<br>

  Book Title: Contemporary Violence-Postmodern war in Kosovo and Chechnya<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Moore Cerwyn<br>
  Abstract: Contemporary Violence: Postmodern War in Kosovo and Chechnya draws on several years of field research, as well as interpretive IR theory and analysis of empirical source material so as to shed light on contemporary violence. Drawing on interpretive approaches to International Relations, the book argues that founding events and multiple contexts informed the narratives deployed by different members of each movement, illustrating why elements within the Kosovo Liberation Army and the armed forces of the Chechen republic of Ichkeria favoured regional and local strategies of war in the Balkans and the North Caucasus. The book draws on post-positivist analysis and empirical research so as unravel the relationship between narratives, stories and hermeneutic accounts of International Relations; regional politics and trans-local identity; globalisation and visual aspects of contemporary security; criminality and emotionality; which together illustrate the dynamics within the armed resistance movements in Kosovo and the North Caucasus and the road to war in 1999. The book is a major addition to a small field of genuinely readable studies of IR theory. The book will be of interest to academics, researchers, students, area studies experts and policy-makers seeking to understand the formation of the armed resistance movements in Kosovo and Chechnya. Amongst other things, the book will be of interest to students and scholars of International Relations, Political Studies, Area Studies, as well as those within Cultural and Historical and Sociological Studies.<br>

Building on the last chapter, the analysis engages with localised social networks which informed the armed resistance movements in Kosovo and Chechnya. Firstly we turn to the battle of Gudermes in Chechnya in 1998, and the incursion into Dagestan in 1999. This demonstrates how the former nationalist-separatist movement fragmented in a number of ways, becoming reconstituted around a broader anti-Russian regional narrative.

  Book Title: A Godly Humanism-Clarifying the Hope That Lies Within<br>
  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): George Francis Cardinal<br>
  Abstract: For Francis Cardinal George, the Catholic Church is not a movement, built around ideas, but a communion, built around relationships. In A Godly Humanism, he shares his understanding of the Church in lively, compelling prose, presenting a way to understand and appreciate the relationships of God to human beings and of human beings to one another. These loving relationships are continually made present to us in and through the Church, from the time of Jesus' first disciples down to our own day. We are introduced to how the spiritual and intellectual life of Christians, aided in every generation by the Holy Spirit working through the Apostles and their successors, resist the danger of splitting apart from one another. Though they take different outward forms at different times, both wisdom and holiness are made possible for every Christian of every station of life. Sign-posting his conversation by the milestones of his own spiritual and intellectual journey, Cardinal George invites us to view the Church and her history in ways that go beyond the categories of politics - through which we find merely human initiative, contrivance, and adjustment - and rather to see the initiative as God's first and foremost. God is the non-stop giver, we are non-stop recipients of his gifts, and the recent popes, no less than the Father of the Church, have made every effort to make us aware of the graces - that is, of the unearned benefits - that God confers on us as Catholics, as Christians, as believers, and simply as human persons. Pope Francis, he reminds us, contrasts human planning with God's providence, and this book is at once an exposition of that providence and a personal response of gratitude for the way it has operated in one man's life.<br>

But the radical political climate to which these events contributed did not come to bloom before the end of the decade, and belongs, strictly speaking, to the ten years

  Abstract: The intellectual project of using whiteness as a tool of analysis is not one that has taken root in the UK. However, there are a number of empirical studies that investigate the racialisation of white identities. This bears some comparison to the themes thrown up by the plethora of American work in the loose multidisciplinary field labelled ‘whiteness studies’. Indeed, that corpus is far advanced: Winddance Twine and Gallagher (2008: 5) label the empirical studies of localised whiteness as it intersects with class, nation and gender, as the ‘third wave’ of whiteness studies.

  Abstract: About one hundred years ago, in 1906, at Azusa Street Mission in Los Angeles, Christians at the margins of power shared the overpowering experience of celebrating the presence of God together as one people, in spite of the ideology of racial segregation so prominent in the United States at that time. This became one of the birthplaces of modern Pentecostalism.

But, along with figurative language generally, it fell victim to the hostility toward classical rhetoric manifested by literary movements from romanticism to modernism. Indeed, one history of rhetoric still in use claims authoritatively: “ekphrasis . . . perverts descriptions because it frustrates narrative movement; [and] . . . confirms a decadent habit of literature” (Baldwin, 19).

  Abstract: The gnostic movement that, in Irenaeus’s day, threatened to engulf Christianity subsided gradually into an underground current that would rise to the surface but sporadically in subsequent Christian history. Meanwhile, the Christian church soon advanced from being a persecuted minority to become the state religion of the Roman Empire, and eventually, in many ways, its successor. Once the age of martyrs gave way to Christendom, the sacralized political order on which Christendom rested would create tensions of its own and these, nine centuries after Irenaeus, provide the setting for the next work to claim our attention, Anselm of Canterbury’s

  Book Title: Into the Far Country-Karl Barth and the Modern Subject<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Long D. Stephen<br>
  Abstract: Into the Far Country is an investigation of Karl Barth’s response to modernity as seen through the prism of the subject under judgment. By suggesting that Barth offers a form of theological resistance to the Enlightenment’s construal of human subjectivity as “absolute," this piece offers a way of talking about the formation of human persons as the process of being kenotically laid bare before the cross and resurrection of Christ. It does so by reevaluating the relationship between Barth and modernity, making the case that Barth understands Protestantism to have become the agent of its own demise by capitulating to modernity’s insistence on the axiomatic priority of the isolated Cartesian ego. Conversations are hosted with figures including Fyodor Dostoevsky, Rowan Williams, Gillian Rose and Donald MacKinnon in the service of elucidating an account of the human person liberated from captivity to what Barth names “self-judgment," and freed for creative participation in the super-abundant source of life that is the prayerful movement from the Son to the Father in the Spirit. Therefore, an account of Barth’s theology is offered that is deeply concerned with the triune God’s revelatory presence as that which drives the community into the crucible of difficulty that is the life of kenotic dispossession.<br>

  Abstract: In the last two chapters, we saw how a reflection on the Freudian theory of drives led authors such as Lacan and Adorno to rebuild the concept of subjectivity, thus starting a movement that had major consequences for any theory of recognition that does not want to depend on the reiteration of a certain type of non-problematized normative anthropology. In my view, this perspective can serve as basis for criticizing one of the most successful attempts to recover Hegel’s concept of recognition in the philosophical debate of the past twenty-five years, which was carried out by Axel Honneth.

In its concern with epochs, mentalities, and collective representations, it uses anthropology as a repository of concepts, methods, and empirical data that historians can raid. The other paradigm, which typifies historical anthropology, is the one through which anthropologists operate in order to do history, using a central method of local-level research¹ and exploring issues related to “autonomy, deviance,<br>

  Abstract: Since the 1980s, France has experienced a vigorous revival of interest in its past and cultural heritage. This has been expressed as part of a movement of remembering through museums and festivals as well as via elaborate commemorations, most notably those held to celebrate the bi-centenary of the Revolution in 1989 and can be interpreted as part of a re-examinaton of what it means to be French in the context of ongoing Europeanization. This study brings together scholars from multidisciplinary backgrounds and engages them in debate with professionals from France, who are working in the fields of museology, heritage and cultural production. Addressing subjects such as war and memory, gastronomy and regional identity, maritime culture and urban societies, they throw fresh light on the process by which France has been conceptualized and packaged as a cultural object.<br>

  Book Title: A Passion for the Possible: Thinking with Paul Ricoeur-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): VENEMA HENRY ISAAC<br>
  Abstract: Paul Ricoeur's entire philosophical project narrates a passion for the possibleexpressed in the hope that in spite of death, closure, and sedimentation, life is opened by superabundance, by how the world gives us much more than is possible. Ricoeur's philosophical anthropology is a phenomenology of human capacity, which gives onto the groundless ground of human being, namely, God. Thus the story of the capable man, beginning with original goodness held captive by a servile will and ending with the possibility of liberation and regeneration of the heart, underpins his passion for the more than possible. The essays in this volume trace the fluid movement between phenomenological and religious descriptions of the capable self that emerges across Ricoeur's oeuvre and establish points of connection for future developments that might draw inspiration from this body of thought.<br>

  Abstract: The most persuasive moment of Paul Ricoeur’s work for the development anthropologist is his idea of narrative imagination.

Far from static, this new place is an emerging plot that enables movement from shame and hunger to selfsustainability on the part of the local, and movement from the confinement of Western individualism to an ontological<br>

  Author(s) Ansell Nik<br>
  Abstract: The evangelical tradition has virtually co-existed, albeit uneasily, with concepts of universal salvation.

Liberalizing trends were strongly resisted, and incipient universalist tendencies were strenuously repudiated. Faced with challenges to depart from what it saw as an established, traditional, biblical, and doctrinal position with regard to salvation, judgment, and eternal punishment, reaction was usually swift and hostile, often prompting simultaneous renaissance of historic definitive positions. Denial of eternal punishment and embrace of<br>

  Abstract: Social concern and involvement is undoubtedly one of the major indicators of the changing ethos of the evangelical movement in the twentieth century. Take the example of North America, where the evangelical movement has been influential not only in the Protestant church but society as a whole. From evangelicals’ balanced approach to soul-saving and social services, to the “Great Reversal” completed during the fundamentalist-modernist controversy of the 1920s and 1930s, to the re-emergence of the sense of social responsibility among evangelicals since the 1970s, the rise of American evangelicals’ social consciousness and commitment is quite dramatic. Nevertheless, American evangelicals’ experience<br>

  Abstract: Heredity or environment? Which of these factors most determines the behavioral development of a child? This question has been debated vigorously among psychologists and behavioral scientists. No doubt most would conclude today that both hereditary and environmental factors are important and that both should be considered. This is also the case with the development of early Christianity, if we may employ an analogy between human growth and the historical development of a religious movement. What later became rabbinic Judaism and Christianity were both developments out of Judean state religion. Jesus and his disciples were Jews, and for some time Christianity<br>

The idea emerges from the restorative justice movement and the repair required in the aftermath of genocide in Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Bosnia, Cambodia, Liberia, and Uganda.

  Abstract: The World Missionary Conference held in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1910, has long been regarded as the historic landmark of world mission and the modern ecumenical movement. It is important to remember that one of the outcomes of Edinburgh 1910 was a desire to seek and attain unity in mission.

  Book Title: Contextual Theology-The Drama of Our Times<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Matheny Paul Duane<br>
  Abstract: For centuries, the global understanding of Church has been shaped by Western theological imperatives. Yet today, the decline of institutional religion in the West, and the extraordinary growth of the Church of the global South mean that a radical movement beyond such theologies is required. In this book, Paul Matheny argues that the Church would benefit by becoming more contextualized and less Western. Contextual Theology is an attempt to address that issue and to examine how a reassessment of the relationship of the Gospel to cultural context can advance this critical and necessary development. Through an accessible and critical approach, Matheny considers the historical background to contextual theology. In the same way, he aims to show how to use contextual methods to think theologically and act missiologically in different cultural contexts.<br>

There is no such consensus about Bonhoeffer. Indeed, while early interpreters were bold to advance theses about the nature of Bonhoeffer’s theology as<br>

Sustainable living invites questions at the cultural level so that a direction conducive to human living might be found.

Along with the capitalist development of world-economy and sociological analysis of religious ideas, it is necessary to examine how closely the philosophical ideas of individual rights, civil society, and freedom have been intertwined with the economic individualism of capitalism.<br>

Although Husserl did not directly contribute to these developments, it is not correct to say that he simply sat on the sidelines. He personally knew and corresponded with several of the finest scientific and mathematical minds of the time.

  Author(s): ABBOTT FRANK A.<br>
  Abstract: There are many analyses of Tractarianism – a nineteenth-century form of Anglicanism that emphasized its Catholic origins – but how did people in the colonies react to the High Church movement? Beating against the Wind, a study in nineteenth-century vernacular spirituality, emphasizes the power of faith on a shifting frontier in a transatlantic world. Focusing on people living along the Newfoundland and Labrador coast, Calvin Hollett presents a nuanced perspective on popular resistance to the colonial emissary Bishop Edward Feild and his spiritual regimen of order, silence, and solemnity. Whether by outright opposing Bishop Feild, or by simply ignoring his wishes and views, or by brokering a hybrid style of Gothic architecture, the people of Newfoundland and Labrador demonstrated their independence in the face of an attempt at hierarchical ascendency upon the arrival of Tractarianism in British North America. Instead, they continued to practise evangelical Anglicanism and participate in Methodist revivals, and thereby negotiated a popular Protestantism, one often infused with the spirituality of other seafarers from Nova Scotia and New England. Exploring the interaction between popular spirituality and religious authority, Beating against the Wind challenges the traditional claim of Feild’s success in bringing Tractarianism to the colony while exploring the resistance to Feild’s initiatives and the reasons for his disappointments.There are many analyses of Tractarianism – a nineteenth-century form of Anglicanism that emphasized its Catholic origins – but how did people in the colonies react to the High Church movement?

  Book Title: The Rhizomatic West-Representing the American West in a Transnational, Global, Media Age<br>
  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): Tatum Stephen<br>
  Abstract: Using Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's concept of the rhizome, Neil Campbell shows how the West (or west-ness) continually breaks away from a mainstream notion of American "rootedness" and renews and transforms itself in various cultural forms. A region long traversed by various transient peoples (from tribes and conquerors to immigrants, traders, and trappers), the West reflects a mythic quest for settlement, permanence, and synthesis-even notions of a national or global identity-at odds with its rootless history, culture, and nature. Crossing the concept of "roots" with "routes," this book shows how notions of the West-in representations ranging from literature and film to photography, music, and architectural theory-give expression to ideas about identity, nationhood, and belonging in a world increasingly defined by movement across time and borders.
      The Rhizomatic Westoffers a new vision of the American West as a hybrid, performative space, a staging place for myriad intersecting and constantly changing identities.<br>

  Abstract: Over the past few years, scholars have shown that women’s travel writing set in northern Canada often complicates and challenges mainstream literary representations of the north.² I explore how North American women’s travel literature set in northwestern Canada at the turn of the 20th century uses recurring metaphors that connect the physical experience and movement of the traveller to cross-border ideas of empire, gender, and race. In this article, I show how two travellers in particular, American Elizabeth Taylor (1856-1932) and Canadian Agnes Deans Cameron (1863-1912), use images of the female travelling body in northern Canada to promote women’s rights<br>

  Abstract: The emergence of early Christianity during the first century CE is a truly remarkable phenomenon. The literature this movement produced during its first seventy years of existence exhibits profound creativity in the context of traditional cultures, which are known for their conservative nature. Years ago, scholars such as Amos Wilder observed that there were amazingly “new” formulations of phrases and words in New Testament literature.¹ There has, however, been only limited progress in our understanding of how this “newness” emerged.

This is to say that each person’s experience of the city organizes an intricately shifting site for the production and exchange of meaning.

  Abstract: In a volume that aims to expand our understandings of Christian love by clarifying love’s meaning in theory and practice, a chapter devoted to “forgiveness” may appear marginal to the task. Yet the opposite is the case. There is no genuine Christian forgiveness without love, and love is sometimes tested in its ultimate possibility and imperative by the forgiveness it generates. Moreover, the construals of forgiveness that are central to much of Christian theology slip into caricature unless they include love in their foundation, framework, and movement.

  Abstract: Although the Psalms of Asaph (Pss. 50, 73‒83) contain a concentration of historical referents unparalleled in the Psalter, they have rarely attracted sustained historical interest. Karl N.

Asaph “remembers" the past as a movement from henotheism to Yahwism as the core memory that informs a new historical situation for worship participants.<br>

  Author(s): RICHARDSON BRIAN<br>
  Abstract: A Poetics of Unnatural Narrativeoffers a collection of foundational essays introducing the reader to the full scope of unnatural narrative theory: its meaning, its goals, its extent, its paradoxes. This volume brings together a distinguished group of international critics, scholars, and historians that includes several of the world's leading narrative theorists. Together, they survey many basic areas of narrative studies from an unnatural perspective: story, time, space, voice, minds, narrative levels, "realism," nonfiction, hyperfiction, and narrative poetry. Rarely have these fundamental concepts been subjected to such an original and thoroughgoing reconceptualization. Much of the book is directed toward an investigation of experimental and antirealist work. Each essay focuses on texts and episodes that narrative theory has tended to neglect, and each provides theoretical formulations that are commensurate with such exceptional, albeit neglected, works.A Poetics of Unnatural Narrativearticulates and delineates the newest and most radical movement in narrative studies. This anthology will be of great interest to students and scholars of narrative studies and of the history and theory of modern fiction.<br>

Meeks' introduction offers a retrospective on New Testament studies of the past thirty years and explains the intersection of these studies with a variety of exploratory and revisionist movements in the humanities, embracing social theory, history, anthropology, and literature.

  Abstract: In the Anglo-American tradition, conservative thought was born of beauty, particularly literary beauty. If conservatism is a movement, it is first a literary one. By this, I do not refer to Dr. Johnson and Dean Swift, who, along with many other great men of letters of the eighteenth century, were Tories—a detail that may help explain the essentially backward look of satire in that or any period, but does not in itself forge a necessary link between the Tory cause and literature. Rather, I refer to that moment when Tory thought was transformed and diluted into a new compound<br>

  Book Title: Constructing Constructive Theology-An Introductory Sketch<br>
  Publisher: Fortress Press<br>
  Author(s): Wyman Jason A.<br>
  Abstract: To date, constructive theology hasn’t been viewed or conceptualized as a movement or trend in theology on its own as a whole. Questions arise as to what constructive theology is, where it came from, why it considers itself “constructive," and why constructive is something different from the ways in which theology has been done in the past. This book traces the overall historical arc of constructive theology, from proto-movement through the present. Inklings of constructive theology emerged well before it began to take any formalized shape. At the same time, an important shift occurred when a group of theologians decided to create the Workgroup on Constructive Theology. Further, even as the workgroup continues to work collectively, producing textbooks, statements, and methodologies concerning theology, many theologians who are not part of the workgroup or may not even know it exists have adopted the moniker of “constructive theologian." The book also considers the term “constructive" itself, offering possible reasons and historical contexts that led to this distinction being made in contrast to “systematic" theology and its subcategories. Constructive theology speaks to a very specific, historically situated emergence in the academy generally and in theology’s attempts to engage those shifts specifically.<br>

  Abstract: As a genre, constructive theologies come in staggering variety. To this point in its history no attempts have been made to define constructive theology as one movement or method in theology. Some encyclopedia entries and cursory descriptions of constructive theology have appeared in various places, but never in a comprehensive way. In one of the most extensive descriptions of constructive theology, found in the

  Abstract: Scholars of Wallace Stevens have long recognized that his poetics is bound up with the loss of religious faith. The standard critical picture is that, like many Victorians before him, Stevens gave up certain consolatory beliefs in the “supernatural” and looked to poetry to fill the vacuum of “meaning.” Stevens himself wrote bluntly in a letter of mid-career: “[I]t is a habit of mind with me to be thinking of some substitute for religion” (L, 348 ). Critics have usually proceeded, however, as if the terms of Stevens’s secularism were self-evident and the transitional movement between religion and poetry—“substitution”<br>

  Author(s) DECKERT JENNIFER CHAPPELL<br>
  Abstract: The ideology of scientific motherhood began to gain ground in Canada in the late nineteenth century, and came to rationalize mothering for Mennonite women along expert and scientific lines. Scientific motherhood was a widespread cultural movement that sought to reproduce the conditions of industrialization and regulate the modes of women’s labour inside the “factory” home. Scientific motherhood is closely associated with urbanization, industrialization, the medicalization of childbirth, and the increasing popularity of artificial formula that characterized its rise during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (see Apple), a time of significant Mennonite resettlement in Canada.

  Abstract: This paper examines ways in which images of birth and the maternal body are contemporary forms of the sacred, and, controversially, how their production represents a renewed interest in birth and mothering as primary sources of empowerment for many women. Through research in art history, religious studies, philosophy, medical anthropology, and feminism, I first show how members of an international movement devoted to birth and art are actively using religious, secular, and re-sacralized art imagery in the visualization of labour and birth and as a ritualistic part of birth as a rite of passage.

  Book Title: Love and its Critics-From the Song of Songs to Shakespeare and Milton’s Eden<br>
  Publisher: Open Book Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Movsesian Arpi<br>
  Abstract: This book is a history of love and the challenge love offers to the laws and customs of its times and places, as told through poetry from the Song of Songs to John Milton’s Paradise Lost. It is also an account of the critical reception afforded to such literature, and the ways in which criticism has attempted to stifle this challenge. Bryson and Movsesian argue that the poetry they explore celebrates and reinvents the love the troubadour poets of the eleventh and twelfth centuries called fin’amor: love as an end in itself, mutual and freely chosen even in the face of social, religious, or political retribution. Neither eros nor agape, neither exclusively of the body, nor solely of the spirit, this love is a middle path. Alongside this tradition has grown a critical movement that employs a 'hermeneutics of suspicion', in Paul Ricoeur’s phrase, to claim that passionate love poetry is not what it seems, and should be properly understood as worship of God, subordination to Empire, or an entanglement with the structures of language itself – in short, the very things it resists. The book engages with some of the seminal literature of the Western canon, including the Bible, the poetry of Ovid, and works by English authors such as William Shakespeare and John Donne, and with criticism that stretches from the earliest readings of the Song of Songs to contemporary academic literature. Lively and enjoyable in its style, it attempts to restore a sense of pleasure to the reading of poetry, and to puncture critical insistence that literature must be outwitted. It will be of value to professional, graduate, and advanced undergraduate scholars of literature, and to the educated general reader interested in treatments of love in poetry throughout history.<br>

  Abstract: The events of 1968 have been seen as a decisive turning point in the Western world. The author takes a critical look at "May 1968" and questions whether the events were in fact as "revolutionary" as French and foreign commentators have indicated. He concludes the student movement changed little that had not already been challenged and altered in the late fifties and early sixties. The workers' strikes led to fewer working hours and higher wages, but these reforms reflected the secular demands of the French labor movement. "May 1968" was remarkable not because of the actual transformations it wrought but rather by virtue of the revolutionary power that much of the media and most scholars have attributed to it and which turned it into a symbol of a youthful, renewed, and freer society in France and beyond.<br>

She does this judiciously, without choosing sides because, for her, phenomenology is above all a way of thinking through a problem and practicing a method. The fecundity of the movement is appreciated only by participating in it-phenomenology has always thought of itself as philosophical research undertaken by and through a community of thinkers who share certain fundamental questions and ways of approaching those questions, even if their responses to these questions often differ. In this regard, Dastur is both one of the clearest guides to phenomenology and one of its ablest practitioners.<br>

  Abstract: The American and European women’s movement of the late 1970s and early 1980s contained a large segment organizing around issues of weapons, war, and peace. By the early 1990s, the humor and heroism of women’s peace actions had been all but forgotten. Prompted by events in the United States and the world since September 2001, and by the rhetoric of U.S. leaders justifying some of their actions, I do think that there are urgent reasons to reopen the question of whether looking at war and security issues through a gendered lens can teach us all lessons that might further the<br>

Thus the invention of rhetoric was attributed either to Hermes—the god of crossroads and highways, of movement, passage, of communication in all senses of the term—or, as we have seen, to Homer, and finally to three men of the fifth century b.c., Empedokles, Korax, and Tisias.<br>

  Author(s): Landau Ellen G.<br>
  Abstract: Abstract Expressionism is arguably the most important art movement in postwar America. Many of its creators and critics became celebrities, participating in heated public debates that were published in newspapers, magazines, and exhibition catalogues. This up-to-date anthology is the first comprehensive collection of key critical writings about Abstract Expressionism from its inception in the 1940s to the present day. Ellen G. Landau's masterful introduction presents and analyzes the major arguments and crucial points of view that have surrounded the movement decade by decade. She then offers a selection of readings, also organized by decade, including influential statements by such artists as Mark Rothko, Robert Motherwell, Jackson Pollock, and Barnett Newman as well as the commentary of diverse critics. Offering new insights into the development of Abstract Expressionism, this rich anthology also demonstrates the ongoing impact of this revolutionary and controversial movement. Reading Abstract Expressionism is essential for the library of any curator, scholar, or student of twentieth-century art.<br>

This movement, however, has also been answered with renewed versions of the traditional functionalist and behaviorist rejections of the study of consciousness as anything other than an incidental by-product of computational capacity (Dennett, 1991). Consciousness is seen as private and hence outside scientific scrutiny, confabulated and deluded in its pretended access to cognitive process, and ultimately nonfunctional.

  Book Title: Aliens and Sojourners-Self as Other in Early Christianity<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): DUNNING BENJAMIN H.<br>
  Abstract: Early Christians spoke about themselves as resident aliens, strangers, and sojourners, asserting that otherness is a fundamental part of being Christian. But why did they do so and to what ends? How did Christians' claims to foreign status situate them with respect to each other and to the larger Roman world as the new movement grew and struggled to make sense of its own boundaries?
      Aliens and Sojournersargues that the claim to alien status is not a transparent one. Instead, Benjamin Dunning contends, it shaped a rich, pervasive, variegated discourse of identity in early Christianity. Resident aliens and foreigners had long occupied a conflicted space of both repulsion and desire in ancient thinking. Dunning demonstrates how Christians and others in antiquity capitalized on this tension, refiguring the resident alien as being of a compelling doubleness, simultaneously marginal and potent. Early Christians, he argues, used this refiguration to render Christian identity legible, distinct, and even desirable among the vast range of social and religious identities and practices that proliferated in the ancient Mediterranean. Through close readings of ancient Christian texts such as Hebrews, 1 Peter, theShepherd of Hermas, and theEpistle to Diognetus, Dunning examines the markedly different ways that Christians used the language of their own marginality, articulating a range of options for what it means to be Christian in relation to the Roman social order. His conclusions have implications not only for the study of late antiquity but also for understanding the rhetorics of religious alienation more broadly, both in the ancient world and today.<br>

  Book Title: The Cinema of Attractions Reloaded-  Publisher: Amsterdam University Press<br>
  Author(s): Strauven Wanda<br>
  Abstract: What have Lumière in common with Wachowski? More than one hundred years separate these two pairs of brothers who astonished, quite similarly, the film spectator of their respective time with special effects of movement: a train rushing into the audience and a bullet flying in slow motion. Do they belong to the same family of "cinema of attractions"? Twenty years ago Tom Gunning introduced the phrase "cinema of attractions" to define the essence of the earliest films made between 1895 and 1906. His term scored an immediate success, even outside the field of early cinema. The present anthology questions the attractiveness and usefulness of the term for both pre-classical and post-classical cinema. With contributions by the most prominent scholars of this discipline (such as Tom Gunning, André Gaudreault, Thomas Elsaesser, Charles Musser, Scott Bukatman and Vivian Sobchack) this volume offers a kaleidoscopic overview of an important historiographical debate.

  Abstract: In 1927, Boris Eichenbaum claimed for theory the right to become history.³ In 1969, in this very same room here in Cerisy, Gérard Genette affirmed it was more a necessity than a right: “a necessity,” he said, “that originates from the movement itself and from the needs of the theoretical work.”⁴ In his paper, Genette tried to explain why what he calls the “history of forms” took so long to establish itself. Along with a number of circumstantial factors, Genette stressed two causes that we would like to take into consideration. Let’s let him speak: “The first of these causes<br>

  Book Title: The Bioregional Imagination-Literature, Ecology, and Place<br>
  Publisher: University of Georgia Press<br>
  Author(s): ZEITLER EZRA<br>
  Abstract: Bioregionalism is an innovative way of thinking about place and planet from an ecological perspective. Although bioregional ideas occur regularly in ecocritical writing, until now no systematic effort has been made to outline the principles of bioregional literary criticism and to use it as a way to read, write, understand, and teach literature. The twenty-four original essays here are written by an outstanding selection of international scholars. The range of bioregions covered is global and includes such diverse places as British Columbia's Meldrum Creek and Italy's Po River Valley, the Arctic and the Outback. There are even forays into cyberspace and outer space. In their comprehensive introduction, the editors map the terrain of the bioregional movement, including its history and potential to inspire and invigorate place-based and environmental literary criticism. Responding to bioregional tenets, this volume is divided into four sections. The essays in the "Reinhabiting" section narrate experiments in living-in-place and restoring damaged environments. The "Rereading" essays practice bioregional literary criticism, both by examining texts with strong ties to bioregional paradigms and by opening other, less-obvious texts to bioregional analysis. In "Reimagining," the essays push bioregionalism to evolve-by expanding its corpus of texts, coupling its perspectives with other approaches, or challenging its core constructs. Essays in the "Renewal" section address bioregional pedagogy, beginning with local habitat studies and concluding with musings about the Internet. In response to the environmental crisis, we must reimagine our relationship to the places we inhabit. This volume shows how literature and literary studies are fundamental tools to such a reimagining.<br>

  Abstract: Bioregional practice begins with understanding place and, correspondingly, self. Most bioregionalists emphasize that cultivating sustainable dwelling requires not simply acquiring technical knowledge about the natural possibilities and limitations of one’s geologic, biotic, or climatic region but also reconnecting to place through personal experience and rediscovering, in the words of Gary Snyder, “the ‘where’ of our ‘who are we?’” (

  Abstract: In September 2003, national security advisor Condoleezza Rice began laying claim to the legacy of the civil rights movement to authorize the U.S. war in Iraq. The speeches themselves are arresting, as familiar political affinities between race, war, and political party identification are dramatically rearranged. The strangeness of the political position Rice is attempting commands attention. Are Rice’s efforts to realign Republican foreign policy with a civil rights agenda sincere? Or is the equation of liberation in the American South with liberation in Iraq mere window dressing for the Bush administration’s military aims, divorced from deeper political commitments?

  Abstract: LOGICAL EMPIRICISM was the dominant movement in twentieth-century philosophy of science until about 1965. During its prime in the 1950s it dominated the field so totally that philosophers regarded it as identical with philosophy of science itself. Its basic definitions and distinctions were regarded as self-evident, and anyone who questioned them was contemptuously ignored as simply not a philosopher of science. After about 1958, it was increasingly on the defensive against newer movements, and by 1970 all the innovation was occurring in the newer movements.

  Abstract: A basic issue in dance is how to link human agency with movement form and expression. When we dance we embody agency through bodily orientation and consciousness. The dialectic nature of these links is played out daily in our movement choices and bodymind awareness. Judith Butler asks what kind of performances will destabilize received and rehearsed categories. The possibilities of transformation may be found in a “failure to repeat, a de-formity.”¹ Dance forms are repeated daily, hourly, in rehearsal rooms around the world. Thus a major question we should ask is, “What do we want to instill in this process,<br>

  Book Title: Illness as Narrative-  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Jurecic Ann<br>
  Abstract: For most of literary history, personal confessions about illness were considered too intimate to share publicly. By the mid-twentieth century, however, a series of events set the stage for the emergence of the illness narrative. The increase of chronic disease, the transformation of medicine into big business, the women's health movement, the AIDS/HIV pandemic, the advent of inexpensive paperbacks, and the rise of self-publishing all contributed to the proliferation of narratives about encounters with medicine and mortality.While the illness narrative is now a staple of the publishing industry, the genre itself has posed a problem for literary studies. What is the role of criticism in relation to personal accounts of suffering? Can these narratives be judged on aesthetic grounds? Are they a collective expression of the lost intimacy of the patient-doctor relationship? Is their function thus instrumental-to elicit the reader's empathy?To answer these questions, Ann Jurecic turns to major works on pain and suffering by Susan Sontag, Elaine Scarry, and Eve Sedgwick and reads these alongside illness narratives by Jean-Dominique Bauby, Reynolds Price, and Anne Fadiman, among others. In the process, she defines the subgenres of risk and pain narratives and explores a range of critical responses guided, alternately, by narrative empathy, the hermeneutics of suspicion, and the practice of reparative reading.
      Illness as Narrativeseeks to draw wider attention to this form of life writing and to argue for new approaches to both literary criticism and teaching narrative. Jurecic calls for a practice that's both compassionate and critical. She asks that we consider why writers compose stories of illness, how readers receive them, and how both use these narratives to make meaning of human fragility and mortality.<br>

But certainly all the arts reveal time-space as lived in human experience. Dance does this through movement imagery, through structured figures of movement, in time-space. When we describe a dance or its movement images, we find ourselves also describing time and space in human (lived) and metaphoric terms.<br>

  Author(s): SHEPPARD ROBERT<br>
  Abstract: In The Poetry of Saying Robert Sheppard explores an array of ‘experimental’ writers and styles of writing many of which have never secured a large audience in Britain, but which are often fascinatingly innovative. As a published poet in this tradition, Sheppard provides a detailed and thought provoking account of the development of the British poetry movement from the 1950s. As well as analysing the work of individual poets such as Roy Fisher, Lee Harwood and Tom Raworth The Poetry of Saying also examines the influence of the Poetry Society and poetry magazines on the evolution of British poetry throughout this period. The overriding virtue of the poetry of this period is its diversity, a fact that Sheppard has not ignored. As well as providing a fascinating into the work of these poets, The Poetry of Saying offers an ‘insider’s’ commentary on the social, political and historical background during this exciting period in British poetry.<br>

George Eliot and Hardy acquired considerable expertise in matters of art, but both set out with a deliberate intention to learn the subject which was very different from Thackeray’s comfortable familiarity. This may help to explain why Hardy’s novels make more direct reference to painters and their works than do those of Thackeray, although an equally plausible explanation could be found in the later date at which Hardy was writing.

We think of animals and people as migrating, sometimes by choice, sometimes by instinct, sometimes by compulsion. Migration is movement, but not just any movement. It is movement across geographical, national and/or cultural boundaries or differences. So, migration requires difference of some sort. We rarely speak of someone or something as having migrated if no change or adaptation was required, although of course at some level every move is by definition a change.

This movement of international mediators proved to be a curious hybrid of academic idealism and prescriptive procedures. The mediator was most often male and Western, and he took centre stage, controlling communication among conflicting parties to nudge them into compromises, settlements, and even resolution of their disputes—using techniques extrapolated from, among other sources, marriage guidance manuals.<br>

  Book Title: Dark Writing-Geography, Performance, Design<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Carter Paul<br>
  Abstract: We do not see empty figures and outlines; we do not move in straight lines. Everywhere we are surrounded by dapple; the geometry of our embodied lives is curviform, meandering, bi-pedal. Our personal worlds are timed, inter-positional, and contingent. But nowhere in the language of cartography and design do these ordinary experiences appear. This, Dark Writing argues, is a serious omission because they are designs on the world: architects and colonizers use their lines to construct the places where we will live. But the rectilinear streets, squares, and public spaces produced in this way leave out people and the entire environmental history of their coming together. How, this book asks, can we explain the omission of bodies from maps and plans? And how can we redraw the lines maps and plans use so that the qualitative world of shadows, footprints, comings and goings, and occasions—all essential qualities of places that incubate sociality—can be registered? In short, Dark Writing asks why we represent the world as static when our experience of it is mobile. It traces this bias in Enlightenment cartography, in inductive logic, and in contemporary place design. This is the negative critique. Its positive argument is that, when we look closely at these designs on the world, we find traces of a repressed movement form. Even the ideal lines of geometrical figures turn out to contain traces of earlier passages; and there are many forms of graphic design that do engage with the dark environment that surrounds the light of reason. How can this "dark writing"—so important to reconfiguring our world as a place of meeting, of co-existence and sustaining diversity—be represented? And how, therefore, can our representations of the world embody more sensuously the mobile histories that have produced it?

  Abstract: What is “dark writing”? In the first three chapters it referred to the trace of movement that is arrested in spatial representations. A history of journeys, encounters, inclinations, and leaps of faith can be shown to survive in maps and plans once their symbolic character is recognized, and it is these supplementary inscriptions that constitute dark writing. Dark writing alludes to the bodies that go missing in the action of representation. But it does not seek to replace them—to represent them. Aligned to their passage, it registers their passage graphically, as a pattern of traces. In the last three<br>

  Book Title: Christianity in Korea-  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Lee Timothy S.<br>
  Abstract: The volume begins with an accessibly written overview that traces in broad outline the history and development of Christianity on the peninsula. This is followed by chapters on broad themes, such as the survival of early Korean Catholics in a Neo-Confucian society, relations between Christian churches and colonial authorities during the Japanese occupation, premillennialism, and the theological significance of the division and prospective reunification of Korea. Others look in more detail at individuals and movements, including the story of the female martyr Kollumba Kang Wansuk; the influence of Presbyterianism on the renowned nationalist Ahn Changho; the sociopolitical and theological background of the Minjung Protestant Movement; and the success and challenges of Evangelical Protestantism in Korea. The book concludes with a discussion of how best to encourage a rapprochement between Buddhism and Christianity in Korea.<br>

Accused of killing two FBI agents during a confrontation at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, in 1973, Peltier has argued for his innocence. His supporters say that he is a political prisoner, held for upholding Native rights. Conversely, more recent researchers into the American Indian Movement (AIM) and the death of activist Anna Mae Pictou Aquash have sketched AIMʹs own politics as self-aggrandizing and masculinist,¹ and some historians suggest that Peltierʹs importance as a political figure has been exaggerated.² Amid these conflicting views, Peltier has published

Literature is one of the cultural sites that embodies the consequences of this mutation. As Peter Bürger notes, there is a point at which the activity of the philosophes needs to slide from philosophical inquiry into aesthetic production to carry out the project of the autonomy of reason (1992, 8–11). Through this movement, aesthetics in general and the literary domain in particular become the site of absolute freedom in modern societies, that is, a site where<br>

  Abstract: The term “liberalism” has always enjoyed a separate existence away from the constricting, formal, and austere world of political concepts and theories. To be liberal evokes generosity, tolerance, compassion, being fired up with the promise of open, unbounded spaces within which the free play of personality can be aired. Yet the clues to liberalism’s political nature are not hard to detect. Generosity suggests the dispensing of bounties beyond the call of duty—to prioritise justice as the first liberal virtue is unnecessarily reductionist. Tolerance suggests a flexibility, a movement, a diversity—of ideas, of language, and of conceptual content—that<br>

  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Geertz Clifford<br>
  Abstract: Geertz, who once considered a career in philosophy, begins by explaining how he got swept into the revolutionary movement of symbolic anthropology. At that point, his work began to encompass not only the ethnography of groups in Southeast Asia and North Africa, but also the study of how meaning is made in all cultures--or, to use his phrase, to explore the "frames of meaning" in which people everywhere live out their lives. His philosophical orientation helped him to establish the role of anthropology within broader intellectual circles and led him to address the work of such leading thinkers as Charles Taylor, Thomas Kuhn, William James, and Jerome Bruner. In this volume, Geertz comments on their work as he explores questions in political philosophy, psychology, and religion that have intrigued him throughout his career but that now hold particular relevance in light of postmodernist thinking and multiculturalism.

It is not at all Brahms-like or Tchaikovsky-like; it lacks the “great melodies”, those memorable tunes, focused by apodeictic signs, which dominate the symphonies of Mahler’s predecessors. Mahler’s melodies can be bombastic and vulgar, like the “Alma” theme in the Sixth Symphony, or jingling folk-tunes, like the main theme of the first movement of the First, taken from the Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen; they can be veiled quotations from Beethoven and Schubert, from street-songs<br>

In Roxanne Euben's groundbreaking excursion across cultures, geography, history, genre, and genders, travel signifies not only a physical movement across lands and cultures, but also an imaginative journey in which wonder about those who live differently makes it possible to see the world differently.<br>

Paths constitute the basic physical support for movement.

Moral discourse concerns itself with the appropriateness of conduct and action relative to situations. Rather than prevent changes in conduct and character, morality (at least in its cinematic forms) aims to control their flow and regulate their transformation (see Deleuze 1992 on control). The extent and effectiveness of these efforts can be recognized in the regularities of movement they produce. Ethics also involves movement and change, but it is concerned<br>

  Abstract: This chapter focuses on the social consequences that emerged from the Protestant conception of moral authority. My intention here is not, therefore, to make any original contribution to the scholarship on Protestantism, nor to explore extensively the religious foundations of the movement, but to view the Protestant tradition as a foil for the Catholic tradition. The Protestant tradition, as carried by the Anglo-Saxon world, is interesting to observe because of the social consequences of such a break, especially when it is compared to the Catholic societies, which took a different course.<br>

  Abstract: I now wish to deal in a new way with the question as to whether Polanyi’s theory of the double movement is credible. In the previous chapter I argued, with the support of a good number of political economists, that even in the present neoliberal decade such a counter-movement does exist. People continue to defend their habitation against the inroads of the self-regulating market system. Yet the movement is small. Since it exists at the community level, will it ever be strong enough to affect the dominant structures?<br>

  Abstract: It is hard to imagine a more optimistic beginning than the early movement of second-wave feminist theology.¹ Bolstered by the momentum of secular feminism² and by a boundless confidence in the critique of Christian orthodoxy, these pioneering scholars set about the task of liberating all women. It is easy to appreciate this initial enthusiasm. As Rosemary Radford Ruether notes, the fundamental impetus for change was at first simply to challenge the patriarchal notion that women are inferior.³ The fight for equality ensured that feminist scholars across all disciplines would argue for the status of women alongside men, especially in regard<br>

Tracing its roots back to the “Jesus Movement” of the 1960s, the Vineyard is now a denomination that rejects its denominational status, presenting itself as a church-planting “movement.” The Vineyard, however, has effects that exceed its own body (denominational or otherwise): the Vineyard is seen as playing a vital role in the “Californianization” of American Protestantism<br>

  Book Title: Protest Beyond Borders-Contentious Politics in Europe since 1945<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Romanos Eduardo<br>
  Abstract: The protest movements that followed the Second World War have recently become the object of study for various disciplines; however, the exchange of ideas between research fields, and comparative research in general, is lacking. An international and interdisciplinary dialogue is vital to not only describe the similarities and differences between the single national movements but also to evaluate how they contributed to the formation and evolution of a transnational civil society in Europe. This volume undertakes this challenge as well as questions some major assumptions of post-1945 protest and social mobilization both in Western and Eastern Europe. Historians, political scientists, sociologists and media studies scholars come together and offer insights into social movement research beyond conventional repertoires of protest and strictly defined periods, borders and paradigms, offering new perspectives on past and present processes of social change of the contemporary world.<br>

The core of Heidegger’s interpretation consists in showing that the schematism, lying in the middle between the faculties of the sensibility and the understanding, must be understood as a pure form of auto-affection, and that auto-affection must be understood through the flow of time.

  Author(s) Porter Robert<br>
  Abstract: The term ‘poststructuralism’ will first be considered in relation to the play that it bestows on the term ‘structuralism’ in order to outline its double movement of legacy and secession that the former retains in relation to the latter. Before disembowelling, drilling deep into the notion to find its own attributes, it is necessary to make it resonate with the humus that it emerges from. The nature of the relationship between poststructuralism and structuralism presents both an organic link and a mutation, a continuity and a divergence. The lowest common denominator represented by the structuralist thought of Lévi-Strauss, Benvéniste, Genette<br>

  Author(s) Janz Bruce B.<br>
  Abstract: Continental feminist philosophy is a movement of thought unified by the theme of the difference of woman and the difference of the feminine. But it is by no means monolithic in method or content. It begins with Simone de Beauvoir’s existentialist feminism in the 1940s. For de Beauvoir, the free transcendence of the ‘independent woman’ wrests her from linear history and orients her to something more than equal rights for man and woman, something more than egalitarian ideals. With May 1968 a new phase of French feminist theory began, bringing along with it aesthetic experiences, influences from deconstruction, psychoanalysis and<br>

  Author(s) Bowie Andrew<br>
  Abstract: They want to put metaphysics in motion, in action. They want to make it act and make it carry out immediate acts. It is not enough, therefore, for them to propose a new representation of movement; representation is already mediation. Rather, it is a question of producing within the work a movement capable of affecting the mind outside of all representation; it is a question of making movement itself a work … (Deleuze [1968] 1994: 8)<br>

Jean-François Lyotard (1924–98) will no doubt always be identified with the former movement, and he was indeed one of the most powerful and persuasive commentators on postmodernism – if perhaps not always classifiable as a postmodernist as such himself. He tended to present himself as an observer of postmodernism and could be critical of what it involved on occasion (only too able as he put it, ‘to embrace … conflicting perspectives’);¹ but so influential<br>

  Abstract: On December 2005, Evo Morales won Bolivia’s presidential election by one of the widest margins in the country’s democratic history, while his party, Movement Towards Socialism (MAS), gained control of congress. The margin of victory (54 per cent of the votes and 25 percentage points ahead of his closest opponent) was, perhaps, overshadowed by Morales self-identification as an indigenous person and as a staunch critic of the neo-liberal project as neo-colonial and undemocratic. This victory raised many doubts from critics and opponents, who saw Morales as unprepared to assume the responsibilities of governing a country. However, under his leadership Bolivia<br>

  Abstract: The title of this chapter points to two sets of interrelated difficulties.

The second set reflects the intellectually and ideologically crisscrossed connections among the various discourses currently concerned with those relations, including the movement for animal rights, ecological ethics, posthumanist theory, and such fields as primatology and evolutionary psychology. I begin with some general observations on kin and kinds – that is, relations and classifications – and then turn to the increasingly complex play of claims and counter-claims regarding the so-called species barrier.<br>

Its legacy has seen a supposedly preexisting Arcadia touted as ‘authentic’ for a public that misrecognises fabrication for historical fact. Arguably, alienated from their own acts of creation, cultural producers have reified their own constructions, believing likewise that these reflect a sacred essence of ‘natural beauty’. Icons abound.

  Abstract: The cultural history of film has often been rooted in the shifting conceptions of and metaphorical uses of light. Film produces life, movement and action from light, making it seem organic (as light produces life and growth in the natural world), but also uncanny (the creation of life and movement from nothing). That the world is reproduced through the effects of light in photography and film has led numerous critics recently to reassert the uncanny and occult status of the media (Gunning 1995). Indeed light has many occult resonances, from Emanuel Swedenborg, through theories of vitalism, to the metaphorical uses<br>

  Abstract: The literary clinic suggests a profound linkage between biophilosophy and literature. In the biophilosophical tradition of hylomorphism which includes Aristotle and Kant equally, life is isolated from the material it animates, since, as Toscano explains, life ‘cannot organize itself, it can only organize matter’ (Toscano 2006: 36). From the hylomorphic point of view, a self-organising life would be unintelligible, since the forms which organise matter would be indistinguishable from matter itself. Life is thus properly speaking ‘immaterial’ and immortal, the pure formal movement of the concept, while matter is mere lifeless receptivity. Deleuze is critical of this position,¹ and it<br>

Mrs. Ramsay drowns in anguish at the dinner-party she gives in Woolf's To The Lighthouse. Death is a guest in Katherine Mansfield's 'The Garden Party'. Politics sour the evening party in Joyce's 'The Dead'. Have you also noticed the role played by parties in the public intellectual culture of Modernism? A party held in London by Amy Lowell on 17 July 1914, attended by Ezra Pound, Ford Madox Ford, H.D. and Richard Aldington, degenerated into an argument over the nature of Imagism. On 18 May 1922, Proust, Joyce, Picasso, Stravinsky and Diaghilev met at a post-ballet party at Paris's Hotel Majestic: an unrepeatable encounter between Modernism's leading figures. In The Modernist Party, internationally distinguished scholars explore the party both as a literary device and as a social setting in which the movement's creative values were developed.Key Features:* Develops the concept of space, currently of central concern to Modernist scholars* Explores the tensions between Modernism as an aesthetics of intensity and Modernism as a movement of the everyday* Adds a new and vital area of research to investigations of Modernism as the product of intellectual and social networksKeywords: Modernism, Literature, Party, Social Network, Collaboration, Space<br>

  Book Title: Race and the Making of the Mormon People-  Publisher: The University of North Carolina Press<br>
  Author(s): MUELLER MAX PERRY<br>
  Abstract: The nineteenth-century history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Max Perry Mueller argues, illuminates the role that religion played in forming the notion of three "original" American races-red, black, and white-for Mormons and others in the early American Republic. Recovering the voices of a handful of black and Native American Mormons who resolutely wrote themselves into the Mormon archive, Mueller threads together historical experience and Mormon scriptural interpretations. He finds that the Book of Mormon is key to understanding how early followers reflected but also departed from antebellum conceptions of race as biblically and biologically predetermined. Mormon theology and policy both challenged and reaffirmed the essentialist nature of the racialized American experience.The Book of Mormon presented its believers with a radical worldview, proclaiming that all schisms within the human family were anathematic to God's design. That said, church founders were not racial egalitarians. They promoted whiteness as an aspirational racial identity that nonwhites could achieve through conversion to Mormonism. Mueller also shows how, on a broader level, scripture and history may become mutually constituted. For the Mormons, that process shaped a religious movement in perpetual tension between its racialist and universalist impulses during an era before the concept of race was secularized.<br>

  Book Title: Moving Consciously-Somatic Transformations through Dance, Yoga, and Touch<br>
  Publisher: University of Illinois Press<br>
  Author(s): Fraleigh Sondra<br>
  Abstract: The popularity of yoga and Zen meditation has heightened awareness of somatic practices. Individuals develop the conscious embodiment central to somatics work via movement and dance, or through touch from a skilled teacher or therapist often called a somatic bodyworker. Methods of touch and movement foster generative processes of consciousness in order to create a fluid interconnection between sensation, thought, movement, and expression. In Moving Consciously , Sondra Fraleigh gathers essays that probe ideas surrounding embodied knowledge and the conscious embodiment of movement and dance. Using a variety of perspectives on movement and dance somatics, Fraleigh and other contributors draw on scholarship and personal practice to participate in a multifaceted investigation of a thriving worldwide phenomenon. Their goal: to present the mental and physical health benefits of experiencing one's inner world through sensory awareness and movement integration. A stimulating addition to a burgeoning field, Moving Consciously incorporates concepts from East and West into a timely look at life-changing, intertwined practices that involve dance, movement, performance studies, and education.

  Book Title: Veer Ecology-A Companion for Environmental Thinking<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Royle Nicholas<br>
  Abstract: The words most commonly associated with the environmental movement-save, recycle, reuse, protect, regulate, restore-describe what we can do to help the environment, but few suggest how we might transform ourselves to better navigate the sudden turns of the late Anthropocene. Which words can help us to veer conceptually along with drastic environmental flux? Jeffrey Jerome Cohen and Lowell Duckert asked thirty brilliant thinkers to each propose one verb that stresses the forceful potential of inquiry, weather, biomes, apprehensions, and desires to swerve and sheer. Each term is accompanied by a concise essay contextualizing its meaning in times of resource depletion, environmental degradation, and global climate change.<br>

  Abstract: Life begins in whirling. By “life” I do not mean an interior property that distinguishes some things we call “animate” from everything else we call “inanimate.” It is not to be found in the behavior of some magic molecule such as DNA that, in the right circumstances, can turn out replicas of itself. I mean, rather, the potential of a world given in movement to generate the forms of things, to hold them fast, and in turn to portend their dissolution. In a world of life, things are formed as eddies in the flow, that is as centers of stillness<br>

  Book Title: The Thought of Death and the Memory of War-  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
  Abstract: War lays bare death and our relation to it. And in the wars-or more precisely the memories of war-of the twentieth century, images of the deaths of countless faceless or nameless others eclipse the singularity of each victim's death as well as the end of the world as such that each death signifies. Marc Crépon's The Thought of Death and the Memory of War is a call to resist such images in which death is no longer actual death since it happens to anonymous others, and to seek instead a world in which mourning the other whose mortality we always already share points us toward a cosmopolitics. Crépon pursues this path toward a cosmopolitics of mourning through readings of works by Freud, Heidegger, Sartre, Patocka, Levinas, Derrida, and Ricœur, and others. The movement among these writers, Crépon shows, marks a way through-and against-twentieth-century interpretation to argue that no war, genocide, or neglect of people is possible without suspending how one relates to the death of another human being. A history of a critical strain in contemporary thought, this book is, as Rodolphe Gasché says in the Foreword, "a profound meditation on what constitutes evil and a rigorous and illuminating reflection on death, community, and world." The translation of this work received financial support from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.<br>

Nationalism as a mass movement, Hobsbawm indicates, is a final stage, coming after the formation of a state. To generate identification with this “imagined community,”² nationalist movements often call upon already existing constructs of community, what we can term “protonationalist” identities generated by discourses of religion, ethnicity, language, kinship, culture, and earlier “historical<br>

With his “experiment in living,” Thoreau expressed in dramatic and conclusive form the abolitionists’ determination to separate their movement from the civil institutions of the political public sphere and from any positive representation of a people.

This position at the front of the trend might seem to suggest Tarantino’s radicality: as the first, he offers the most decisive step that later filmmakers modify and thereby dilute. But Tarantino’s innovation, though it opens up widespread acceptance of the atemporal mode, actually remains focused on temporality rather than the break from it. In this sense, Tarantino does not belong to the atemporal mode proper but instead remains within traditional cinema’s privileging of the forward movement of time. He is the bridge<br>

  Abstract: Our presentist present is by no means uniform or clear-cut, and it is experienced very differently depending on the position we occupy in society. We are caught up in global movement and accelerated flows, or else condemned to the life of casual workers, living from hand to mouth in a stagnant present, with no recognized past, and no real future either (since the temporality of plans and projects is inaccessible). The present is therefore experienced as emancipation or enclosure, and the perspective of the future is no longer reassuring, since it is perceived not as a promise, but as a threat. Hartog's resonant readings show us how the motor of history(-writing) has stalled and help us understand the contradictory qualities of our contemporary presentist relation to time.<br>

Volume 1 ofChinese History and Cultureexplores how theDaowas reformulated, expanded, defended, and preserved by Chinese intellectuals up to the seventeenth century, guiding them through history's darkest turns. Essays incorporate the evolving conception of the soul and the afterlife in pre- and post-Buddhist China, the significance of eating practices and social etiquette, the move toward greater individualism, the rise of the Neo-Daoist movement, the spread of Confucian ethics, and the growth of merchant culture and capitalism. A true panorama of Chinese culture's continuities and transition, Yü Ying-shih's two-volume Chinese History and Culture gives readers of all backgrounds a unique education in the meaning of Chinese civilization.<br>

  Abstract: Both “individualism” and “holism” are Western concepts whose introduction into Chinese intellectual discourse is a matter of only recent historical development.¹ This does not mean, however, that as categories of analy sis these two concepts are totally inapplicable to the study of early Chinese thought. As a matter of fact, we find in the long history of Chinese political and social thought a wide range of views that can be legitimately characterized as either holistic or individualistic. In this study, the Neo-Daoist movement since the end of the Han dynasty will be explored as an example of one type of<br>

  Abstract: In recent years, the May Fourth Movement has generally been identified as the Chinese Enlightenment. When Chinese authors first gave the movement this new identity in the late 1930s and early 1940s, it was clearly intended as a tribute of the highest possible order by way of analogy. Now that the twentieth century is over, however, the honor originally implied in that identity is fast becoming a dubious one. Indeed, now the dark side of the Enlightenment project centering on the idea of rationality is often perceived as a “failure,” or even worse, as a form of “domination.” It is<br>

  Abstract: The 1960s witnessed the most significant changes in the history of the Roman Catholic Church (and, arguably, in Christianity) since at least the Reformation and Counter-Reformation. A major liturgical reform was announced at the Second Vatican Council of 1962 to 1965 and was subsequently implemented throughout the Church. This reform marked an endorsement of previous calls for change from theologians, liturgy scholars, and ordinary priests around the world; known as the Liturgical Movement, it now has a well-documented historical narrative.¹ Yet in Britain these changes came suddenly to many clergy and faithful, since few had any significant awareness of the<br>

  Abstract: Recent years have brought public mourning to the heart of American politics, as exemplified by the spread and power of the Black Lives Matter movement, which has gained force through its identification of pervasive social injustices with individual losses. The deaths of Sandra Bland, Michael Brown, Freddie Gray, Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice, Walter Scott, and so many others have brought private grief into the public sphere. The rhetoric and iconography of mourning has been noteworthy in Black Lives Matter protests, but David W. McIvor believes that we have paid too little attention to the nature of social mourning-its relationship to private grief, its practices, and its pathologies and democratic possibilities.<br>

  Abstract: Many observers have described Western intellectual and legal histories as moving from notions of fixed and assigned status to notions of individual freedom and rights. Sir Henry Maine’s famous dictum defined progress as the movement from status to contract.¹ Such broadly gauged summaries risk oversimplification and insensitivity to the variety and contestability of understandings of the past. Nonetheless, the contrast between legal orders premised upon status and those premised upon state-guaranteed rights helps to locate notions of abnormal persons and rights analysis as ways for dealing with differences. And as a historical matter, rights analysis in some ways is a<br>

  Book Title: The Light of Knowledge-Literacy Activism and the Politics of Writing in South India<br>

  Author(s): Cody Francis<br>
  Abstract: The Light of Knowledgeis set primarily in the rural district of Pudukkottai in Tamil Nadu, and it is about activism among laboring women from marginalized castes who have been particularly active as learners and volunteers in the movement. In their endeavors to remake the Tamil countryside through literacy activism, workers in the movement found that their own understanding of the politics of writing and Enlightenment was often transformed as they encountered vastly different notions of language and imaginations of social order. Indeed, while activists of the movement successfully mobilized large numbers of rural women, they did so through logics that often pushed against the very Enlightenment rationality they hoped to foster. Offering a rare behind-the-scenes look at an increasingly important area of social and political activism,The Light of Knowledgebrings tools of linguistic anthropology to engage with critical social theories of the postcolonial state.<br>

  Book Title: God and the Gawain-Poet-Theology and Genre in Pearl, Cleanness, Patience and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Hatt Cecilia A.<br>
  Abstract: Pearl, Cleanness, Patience and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight are accomplished examples of four different literary genres and represent some of the finest poetry in Middle English. They are, by turns, fast and funny, powerfully dramatic, gentle and ironic, telling of painful bereavement and the terror of victims of disaster and violence, as well as the comic bewilderment of people entangled in alarmingly mysterious situations. The anonymous poet's evident delight in the pleasures and artistry of courtly life has led some readers to suggest that he was a gifted but complacent frequenter of courts, his attention dedicated to the wealthy and his sympathies to the powerful, and moreover, that his poems pay the merest lipservice to religious observance. God and the Gawain-poet argues that, on the contrary, the poet's wide-ranging engagement with all human life explicitly acknowledges all material creation as God's gift, revelling in its physicality, in bodily senses and movement and the ways a community celebrates itself. Dr Hatt shows how, in exhorting readers to recognize and respond to the narrative of divine gift, he appears as an energetic Christian poet and a humane and compassionate observer. Cecilia Hatt gained her D.Phil from Oxford University.<br>

  Book Title: Spanish Golden Age Poetry in Motion-The Dynamics of Creation and Conversation<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): TORRES ISABEL<br>
  Abstract: The fourteen essays of this volume engage in distinct ways with the matter of motion in early modern Spanish poetics, without limiting the dialectic of stasis and movement to any single sphere or manifestation. Interrogation of the interdependence of tradition and innovation, poetry, power and politics, shifting signifiers, the intersection of topography and deviant temporalities, the movement between the secular and the sacred, tensions between centres and peripheries, issues of manuscript circulation and reception, poetic calls and echoes across continents and centuries, and between creative writing and reading subjects, all demonstrate that Helgerson's central notion of conspicuous movement is relevant beyond early sixteenth-century secular poetics, By opening it up we approximate a better understanding of poetry's flexible spatio-temporal co-ordinates in a period of extraordinary historical circumstances and conterminous radical cultural transformation. Los catorce ensayos de este volumen conectan de una manera perceptible con el tema del movimiento en la poesía española del siglo de oro, sin limitar la dialéctica de la estasis y movimiento a una sola esfera o manifestación única. Entre los multiples enfoques cabe destacar: el cuestionamiento de la interdependencia de la tradición e inovación, de la poesía, del poder y la política, de los significantes que se transforman, de los espacios que conectan y cruzan con los tiempos 'desviados'; análisis de las tensiones entre lo sagrado y lo secular, del conflicto centro-periferia y del complejo sistema de producción, circulación y recepción de los manuscritos; el diálogo con el eco poético a través de los siglos y de los continentes y la construcción creativa del sujeto escritor y/o lector. Al abrir la noción central de Helgerson del "movimiento conspicuo" más allá de la poesía nueva secular, este libro propone un entendimiento más completo de las coordinadas espacio-temporales de la poesía en un periodo de circunstan~<br>

  Abstract: In the domain of religion, the evidence of interactions between different beliefs and practices in the long sixteenth century is inescapable. Whether or not these interactions are part of the Renaissance movement is a more difficult and controversial question. However, the revival of antiquity, especially the “patristic revival” (the renewed interest in Augustine, Jerome and other leading figures of the early Church), was important in the history of Christianity in this period. The writings of the Fathers, which exemplify the Hellenization of Christianity, were influential on Catholics and Protestants alike.<br>

The last day of February was my chosen deadline for unloading its softbound copies at the Board of Graduate Studies in a partly triumphant and partly anticlimactic local ritual known as submission. The week before, Ukraine’s Maidan uprising claimed its largest number of victims yet. The bloodshed continued for several days. February 2014 saw the Maidan movement’s most fatal time.<br>

  Abstract: Karl Marx’s
                  Capitalwas the seminal work of nineteenth-century socioeconomic criticism, generating heated social and political debates in Britain and Ireland. There is a view according to which the social theories proposed by Marx and his friend, Friedrich Engels, were themselves utopian, although both social critics repeatedly emphasized their rejection of nineteenth-century utopian socialism—Marx himself claimed bluntly that it was simply “silly” and “stale” and “reactionary.”¹ During the second half of the nineteenth century, Marxism, in its various shapes and forms, emerged as a powerful movement, making its very palpable presence felt in late-Victorian economic, social, and political discourses<br>

Abstract: The staminal hypothesis was extremely successful and inspired curious elaborations. In 1719 a collection appeared of
            Essays on Providence and on the Physical Possibility of the Resurrection. Published in French, its claim to have been “translated from the English of Dr. B.” for a while turned Boyle into the presumed author. The book has been attributed to Jean‐François Bion, a French priest who converted to Protestantism after being chaplain to Huguenotgalériens.98Bion’s purpose was to elucidate Providence and resurrection physiologically. The will, he explained, has no influence on bodily processes such as the circulation of the blood but can control others (for example, breathing) that are just as essential to life and as much governed by general and immutable laws. The reason why some functions can be voluntarily directed is that they depend on an excess of fluids, with which we are free to do what we want. It is the same, Bion claimed, with Providence. God originally put in nature fluids that lack a determinate function, and these he uses occasionally to alter the course of nature without suspending its laws (see
                  , p. 18). Thus could He stop the movement of the sun and the moon so that Joshua could defeat his enemies (see Josh. 10:12–13) or (a physico‐theological favorite) make the iron axe float on the waters of the river Jordan.E<br>

Abstract: The Planet Friends’ group style was much different from ACES’s and much more like the “default” style delineated above. As for their relation to the wider world, Planet Friends did not identify with any locale in particular; the group’s monthly meetings took place anywhere within a 60‐mile radius of the researcher’s home. In the group, their main reference points were the universe as a whole and the members' own selves. The group bonded on members’ mutual obligation to hear one another out, and a responsibility to respect the monthly host’s plan for a group exercise. Appropriate speech was therapeutic—it was speech that would express one’s feelings about oneself, about the planet or world peace. When a member suggested the group take a position on a current environmental issue, in public, conflict ensued. Another member said that going public in that way might wreck the group, threaten its status as a safe place for personal sharing. It certainly would have meant cultivating a different relation to the world, a different basis for respecting members, and a different set of expectations about speech itself. The group dropped the idea. Planet Friends did not use expressive individualist language to affirm public engagement, the way ACES did. As a group, they did not participate in demonstrations, town meetings, hearings, public education workshops, or campaigns. Yet one individual member ran for office as a Green Party candidate; another supported the Green movement; another supported a local antitoxics group. These campaigns and issues did not get discussed
               in Planet Friends settings. In those settings, with the group style in play, these kinds of political or civic discussions would have been out of bounds. While perceiving one another in the context of Planet Friends, members drew on expressive individualism in a way that was close to what previous scholarship would suggest.<br>

Abstract: Durantis presentation of the three paradigms of the study of language and anthropology in the United States is useful not only for anthropologists but also for discourse analysts. Indeed, one source of modern discourse analysis coincides with the second paradigm described by Duranti, namely, the study of communicative events by Hymes, Gumperz, and others in the ethnography of communication. In fact, it was roughly in the same period (196474) that other developments took place that can be interpreted as historical foundations of discourse studies and as paradigm breaks with formal (structuralist or generative) linguistics, such as text grammar, semiotics, pragmatics, conversation analysis, and the psychology of text processing. In other words, the paradigm shift in anthropology is part of a much more general international movement in which interest has shifted from socially contextfree formal grammar or fixed or elicited data to the more dynamic properties of talk, spontaneous everyday interaction, speech acts, strategic processing, nonverbal communication, and social context, that is, to actual language use and discourse.<br>

Abstract: We have thus followed a strange movement, a sort of coming and going between perceiving subjects and perceived objects, a zoom effect like that of a camera trying to set the right distance with its object in order to achieve a maximum degree of clarity—total transparency. On the one hand, we have seen how the tricky adjustment between the multiplicity of stabilized representations of Hawking and my face‐to‐face interaction with him has fragmented his identity. Like an impressionist painting, distance allows us to see what proximity causes us to lose. The layering of the multiplicity of narratives about Hawking reveals the stable identity of an individual that face‐to‐face contact does not allow. The closer we get to the object‐subject, the further we move from it. We no longer know who or where he is. All the categories we normally use in thinking about a person, a body, a machine, a mind, an interaction, a conversation, a text, and speech are blurred. In his presence, Hawking seems even more difficult to seize than we had imagined. The reason is, first, because, as we have shown, the depth of the social body (the one that talks of the other as much as of itself and allows the accumulation of self‐definitions), normally visible but unnoticed in any interaction, is absent in his case. Second, the internal functioning of the flesh‐and‐blood body, normally invisible, becomes visible and distributed here (the
      Iandlegsare mixed in the same discourse and are detached from the body; they are before him while his voice is next to him, and the flesh‐and‐blood body is collectively taken care of) and omnipresent (it appears at different moments during the interaction). Third, the machine, by the coordination of the actions it allows, disturbs the interaction as much as it creates it. This is where the confusion and fragmentation of identity is pursued by recomposition. Here we follow, step by step, how the machine to which this silent body is attached makes the component~<br>

Abstract: Not only does man know that he does not know himself, even if this were only because within his most intimate depths he discovers an unfathomable memory: “Magna vis est memoriae, nescio quid horrendum, Deus meus, profunda et infinita multiplicitas. Et hoc animus est et hoc ego ipse sum. Quid ego sum Deus? Quae natura sum?” (“Great is the power of memory, an awe‐inspiring mystery, my God, a power of profound and infinite multiplicity. And this is mind, this is I myself. What then am I, my God? What is my nature?”).
         31But above all, man understands, within this impasse, that the one who is alone in knowing him remains for him another, namely, God: “Utrum ita sim, nescio. Minus mihi in hac re notus sum ipse quam tu. Obsecro te, Deus meus, et me ipsum mihi indica” (“Whether I am one or the other I do not know. In this matter I know myself less well than I know you. I beseech you, my God, show me myself”).32Under Augustine’s analysis, man’s incomprehensibility to himself thus takes on yet wider and vaster dimensions. To begin with, as in the Greek fathers, the analysis points out not only the image and likeness of God within man’s incomprehensibility but also a unique privilege held by the human being with regard to all other creatures (which only resemble theirgenus, which is to say, themselves). Next, this incomprehensibility tells man that he goes beyond and exceeds himself, in short that “l’homme passe infiniment l’homme” (“man transcends man”), following the formulation of an exemplary Augustinian: in a word, man passes beyond his own means, man lives above his means.33Finally and above all, according to a strict consequence, only the infinite and incomprehensible can comprehend man, and thus tell him of and show him to himself; only God can reveal man to man, because man only reveals himself by revealing, without knowing it, the one whose image he bears. Not only is it true that “Je est un autre” (I is another), but this other calls himself God within man,~<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur suggests that, for a person, there are a series of dialectics at work in this process of identity narration [
         29]. First, there is explanation and understanding operating in dialectic; a process of interpretation involves a threefold movement of interpretation, understanding, and explanation. In other words, as we saw above, a person interprets a symbol, understands it, and then explains its meaning; Ricoeur argues that this happens regardless of whether we privilege one or the other of two kinds of events—interpretations or facts—because both are present and part of one set of operations. Second, Ricoeur attends to the importance of the dialectic between self and other, which he suggests is multiple in the sense that it is characterized by experience of one’s own body, the self of reciprocity or dialogue with other people, and the dialogue with what can be thought of as the “other within.” The last, he argues, is experienced as conscience. Third, there is the dialectic of identity, which is shaped by narrative in time. Each of these contribute to a dynamic relationship between sameness and selfhood, by which he means that we can be identified in time as the same person, but we also change over time as we develop selfhood.<br>

Abstract: One can find such a coalescence of subaltern religious representations and creation of a politically solidary narrative via intentional hybridization in the works of the Korean
            minjungpoet Kim Chi Ha (1941– ). Kim’s poetry weaves Catholic liberation theology with the antifeudal and anticolonial social vision of the Tonghak religion, which rose as an indigenous religious movement of peasants for democratic revolution in Korea at the turn of the nineteenth century and played a prominent role in the 3.1 Independence Movement of 1919. The Tonghak religion itself was the product of a coalescence of elements of Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, and indigenous beliefs in the subaltern religious and social imagination of the Korean peasantry. In the unfinished talk poem (ballad)The World of Chang Il Tam, one of the works for which he was imprisoned, tortured, and sentenced to life imprisonment by the dictatorial South Korean regime of Park Chung Hee in 1976, Kim merges the symbols of the Eucharist—the mystical body of the deity that is eaten—with the Tonghak teaching of “human being is heaven [in nae chʾǒn]”: “Food is heaven / As we eat / God enters us / Food is heaven. / Oh, food / Should be shared and eaten by all.” See Kim Chi Ha,The Gold‐Crowned Jesus and Other Writings, ed. Chong Sun Kim and Shelly Killen (Maryknoll, N.Y.: Orbis, 1978), 13–39. See also hisSaengmyǒng(Seoul: Sol, 1992), 132–49. Kim’s religiously hybrid poetic vision has been one of the mainsprings of inspiration for South Korea’sminjungtheology.

Abstract: The parabolic dimension of Christ’s narrative not only guards the singularity of Christ’s identity; Frei sees the application of the “Christlike pattern” to history as requiring that we see events as parables, obscurely and only partially interpretable. In the parabolic, dark light of Christ’s identity we thereby come to glimpse the uniqueness of other events and identities as well: “His specific identity is such that others cannot merge into a common indistinguishable identity with him; instead they find that their own specific and unsubstitutable identity becomes sharply accentuated by relation to Jesus’ own identity.”
         26While we cannot read the story of Jesus onto history in any clear and distinct way, we can see patterns of Christlike death and resurrection in various places in our world and history—the civil rights movement being foremost among others when Frei wrote this text (as if it isn’t today!): “Surely the pattern of this agony and hope may be discerned in such instances as a nation of brothers fighting a civil war to purge itself of the curse of slavery and so achieve concretely a union previously little more than a contractual arrangement. One may dimly discern the same pattern in the equally agonized and uncertain fight of the same nation to complete the unfinished task of reconciliation of those who have lived in estrangement from each other because of racial discrimination.”27It is clear, then, that Frei does not see the literal narrative as separating Christ’s narrative from history, so much as providing a way toreadhistory that can do justice to the contingent, aleatory character of events and identities, both within scripture and beyond.<br>

Abstract: Not that there were no suggestions for the transformation of the mausoleum in Bulgaria. They were plentiful and diverse. Some were in line with the Havana spirit: turn the mausoleum into a brewery, a discotheque, public toilets. There was an elaborate proposal to create a Madame Tussaud museum in the mausoleum with the figures of kings, political and revolutionary leaders, writers, composers, athletes.
         83Most were serious, even solemn. The famous artist Svetlin Rusev thought the structure could become a museum of sculpture.84The British historian of Bulgaria Richard Crampton, in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation, suggested that the mausoleum be turned into a monument for victims of totalitarianism.85The historian Nikolay Genchev thought it would be appropriate to make it into a monument dedicated to the fallen in various wars.86The BCP leader Alexander Paunov wanted it transformed into a pantheon of martial glory.87The political movement Gergyovden initially suggested that the mausoleum be left alone and made into a futuristic symbol.88Later, it backed the initiative of its members from Dimitrovgrad, a city that was built by the enthusiastic labor of Communist brigades in the 1940s and 1950s and that refused to change its name in the 1990s: these citizens asked for the remains of the mausoleum, which they wanted to place in a “lane of the rejected” together with other Communist monuments that had been pulled down in the past decade in different parts of the country.89Other suggestions involved turning it into the largest disco club in the Balkans, or a department of the National Library or of the National Historical Museum, or an exhibition place with a large sundial measuring the time after the regime's collapse.90<br>

Abstract: A fourth and final method in the study of childhood can be found in some of the ways that sociology and other social sciences have been applied to children in the United States, where the focus is again more frequently around the specific arena of marriage and families. Beginning around the same time in the late 1980s as the above Europeans, American sociologists such as Sarah McLanahan, Gary Sandefur, David Popenoe, Alan Wolfe, William Goode, and Linda Waite have investigated the impacts of marriage and divorce on children in terms of broad social outcomes like poverty, education, health, and general social capital.
         15Some of this research is partnered with the marriage movement mentioned above. However, it focuses less on what it takes therapeutically to create strong marriages and families and more on the consequences of marriage and its disruption on children’s broad social well‐being (as well as the resulting well‐being of society). Unlike in the above originally European politico‐sociological model, this family‐sociological model places less emphasis on children’s agency and diversity than on their social vulnerability and their dependency on families for social mediation.<br>

Author(s): Kern Stephen <br>
Abstract: Kern’s analysis is lucid and his thesis is ultimately persuasive. He argues that “the novel is emphatically historical in capturing a new sense of the complexity and uncertainty of causal understanding” as he traces the “sensitivity” of contemporary authors like Don DeLillo to “the significance of the new technologies of transportation, communication and investigation that transformed causal understanding in modern society” (p. 369). This is an observation with which many literary critics would agree. There are resemblances here to the methodology deployed by Ronald Thomas in his seminal and startlingly successful work
   Detective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science(Cambridge, 1999): narrative registers in its very construction the pressures of scientific and epistemological change. Yet a comparison with Thomas’s work reveals perhaps one of the few flaws of Kern’s study. IfA Cultural History of Causalityis directed toward the historian of science, one must question whether novels are ever really adequate source material for the construction of a hypothesis regarding nonfictional understandings of causality and probability. Paul Ricoeur reminds us inTime and Narrative(Chicago, 1984–1988) that literature has been seen since ancient times as “an ethical laboratory where the artist pursues through the mode of fiction experimentation with values” (Vol. 1, p. 59): fiction is thus both tethered to, yet at the same time distinct from, the world of the actual and the real. Kern acknowledges this to be so, yet his theory of mimesis, of realistic representation, seems to exclude any genuine engagement with tropes of playfulness, indeterminacy, symbolism, and ambiguity that mark literature just as deeply as any desire to replicate the real.

Abstract: Human community under such fragile circumstances constantly devolves into a community of mere difference alone. The original sin, from a poetic point of view, is the failure to embrace our own deeper capabilities for creating ever more inclusive social worlds. The possibility for a living creative tension among others is on some level always already defeated by the use of human creative faculties in merely limited ways, by historical stasis and consolidations of power, and by all too human anxieties that leave us naked and ashamed before one another. In symbolic terms, the invisible “fruitfulness” of social generativity in the image of a Creator is inevitably (if understandably) overcome by the idolatrous temptation of the visible “fruit” of a fixed and tangible “knowledge of good and evil.” The products of creative life are mistaken for creative life itself. Moral uncreativity is perhaps similar in this respect to bad literature: repetitive of worn‐out clichés (as also in Hannah Arendt’s description of the overwhelming reliance on clichés by Adolf Eichmann), lacking a more inclusive movement and tension, or uninvested with openness to larger and wider meaning.
         35In any case, the challenge for us morally creative beings is to turn tensions of fear and division in human relations into tensions of inclusive production and multiplication. It is to imitate the Creator’s perfect Sabbath, which is no mere final stasis but a living harmony of the ongoing differences between night and day, land and water, plants and animals, and the whole Creation in all its marvelous and interacting diversity. The expulsion from the Garden of Eden is a loss, from this perspective, not of placid amoral inactivity but of the vital capability for generating, on the basis of human multiplicity and otherness, an ever more complex and diverse narrative of humankind.<br>

Abstract: The historical movements that reflected the regime of mixed temporalities invariably envisaged a different relationship between experience and expectation. When such movements and groups experience misfortune, for example, they must define the present by historicizing and temporalizing the asymmetrical interplay of the past and the current situation. In this regard, history is not only the locus of uneven rhythms, the collision of coexisting temporalities and difference, as Samir Amin once proposed; it is also the scene where the ghosts of the past comingle daily with the living (a little like the cohabitation of dead and living labor), in a habitus of a haunted house. This observation recalls both the initial separation of memory and history and the effort to clearly differentiate their respective domains precisely because of the messiness of always colliding temporalities. Significantly, historiography—that is, national history and narrative—invariably socializes the domain of the uncanny and makes it familiar through the construction of what has been called “‘historical’ memory.”
         14For Koselleck, who designated the distinctively modern in terms of historical time, “experience is present past, whose events have been incorporated and can be remembered.” Similarly, expectation also occurs in the today and signals the “future made present” (FP,p. 272). Clearly, it is oriented toward a not yet, toward a realm of nonexperience, an unrealized though reachable horizon. The horizon of expectation comes from the future and provides the direction toward which experience in the present must necessarily move, without, at the same time, imprisoning movement in a preestablished route, even though the direction has already been prefigured by a conception of progress whose realization remains untranscendable. It is important to recognize how this temporal order leads to comparison and the figuration of the noncontemporaneous contemporary as a sign of retarded achievement~<br>

Abstract: This is the clearest signal that, for Smith, Enoch represents an antecedent to the Abrahamic covenant that “I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee” (see Genesis 17 and 22:15–18). For extension of the Abrahamic covenant to the Christian movement, see, e.g., Luke 16:22–23 (the righteous to rest in the bosom of Abraham) and Gal. 3:8 and 29 (through Christ, the Gentiles become the seed of Abraham and “heirs according to the promise”). For Smith’s elaboration on this covenant, see the Book of Abraham 2.<br>

Abstract: The question of genre is a vexed and much disputed one, too complex to be fully addressed here (see, e.g., Derrida
            1981and Marcus1994). My point is that in the late 1980s and early 1990s, increasing critical attention was given to feminist intertextuality and metafiction (see, e.g., Greene1991a; Barr1993; and Boehm1995), identified as forms, movements, or genres of their own. The rewritings and re‐visions I am concerned with here can be identified as belonging to what Gayle Greene terms “a movement in contemporary … women’s fiction” that she defines as “a form of feminist fiction—feminist metafiction—that concerns women writers’ relation to ‘the tradition’” (1991a, 1). Compare also Peter Widdowson, who speaks of a “sub‐genre of contemporary fiction” (2006, 496).<br>

New York: Cam- bridge University Press. 2003. Pp. xiii, 527. $60.00. In reviewing for this journal the first two volumes of J. G. A. Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters. Gibbon's readers had to wait until 1781 for the story to pick up again. Exposition of this "first decline and fall" in fact occupies only the ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives.

Abstract: Schopenhauer’s rejection of individual will’s self‐serving egoism bespeaks a greater concordance than he is willing to acknowledge between his views and Augustine’s avocation of the perfectibility of
         voluntas. As discussed, to Augustine the harder one’s individual intention strives to coincide with love, the better one gets to know oneself; and the better one gets to know oneself, the more diaphanous becomes the diaphragm separating one’s real self from its ideal reflection in the mirror of introspection. Self‐knowledge is self‐making in Augustine, and this self‐making consists of the transformative self‐denial whereby one purposefully modifies one’s own will until a coincidence is reached between desire and love. Schopenhauer accuses Augustine of “expressing in a naïve way” the role played by will in one’s self‐determination. According to Schopenhauer, when Augustine draws an analogy inDe civitate Deibetween “gravity [as] the motion of the body” and “love [as] the motion of the soul,” he is confusing the “real necessity” bestowed on both motions by the same cause, that is, by the self‐deployment of will in time and space, with the soul’sliberum arbitrium indifferentiae, that is, the undifferentiated free will whereby the soul, contrary to the body’s deterministic fate, chooses its own destiny.56There is no “undifferentiated free will,” hence no perfectible self in Schopenhauer; one either succumbs to the necessity of will’s self‐deployment or affirms one’s freedom by obstructing it, by boycotting it. Schopenhauer is an Augustinian reductionistmalgré soi—a revisionist of Augustine’s avocation of the perfectibility of the self. Schopenhauer’s reductionism is reflected in the lack of direction intrinsic to his project of self‐emancipation from the dominion of will. In Augustine the obstruction of the instinctive drive of self‐interest is a figuratively upward movement (momentum), deriving its direction from the self‐abnegation, the weightlessness of love;57in~<br>

Author(s): Schweiker William<br>
Abstract: The title of the lecture trades on a double entendre that is meant to name a current worry about religion and the human future. How can religions be humanized so that they might help to forge a viable future rather than reduce the world to violence and ignorance, and, conversely, how, if at all, are the religions humanizing forces that invigorate the human spirit in global times when existence seems increasingly flattened and drained of depth? The idea of humanizing religion designates a double movement of thought that can be undertaken in different ways within diverse disciplines, traditions, and communities. However, it must be admitted that the idea of humanizing religion marks out contested ground in the academy and indeed throughout the world. Religion and humanism are often at odds and sometimes violently so. I take it for granted that each of us has some awareness of these ongoing global clashes. I will not explore them in detail.
         2Yet theological ethics, I submit, must be reconceived in order to meet these and other global challenges. Accordingly, the interactions among humanism, religion, and the reconstruction of theological ethics are the specific topic of the reflections that follow.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur,  Paul<br>
Abstract: This volume is something of a companion to Ricoeur’s earlier collection,
      The Just(Chicago, 2000), but positions the question differently. Ricoeur characterizes the aim of the earlier volume as a focused treatment of the relationship between justice as a moral ideal and justice as a system of institutions. “In the present volume, the adjective ‘just’ is traced back to its terminological and conceptual source, as we find it in Plato’s Socratic dialogues” (1). The volume is divided into three parts, titled respectively, “Studies,” “Readings,” and “Exercises.” This tripartite structure is one that appears constantly in Ricoeur's work. The essays in the first section isolate the idea of justice. In this initial section, Ricoeur brings thought to bear on the principal phenomenological structures through which the problematic of justice manifests itself: the necessary distance introduced into the question of justice by the imposition of a rule of justice, the relation of passivity and autonomy in the articulation of the imperative of justice, the paradoxical nature of authority, and the aporia that opens between the reflection of justice as an abstract, transhistorical ideal and justice as a historically conditioned set of institutional practices. The essays in the second section place the idea in the context of thought about justice. The principal figures who come into the discussion here are Kant, Weber, and Charles Taylor. The essays in the third section deal with the ideal of justice in the realm of practical, or regional, ethics; Ricoeur’s primary interests here are legal and medical ethics and their similarities, differences, and relations. In each of these proceeding sections, issues raised in the first section are taken up and dealt with at a progressively less abstract level. There is then a discernible trajectory that holds these essays together, one that might be characterized, without too much oversimplification, as a movement from abstract structuring of~<br>

Abstract: D'Holbach, in his infamous treatise,
         Système de la nature(1770), echoed and amplified many of Spinoza's monist sentiments. Since the totality of nature is “but an immense chain of causes and effects that ceaselessly follow from one to the other,” it stood to reason that the self does not possess “independent energy, an isolated cause,” or “detached action” from its fellow beings. An empirical investigation of the natural world suffices to prove that “man is in each instance of his life a passive instrument in the hands of necessity.”51Nor is the divine afforded any greater latitude of thought or movement. While it is ironic that d'Holbach chose to present nature as a speaking and seeing goddess in the final pages of his treatise, he repeatedly stressed that nature should not be regarded as a subject, divine or otherwise, despite apparent indications to the contrary: “When I say that nature produces an effect, I do not at all claim to personalize it. … We cannot call nature intelligent in the manner of some of the beings it encompasses.”52<br>

Abstract: Here, once again we find a collection of verbs in the present, some both reflexives and neologisms, which simultaneously render eternal action and linguistic impossibility (because of the neologisms) while eliding the difference between the actor and action: “s'infiora” (enflower themselves), a neologism; “si ritorna” (return themselves); “s'insapora” (ensavors itself), a second neologism; “s'addorna” (adorns itself); “risaliva” (re-ascends), and “soggiorna” (abides). With the reflexives and the present tense, Dante emphasizes the perpetual movement of angels as they sing God's praises; with the linguistic play of the neologisms he conveys the impossibility of actually describing them; and by likening them to their analogy in the created world, bees, he also heightens our awareness that in the actions of bees we can see something of the divine realm in our world of nature. This focus on the detail of creaturely action, through the verbs and this observable natural environment, once more overcomes the separation between the transcendent and the immanent, sign and signified, vehicle and referent, with the analogy hinting that alterity can become sameness or, as Badiou puts it, poetry's melding with philosophy allows it to bond object and subject and to overcome the rupture between what would otherwise be two modes of discourse.

Abstract: Various features come to the fore. First, there is the formal aspect of time as present. Since its integral nature would seem to make time look like eternity, and since eternity has got everything to do with the “present of the present,” it is important to keep the two apart while at the same time honoring their affinity. In its capacity of enduring attention, it can be reduced neither to a point nor to the uncertainties of historicity pure and simple: it passes in a point. Second, the absence of a
      distinctio realisof future, present, and past inside the flux of time eliminates any possible chain of cause and effect. Thus the will can never be seen to establish a future for its own sake, since such a move presupposes a distinctness that would never allow that future to turn into atemps perduas if there were a real distance between past and future. Third, it would be wide of the mark to conclude from this “foregrounding” of temporality that the dimensions of the future and the past would be flattened. Rather, the contrary may be the case. Precisely in this prism of the present, “contingent events” break into myriads of presents, futures, and pasts. As for this “foregrounding” of time, what obtains for Joyce and Proust does so a fortiori for Augustine. Fourth, there is the issue of consciousness, for, far from floating in the air, time for Augustine is firmly embedded in consciousness: “All [manifestations of] time [alle Zeiten] are subjected to the movement, never to come to rest, of the actual flux of consciousness and are to flow into each other uninterruptedly.” To put it in Augustine's own words: “So, it is in you, my mind, that I measure periods of time.”
            Quite. But to be able to establish a link between, respectively, life as gift, time as the shift between future, present and past, and a sustained arrogation of voice, no allowances can be made for even the slightest gaps between those manifestations of time and of consciousness as if consciou~<br>

Author(s): Vásquez Manuel A.<br>
Abstract: When viewed against his background and his prior research—and I mean this in no way as either reductive or an ad hominem—it is not surprising that Vásquez would opt for realism. Born in El Salvador, he attended the
      Colegio
         Externado San José, a secondary school run by Jesuits seeking to implement the more radical social teachings of Vatican II. As he relates in the preface to his first book,The Brazilian Popular Church and the Crisis of Modernity(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998), his education at this a radical time proved a formative influence on his outlook. This first book is a sociological study of a specific group of people participating in the “popular church” movement in Brazil. His more recent workGlobalizing the Sacred: Religion across the Americas(New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 2003), which he coauthored with Marie F. Marquardt, looks again at concrete groups as they perform their religion in a variety of contexts and as these contexts are affected by the processes of globalization. The place theory holds for him and his theoretical disposition follow logically from his training as a sociologist. He is a realist as described above (he describes his position in this debate as “cultural realism” [6]). He engages in theory because: “I do theory for a more ‘therapeutic’ purpose: to disentangle some of the epistemological knots that have characterized the discipline of religion as [a] way to provide fallible yet effective tools to explore the rich and diverse everyday activities of situated actors who have come to identify what they do as religious” (9). Theory, then, is a tool, that is, a secondary element that comes after the solid research is completed.<br>

Abstract: Beyond this sampling of monographic treatments of witchcraft, I can only briefly allude to the tenor in relation to evil in a limited selection of edited collections. The volume edited by Kapferer (
         2002) stands firmly on the shoulders of Evans-Pritchard in beginning with and moving beyond the problem of rationality. One direction of this movement is emphasis on the “human-centric, person-centered and social nature of witchcraft’s practical reason that gives prime force to human agency” (7), and the assertion that “Sorcery fetishizes human agency, often one which it magically enhances, as the key mediating factor affecting the course or direction of human life-chances” (105).
               Another is the conjunction of witchcraft and sorcery with the conditions of modernism, postmodernism, the state, and postcoloniality, pushing analysis toward mythopoesis, metacosmology, and the imaginary rather than toward morality, while yet acknowledging their inherent violence and the monstrosity of their symbolism and practice. In contrast to this approach, the volume edited by Whitehead and Wright (13
            2004) on witchcraft and sorcery practiced by “dark shamans” in Amazonia directly confronts both the lethal violence and socio-cosmological centrality of these practices. This strategy avoids playing into either a renewal of irrationalizing colonial demonization in the name of suppression or romanticizing contemporary rehabilitation in the name of cultural diversity. Thus, Amazonian shamanism is a “predatory animism,” and in this sense its key symbol of the jaguar should be understood not as an endangered species but as a dangerous predator (Fausto2004:171). The witch or dark shaman is “the embodiment of evil in the world” because they “lack empathy for other humans and act for purely personal motives” (Heckenberger2004:179). For the Arara people there are explicit connections among morality, sorcery, and banishment with respect to people who forgo generosit~<br>

Article Title: From Religionless Christianity to Immanent Grace: Bonhoeffer’s Legacy in Badiou<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 677726<br>
Date: 10 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Urbaniak Jakub<br>
Abstract: Let’s go back to Bonhoeffer. The God of Jesus, instead of being banished to religious exile—either that of metaphysics or that of inferiority—must be proclaimed and realized in a religionless-worldly manner. A nonreligious interpretation stemming from the movement deeper into the world aims at disclosing the meaning of biblical concepts for our earthly life here and now.
            
                  What does acting on the words of Jesus mean in practice? Bonhoeffer, whose late theology remains of a fragmentary character, was unable to outline a program of practicing a nonreligious Christian existence in the midst of the world. Yet, he left us several guidelines. The content of Christian life in the world come of age, as a guiding concept, is described in his texts either in the pair “prayer” and “discipleship” or is expanded into the triad “prayer,” “action,” and “waiting.”101
               
                  “Discipleship” or “righteous action among people” are, in turn, connected with the notion of “being for others.” The religionless Christian is “the person who lives from within the transcendent,”102
               
                  that is, the person who through faith participates in Jesus’s being for others. For Bonhoeffer, our relation to God must express itself in a new life in “existence for others,” through participation in the being of Jesus, that is his incarnation, cross, and resurrection.103
               
                  Belonging wholly to the world and living for others without claiming cultural or spiritual privilege, without regarding oneself as “religiously” favored is then essential, decisive, and normative to religionless faith. Only such an attitude can enable a Christian to overcome the forces that separate the world from God, religion from reality, and faith from life.104
               
                  In Bonhoeffer’s view, the previous religious language of the church was incapable of expressing what life in Christ and disciples~<br>

Author(s): Gutterman David S.<br>
Abstract: Beyond this, Gutterman provides good historical accounts of each movement (although the most recent scholarship is not always cited), yet his feel for the nuances of his case studies' religiosity could be strengthened. At times he invokes antiquated or contested categories: “mainstream Protestantism” (p. 52), “religious revivalism” (p. 2), or “culture wars” (p. 134). Further, while Exodus is clearly an important narrative, it is perplexing that Gutterman focuses relatively little on each group's Christology. One might usefully explore the centrality of Mark or Acts to CTR, or of Galatians to King, for example.<br>

Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: ca.2006.25.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 2006<br>
Author(s): Moatti Claudia<br>
Abstract: AbstractThis paper isolates movement as a topic for analysis in Roman imperial history. Movement is regarded under three aspects: translation (of texts, practices, ideas), migration (of officials, merchants, students, etc.), and communication (i.e. the movement of written documents). Interrelationships among the three aspects of movement are identified and discussed, as are the shared impact of translation, migration, and communication on issues of cultural and social identity and political negotiation and control. The article argues that movement changes the role of the state as well as relations between individual and states, augments the use of writing in society, transforms identities, and gives impulse to internal and external regulations. The implications of movement are understood as both pragmatic and formal, altering relations to space and time and influencing ways of organizing and thinking. The author surveys current work in the field and identifies potential areas for future research. The paper draws heavily on both literary and documentary sources and discusses material from the late republic through late antiquity, paying particular attention to continuities and discontinuities between early and later periods of the Roman empire.<br>

Abstract: Maybeck scholars argue that in spite of the affinity of his earlier projects with architecture of the Arts and Crafts movement, his approach was too individual and intuitive to be confined within any artistic style of the time. They also report that Maybeck did not appreciate the latest examples of Art Nouveau and Secessionist architecture, to which he was introduced during his European tour in 1897–98 (Cardwell,
               Bernard Maybeck, 43; Woodbridge,Bernard Maybeck,77). However, the influence from John Ruskin and William Morris's theories on Maybeck's early projects is also widely acknowledged. Woodbridge in particular states that Maybeck interest in these theories brought him close to Charles Keeler and some other influential thinkers in San Francisco Bay Area; Woodbridge,Bernard Maybeck,24, 26.<br>

Abstract: Abstract.
         Gadamer's pursuit inTruth and Methodof an applicative literary hermeneutics modeled on legal hermeneutics earns him the status of a precursor to the emergence of what is known in North America as the “literature and law movement.” Attentive to the debates and controversies surrounding this movement, this article seeks to explore an interpretive interzone in which the judge and the literary critic, if they apply themselves to a poetics of elasticity, might be of exemplary significance to each other. The notion of “exemplarity” does not, however, imply a mechanical appropriation of the practices of the one by the other, but a mutually nuanced and complicated approximation of the strengths of each by the other. In the light of this normative poetics of proximity and distance, Dworkin's model of the “chain novel” is assessed and supplemented by (an alternative) model grounded in Foucault's genealogy of authorship as expounded in his article “What Is an Author?”<br>

Abstract: The thematic uniformity of the movement brings to the fore other musical parameters. Particularly important here are the roles of texture and sheer quality of sound—aspects of the musical experience that are hallmarks of Mozart's engagement with variation. In this pared-down environment, the understated yet virtuosic treatment of the instrumental forces—so characteristic of his later works—plays a form-defining role.<br>

Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: ncm.2012.36.issue-1<br>
Date: July 2012<br>
Abstract: Framed in such a way, the early movements of Mahler's Second Symphony—characterized by the alternation between halting sections that dissolve almost as soon as they begin and long-breathed melodies that seem to unfold effortlessly—suggest the melancholic subject's struggle between despair in the face of abject meaninglessness and a manic euphoria, neither of which addresses the loss. By contrast, the text in the symphony's final movement, adapted by Mahler from Friedrich Klopstock's chorale on the resurrection of the dead, encourages true remembrance of the deceased as a figure beyond death. Heard as a musical enactment of mourning, the final movement suggests that the dead who are mourned are resurrected through remembrance. Forcing us to acknowledge Mahler's death on some level, the final movement completes the work of mourning by engendering the composer's own resurrection in our memories as we witness each performance of his Second Symphony.<br>

Author(s): Selby Gary S.<br>
Abstract: Abstract:This essay argues that in 1 Thessalonians, Paul uses eschatological discourse—language about the end of hme—in order to evoke a symbolic world-view in which his readers become God's elect, living at the end of time and awaiting the sudden, imminent retum of Christ from heaven. This self-identification explains their present misfortunes, while at the sam.e time demanding that they fulfill the ethical and moral demands of the Christian faith. More broadly, this essay points to the role that eschatological discourse played within early Christianity in general, suggesting that it formed a central, paradigmatic drama which helped to define ontological and teleological reality for the movement's adherents.<br>

Publisher: Taylor & Francis Group<br>
Issue: i260667<br>
Date: 10 1, 1931<br>
Author(s): Woolf Steph<br>
Abstract: This article is concerned with the ways in which women narrate a move from a 'working-class' position to a position marked (in however fragmentary and complex a way) as 'middle class'. While such a move might be seen in terms of a straightforward escape from a disadvantaged social position, I argue here that what has to be analysed is the pain and the sense of estrangement associated with this class movement. Drawing on the class narratives of a group of seven white British women, the article uses Bourdieu's concepts of symbolic capital and habitus to explore the cultural and symbolic configurations of class. These configurations may be inscribed into the self, so that the self, itself, is class marked. Since working-class selves are frequently marked in pathological terms, this raises particular difficulties for the idea of an 'escape' from such a position. Class in this sense is embedded in people's history and so cannot be so easily 'escaped'. The usual conventions of life-narratives - in which the self remains the same entity from birth to death and later events are a culmination of earlier ones - are also disrupted in this case. But if a working-class position is marked as pathological, so too is taking on the markers of middle-class existence. to do so is not only to risk 'getting it wrong', but it is also to risk the scorn attached to 'pretentiousness'. There is a particular jeopardy here for women, since it is women who have been especially associated with desires for artefacts associated with bourgeois existence. The article argues for a focus for classed desires and class envy, not in pathological terms, but in terms of a coherent response to political and social exclusions.<br>

Article Title: Is Zoroastrianism Dualistic or Monotheistic?<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263718<br>
Date: 12 1, 1961<br>
Author(s): Zaehner Donald A.<br>
Abstract: The question raised in the title has been much debated by past and present interpreters of Zoroastrianism. In the first two parts of this paper we present some dualistic and monotheistic interpretations of the religion. The interpretations can be labeled as follows: 1. DUALISTIC INTERPRETATIONS 1. The View That Angra Mainyu Is Primordial But Lacks Omnipotence And Omniscience (Dhalla, Henning) 2. The View That Angra Mainyu Is Primordial But Lacks A Physical Nature (Shaked, Boyce) II. MONOTHEISTIC INTERPRETATIONS 1. The Created Spirits View (Zaehner, Fox, Gershevitch) 2. The Transformationist (Maskhiyya) View 3. The Zurvānite View 4. The View That Good And Evil Are Coeternal Only In A Logical Sense (Moulton, Bode and Nanavutty, Duchesne-Guillemin) We present each of these views and discuss it critically in light of the following criteria: (1) textual evidence; (2) the continuity of the religion throughout its history, including the present time; (3) philosophical cogency; and (4) religious satisfaction. Our conclusion is that each of the above positions, despite its elements of strength, falls seriously short of one or more of these criteria, and hence that there is need for a more adequate interpretation of Zoroastrianism than any of them can offer. Accordingly, we present another interpretation in order to provoke further discussion and, hopefully, to advance the cause of trying to gain a more precise grasp of the teachings of this remarkable religion. In brief, the interpretation we favor is that Zoroastrianism combines cosmogonic dualism and eschatological monotheism in a manner unique to itself among the major religions of the world. This combination results in a religious outlook which cannot be categorized as either straightforward dualism or straightforward monotheism, meaning that the question in the title of this paper poses a false dichotomy. The dichotomy arises, we contend, from a failure to take seriously enough the central role played by time in Zoroast~<br>

Article Title: Toward a Generic Analysis of a Classic of the Social Gospel: An Essay-Review of Walter Rauschenbusch<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263714<br>
Date: 12 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Rauschenbusch Walter<br>
Abstract: Walter Rauschenbusch's Christianity and the Social Crisis, viewed by many as the masterpiece of the social gospel movement, has been confined to the dusty shelves of the library. Can we catch no glimpse of what astounded its massive reading public, no glimmer of Rauschenbusch's own sense of the work as a "dangerous book" written in fear and trembling? This article suggests that a generic analysis of Christianity and the Social Crisis might lead to surprising disclosures. Any generic analysis involves the discussion of a group of texts. Consequently this study proceeds via a comparison of the structure of Christianity and the Social Crisis with those of other works of a similar type which were produced between 1890 and 1915. The genre is isolated by utilizing the techniques of Tzvetan Todorov. Certain negative traits are specified which separate the genre from its neighbors. The positive leitmotif of a dual crisis-a crisis affecting society as a whole and the ramifications of that crisis within the Christian churches-is specified as the decisive trait of the genre. To deal with this leitmotif a specific structure was generated by the works under consideration. They provided-to pirate the words of Clifford Geertz in his landmark essay on modern ideologies-"maps of problematic reality" and "matrices for the creation of collective conscience." In designing their maps of problematic reality our authors worked along two separate but related vectors. The first of these vectors was constituted by a historical analysis of the origins of the present crisis, while the second consisted of a systemic analysis of the present social order. Each of these elements of the genre is examined in turn. The mapping of problematic reality by means of a historical and a structural analysis was geared towards provoking as well as defining the crisis. Crisis, once defined, demanded decision. Nevertheless the "permanent basis for action" which Rauschenbusch and others sought could not be groun~<br>

Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263719<br>
Date: 3 1, 1974<br>
Author(s): Weiss Richard<br>
Abstract: Anyone who wishes to understand the debate between Hegel and Schleiermacher is forced to confront not only the staggering complexity of their thought but also the disparate nature of the key texts which are available and the fact that many philosophers and theologians approach Hegel and Schleiermacher with misleading preconceptions. This article attempts to illuminate the conflict between the two thinkers by exploring the biographical and historical context in which it arose. The author argues that, while neither thinker depended upon the other in forming his own position, each man kept the other's position constantly in view as a foil for his own. After a consideration of some early indications of conflict, the debate between Hegel and Schleiermacher is traced through a series of events which begins with Hegel's call to Berlin. While Schleiermacher was apparently quite willing to have Hegel come to Berlin, differences in political philosophy soon led to conflict, with the student movement providing a concrete focus for their disagreement. Schleiermacher's role in excluding Hegel from the Berlin Academy of Sciences is shown to have heightened the tensions. The article concludes with an exploration of Hegel's critique of Schleiermacher's dogmatics. It is argued that the intellectual core of the conflict between the two men centers upon the problem of immediate knowledge.<br>

Abstract: Creativity is seen as inherent in the developmental potential of the individual and of society as well. This "yen for becoming" is felt at all ages, and is in fact recognized as associated with the realization of the profoundest aspirations of man. Its origin is detected in early childhood. It is deeply rooted in the associative trend of thought and action, a trend which tends to perpetuate itself in the direction of unending abundance and novelty. The process assumes passage from awareness to memory, and even to the subconscious. The thought of the moment dips into the past, awakens memories, even those seemingly forgotten, reactivates all that is pertinent for the creation of new structures. It is believed that this tendency is essentially dynamic, endowed with energy which drives toward endless realizations. Nothing dies in the subconscious, as Freud pointed out. Each past experience is apt to return into consciousness and engage in a double process of homogenization and heterogenization, of convergent and divergent currents. Here the combinations, or commutations and permutations, are indefinite, an array which defies any computer. Creativity calls into play all energized experiences, present and stored, cognitive and affective, perceptual and conceptual, sensory and motoric, verbal and non-verbal, taxonomic and functional, real and symbolic; it constantly provokes new patterns. The richer the content of experience, the greater the possibility of innovation. The creative construction starts with the activation of readily available knowledge, the elements of which trigger related material in the memory and the subconscious. The movement is derived from active associations that continue to connect the units, and is oriented toward specific goals, leading to eventual syntheses, which may be expressed in either action or discourse. Here we face an unfurling, which coincides with interpretation, the unlocking of the new meaning built from the past upon the first mean~<br>

Abstract: Michael Ermarth summarizes the move as follows: "Particularly after his read-
ing of Husserl, he extended his notion of meaning to include the relation between the sign and the
thing signified and stipulated that what is signified cannot be resolved into experiential components
and configurations. Verstehen is not just simply the "resubjectifying of objectivations in a 'back-
ward' movement from the objective expression to the immanent subjective experiences of the
expresser, but also a 'forward movement' from the sign to its intentional object" (Wilhelm Dilthey:

Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishing<br>
Issue: i20010333<br>

Author(s): Johnson Greg<br>
Abstract: This essay takes up the claim made recently by Simon Critchley in The Companion to Continental Philosophy that a "feature common to many philosophers in the Continental tradition" is the "utopian demand that things be otherwise." The general question I pursue has to do with whether or not such a claim includes movements within Continental philosophy that do not self-identify with the utopian (like critical theory). The particular question has to do with whether or not the movement of phenomenology is utopian or does it, because of its other commitments, view the utopian as the antithesis to its orientation, which makes that claim that phenomenology is utopian seem strange. My thesis is that phenomenology can be seen as a utopian tradition but that some account must be given that demonstrates this connection to the utopian. In particular, I argue that Maurice Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology provides an understanding of the utopian, which I call a non-conventional view, that is vastly different from the one assumed by most when they see or hear the word "utopian," which I lable conventional. I show that such a non-conventional understanding can be developed in a way that neither requires us to view the utopian solely as opposed to finitude and contingency, nor a form of thought and action from which we necessarily need to dissociate ourselves. It is this non-conventional view of the utopian that in the end enables us to understand how Continental philosophy in general and phenomenology in particular are important bearers of the utopian demand that things be otherwise.<br>

Author(s): Vion Antoine<br>
Abstract: Town twinning can be seen as the first activity to involve municipal institutions as such in wide-ranging and long-term international action. Twinning fits Eric Hobsbawm's definition of an 'invented tradition'. The French federalists played a decisive part in this process of invention, bringing European municipalities together in order to ensure an eventual European political union. Before long, however, the so-called bilingualist movement also turned to twinning as a way to further a universal mutual understanding that transcended the East-West divide. This resulted in a big clash between the French twinning organisations. Thus, the invention of town twinning needs to be studied alongside the dynamic political tensions that emerged on the French political scene during the Cold War. /// Les jumelages urbains peuvent être considérés comme la première activité à impliquer les institutions municipales en tant que telles dans une action internationale de grande ampleur et de long terme. Le jumelage est un de ces 'traditions inventées' définies par Eric Hobsbawm. Les Fédéralistes français jouèrent un rôle décisif dans cette invention, qui regroupa un nombre important de municipalités européennes dans la perspective de construire l'union politique de la région. Très vite, des mouvements et définitions concurrentes se mirent en place, notamment avec le 'mouvement bilingue' qui s'empara des jumelages pour en faire l'outil d'une compréhension universelle qui aurait transcendé la division Est-Ouest. Une 'guerre des jumelages' fit rage pendant plusieurs années sur la scène française, guerre dont la compréhension appelle à l'inscription de ses enjeux dans le contexte de la Guerre Froide, et dont le déroulement participe de la dynamique de cette période. /// Städtepartnerschaften können als erster Versuch, städtische Institutionen in weiterreichende und dauerhafte internationale Aktivitäten einzubeziehen, gesehen werden.

Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i20099867<br>
Date: 6 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Bird Robert<br>
Abstract: Aleksej Losev's definition of myth centres on the concept of detachment. In modern times detachment has most often figured in the context of philosophical aesthetics, where it is a cognitive category akin to Kant's "disinterestedness" or the Russian formalists' "estrangement." However Losev's usage also makes reference to the ontological sense of detachment as contemplative ascent (cf. Meister Eckhardt's "Abgeschiedenheit"). Thus, Losev's concept of myth combines both senses of detachment, binding perceptual attitude and being together in a double movement of resignation from the world and union with meaning; this movement literally makes sense out of reality. It therefore bears comparison to the treatment of distanciation in contemporary hermeneutics, where detachment is a key condition of understanding. By investigating Losev's connections to other Russian thinkers, the author makes a case for a distinct Russian tradition of hermeneutic philosophy (V. Ivanov, G. Shpet, A. Bakshy, A. Losev).<br>

Abstract: En este artículo se estudian las memorias sobre 1968 en el espacio público mexicano en los últimos cuarenta años. Si desde 1969 se puede ubicar una memoria de denuncia de la represión asociada al 2 de octubre, es sólo a mediados de los años ochenta que puede localizarse una memoria de elogio del movimiento estudiantil en su conjunto que considera que buscó abrir cauces hacia la democratización del país. El artículo analiza en qué presente se narra, se recuerda, y cuál es el pasado recuperado; para ello las memorias públicas son historizadas desde los distintos presentes políticos desde los cuales son enunciadas. This article studies the memories in the Mexican public space over the past forty years. Although it of 1968 is possible to find a memory of the denunciation of repression associated with October 2 since 1969, it is only from the mid-1980s that we can locate a memory of praise of the student movement as a whole, since it is considered to have paved the way for democratization of the country. The article analyzes what present narratives are enunciated and events recalled, and what kind of past is recovered. Whit this purpose public memories are historicized from the various political presents from which they are expressed.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i211059<br>
Date: 11 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Kane Anne E.<br>
Abstract: Though the process of meaning construction is widely recognized to be a crucial factor in the mobilization, unfolding, and outcomes of social movements, the conditions and mechanisms that allow meaning construction and cultural transformation are often misconceptualized and/or underanalyzed. Following a "tool kit" perspective on culture, dominant social movement theory locates meaning only as it is embodied in concrete social practices. Meaning construction from this perspective is a matter of manipulating static symbols and meaning to achieve goals. I argue instead that meaning is located in the structure of culture, and that the condition and mechanism of meaning construction and transformation are, respectively, the metaphoric nature of symbolic systems, and individual and collective interpretation of those systems in the face of concrete events. This theory is demonstrated by analyzing, through textual analysis, meaning construction during the Irish Land War, 1879-1882, showing how diverse social groups constructed new and emergent symbolic meanings and how transformed collective understandings contributed to specific, yet unpredictable, political action and movement outcomes. The theoretical model and empirical case demonstrates that social movement analysis must examine the metaphoric logic of symbolic systems and the interpretive process by which people construct meaning in order to fully explain the role of culture in social movements, the agency of movement participants, and the contingency of the course and outcomes of social movements.<br>

Article Title: A COHESIVE SHAMBLES: THE CLASH'S `LONDON CALLING' AND THE NORMALIZATION OF PUNK<br>
Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23013006<br>
Date: 5 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Gelbart Matthew<br>
Abstract: The Clash's London Calling was released just at the moment when the British punk movement seemed to be imploding. From the earliest reviews, it was received as a musical masterpiece that drew on many styles while still managing to be `punk' in some sense. This article argues that London Calling normalized punk, allowing it to be more than an event: punk could henceforth be assimilated into traditional musical discourse and aesthetics. As a careful balancing act between punk street-cred and mainstream musical values, London Calling allowed a double reading. Punk fans could find in it what they sought: anti-establishment anger and at times a messy, disdainful approach to conventional musicianship. At the same time critics and listeners who had come since the late sixties to assimilate rock into a Romantic (or post-Romantic) system of `art' values could find in it what they sought: stylistic growth, organic coherence, originality, and even a `universal' narrative of struggle, triumph, and redemption played out across the album. It is possible to isolate not only a story, but musical connections between the songs (keys, recurrent motifs, and topoi) all laid out in a logical manner. However, unlike concept albums in the seventies' progressive rock style against which punk reacted, London Calling often calls attention away from its musical coherence, and even its textual coherence, rather than towards it—such as by the last-minute addition of a bonus track that disrupts the narrative and key schemes established earlier. The ease with which the album can be praised in established musical language should not completely obscure its potential (and the general potential of punk) to undercut and confront conventional musical discourse.<br>

Author(s): Wilson Erin K.<br>
Abstract: Globalization has unsettled conventional, nationally based political belief systems, opening the door to emerging new global political ideologies. While much analytic focus has been on ideational transformations related to market globalism (neoliberalism), little attention has been given to its growing number of ideological challengers. Drawing on data collected from 45 organizations connected to the World Social Forum, this article examines the political ideas of the global justice movement, the key antagonist to market globalism from the political Left. Employing morphological discourse analysis and quantitative content analysis, the article assesses the ideological coherence of "justice globalism" against Michael Freeden's (1996) three criteria of distinctiveness, context-bound responsiveness, and effective decontestation. We find that justice globalism displays ideological coherence and should be considered a maturing political "alter"-ideology of global significance. The evidence presented in this article suggests the ongoing globalization of the twenty-first-century ideological landscape.<br>

Issue: i23535704<br>

Author(s): Grossman Kathryn M.<br>
Abstract: Set in the exiled poet's "marginal" home in the Channel Islands, Les Travailleurs de la mer (1866) elaborates a vision of creative potential. Science, dreams, meditation, natural forces, physical prowess, selfess devotion, even death—all serve as vehicles for expanding the boundaries of our universe, both internal and external. The protagonist, Gilliatt, avails himself of these multiple modes of transport to challenge our notion of the humanly—and inhumanly—possible. Transcending his own limits to conquer a wide array of "monsters," he links the motifs of movement and displacement in Hugo's hypertropic narrative to the transpositions of metaphor, the sublime, and political exile.<br>

Abstract: This essay offers some theoretical and methodological reflections on how the study of religion might look if we were to assume that complexity, connectivity, and fluidity are preponderant features of our present age, without ignoring the strong countervailing global logics of segregation, surveillance, and control. After characterizing transnational, global, and diasporic modalities of religion in motion, the essay explores the strengths and weaknesses of the analytical tools of flows, landscapes, and networks in the study of mobility. I argue that by placing power front and center, the concept of networks provides a necessary corrective to hydraulic models of flows and spatial metaphors of landscapes. These metaphors tend to overstate the pervasiveness of porous boundaries and movement or to privilege the hermeneutic and phenomenological dimensions of religious activity.<br>

Abstract: This essay examines how two Jefferson biographies represented the Thomas Jefferson—Sally Hemings relationship in the post—civil rights movement era: Fawn Brodie's Thomas Jefferson (1974), a controversial publication that claimed that Hemings and Jefferson loved each other, and Joseph Ellis's American Sphinx (1996), one of the last mainstream biographies to deny that they had any children together. The story in both cases serves as an allegory of founding authority and national membership. The author finds that Ellis and Brodie characterize Jefferson as a fallible founder to affirm that founding ideals can accommodate and overcome racial differences and injustices.<br>

Abstract: Experience of God, of time, and of oneself are connected with each other. This connection is not to be understood within the frame of a metaphysical thought of god, but in the context of the realism of mercy: God's time is qualified by the movement of mercy. Discussing different theories of time (Augustin, M. Theunissen, U. Beck, E. Erikson) the character of time as a gift is elaborated and understood as a way of secular speaking of God.<br>

Abstract: Depuis 1996, les chômeurs qui ont adopté le nom de piqueteros sont devenus un nouvel acteur, particulièrement perturbateur, du scénario politique et social argentin. Le point de départ de cet article porte sur les conditions qui ont permis la constitution des organisations de chômeurs. La première partie analyse les courants principaux du mouvement piquetero, ses différentes matrices politiques et idéologiques, le rapport qu'il établit avec l'État et l'institutionnalisation des programmes sociaux. La deuxième partie étudie les éléments communs qui constituent l'espace piquetero. Enfin, l'article fait le point sur les difficultés actuelles du mouvement. Since 1996, the unemployed who have adopted the name of piqueteros have become a new and particularly perturbing actor on the Argentinean political scene. This article examines the conditions which have brought about the constitution of the unemployed into organisations. The first part analyses the principal currents of the piquetero movement, its different political and ideological matrices, the relationships it establishes with the State and the institutionalisation of social programmes. The second part studies the common elements which constitute the piquetero space. Finally, the article assesses the current difficulties of the movement.<br>

Publisher: BRILL<br>
Issue: i23653923<br>
Date: 1 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Taylor Betsy<br>
Abstract: The global justice movement reveals a diverse array of emergent publics striving politically for a sustainable world. Working partly from John Dewey, we try to illuminate democratic grounds for knowledge and action in these endeavors. We begin by situating Dewey's ideas in the politics of American history, especially historian John Diggins' countervailing approach to issues of authority, knowledge and opinion. Diggins, against Robert Westbrook and others, contends that Dewey's philosophy of politics chased radical democratic illusions, whereas he might have learned from Charles S. Peirce to uphold the boundary between professional communities and other entities including democratic publics. Dewey saw no democratic alternative to harness the political energy of ordinary people. We argue that Dewey had come to understand that a corporate state system of political economy had come to engulf both the liberal democratic polity and the professions. Dewey's political challenge to the professions and his illumination of the aesthetic ecology of democratic publics prefigure a democratic republican alternative that opens up a new basis for participation in the global justice movement confronting, among other obstacles, a transnational corporate state based in the USA. A Marxist-progressivist notion of the ongoing socialization of markets by corporate capitalism too often reinforces an anti-Populist intellectual sensibility that is coupled with, whether wittingly or not, either a social-democratic elitism or a revolutionary vanguardism. Globalization struggles need, on the contrary, a pragmatic vision of democratic publics instituting a true diversity of policies assuring a world-in-common. The fight for public spaces in the treacherous politics of civil society and global consumerism is a struggle against subjectivization. The fact that corporate state elitism, in the U.S. context, feeds on a rightist version of nationaism does not mean we can junk the history of democratic s~<br>

Abstract: The antipositivist movement of the past two decades or so in economics, economic history, and history reveals the scope for a rapprochement, a growth of mutual respect and understanding, and perhaps even more active collaboration between the practitioners of these disciplines. The emergence of a more open-minded and flexible approach to economic methodology, and a more sophisticated awareness of the nature of historical explanation underlie this process. And the economists' increasing preoccupation with problems of time, expectations, uncertainty, and limited information provides substantive incentives for the widespread and varied efforts to break out of the confines of conventional static equilibrium theorizing.<br>

Abstract: Creating one's identity is an on-going process, which is greatly dependent on language. Having this idea as a starting point in the study of religiosity, sharing self-reported experiences can be seen as an integral part in constructing one's religious identity and personal conviction. In this article, I would like to present the idea of bringing together narrative research and the psychological approach to the study of religious experience with the help of personal experience stories about God's guidance told by Christian believers who are members of a charismatic revival movement.<br>

Abstract: Our objective in this article is to demonstrate why between 1901 and 1922 reformism in Italy remained a minority position among the members of the left-wing parties without which it failed to gain influence among the ruling classes. After explaining why we chose to study this particular period, we first show how the republican and socialist reformists were both criticized in their respective parties and bitterly fought by the liberals in power. In addition to these external difficulties, there were internal ones: the progressive positivist culture which characterized the ideology of Italian reformists was also shared by a part of the middle-classes. Especially after 1900 it became unable to appeal to the masses and to young people who were more and more fascinated by a dramatic and violent conception of history which was in contradiction with the reformist intellectuals'vision of the world. Finally, Italian reformism did not manage to fit in with the revisionist trend that was led in Europe by E. Bernstein. The third reason for the failure of this movement lies in the organizational weakness of the political reformist groups, which is to be understood through the study of the conflictual relationships between the P.S.I. and P.R.I. and their respective parliamentary groups. Revolutionary or reactionary logics prevailed over the strategies of emancipation of the people through democratic means. The failure of democratic reformism in Italy between the liberal watershed and fascism also constitutes the failure to implant a democratic political culture in this country.<br>

Author(s): Souza lara<br>
Abstract: This article inquires as to the meaning of nervoso (nerves) among poor, working-class women from Salvador, Brazil. Our aim is to understand nerves as an experience that emerges from the background of a life trajectory and that, in many significant ways, disrupts the taken-for-granted character of that trajectory. From a phenomenological-hermeneutical tradition, we explore the links between experience, embodiment and temporality and then discuss the relevance of this approach for the understanding of women′s nervoso. In order to do so we present the life histories of three middle-aged women who have been afflicted with nerves. The accounts describe significant ways in which culturally inherited possibilities – grounded in a lived context of class and gender – are recovered and come to pre-figure a certain future. As we argue throughout the article, it is only when we situate the experience of nervoso within the temporal frame of life that we can truly understand it – that is, grasp it as part of a movement that involves both recovery and creation of meaning.<br>

Abstract: This article concerns itself with the question of what constitutes a hymn, within the framework of the existing state church. This framework is defined as "religious pluralization", characterized by an individualized understanding of Christ, and the parallel development of a new interdenominational religious awareness, two trends which have been increasingly prominent since the days of post-Reformation Orthodoxy and the Enlightenment. "Pluralization" is intimately associated with a fundamental movement away from traditional forms of religious piety. The article attempts to describe the hymn as a figure of "tentative continuity"; that ist, the hymn is the means by which human beings symbolically express their religious perception of their own finiteness in history. The hymn can therefore claim a more universal validity than if it merely pinpoints a specific moment of human religious history. At this point, the article carefully examines several examples of older as well as of more modern hymnody.<br>

Abstract: The philosopher as the tormented individual trying to grasp the truth is the topic of Giordano Bruno's Eroici furori. This paper offers a reading that assumes that Ignatius of Loyola's Spiritual Exercises were part of its cultural background. Both texts have some features in common: the individual struggles for contemplation of the absolute; the strife is a circular movement within the human condition; Ignatius and Bruno suggest to employ the lower realms of reality and the lower faculties of the soul for the sake of their overcoming in truth. Consequently, dialogue, imagery, and emblematic contraptions of multiple senses are specifically apt to educate the individual. Bruno addresses systematically the epistemological and metaphysical problems that accompany the Exercises.<br>

Abstract: For anthropologists working on the topic of human rights, fieldwork often consists of collecting narratives documenting experiences of violence and loss. Drawing on research with human organizations in Argentina, this article questions this methodological focus that is often related to human rights activism. While these narratives are often treated as organic accounts, they are also products of the human rights movement. Analyses that fail to address this larger institutional context may end up reproducing conventionally held knowledge. By exploring the larger interconnections between narrative, human rights and trauma, I conclude by questioning the prevalent normative assumptions about narrative. Pour l'anthropologue travaillant sur le sujet des droits humains, le travail de terrain consiste souvent à recueillir des récits documentant des expériences de violence et de perte. À partir de recherches menées auprès d'organismes de défense des droits humains en Argentine, cet article interroge ce parti-pris méthodologique qu'on associe souvent au militantisme pour les droits humains. Alors que ces récits sont souvent traités comme des comptes-rendus organiques, ils sont aussi des produits du mouvement pour les droits humains. Les analyses qui omettent de tenir compte de ce contexte institutionnel plus étendu peuvent finir par reproduire des connaissances conventionnellement admises. En explorant les interconnexions plus étendues entre les récits, les droits humains et les traumatismes, je conclus en remettant en question les a priori normatifs courants relatifs aux récits.<br>

Abstract: L'histoire des sensibilités suscite encore une méfiance persistante, avant tout parce que son projet intellectuel demeure mal identifié, parce que l'historiographie a souvent laissé penser que ses origines s'ancraient uniquement dans la continuité du projet de Lucien Febvre et de l'histoire des mentalités à la française. Or, en vérité, celle-ci n'est autre que la traduction historiographique d'un mouvement philosophique beaucoup plus ample et ancien, né du basculement incarné par Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche et Sigmund Freud, ces penseurs du soupçon, qui nous ont appris à repérer derrière les idées, la raison et la conscience, le rôle des désirs et des appétits, le jeu des pulsions et des sentiments. Rendant ainsi l'homme moins transparent à luimême, l'historien du sensible vise, outre à restituer l'historicité de notre vie sensible, à réévaluer la part des affects dans la détermination des conduites humaines. Pour ce faire, il s'appuie également sur la riche nébuleuse des savoirs critiques élaborés ensuite, dans l'Allemagne de la première moitié du 20e siècle, sous les appellations de « psychologie sociale » ou « historique » ou, à la manière nietzschéenne, de « psychologie des profondeurs ». The history of sensibility still continues to elicit suspicion, first and foremost because this intellectual project remains poorly defined, historiography often having led us to believe that its roots stemmed solely from Lucien Febvre's endeavours and the French history of mentalities. And yet in truth, the history of sensibility is nothing less than the historiographical translation of a much broader and older philosophical movement, born of the tipping point provoked by Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud. Those great sceptical thinkers taught us to unmask the role of desires, appetites and impulses behind our ideas, reason and consciousness. In addition to recreating the historicity of our lives of sensibility and thus rendering man less transparent to himse~<br>

Abstract: Al estudiar los procesos de transmisión dialógica de las memorias sobre la dictadura militar chilena y el rol que en ella tuvo la Iglesia Católica, desde la Corriente Liberadora (Teología de la Liberación), en tanto memoria subalterna, podemos concluir que opera una paradoja. El principal desafío de esta Corriente es defender la forma en que vivieron el cristianismo durante la dictadura, tratando de influir a la propia Iglesia Católica tras su progresivo alineamiento con los sectores más conservadores a partir de la recuperación democrática. Sin embargo, dentro del clero no encuentran herederos o cómplices para esta Corriente, con lo cual se arriesga el olvido de sus experiencias. Sin embargo, los laicos/as han encontrado en otros actores no eclesiales formas en que sus memorias transiten, en tanto recurren al sentido último de la Teología de la Liberación: el compromiso con las nuevas luchas sociales de los actores marginados. Au moment d'étudier les processus de transmission dialogique des mémoires sur la dictature militaire chilienne et le rôle qu'a joué l'Église catholique dans cette dictature auprès du courant libérateur (Théologie de la Libération), en tant que mémoire subalterne, nous pouvons conclure que ce rôle relève du paradoxe. Le principal défi de ce courant est de défendre la façon dont ses partisans ont vécu le christianisme pendant la dictature, en essayant d'influencer l'Église catholique après son alignement progressif sur les secteurs les plus conservateurs, une fois le démocratie revenue. Cependant, le clergé ne trouve pas d'héritiers ou de complices de ce courant parmi ses membres, au risque d'oublier ces expériences. Néanmoins, les laïcs ont trouvé chez d'autres acteurs, non ecclésiaux, des formes par lesquelles leurs mémoires transitent, en ceci qu'ils recourent au sens ultime de la Théologie de la Libération : l'engagement dans les nouvelles luttes sociales des acteurs marginalisés.

Article Title: Rediscovering Collingwood's Spiritual History (In and Out of Context)<br>
Publisher: Wesleyan University<br>
Issue: i342984<br>
Date: 2 1, 1957<br>
Author(s): Jaspers David<br>
Abstract: Collingwood has often been depicted as a neglected and isolated thinker whose original ideas on the contextual nature of truth (in both history and philosophy) anticipated important trends in postwar thought. The spiritual aspects of his thought, however, have often been problematic, precisely because they seem to conflict with his more influential ideas. Although Collingwood's overtly theological and metaphysical writing can be safely confined to an early, perhaps even juvenile phase of his career, the spiritual dimension of some of his later work, including, for example, the famous doctrine of reenactment, has often been marginalized, repressed, or domesticated in order to preserve Collingwood's historical place in twentieth-century philosophy of history. This radical conflict continues to disrupt both the reception of Collingwood's ideas and attempts to contextualize them historically. However, if the spiritual and theological nature of Collingwood's thought is taken seriously, and not marginalized, it is hard to see his career as discrete stages of development. The problem of transcendent identity was a central concern for Collingwood throughout his career, and it unifies much of his thinking on divergent topics. The problematic idea of reenactment actually opens up a complex connection in Collingwood's thought between ethical action, historical time, and our relationship with divine reality. It is this rediscovery of Collingwood's spiritual ideas on history that leads to a reevaluation of his own historical context, for it becomes clear that these ideas were neither eccentric nor old-fashioned. The problems Collingwood was addressing link him with a much broader movement of European thought in the interwar period, one that was trying to mediate transcendent reality and concrete historicity in a situation of crisis and fragmentation.<br>

Abstract: On September 11, 2001, the passengers and crew members aboard Flight 93 responded to the hijacking of their airplane by organizing a counterattack against the hijackers. The airplane crashed into an unpopulated field, causing no damage to human lives or national landmarks beyond the lives of those aboard the airplane. We draw on this story of courageous collective action to explore the question of what makes this kind of action possible. We propose that to take courageous collective action, people need three narratives-a personal narrative that helps them understand who they are beyond the immediate situation and manage the intense emotions that accompany duress, a narrative that explains the duress that has been imposed upon them sufficiently to make moral and practical judgments about how to act, and a narrative of collective action-and the resources that make the creation of these narratives feasible. We also consider how the creation of these narratives is relevant to courageous collective action in more common organizational circumstances, and identify how this analysis suggests new insights into our understanding of the core framing tasks of social movements, ways in which social movement actors draw on social infrastructure, the role of discourse and morality in social movements, the formation of collective identity, and resource mobilization.<br>

Author(s): Lafaye Claudette<br>
Abstract: Families of squatters who had settled in a quiet neighborhood of Paris wished to send their children to the local school. Our ethnohistorical inquiry explores how the mobilization in favor of schooling the children was embedded in other controversies and mobilizations that arose from the squatters' presence in the occupied building. Many collective social actors (associations, unions, administrations, and politicians) were involved in conflicting mobilizations in an ongoing struggle of competing arguments. The contemporary crisis of the French model of political representation has enabled the emergence of new forms of collective protest: new ways of defining social problems and a new repertory of civil actions, that is, the "mediatization" of social action and the recourse to litigation. Our study suggests some of the possible extensions and limitations of this movement, especially in the context of action taken by teachers' unions and parents' associations.<br>

Abstract: From the beginning of his career, sixteenth-century playwright Angelo Beolco (also known as Ruzante, the name of the peasant character he created and played) declared his anguish at the worsening of the peasants' economic and political position. Illegitimate child of the authoritarian patriarch of a minor noble family beginning its decline and (probably) a household servant likely of peasant origin, he appears to have identified with the peasants' exclusion from governing institutions and the blocking of their access to wealth. At first, the Evangelical reform movement, with its emphasis on justice for the poor, appealed to him as an effective instrument for persuading the powerful to correct the situation. That hope having proved illusory, Beolco passed through a rapid evolution of beliefs that calls into question Lucien Febvre's theory of the parameters of religious experience in the Renaissance. The present article explores this evolution.<br>

Abstract: Regido por la subjetividad, el universo contemporáneo del creer es en todas sus partes de circulación fluida, inmediatamente refractario a cualquier referencia estructurante a estabilidad alguna, excepto cuando postula esta estabilidad como puramente operatoria. El objetivo del creer contemporáneo no consiste en alcanzar una "identidad religiosa" (que se concibe como "estable"), sino demostrar que puede ser un creer dentro del movimiento. En realidad, el concepto de "religión", como también los de "secularización" y de "laicidad" que se le asocian, pasan a ser, en situación de plena legitimidad social de la individualización radical de la construcción de una relación con el sentido, conceptos cada vez más indeterminados y en consecuencia de sobra inutilizables, al menos mientras se persista en reconocerles una pertinencia que les sería propia. La "religión", por ello, no es sino el indicador de recomposiciones más amplias, en las cuales participa, por otra parte, como instrumento de gestión. Así, sólo tiene sentido como objeto de intermediación, un analizador que, contextualizado, puede por lo demás resultar muy precioso. /// Ruled by subjectivity, the contemporary universe of belief is in all its parts of fluid circulation, immediately impervious to any structuring reference to any stability, unless this stability is posited as a purely operating principle. The aim of contemporary belief is not to achieve a "religious identity" (which would be conceived as "stable"), but to show that it can be a belief within movement. In fact, the concept of "religion", as well as the related concepts of "secularization" and "laicism" that are associated to it, happen to become, in a situation of total social legitimacy of radical individualization in constructing a relation with meaning, increasingly indeterminate and consequently utterly useless concepts, at least as far as there persists the will to grant them a pertinence of their own. "Religion", for that reason, is nothing m~<br>

Author(s): Lüscher-Morata Diane<br>
Abstract: This essay examines the correspondence between Beckett and Duthuit in the light of the unpublished notes that Beckett took in Germany in 1936-37. The underlying issue that Beckett's reflections on the image seems to address is the reorientation of his creative writing and the development of a new aesthetic. There is, when Beckett is confronted to an image, a double movement that can be discerned in the way he beholds the image, of fascination, first, but also of mistrust towards this painting. In stripping paintings of their narrative of figurative intention, Beckett's comments seem to aim at a situation of mankind in the world, apprehended outside of all preoccupations with its causes or as the effect of an absent cause. Cette contribution examine la correspondance entre Beckett et Duthuit et cherche à la mettre en perspective avec les notes inédites que Beckett prend en Allemagne (1936-37). L'enjeu indirect des réflexions de Beckett sur le problème de l'image, c'est la réorientation de son écriture, le développement d'une esthétique nouvelle. Il y a chez Beckett un double mouvement, de fascination, mais aussi de méfiance, face à l'image. En dépouillant ces peintures de leur charge narrative ou figurative, les commentaires de Beckett semblent viser une situation de l'homme, appréhendée en dehors de toute cause ou comme l'effet d'une cause absente.<br>

Abstract: From the perspective of Gabriel Marcel’s juvenile writings, most notably
         Fragments Philosophiques(1909-1914) andJournal Métaphysique(1914-1923), this study discuss the first theoretical statute of the experience of God. This reflexive movement, strictly speaking, phenomenological-existential is based (as background) on the critique of absolute knowledge (modern idealism and scientism) which, according to Marcel, is an unavoidable contradiction: at the same time, it affirms the being, it denies the being. What draws attention is the fact that such explanatory model is transposed and, therefore, applied using the classical formulation of the so-called problem of the existence of God, of which theodicy has one of the most eloquent and emblematic metaphysical discourses. For the young French thinker, God cannot be verified or justified as an ontological proof: God is the Inverifiable Absolute, since it has to be experienced in the act of faith, in the expression of love and grace.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i345910<br>
Date: 12 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Rosen William H.<br>
Abstract: This theme issue's call for papers notes that "several prevalent and influential historical practices of the last thirty years have limited agency's significance,.. seeing the human as the patient of History rather than its agent." The questions implicit in this statement are nowhere more urgent than in those practices collectively known as the "linguistic turn." Yet such questions have been explored sparsely enough in relation to this movement that some adherents can still insist that the ideas they favor do not devalue agency, while many simply ignore the issue and incorporate agency as an integral part of their work. By examining a largely unremarked episode in Michel Foucault's highly influential thought and considering its connections to foundational assumptions of the linguistic turn, we seek to demonstrate in detail why the premises that underlie both structuralism and poststructuralism (the theoretical movements most deeply implicated in the direction the linguistic turn has taken in history) logically require the denial of agency as a causal force and ultimately compel the conclusion that no change can occur in realities as interpreted by humans. We illustrate the intractability of these logical problems by analyzing unsatisfactory defenses from some of the few linguistic-turn historians who have discussed relevant issues, after which we conclude by suggesting that attention to current work in linguistics and cognitive science may help resolve such difficulties.<br>

Abstract: "Does the later Heidegger's attempt to reconcile human freedom with the

a concession to the resolution of the problem of historical meaning in traditional philoso-
phies of history which Being and Time had sought to undermine?"(286).

Publisher: Brill Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i27643230<br>
Date: 1 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Doja Albert<br>
Abstract: The system of beliefs and practices related to Bektashism seems to have corresponded to a kind of liberation theology, whereas the structure of Bektashi groups corresponded more or less to the type of religious organization conventionally known as charismatic groups. It becomes understandable therefore that their spiritual tendency could at times connect with and meet social, cultural and national perspectives. In turn, when members of the previously persecuted religious minority will acquire a degree of religious and political respectability within society at large, the doctrines of heterodoxy and liberation theology fade into the background. In the end, the heirs of the heterodox promoters of spiritual reform and social movement turn into followers and faithful defenders of a legitimate authority. They become the spokespeople for an institutionalized orthodoxy whose support is sought by the political regime.<br>

Author(s): Adler Judith<br>
Abstract: Although travel has been performed, appreciated, and formally criticized as an art for at least five centuries, this cultural classification has yet to be taken seriously in the nascent field of tourism research. Present-day tourism is best understood as a recent manifestation of an enduring art of travel whose performance entails movement through space in conventionally stylized ways. Sociological research on current and historical manifestations of this art can benefit from theoretical traditions developed in the study of other domains of expressive culture. Drawing on the sociology of art as well as on recent literary scholarship, this paper proposes that the reproduction and modificaton of distinctive travel styles be examined in terms of the social worlds of their producers.<br>

Publisher: Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland<br>
Issue: i330183<br>
Date: 3 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Ohnuki-Tierney Emiko<br>
Abstract: Most symbols are polytropic as well as polysemic in that their multiple meanings in various contexts functions as different types ot trope. This article pursues the complex nature of polytropes through a formulation of synecdoche as an interstitial trope between metaphor and metonymy, and demonstrates how the two conceptual principles of analogy and contiguity, that define metaphor and metonymy respectively, are interdependent and interpenetrated, rather than of basically different natures as presented in the biaxial image of structural linguistics. The analogic thought expressed in methaphor involves movement and temporality, just as does the discursive thought of metonymy. The interpenetration of the two modes of thought is demostrated through an analysis of the process of objectification of what, throughout history, has been a dominant symbol of self in Japanese culture: the monkey. As a polysemic and polytropic symbol, the monkey takes on different meanings, and functions as different tropic types, sequentially or simultaneously, as actors use and/or interpret the symbol in varying historical and social contexts.<br>

Author(s): Pepper Chunglin<br>
Abstract: This paper considers some aspects of the early history of the American contribution to the International Biological Programme (IBP), ecology's only venture into 'Big Science'. It is argued that American ecologists were successful in obtaining generous funding for the IBP from the US Congress, thanks to a shared understanding of the way in which controlling nature was to be accomplished, expressed in the metaphor of the 'cybernetic machine'. To support this argument, a literary analysis is performed on Congressional documents, on scientific and popular books and papers by ecologists, and on writings of the environmental movement. The paper explores how a dominant representation of nature, or mentalité, is brought about, and its political effects.<br>

Abstract: This essay argues that literary theory can no longer afford to adopt an exceptionalist view of its own disciplinary identity and relation to the Western tradition. To this end, it outlines a conceptual framework that distinguishes between competing tendencies within the Western tradition represented by the terms metaphysics and ontology. The implications of this distinction for literary theory are that the most important sources of the latter's disciplinary identity are neither the linguistics-based movement of French structuralism, as the term poststructuralism implies, nor a "modernity" that has been superseded, as the term postmodernism implies, but rather a modernist tradition of aesthetics shaped by eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century German romanticism and idealism.<br>

Abstract: L'étude d'un conflit centré sur le maintien d'écoles élémentaires dans le dispositif de zone d'éducation prioritaire (ZEP) permet de clarifier les figures de montée en généralité dans les engagements et les mobilisations autour de l'école. La mobilisation que nous avons analysée en nous fondant sur les récits rétrospectifs de ses différents protagonistes montre la possibilité pour des mouvements locaux de s'articuler à des revendications non particularistes, sans toutefois oublier les motifs initiaux d'insatisfaction. Cet accès à une cause argumentée, au-delà du travail de médiatisation du mouvement, lui a donné sa consistance interne. En effet, à partir d'un ancrage localisé, ces formes d'action ont fait émerger des questions d'intérêt général que nous présentons et discutons. La clôture de la controverse montre cependant que si l'administration accède à la satisfaction de la revendication initiale des parents, elle méconnaît sa légitimité. /// The study of a conflict centered on whether to keep primary schools in the ZEP programme, gives some clear figures illustrating the more general nature of commitment and mobilization on school matters. Mobilization, which was analyzed from retrospective accounts of its various protagonists, shows how it is possible for local movements to take part in non-specific claims, without however forgetting the initial reasons for dissatisfaction. This means of access with a justified cause reaching beyond the mediatization of the movement, has given it an inner strength. In fact, these types of action, coming from a local base, have brought into light questions of general interest that are presented and discussed. However, the closing of debate shows that although administration meets the parents' initial claim with satisfaction, it refuses to recognize its legitimacy. /// Die Untersuchung eines Konflikts zum Erhalt von Grundschulen im Rahmen der sog.

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i370115<br>
Date: 9 1, 1986<br>
Author(s): Wrigley Trevor J.<br>
Abstract: In this article, I reflect upon and attempt to understand the changing theoretical nature of post-World War II Anglo-American economic geography. In particular, I contrast the kind of theorizing that first occurred in the discipline during the 1950s with the very different kind now carried out under what has been called the "cultural turn" or the "new economic geography." I argue that, during this transition, not only did the use of specific theories alter, but the very idea and practice of theorization also changed. I characterize the phases of this movement by using the terms "epistemological" and "hermeneutic theorizing," defined on the basis of works by pragmatist philosopher Richard Rorty and science studies writer Donna Haraway. I argue that "epistemological theorizing" best describes the first period of theorization in the discipline around the quantitative revolution of the late 1950s and early 1960s, and that it is bound by the quest for accurate (mirror) representation. In contrast, hermeneutic theorizing describes the kind of theorizing found in the new economic geography, marked by an interpretive mode of inquiry that is reflexive, open-ended, and catholic in its theoretical sources.<br>

Publisher: American Educational Research Association<br>
Issue: i370911<br>
Date: 9 1, 1993<br>
Author(s): Wittig Zeus<br>
Abstract: Critical social theory is a multidisciplinary knowledge base with the implicit goal of advancing the emancipatory function of knowledge. It approaches this goal by promoting the role of criticism in the search for quality education. Through critical social theory in education, quality is proportional to the depth of analysis that students have at their disposal. As a critical form of classroom discourse, critical social theory cultivates students' ability to critique institutional as well as conceptual dilemmas, particularly those that lead to domination or oppression. It also promotes a language of transcendence that complements a language of critique in order to forge alternative and less oppressive social arrangements. A critical social theory-based movement in education highlights the relationship between social systems and people, how they produce each other, and ultimately how critical social theory can contribute to the emancipation of both.<br>

Author(s): Schreiner Sabine<br>
Abstract: En analysant l'épisode de la lettre à Johnson publiée en avril 1966 par "Témoignage chrétien" et "Cité nouvelle," Sabine Rousseau décrit les mécanismes d'une mobilisation, alors pionnière, contre la guerre du Vietnam. Au lendemain de Vatican II, l'enracinement chrétien confère à cet engagement une forme originale, caractéristique d'un tiers-mondisme fondé moins sur les théories de l'impérialisme que sur le sentiment de la responsabilité chrétienne dans le drame vietnamien. /// The publication in "Cité nouvelle" and "Témoignage chrétien," on 21 April 1966, of an appeal to President Johnson marked the French Protestant and Catholic left's entry in the fight against the Vietnam war. Although somewhat late in their mobilization with respect to the Peace Movement, the commitment was early enough considering the dominant silence outside communist and communist sympathizer circles. As a sequel to the struggle for decolonization, this commitment took the original form of a letter to the president of the US. The feeling of Christian responsibility for the history of imperialism overtook the political analysis of the war. After a difficult beginning, the public opinion campaign grew during the summer, favored by the escalation of violence in Vietnam. But to the most committed left Christian militants, the campaign seemed already insufficient. Their radicalization in the fall of 1966 prepared for a mobilization in which the specific Christian commitment gave way to common action with the anti-imperialist movements.<br>

Abstract: Un jour viendra. Car l'Histoire a un sens, qu'on peut infléchir. L'engagement est né de cette représentation fondatrice du radicalisme moderne, confirmé et sublimé par 1789. Mais il fallut ensuite apprendre à vivre le temps de la "séparation ouvrière". Jusqu'au nouveau remaniement de la scène sociale avec l'affaire Dreyfus, en prélude aux fureurs et aux drames du 20e siècle. Voici la toile de fond de cette histoire violente que nous explorons dans ce numéro, et qui n'a pas répondu à la question qui hante, encore et toujours: que faire? /// The idea of direct intervention, which goes back to Early Modern times and thrived during the Enlightenment, is at the root of political commitment. It remained, however, restricted in scope and more attentive to he rights of Man than to social concerns. In the course of the nineteenth-century, by contrast, the social question came to the fore as writers tended to eulogize the People. But the autonomy of the workers movement, readily anti-intellectual, confined nineteenth-century writers to the secondary role of "road companions", which in turn freed them for the task of upholding justice, as in the Dreyfus Affair. All these mutations, of causes, actors, projects and behaviors, outlined complex configurations reflecting changes in attitudes to time, to space and to ways of envisioning the future. Nineteenth-century experiences help us to better understand the various forms, both fleeting and vigorous, of contemporary commitents.<br>

Abstract: The critical reception of Asher B. Durand's 1855 painting In the Woods sets out some of the preeminent concerns and terms of debate for the genre, and for art in general in the years preceding the Civil War. The painting divided critical opinion. Employing common aesthetic criteria, the opposing writers all took up the question of whether a landscape painting should dwell on factual details. The commentary, however, expressed aesthetic opinions in a vocabulary of labour, materialism, and commodities. Consequently, I consider the relationship between the form of the painting and the partisanship of its reception, how we might read the uneasy and indirect, yet evident rhetorical movement between aesthetic terms and economic ones, and what the implications were for the definition of landscape painting. Arguing that In the Woods offered the material substance of the world as a value by itself, and a mode of viewing that installed significance on the surface, I suggest that the debate was over the larger role of art. Would representation be defined by materialism? Should art, with its lofty status as a transcendent value, sanction by adopting, the mode of vision utilised by the commodity?<br>

Author(s): Vindhya Srila<br>
Abstract: Marriage practices, the dynamics of interpersonal relationships and the politics of sexuality are relatively under-researched themes in the study of Bengali communism. Historical scholarship on the revolutionary politics of the extreme left Naxalbari andoian of the late 1960s-1970s, the object of this piece of study, is no exception. The article engages with women and men's narratives on the practice of 'revolutionary' marriage in the movement through the prism of contemporary popular memory studies and narrative analysis. Drawing on field interviews with middle-class male and female activists, the article draws attention to the contestatory nature of marriage in the collective memory of the movement. Narrative contestations over marriage in the Naxalite movement underscore, I argue, a tension between a Utopian ideal of transgressive interpersonal relations and dominant middle-class codes of sexual morality. At the same time, individual attempts to 'compose' (in storytelling) socially recognizable and acceptable subject positions are grounded upon the silencing and abjection of more risky memories. Given the discrepancies and contradictions within the narrative repertoire from which individuals construct their identities, these 'marriage stories' are a tremendous resource for investigating the politics of love, sexuality and subject-formation in middle-class Bengali society.<br>

Abstract: La mayoría de las tradiciones religiosas posee en común un canon conformado por un texto o grupo de textos a los que se les concede toda la autoridad. Sin embargo, toda doctrina canónica es sujeto de exégesis, o interpretación, que presenta un riesgo, pues no reproduce de manera íntegra la ortodoxia recibida. En este ensayo se exploran dos casos de interpretaciones divergentes en las tradiciones de la India del s. II y la Inglaterra en vísperas del romanticismo. Los textos son la Tripurã-tãpinī-upanisad, de autor anónimo, y TheMarriage of Heaven and Hell, del poeta William Blake. A lo largo de este artículo el autor argumenta que ambos, en su momento, comprendieron tentativas por realizar una relectura de unos cánones religiosos que, más que rechazar abruptamente nociones o términos manejados por una tradición teológica, fueron resignificados bajo el concepto doctrinario de una energía que debe ponerse en acción. Así, un punto en común en los dos textos es que se acepta el mundo material y se le vincula con el espiritual, en vez de condenarlo. /// A large majority of religious traditions share the commonality of possessing a canon made up of a text, or a set of texts, from which all authority is said to emanate. However, canonical doctrines are the constant subjects of ex-egesis, or interpretaron, which presents a risk, given that these forms of rereading do not tend to faithfully reproduce received orthodoxy. The ob-ject of this text is to explore two exemplars of divergent interpretations within the very different canonical traditions of India in the second century AD and England at the outset of the Romantic movement of the nineteenth century. The chosen works are Trípurã-tãpinī-upanisad, which was written by an anonymous author, and William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell. Throughout this article the author maintains that both texts repre-sented important rereadings of established religious canons; however, rathern than presenting an abrupt rejection of ~<br>

Author(s): Mercier Charles<br>
Abstract: Cet article cherche à identifier les différentes étapes du positionnement de René Rémond par rapport au mouvement de Mai 68, afin d'en repérer les singularités. En 1968, ce célèbre universitaire français est professeur d'histoire contemporaine à la faculté de lettres de Nanterre, berceau et matrice de la révolution étudiante. Il semble adopter trois attitudes successives : la fermeté tant que la contestation reste cantonnée à Nanterre (de mars à mai), la prise de distance quand le mouvement monte en puissance et se diffuse à la France entière (première quinzaine du mois de mai), le dialogue à partir de la seconde quinzaine du mois de mai. Cet itinéraire est diversement interprété. Si certains reprochent à René Rémond un revirement opportuniste, la majorité de ceux l'ayant fréquenté sur cette période estime qu'il a opéré une adaptation stratégique dans le but de protéger l'Université contre les dérives. Cet implication se révélera durable puisqu'il conduira René Rémond à la présidence de la nouvelle Université Paris-X-Nanterre. /// This article deals with and identifies the various stages in René Rémonds positioning with regard to the movement of May 1968. In 1968, this famous French professor was professor of contemporary history at Nanterre, faculty of humanities, cradle and matrice of the student revolution. He seemed to have three successive attitudes: firmness as long as protest remained at Nanterre (from March to May), withdrawal when the movement grew and spread to all of France (May 1-15), and dialogue during the second half of May. This itinerary has been variously interpreted. While some people criticize René Rémond for opportunistically changing sides, most who were involved with him in this period thought he carried out a strategic adaptation in order to protect the University from straying too far. This involvement turned out to be a lasting one as it led René Rémond to be president of the new University Paris-X-Nanterre.<br>

Abstract: Cet article se propose de comprendre le sens musical d'une production de techno dite underground. Au travers de l'analyse de « Let's play » de Crystal Distortion, un artiste réputé de la mouvance free party (ou techno clandestine), on examine principalement la coexistence douloureuse des valeurs utopiques de ce mouvement, aujourd'hui considérablement affaiblies, avec le statut inévitablement commercial du disque sur lequel figure la composition. L'opposition pourrait être frontale, une de ces valeurs premières étant justement le refus de la société marchande, mais on décèle au travers de différentes analyses de nombreuses stratégies pour cacher au mieux l'aspect commercial attelé au morceau. En effet, tout ce qui met une œuvre en situation contribue à son sens, et c'est pourquoi nous consacrons du temps à exposer certains aspects du mouvement acquis par un long travail de terrain et de nombreuses observations participantes : la présentation des valeurs de la free party ; son historique ; la manière dont est considéré Crystal Distortion par les acteurs du mouvement ; ainsi que le fait qu'il vende cette production sur CD (la plupart des productions étant normalement tirées uniquement sur vinyle car destinées au mix par des DJs). Puis nous passons à l'examen des éléments composant la jaquette du CD pour en arriver enfin à l'analyse interne de la production, en relation avec les précédentes strates de l'analyse. The purpose of this paper is to understand the musical meaning of a production of so-called underground techno music. Through the analysis of "Let's play" by Crystal Distortion, a famous artist from the free party trend (or underground techno trend), one examines the painful coexistence of the Utopian values of the movement, tremendously weakened today, with the unavoidable commercial status of the record in which the composition appears. The confrontation could be frontal, as one of these essential values precisely is the refusal of consumer society; but one de~<br>

Abstract: Si certaines formes-sonate ou certains Andante de Mozart et Beethoven ont la réputation d'être « dramatiques » et de porter une expression fondée sur l'opposition entre tension et détente, est-il possible d'y détecter des règles narratives ? C'est la question à laquelle l'article tente de répondre, en se servant du modèle taxinomique proposé par A. J. Greimas. L'articulation des signifiés à l'intérieur d'un micro-univers sémantique est décrite au travers de la représentation de certains types de passion et de caractères musicaux (topiques, topoï, affects, etc.) détectés dans les œuvres de Mozart par Jozsef Ujfalussy. L'analyse de « la forme du contenu » , c'est-à-dire de la structure des signifiés dans un mouvement de symphonie de Mozart (le premier mouvement de la Symphonie en ut majeur, KV 338) ou de sonate de Beethoven (le deuxième mouvement de la Sonate op. 2 n°3) à l'aide du vocabulaire expressif codifié de l'époque, permet de démontrer la présence quasi « littérale » des rapports de contradiction, contrariété et de présupposition décrits par le fameux « carré sémiotique » de Greimas. On y découvre l'existence symbolique, dans ces mouvements d'œuvres instrumentales, des deux grandes classes de récit de la Sémantique structurale de Greimas, en fonction du maintien ou du refus de la situation de départ. If some sonata forms or some Andantes by Mozart or Beethoven can be described as « dramatic » , and cany an expression based on tension and relaxation, is it possible to detect in them narrative rules ? This is the question which the present article tries to answer, on the basis of the taxinomic model proposed by A. J. Greimas. The articulation of signified within a semantic micro-universe is described through the representation of types of passion and of musical characters detected in Mozart's works by Jozsef Ujfalussy. The analysis of the « content forms » , i.e. of the structure of signified in a Symphony movement by Mozart (KV 338, first movement) or in a sona~<br>

Abstract: Segment contestataire de la biomédecine moderne, le mouvement des soins palliatifs constitue actuellement un « paradigme global » de prise en charge du mourir, de la mort et du deuil, proposant simultanément une approche holistique du malade, un modèle d'organisation des soins, une éthique alternative et un projet politique dont l'ensemble fusionne en une synthèse inédite. Aussi, l'impact grandissant des soins palliatifs en France mérite que l'on retrace l'historique de leur institutionnalisation et que l'on mette au jour les fondements idéologiques (clinique, humaniste, herméneutique et chrétien) de leur doctrine. Ainsi définis, les soins palliatifs incarnent-ils à nos yeux un mouvement paradoxal de médicalisation du mourir contemporain. Contestant segment of the modem biomedical world, the palliative care movement represents a « Paradigm » of care of the dying, death and mourning, proposing simultaneously holistic approach of patient, work organisation, alternative ethics and political project which blend into an original synthesis. Thus, the growing impact of palliative care in France leads us to retrace the history of their institutionalisation and to analyse the ideological basements (clinical, humanistic, hermeneutic and Christian) of their doctrine. So defined, the palliative care movement embodies a paradoxical movement of medicalization of contemporary dying.<br>

Abstract: My article contends that Dostoevsky's short novel, The Gambler, is marked by a fundamental conflict of temporalities. While the novel seems to embrace bourgeois optimism and the hopeful narrative temporality that serves as its most resourceful literary embodiment, it also seems to adhere to a strikingly anti-teleological and circular narrative structure. This affirmation and denial of temporality as linear, purposive movement is the appropriate narrative emblem of the peculiar world of Roulettenburg and its inhabitants, a world where beginning and end continually risk equivalence and where the parameters of structure have therefore begun to dissolve. What emerges is an acceptance of inevitable boredom, of permanent failure to resolve conflict, that is both constricting and liberating. As an artistic principle of form, this failure declares a "poetics" of hesitation whose temporal dimensions brilliantly reflect the fundamentally ambivalent eros of the gambler, the latter's inability to accept or escape from a debilitating presentness. In creating this kind of narrative conflict, Dostoevsky reverses the characteristic romantic obsession with the allure of pregnant immediacy that is an illusion of god-like vision to which only a most ungod-like being could succumb.<br>

Abstract: En réaction au libéralisme rawlsien pour qui le droit est référé à la liberté d'action des individus, le mouvement communautarien a voulu référer le droit à l'identité culturelle (individuelle ou collective), lui assignant, ultimement, la fonction de stabiliser cette identité. Pour ces auteurs, le lien entre identité et droit est interne, ce qui ouvre la voie à ce qu'on a appelé « les paradoxes de l'identité démocratique » et conduit à la notion problématique de droits collectifs. On montrera ici comment une telle notion repose sur une « réduction identitaire » , par principe opérée au point de vue objectivant de la troisième personne, privant par là même les acteurs sociaux de leur capacité d'autodétermination, À cette vision anti-libérale dans son fondement, qui fait de la sécurité identitaire son horizon, on opposera la vision d'une identité risquée qui ne préjuge pas dogmatiquement des constituants identitaires de chacun et ouvre ainsi la voie aux authentiques principes de la coexistence multiculturelle. In reaction to Rawlsian liberalism, which relates law to freedom of action, the Communitarian movement wants to relate law to cultural identity (individual or collective), assigning it, ultimately, the function to stabilize this identity. For Communitarianism the relationship between identity and law is internal, which opens the path to what has been called « the paradoxes of democratic identity » , and leads to the problematic notion of « collective rights » . It is shown here how such a notion rests on an « identity-reduction » , which by principle is operated from a third-person perspective, depriving individuals of their capacity of self-determination. In opposition to this fundamentally anti-liberal vision, the notion of an open identity is proposed, which doesn't dogmatically predetermine the identities of everyone and opens therefore the path to the basic principles of a multicultural coexistence.<br>

Author(s): Saillant Francine<br>
Abstract: Au Brésil, le récit officiel concernant la mémoire de l'esclavage différe nettement de la vision des leaders du mouvement noir contemporain, notamment à propos de la situation et des conditions de vie des Afro-Brésiliens à Rio de Janeiro. Ce mouvement demande à l'État et à la société brésilienne de reconnaître les conditions misérables dans lesquelles les esclaves ont été laissés après l'abolition de l'esclavage, mais aussi la contribution des esclaves à la construction de la société, de l'économie et de la culture brésiliennes et enfin le racisme dont les Afro-Brésiliens sont encore l'objet. Aujourd'hui, des décisions juridiques tendent à favoriser une égalité effective, permettant ainsi l'émergence d'une image positive de la culture afro-brésilienne. This article discusses the difference between the official account on the memory of slavery in Brazil and how contemporary black movement's leaders, notably in Rio de Janeiro, see the Afro-Brazilians' situation and living conditions. This movement, which seeks to reveal in public space the memory of slavery and its consequences, claims Brazilian State and society to recognize not only the miserable conditions under which former slaves were left after the abolition of slavery, but the contribution of the slaves to the construction of Brazilian society, economy and culture and also that Afro-Brazilians are still the object of racism. If in today's Brazil, the public debate on reparations comprises a legal aspect of rectification, by creating measures aiming to provide effective equality, this discussion also takes the form of symbolic fight, in which one of the objectives is to build a positive image of the Afro-Brazilian culture. In Brasilien weicht die offizielle Berichterstattung über die Wahrnehmung der Sklaverei vor allem in Bezug auf die Situation und Lebensbedingungen der Afro-Brasilianer in Rio de Janeiro stark ab von der Sichtweise der Führer der zeitgenössischen « Schwarzen-Bewegung ».

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i40050915<br>

Author(s): Rosin Christopher<br>
Abstract: Audit schemes dictating the parameters of environmentally and socially acceptable management practice have emerged as a pervasive feature of global agri-food production. While the impacts of such schemes on the global movement of food and fibre and the evolving terrains of power in agri-food relations are well documented, the associated reconstruction of farming identities in the localities where audits are implemented has received less attention. The emerging responses to audit schemes in the New Zealand kiwifruit and dairy sectors are key examples of the contentious nature through which auditing is incorporated within farming practice. Analysis of these responses reveals the potential for audits to alter the spirit of farming in New Zealand, initiating new conventions of interaction between producers and industries. Within a convention theory framework, the incorporation of auditing within standard management practice involves a negotiated process in which the farmers employ strategic justifications of their capability (and value) relative to the quality designations established by the audit. Rather than evaluate the relative merits of a farm, its product and its owner through the craft and skill of the independent land manager, successful farming is increasingly associated with the individual's ability to conform to an audit's structures. The global trend toward audit schemes suggests that similar challenges to the spirit of farming may be replicated in other contexts.<br>

Abstract: Cherchant à concilier l'engagement chrétien de leurs membres et leur loyauté envers l'école laïque, les associations d'enseignants protestants -le mouvement des Membres et amis chrétiens de l'enseignement, puis la Fédération protestante de l'enseignement (FPE) qui lui succède au lendemain de la Seconde Guerre mondiale - militent en faveur d'une laïcité ouverte et tolérante. L'œuvre des protestants qui, cinquante ans plus tôt auprès de Jules Ferry, avaient contribué à fonder l'école républicaine, leur offre de solides arguments en faveur d'une neutralité bienveillante à l'égard des convictions religieuses. Elle les conduit cependant à définir comme la « vraie laïcité » ce qui ne fut peut-être qu'un épisode de l'histoire de l'institution scolaire. Par ailleurs, les lois scolaires des années 1950 et l'évolution du contexte sociopolitique vont progressivement conduire les dirigeants de la FPE à promouvoir une autre conception de la laïcité : la « laïcité de confrontation ». Seeking to reconcile the Christian commitment and the loyalty of their members to secular education, the Protestant teachers' associations - first the Membres et amis chrétiens de l'enseignement movement, then the Fédération protestante de l'enseignement (FPE) which succeeded to it after the Second World War - campaigned in favour of open and tolerant secularism. The work of Protestants with Jules Ferry which had contributed to the foundation of Republican education some fifty years earlier gave them sound arguments in favour of benevolent neutrality regarding religious beliefs. This led them to define as "genuine secularism "what was, perhaps, only an episode in the history of the school institution. Moreover, the educational laws of the 1950s combined with the evolving sociopolitical context would progressively bring the leaders of the FPE to prone another conception of secularism: "confrontational secularism".

Abstract: Le discours de la recherche sur les enseignants et leurs savoirs est souvent tenté de détacher la connaissance du sujet connaissant, traduisant des préoccupations de fonctionnalité et de transférabilité des savoirs. À cette perspective rationaliste résiste néanmoins une mouvance de recherche qui défend une approche anthropologique du savoir enseignant, moins soucieuse de légiférer l'acte d'enseignement que de mettre au jour les formes complexes et locales de construction de l'enseignant-sujet et de ses savoirs, que ceux-ci soient inscrits dans une forme de vie, incarnés, ou dessinés réflexivement dans l'espace narratif. Ce courant phénoménologique et herméneutique, pluriel et très vivace dans le monde anglo-saxon, promeut le savoir ordinaire des enseignants, se démarquant ainsi des études attentives aux seuls savoirs ' extraordinaires' de l'expert. Traduisant un retour du sujet qui traverse les sciences sociales depuis la dernière décennie, cette tendance dans la recherche éducative à réhabiliter la subjectivité enseignante, sans pour autant la magnifier, adresse des questions importantes à notre champ de recherche sur les choix épistémologiques qui le guident. Research discourse on teachers and their knowledge has a tendency to separate knowledge from the one who knows as it is focusing on knowledge functionality and transfer. Nevertheless, one research movement is resisting to this rationalist perspective, preferring an anthropological approach of teachers' knowledge focusing on sophisticated and local forms of construction of knowledge and knowing subject rather than on teaching laws (these constructions being embodied or reflexively designed in narrative space). This multifaceted phenomenological and hermeneutic trend, observed in anglosaxon world, is promoting teachers' ordinary knowledge, when the majority of investigations focus only on expert knowledge. As it can be observed in all social sciences in this last decade, the importance of the subject - the teac~<br>

Abstract: The memory of the "Solidarity" movement, problems of memory and conflicts of memory are analyzed in the contemporary context of the formation of collective identities in Poland. Politics of memory and commemoration are discussed as part of the politics of symbolization. Symbolic construction of "Solidarity" is analyzed on two levels: the symbolism of the organization of collective actions and discursive symbolism—in other words—symbolism in the "Solidarity" movement and the symbolization of the movement. The other aspect implies politics of symbolization, politics of memory and commemoration, conflict of interpretations and conflict about the memory. The "Solidarity" movement has had many meanings and the interpretation of the movement can refer to various frames of meanings: a workers' revolution, a civil revolution, a movement for national liberation, a movement for religious deprivatization, a moral movement. The multiplicity of meanings has generated conflicts of interpretations. Collective memory is crucial for the phenomenon of "Solidarity" both as a historical movement and as representations in discourses—the symbolic movement of memory.<br>

Abstract: Diversos trabajos han señalado còmo en contextos altamente represivos el surgimiento y la continuidad del activismo no se entienden sin la intervención de fuertes elementos subjetivos, afectivos y emocionales.Este artículo participa de este enfoque con un análisis longitudinal del activismo de la primera generación de anarquistas clandestinos bajo la dictadura franquista (1939-1975). Los resultados destacan la combinación de tres factores que ayudan a explicar el sostenimiento del activismo anarquista: i) la mediación de la esperanza en la percepción de oportunidades para la movilización; ii) la movilización estratégica de la indignación en el discurso dirigido a los potenciales apoyos y participantes; y iii) el fortalecimiento de la identificación ideológica con el movimiento gracias, paradójicamente, a la represión. Las fuentes incluyen diversos materiales de archivo y testimonios de activistas. Previous research has shown that in highly repressive contexts, the emergence and continuity of activism cannot be understood without considering the role of strong subjective, affective and emotional elements.Building on this approach, this article offers a longitudinal analysis of the activism of the first generation of clandestine anarchists under Franco's dictatorship (1939-1975). The results point towards a combination of three factors that help explain the maintenance of anarchist activism. These are: i) the role of hope in the perception of opportunities for mobilization; ii) the strategic mobilization of indignation in the discourse directed at potential supporters and participants; and iii) the strengthening of the ideological identification with the movement due, paradoxically, to the effects of repression. The sources used include a range of archival material as well as activists' memoirs.<br>

Author(s): Baumgartner Frédérique<br>
Abstract: This article focuses on Gina Pane's performance Escalade non anesthésiée (1971), which consisted of the artist mounting a ladder studded with sharp metallic shards, causing injury to herself in the process. Previous art historians have read Pane's performances through a psychoanalytic lens, emphasizing the place of Lacanian thought in the nascent French feminist movement of the 1970s. This article posits that psychoanalytic accounts of Pane's work have neglected the political context of the work's execution and reception. Pane specifically referenced the Vietnam War when she described her intention with Escalade non anesthésiée. Accordingly, this article links her performance to art sociologique - a term applied to a range of politicized works produced in Paris in the wake of the May 68 events - and thereby to the politics of the Internationale Situationniste. Stressing the importance of the concept of alienation in the discourse of the 1970s and in Pane's writings, this article argues that the masochistic elements of her performance were an attempt to end collective passivity. This collective de-anesthetization was carried out by Pane through the photo-documentation of her performance, in which she staged the image of a non-specific rather than individual body.<br>

Abstract: Individual behaviors, such as loss-coping and “grief work” are affected in organizational contexts. In everything pertaining to coping with trauma in general, and loss more particularly, the individual is “trapped” within a political psychology that enforces the habitus and expectations of institutional dominance on the ostensibly intimate and private response. Regimes have perceived bereavement over battlefield deaths as a form of social capital that can be mobilized to enhance national loyalty and political support. Employing both existential/hermeneutic and institutional analysis, this study examines three diachronic models of bereavement — hegemonic, political and civil — and their political ramifications in the Israeli context.Drawing on changing parental conceptual orientations towards fallen sons and their role as cultural and ideological agents in public sphere, the article traces the movement of bereavement from its capture by the hegemonic state institutions to its creations under the domination of others institutions: political and civic and ultimate use in critiquing the political and military echelon. The article indicates the powerful impact of the social institutional-organizational context on the intimate-psychological context of coping with loss, by illustrating this phenomenon in the Israeli society.<br>

Abstract: The 2001 disarmament of kamajor combatants in Bo, Sierra Leone was an event marked by violence. This paper considers that violence, and by extension other violent events in Sierra Leone's recent war, as narrative blocs: configurations of agency, time, imagery and articulation. This formulation stands in contrast to the way vionent events are often treated, as exceptional moments of outburst or eruption resulting from abnormal circumstances but meaningless in themselves. The paper draws on ethnographic fieldwork with the kamajor militia movement in Sierra Leone to trace some of these blocs both within the disarmament center and through other locations in the "war-scape" of Sierra Leone.<br>

Publisher: Sage Publications<br>

Abstract: Although ZhangTaiyan is famous for being a late Qing nationalist and revolutionary, scholars have yet to explore fully the significance of his Buddhist writings, especially as they relate to time and history. This article closely examines Zhang's writings about time and history and points out that Zhang made two interrelated but potentially conflicting arguments. On the one hand, he invoked Yogācāra Buddhism and Zhuang Zi to expound a relativistic vision of time and history. From this perspective, each nation has its historical particularity and cannot be judged from an external standard. However, on the other hand, in a context where intellectuals were uncritically adopting a framework of history as progress, Zhang grounded the theory of evolution in a theory of karmic seeds to develop an interpretation of history as a double movement in which the good gets better and the bad gets worse. The article delves into the significance of Zhang's arguments by highlighting the symmetries between Zhang's exposition of history and the logic of capitalism. Such structural similarities suggest that Zhang could think about time and history in this way precisely because he inhabited a world mediated by the dynamic of capitalism. His writings on Zhuang Zi and Buddhism should be seen as an example of a resistance to capitalism that is not based on a narrative of progress. In the context of twentieth-century Chinese intellectual history, where narratives of progress and evolution are a dominant chord, Zhang's counterpunctual critique of evolution is especially inspiring.<br>

Abstract: Figures of movement are th hinges in Mrs, Dalloway between the different spatial and temporal modalities of utterance, thus signalling the fundamental mobility of discourses while demonstrating its nature as event grounded in contingency. At the same time, these figures connect to the charcterisation of life as perpetual mobility, while discourse's task is to seize the articulations where differences originate or merge.<br>

Author(s): Mennasemay Maimire<br>
Abstract: The paper proposes a symptomatic reading of the writings of a fifteenth century heretical movement—the Dekike Estifanos—to throw light on the modernization predicament of twenty–first century Ethiopia. Based on the assumption that all serious thinking about a society needs to be mediated by its intellectual tradition, the paper enucleates critiques of power, institutions and knowledge that are immanent in the teachings of the Dekike Estifanos and that throw a new light on how Ethiopians could approach the tasks they face in the twenty-first century. It shows that such a critical dialogue with Ethiopia's intellectual traditions discloses questions, ideas and ideals that could provide historically-rooted intellectual resources for developing an Ethiopian critical theory capable of illuminating the possible routes to a modernization productive of freedom, equality, justice, and prosperity.<br>

Abstract: Le but de notre article est d'essayer de montrer en quoi l'expérience rédactionnelle et éditoriale de l'Histoire socialiste de la Révolution française fut pour Jaurès, hormis le prétexte pédagogique évident pour préparer les dirigeants à l'unité du mouvement socialiste encore divisé et pour éduquer politiquement les militants et le prolétariat, l'occasion d'affiner sa réflexion sur une future « méthode socialiste », à la veille de l'unité de 1905. Parce que « la Révolution française contient le socialisme tout entier », quels sont donc les événements que Jaurès juge les plus pertinents et les plus féconds pour l'avenir socialiste de la société et de l'État ? Rappelant le contexte et les conditions de cette grande entreprise, nous nous sommes attachés à retrouver ce qui fonde philosophiquement sa démarche et ses analyses historiques - spécialement au cours du « moment thermidorien » - à partir de sa méthode philosophique adossée à sa métaphysique de l'unité de l'être. Une esquisse, en somme, de l'analyse critique jaurésienne de la « dictature jacobine » et de l'esprit révolutionnaire de Robespierre conditionnant le socialisme réformiste gradualiste de Jaurès. The article attempts to show how the writing and editing of the Socialist History of the French Revolution was for Jaurès not merely a self-evident pretext to enlighten others, unify the still divided leaders of the socialist movement and educate politically the party faithful and the proletariat, but also an opportunity to finetune his reflections on a future « socialist methodology » on the eve of the union of 1905. Given that « the French Revolution contains socialism in its entirety », what then were the events that Jaurès thought most relevant and fruitful for the socialist future of society and state ? While recalling the context and conditions of this great venture, our aim has been to retrieve the philosophical essence of his historical approach and analysis, especially during the « moment of Thermidor »~<br>

Article Title: Peace Research as 'International'. In What Sense?<br>
Publisher: Sage Publications<br>
Issue: i217647<br>
Date: 8 1, 1972<br>
Author(s): Wagar Helena<br>
Abstract: The article presents the notion of peace research, as exemplified by Johan Galtung, as a cognitive movement from the ideational to the anthropo-centric conception. In its anthropo-centric conception, the notion displays a variation in which the progress of man is outlined as a telic process of the mind (as opposed to the genetic process of nature); a process whereby man is able to make choices and direct his own development. In the post-World War II decades, the anthropo-centric concern for progress through mind is actualized as a problem of formation of mental attitude. It is further anticipated that in peace research this movement, in the sense of the cognitive process of research (not in focus here), outlines an idea of the mind-in-progress which is an idea of the moral man. Finally, the author points out an alternative direction to the anthropo-centric critique of the ideational conception in terms of which, according to the thesis of the article, the cognitive movement of peace research largely makes itself understood.<br>

Abstract: In the twentieth century the phenomenon of the subjective body was integrated into ontology in philosophy, moving from Phenomenology to Existentialism. The rediscovery of the body and affect as a way of thinking also led contemporary cognitive science to the topic of the relationship between emotion and cognition, to the necessity of expanding the model of the mind and of experiencing emotions and physical sensation. The extension of the explanatory possibilities of a scholarly metalanguage into the area of the emotions and physical sensation is also important for the analysis of the acoustic aspect of lyric verse. In the acoustic flow of verse, the sounds of language have, apart from a phonemic function, their own sensuous (emotional) effect of the articulating body. In literary studies so far the acoustic flow has been interpreted only at the segmental level as a sequence of phonemes or sounds (for example in constructs of acoustic succession, phonetic instrumentation, or phonetic composition). At the suprasegmental level the acoustic flow must be conceived of as a sequence of syllables, a sequence of articulated phonations, the semantic movement of the phonemic flow. A syllable has no semantic value, but does have an experiential form, which influences motivation, behaviour, and experience. In addition to sonic and tonal modulation at the suprasegmental level, qualitative modulation, modulation of timbre, and the sequences of tones and of noise are also employed. In modelling the semantic movement of syllables in a phonemic flow the methodological approaches of experimental psychosemantics have been used. Connotational objectivization took place in three dimensions that were polarized on the basis of domestic and alien, light and darkness, activity and passivity, and research was conducted with a sample of 2,800 respondents. The analysis of the acoustic side of lyric verse would be incomplete if in addition to accentual rhythm and melody we did not also consider ~<br>

Abstract: Les Frères musulmans, groupe islamiste le plus important du monde arabe, sont largement présents en Europe. Leur mouvance comprend plusieurs types d'organisation, des plus autonomes aux plus orthodoxes. En choisissant de jouer, en particulier en France, la carte de l'insertion dans la société politique locale et nationale, les Frères connaissent désormais une certaine normalisation, qui se traduit par une crise de leurs énoncés idéologiques et de leur force militante. The Muslim Brotherhood, which is the most important Islamic group in the Arabic world, is widely represented in Europe. Its following is composed of a large variety of organizations, whose religious practises vary in their orthodoxy. As they choose to integrate into society both nationally and locally, especially in France, their position has been somewhat normalized. This situation opens an ideological crisis within the movement that, in turn, weakens its militant strength.<br>

Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113389<br>
Date: 7 1, 1986<br>
Author(s): Maddox Donald<br>
Abstract: The entire medieval period is dominated by an eschatological textuality which posits for the history of salvation a singulative movement through time, from creation to eschaton. In book 12 of De civitate Dei, Augustine provides theoretical background for this epochal model; the most cogent statement of its content is found in book 6 of Hugh of Saint Victor's Didascalicon. This type of textuality, whose formal properties are identified, is already marked in Augustine by its exclusion of the purely iterative view of time held by pagan philosophers. From the twelfth century, however, singulative eschatological textuality assimilates an iterative model of the progression of time as it finds expression in metaphorically informed statements concerning the liturgical year. From Jean Beleth to Jacobus de Voragine, the figure of assimilatio facilitates the conflation of a discretelinear and an iterative model of temporality in such representations, the logical relations within which are analyzed here.<br>

Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113394<br>
Date: 12 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): Bishop Edward L.<br>
Abstract: What distinguishes Woolf's prose is not her famous penchant for simile, but her constant use of the less ostentatious, though more radical, verb metaphor. Combining these figures in strings, in which the verbs are consistent but the implied nouns contradictory, Woolf deliberately unsettles the reader, forcing him or her to consider not only the tenuous relations between the word and the world, but the contingent nature of phenomenal reality itself. Thus the view of life as something at once "very shifting" and "very solid" (expressed in the diaries and dramatized in the novels), pervades the essays, captured in the paradoxical relation "it is and is not" that Paul Ricoeur claims lies at the heart of metaphor. A close study of a paradigmatic essay, "On Not Knowing Greek," and of manuscript drafts in New York and Sussex reveals that this tension between shifting and solid extends to the syntax, which manages to be both extravagant and firmly anchored, and to the developing structure of the essay as a whole, which traces a movement of mind (a strategy James Farrell defines as specifically "feminine"), remaining defiantly heuristic and resisting the inherent closure of the formal essay. Thus, like her novels, Woolf s reviews and essays engage us in the process of perception even while inviting us to explore critically the operations of language in that perception.<br>

Abstract: Metaphorics, the movement and process of metaphor, is distributed in Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man as modes generating meaning in each of the novel's five chapters. Each of these modes is linked with the specific "historical" matrix in which it originates, a site which determines the metaphor's structure, its function, and the stylistic effects it produces.<br>

Abstract: En suivant le mouvement circulaire que dessine l'ouvrage fondamental d'Éric Weil, la « Logique de la Philosophie », on relève d'un même coup le penser qui s'y déploie et le rôle qu'y tiennent l'idée de Dieu, la foi biblique et le christianisme. On analyse d'abord la catégorie de Dieu, introduite dans le monde par l'attitude de la foi biblique. On note ensuite ce que devient l'idée de Dieu dans les catégories ultérieures. L'examen des catégories du sens et de la sagesse, constitutives de la philosophie, permet de voir comment le logicien recueille à sa manière le sur-être indicible de la tradition philosophique occidentale, sous la forme du sens présent, de l'éternité de la présence dans le temps de l'histoire. On manifeste enfin, à travers l'écart, quelques convergences entre cette philosophie séculière et la pensée d'un croyant. In the circular movement of the main work of Eric Weil, the « Logique de la Philosophie », we may notice both the development of the thought and the part played by the idea of God, the biblical faith and Christianity. The category of God, introduced by the behaviour of biblical faith, is analysed, and also how the idea of God appears in further categories. By examining categories of meaning and wisdom, proper to philosophy, we may see what means, for the logician, the ineffable over-being of the Western philosophical tradition, as a present meaning, as an eternal presence in historical time. At last appears, through the difference, some convergence between this secular philosophy and the thought of a believer.<br>

Abstract: Cet article offre une vision globale de l'œuvre de Ricœur, l'auteur proposant d'y lire une logique de développement en spirale, parce que dans les ouvrages les plus tardifs du philosophe nous trouvons un retour de la recherche sur la volonté — inscrite dans le cadre d'une anthropologie philosophique — qui avait inspiré son projet de jeunesse. Mouvement en spirale, et non retour circulaire aux origines, car entre le début et la fin il n'y a pas coïncidence mais enrichissement après un long détour à travers l'univers du langage. Ce détour — selon l'hypothèse de travail de l'auteur — progresse à travers trois paradigmes: symbole, texte et traduction. Dans la traduction travaillent le propre et l'étranger, le soi et l'autre, l'autre que nous retrouvons en nous et qui ne se réduit pas à l'altérité de l'autre homme. Un concept pluriel d'humanité — qui est pourtant une — y est à l'oeuvre. Le travail jamais accompli de la traduction suggère enfin l'idée d'une herméneutique de l'inachèvement. This article offers a global vision of Ricœur's work, in which the author suggests the existence of a spiral development, insofar as in the most recent works we find a return to the same research on the will — within the context of a philosophical anthropology — that inspired the project of Ricœur's youthful years. Spiral movement and not circular return to the origin, because the beginning and the end do not coincide but rather enrich one another, after a long detour of many decades through the universe of language. This detour — according to author's working hypothesis — has progressively developed through three paradigms: symbol, text and translation. In translation, what is at work is the familiar and the foreign, the self and the other, the other that we find in ourselves and that cannot be reduced to the otherness of the other man. In translation we find a plural concept of humanity, which is nevertheless one. The never complete work of translation suggests ultimately the idea of ~<br>

Abstract: This paper explores the complicated workings of Japan's mnemonic praxis in its establishment of moral authority. The atomic bombing of Hiroshima was a decisive moment inaugurating Japan as the torch-bearer of pacifism. Given Japan's ideational multiplicity as the victim and the victimizer, its pacifist ideology needs further examinations in conceptual and empirical manifestations. This research situates the ambivalent amnesia and political compromises demonstrated during the renovation project of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum from 1985 until 1994. As for a nation yet to achieve meaningful reconciliation over the past with Asian neighbors, the political divide opens room for utilitarian considerations in its pacifist discourse. The Hiroshima experience suggests that Japan's pacifism can be a problematic representation given its selective mnemonic praxis and situational ethics. This paper argues that Japanese pacifism should be redefined as 'pacifist movement.' Pacifism is foundational ethics, whereas pacifist movement accommodates political contextualization.<br>

Abstract: La « Fédé » (Fédération française des associations chrétiennes d'étudiants) sort renforcée de la Deuxième Guerre mondiale. Influencé depuis le début des années 30 par la théologie de Karl Barth, le mouvement se tourne davantage après 1945 vers le monde et les problèmes politiques. Les étudiants protestants s'insèrent aussi dans la vie associative universitaire et sont partie prenante du développement de l'UNEF. Dans ces cinq années qui suivent la guerre, on voit poindre un certain nombre de tensions entre la jeunesse « fédérative » et les instances religieuses adultes. At the end of second World War, the "Fède" (French Student Christian Federation) has grown stronger. Influenced since early thirties by Karl Barth's theology, the movement shows after 1945 more interest in world affairs and political problems. The protestant studients also get involved in the university's associative life and take part in the development of the student's trade union, the « UNEF ». During these five years following War some tensions become perceptible between the federative youth and the religious adults' organisations. Mit dem Ende des zweiten Weltkriegs ist die « Fédé » (der französische Verband der christlichen Studentenvereine) noch stärker geworden. Ab 1945 interessiert sich die seit dem Anfang der 30er fahre von K. Barths Theologie beeinfluβte Bewegung immer mehr für die Welt und deren politische Probleme. Die protestantischen Studenten beteiligen sich auch häufig an dem Vereinsleben der Universität und wirken aktiv bei der Entwicklung der UNEF mit. Während der ersten fünf fahre nach Kriegsende treten einige Spannungen zwischen einer fugend, die sich für diese christlichen Vereine interessiert, und den religiösen Behörden der Erwachsenen auf.<br>

Abstract: La revue Christianisme social (1896-1971) était l'organe de la Fédération française du Christianisme social, mouvement protestant d'action sociale orienté vers un socialisme chrétien. De 1954 à 1962, elle a vigoureusement pris parti contre la poursuite de la guerre d'Algérie et pour le rétablissement de la paix au moyen d'une négociation avec le F.L.N. Elle a joué le rôle d'une avant-garde par rapport à l'opinion publique protestante, mais sans oser se transformer en parti de la gauche protestante afin de sauvegarder son unité. Son engagement combinait des motivations fondamentalement morales et spirituelles (refus de la torture pratiquée par la police et l'armée françaises) et une analyse politique attribuant au colonialisme français la responsabilité du conflit. Rejetant le principe révolutionnaire du « la fin justifie les moyens », ses rédacteurs appartenaient aux catégories d'opposants à la guerre que Pierre Vidal-Naquet a qualifiés de « dreyfusards » et de « tiers-mondistes ». Mais une étude historique rétrospective doit constater que l'objectivité de leur vision de la guerre d'Algérie a été en partie biaisée par leur parti-pris. Christianisme social (1896-1971) was the main press organ for the Fédération française du Christianisme social, a protestant social action movement leaning toward Christian socialism. From 1954 to 1962, this magazine strongly condemned the pursuit of the Algerian war and called for establishing peace by negociating with the F.L.N. It played an avant garde role for Protestant public opinion without daring setting itself up as the Protestant left party in order to maintain its' unity. This magazines mission combined basically moral and spiritual motivations (refusing torture practised by the French police and army) and a political analysis placing responsability for the conflict on French colonialism. Having rejected the revolutionary principle "The end justifies the means", its' writers belonged to the war opponents that Pierre Vidal-Na~<br>

Publisher: SAGE<br>

Date: 4 1, 2013<br>
Author(s): DeLoughrey Elizabeth M.<br>
Abstract: This article explores how the concept of ecosystem ecologies, one of the most influential models of systems thinking, was developed in relation to the radioactive aftermath of US nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific Islands. Historian Richard Grove has demonstrated how tropical island colonies all over the globe served as vital laboratories and spaces of social, botanical, and industrial experiment in ways that informed modernity and the conservation movement. I propose a similar relationship between the militarized American island colonies of Micronesia and how their constitution as AEC laboratories contributed to both atomic modernity and the field of ecosystem ecology. This was enacted through metaphorical concepts of island isolation and distributed visually by Atomic Energy Commission films that upheld an aerial vision of the newly acquired atolls for an American audience. Finally, the myth of isolation is also at work in the ways in which Marshall Islanders exposed to nuclear fallout became human subjects for radiation experiments due to the idea of the biological isolate.<br>

Abstract: L'idée qu'on se fait généralement, en philosophie de l'action, de la structure physique de l'agir, n'est-elle pas trop schématique? Si l'intentionnalité semble un élément incontournable de la définition de l'agir, n'est-ce pas parce qu'on n'attribue qu'un sens anémique à la notion de mouvement corporel? Il se peut que cette notion, analysée de façon adéquate, se révèle assez vigoureuse pour fonder à elle seule la notion d'agir. Is it not the case that in the philosophy of action we generally have a highly simplified idea of the physical structure of action? Does not defining action in terms of an intention seem unavoidable simply because we give such an anemic meaning to the notion of bodily movement? But if this notion were adequately analyzed, it would perhaps prove sufficient as a basis for the concept of action.<br>

Abstract: Jean-Paul II, dans son encyclique Ut unum sint, situe l'œcuménisme dans une double relation ascendante et descendante: d'une part relation de l'homme à Dieu et d'autre part relation de l'homme au monde. Ces deux mouvements doivent passer par la grille critique de la vérité et de l'amour pour être efficients, ce qui correspond à la Révélation comme mouvement premier de Dieu vers l'homme. Ainsi, le dialogue œcuménique ne pourra éviter une réflexion sur le statut de la vérité et de l'amour dans leur gestion ecclésiale, réflexion menée à la lumière de la polarité christologico-pneumatologique. Symptomatiquement, la question du ministère papal montre les impasses actuelles et les ouvertures possibles. John-Paul II, in his encyclical Ut unum sint, situates ecumenism in a twofold relationship, ascending and descending: the relationship of humankind to God and of humankind to the world. To be dynamic, these two movements must pass through the critical grid of truth and love, which corresponds to revelation as the first movement of God to humans. Thus ecumenical dialogue cannot avoid a reflection of the status of truth and love in ecclesiastic management, in the light of Christo-pneumatological polarity. Symptomatically, the question of papal ministry shows existing dead ends and possible apertures.<br>

Abstract: Le but de cette intervention est de mettre en dialogue les pensées de Paul Ricœur et de Gerhard Ebeling à partir du concept de parole efficace. La première partie entreprend de montrer, notamment à travers les lectures ricœuriennes d'Ebeling dans les années 1960 et 1980, que le théologien allemand est plus «barthien» que le philosophe français en ce qui concerne le mouvement herméneutique de la distanciation. Dans la seconde partie, question se pose, à travers une confrontation plus indirecte entre les deux auteurs, de savoir dans quelle mesure Ricœur est plus «barthien» qu'Ebeling par rapport au mouvement contraire de l'appropriation. Dans sa conclusion, l'auteur avance la thèse selon laquelle Ebeling serait plus cohérent que Ricœur dans sa réflexion autour de la parole efficace. The aim of this essay is to juxtapose the thinking of Paul Ricoeur and Gerhard Ebeling on the basis of the concept of efficient word. The first part, notably through Ricoeur's reading of Ebeling, tries to show that in the 1960's-80's, the German theologian was more «Barthian» than the French philosopher on the topic of the hermeneutical movement of detachment. The second part, by a more indirect confrontation between the two writers, poses the question to what degree Ricoeur is more «Barthian» that Ebeling on the opposite movement of appropriation. The article concludes with the theory that Ebeling is more coherent than Ricoeur in his thinking about efficient word.<br>

Abstract: Confrontation de diverses lectures d'un récit, d'une scène, d'une tradition religieuse. À partir de la figure évangélique de la pécheresse (Luc 7), les analyses philosophiques du pardon s'inscrivent chez le jeune Hegel dans une réflexion sur l'opposition de la loi (le châtiment) et de la réconciliation (l'amour). Dans son Esthétique, les traités de l'art romantique et de la peinture voient en la Madeleine la figuration d'une beauté où intériorité et extériorité s'accordent harmonieusement. Dans divers écrits sur la religion, le même personnage, qui évoque les traits de la belle âme, n'est pas étranger aux méditations sur destin de Jésus, le pardon des offenses et l'idée de la grâce. Ces diverses représentations induisent une pensée en rupture avec d'autres approches philosophiques de la grâce et du pardon (Spinoza, Kant). Une deuxième partie évoque la pécheresse, souvent confondue avec d'autres femmes des Évangiles, telle qu'on la retrouve chez des écrivains de la spiritualité française (Bérulle 1627, Charles de Saint Paul 1628, Lacordaire 1859) et chez les peintres de l'époque baroque. L'article se termine par une étude des nombreuses évocations de la pécheresse chez Kierkegaard. À la différence de la spéculation philosophique ou des « élévations » mystiques, c'est dans une méditation toujours au plus près de la lettre même du Nouveau Testament que sont alors développés de manière existentielle les thèmes du repentir et du pardon. A look at diverse readings of a story, a scene, a religious tradition. Taking the gospel figure of the adulterous woman (Luke 7) as a starting point, the youthful Hegel sets his philosophical analysis of forgiveness in a meditation on Law (Punishment) versus Reconciliation (Love). In his Aesthetics, the treatises on the romantic art movement and on paintings see in Mary Magdalen the figuration of a beauty in which interiority and exteriority are harmonised. In various writings on religion, the same character, now the figuration of the bea~<br>

Abstract: Adopting a reflexive approach, this article interprets a recently created healing ritual in Brittany that integrates local 19th-century notions about the curative powers of prehistoric monuments with diverse elements from non-Breton sources. Parallels are noted between this New Age therapy and witchcraft, an older explanatory framework for illness and misfortune in Brittany. The therapeutic discourse associated with the ritual draws on the past and on exotic cultures to construct a meaningful cosmology. Therefore, this discourse--like the New Age movement as a whole--has much in common with anthropology, which, it is suggested, provides Western society with an ordered vision of the world.

Author(s): Young Patricia A.<br>
Abstract: The field of bioethics has been dominated by the tenets and assumptions of Western philosophical rationalistic thought. A principles and rights-based approach to discussions of moral dilemmas has sustained and reinforced a pervasive reductionism, utilitarianism, and ethnocentrism in the field. Recent explorations of casuistry and hermeneutics suggest a movement toward an expanded theoretical and conceptual framing of medical ethical problems. Increased attention to moral phenomenology and a recognition of the importance of social, cultural, and historical determinants that shape moral questioning should facilitate collaborative work between anthropologists and ethicists. In this article, I examine the philosophical orientation of U.S. bioethics and the relationship of the social sciences to the field of medical ethics. Deterrents to collaboration between anthropologists and bioethicists are explored. Finally, I review past and possible future contributions of anthropology to the field of bioethics and, more generally, to medical ethics.<br>

Abstract: This study describes the symbolic process by which individuals attempted to realize, in organizational form, their variant interpretations of an extended metaphor - community mental health. Their metaphoric construals were embedded in everyday discourse and were initially unrecognized by participants at a community mental health center. The metaphoric process, that is, the movement involving the emergence, interpretation, and realization of these metaphors, was mediated by the self-images of the participants. They had embarked upon an innovative project to realize, in part, an ideal sense of self. The latter was a key factor in the development of new construals of community mental health and the implementation of these construals.<br>

Abstract: 'Positivism,' it seems, is a movement that cultural anthropology can do without. But what is positivism, who are these positivists, and what precisely are their sins? Notwithstanding appearances to the contrary, the image of positivism in cultural anthropology is comparatively coherent and the criticism directed at it relatively well founded. What is dubious is the conclusion to which many critics think it leads: that the methods of the natural sciences are inappropriate to the study of human culture and society.<br>

Author(s): DAVIS ANDREW<br>
Abstract: This article proposes that Romantic sonatas exploit in their formal structures multiply directed temporal narratives, comprising a temporal stream and various other streams that can be broadly characterized as
         atemporal. The temporal stream articulates the principal sonata trajectory and correlates with the concept known in structural narratology as thefirst narrative; the atemporal streams reside on alternate temporal levels and remain external to, or disengaged from, that of the first narrative. The structural and expressive implications of this opposition, together with the view of sonata-formal conventions made available in recent work on Sonata Theory, provide a framework within which the article explicates Chopin’s robust dialogue, in the first movement of his Piano Sonata in B Minor, Op. 58, with Classical German-Austrian sonata conventions and contemporary Romantic aesthetic currents. The reading provides a foundation for reassessing Chopin’s work in the sonata genre, the norms and expressive potential of which he is often thought of as never fully apprehending.<br>

Date: 04 2010<br>
Author(s): Siff David B.<br>
Abstract: R. Naḥman of Bratslav's magnum opus,
         Liqutey Moharan, expresses contradictory attitudes toward the value and ontological primacy of books as opposed to living speech. When his discourses are sorted by the date delivered, one can see a specific shift in attitude. R. Naḥman's emphasis on oral expression, in discourses leading up to 1804, is characteristic of Hasidism's shift from the literary approach of Kabbalah toward an orally driven mass movement. Rebbe Naḥman's later emphasis on printed books can be understood in light of his decision in 1804 to embrace the printed book as a mechanism for spreading his ideas, a decision that may have stemmed from his messianic aspirations. Ontologies of orality and literacy are thus exposed as shifting ideological responses to biographical and historical circumstances.<br>

Abstract: Allusion and citation in Philip's
         She Tries Her Tongueexplicitly works to harness cultural capital from the literary canon. As she puts it, her poems are squatters in the house of language: “We have been linguistic squatters, possessing adversely what is truly ours.”
               This appropriation is of a piece with what Oswald De Andrade and K. Silem Mohammad are about in their splicing of Shakespeare, which I mentioned at the outset. In130
            Sonnagrams, Mohammad combines aleatory procedures with the strict observance of traditional meter and rhyme in his recombination of Shakespeare's sonnets. Somewhat like Pierre Menard's re-authoring ofDon Quixote, Mohammad sought to create new poems that were “quantitatively equivalent to Shakespeare's poems,” although this meant they were equivalent only “at the most basic linguistic level: the letter.” Mohammad explains his combinatorial process: “I feed each of Shakespeare's 154 sonnets one line at a time into an internet anagram engine … thus generating a new list of words from each line … The textual output … gives me a bank of raw material.”
               A quatrain from sonnet #3 (“Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest”) becomes:131
            
               As Heather McHugh puts it, Mohammad offers an “anagram as scrupulous as it is full of slang and sass.”Go softly to the Disneyland Hotel,

               Mohammad notes that he's not interested in being “overtly influenced by Shakespeare's semantic content.”133
            
               His re-authoring is, moreover, consciously situated within a tradition of anagrams (especially those of Ferdinand De Saussure) and rewritings of Shakespeare's sonnets (he names Ted Berrigan, Bernadette Mayer, Jen B~<br>

Abstract: It is surely a mark of some kind of success when a movement begins to be attacked by its own participants. We may recall the surrealist debates of the 1920s, with their rival manifestos, counterblasts, and excommunications, or Roland Barthes's irritated insistence in the mid-1970s that he was not after all a structuralist. Emily Apter's new book suggests that the resurgent study of world literature has achieved a comparable standing today. Herself a leading figure in the opening up of comparative literature toward global perspectives, notably as author of
      The Translation Zone: A New Comparative Literature(2006), as contributor to several collections on world literature, and as a founding board member of Harvard's Institute for World Literature, Apter is well situated to assess the field from within. InAgainst World Literature, she offers a bracing critique of the politics of translation in American literary studies. All too often, she argues, scholars and teachers of world literature assume a ready transferability across open linguistic and political borders, and she aims to complicate these matters, both linguistically and politically.<br>

Abstract: Fitzgerald's nostalgic style, though, set an example of how a nostalgic narrative could be structured, and in its aftermath it was used by such different authors as Evelyn Waugh in
      Brideshead Revisited(1945), Anthony Burgess inA Clockwork Orange(1962) and the works of Kazuo Ishiguro. The author's own later work employs it as well. The technique of using the reader's textual memory in order to evoke a phenomenological nostalgic experience is very evident in both versions ofTender Is the Night(the 1934 original, and Malcolm Cowley's 1951 restructuring). In the 1951 version, the structure of the narrative closely follows the pattern of happiness and reflection. An early description of a Swiss valley communicates an awe of life and nature: “The sun swam out into a blue sea of sky and suddenly it was a Swiss valley at its best—pleasant sounds and murmurs and a good fresh smell of health and cheer” (9). In the transitory third book, “Casualties: 1925,” the tone has changed from appreciative to melancholic, as in this description of the small town of Amiens: “In the day-time one is deflated by such towns, with their little trolley cars of twenty years ago crossing the great grey cobble-stoned squares in front of the cathedral, and the very weather seems to have a quality of the past, faded weather like that of old photographs” (138). At the end of the novel both Dick and Nicole Diver become obsessed with youth and the past as well as with time: “for Nicole the years slipped away by clock and calendar and birthday, with the added poignance of her perishable beauty” (228). Toward the end of the novel, Nicole's last sight of Dick—“her eyes followed his figure until it became a dot and mingled with the other dots in the summer crowd” (386)—forces the reader to reflect in a reversed movement. Instead of vanishing like Dick, this image suggests a backward recollection of what was a Swiss valley “at its best.”<br>

Abstract: Throughout this discussion I have attempted to pay attention to geographical, spatial meanings as the material basis in our discussion. This is especially true in any study of diasporas since they involve movement through space over land and seascapes. Diasporas define orientations within situations of transculturation. They emphasize the religious meaning evoked from the transhumance capability of the human mode of being. Sacrality is often understood through vertical metaphors, with the gods and divine beings above, the human below, and the earth below. Along with this vertical metaphor, diasporic orientations bring to the fore the horizontal dimension of sacrality and the role of distance and movement in the revelation of sacrality and knowledge.<br>

Abstract: In the event, SPEP did seem to be made up of oddballs and outsiders in those early years. In 1964 it was a bit larger than the twenty or thirty souls that Ed Casey describes in his paper, but not by much. The leadership was a diverse bunch: Aron Gurwitsch, gruff and insistent on rigor and clarity, the embodiment of the old-school European professor. His presence made me aware, for the first time, I think, of the existence of the New School for Social Research, that amazing institution where I would later teach and am teaching now. John Wild, with the fervor of the recent convert himself, was eager to convert others. According to one tale, possibly apocryphal, an undergraduate student reported that he kept talking about a place called “Lebensville” and saying we ought to go back there. Herbert Spiegelberg, sweetest of men, had earned the respect and gratitude of all for publishing his two-volume
      The Phenomenological Movement, which had appeared in 1960. George Schrader, slowly abandoning Kant for Heidegger. Bill Earle, a very smooth talker—that's all I remember. Erwin Straus, who in his old age exemplified, every time he stood up to speak, the epic struggle of our species to attain the upright posture. Dreyfus, Todes, Lingus, Schrag, and Edie were the Young Turks in that group. We graduate students, still looking on curiously from the sidelines at that point, slowly got a sense of the great learning and intellectual integrity of our elders and also eventually picked up the excitement of being an embattled minority struggling for survival and recognition.<br>

Abstract: An early SPEP paper by Earle made a strong impression on me in this regard—though not, I think, in quite the way he intended.
      
            He argued that our fledgling movement seemed to be developing a dual personality. On the one hand, we seemed to be trading in the traditional metaphysics of human nature for a rigorous Husserlian science of human life's “essentials”; and on the other hand, we were producing an existentialist excess of “ontological autobiographies” that glorified various purely contingent and accidental senses of how life might be lived. But surely Earle's dualism was too traditional to capture what we all wanted to say both about the human condition “in general”11
         andabout the unique possibilities open to every individual. Indeed, Earle himself was especially hard on those who tried to avoid sayinganythingtoo generally, for fear they might objectify life's deepest dimensions, oranythingtoo specifically, lest it be taken as merely philosophical special pleading. What, he demanded, do twoExistenzentalk about? To be struck dumb by this question would be to betray one's possessing a very unphenomenological allegiance to an objectivist conception of language.<br>

Abstract: But why that second injection to paralyze the muscles? This supplementary injection can only be for the sake of the witnesses who want to see an inert body devoid of movement, unlike the wracked and bleeding bodies aflame in the electric chair. This so-called clean death sterilized with high-tech medical apparatus, including IVs, syringes, and hospital gurneys, supposedly sanitizes death; and like the surgical strike in high-tech warfare, it focuses death into an imagined pain-free instant, but only by dividing it into the three stages of the lethal injection protocol, which ensures that the prisoner will look dead before he or she is dead.<br>

Abstract: The Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy (SPEP), as a fifty-year-old movement of both phenomenologically and existentially disposed philosophers, may regard Franz Brentano (1838–1917) as at least a grandfather. For many SPEP members, including myself until very recently, Brentano has been known in a rather vague and inauthentic empty intention merely as the teacher of Husserl, foremost in regard to some aspects of the doctrine of intentionality. Upon closer inspection this is pitifully shortsighted, and I have come to believe that the phenomenologist's lineage to the grandfather is not to be forgotten and that retrieving it may bring out not only differences but surprising enrichments that will emerge through wrestling with the differences.
         
                  As merely one example, I want to discuss Brentanian propositions regarding the individuality of the I.1<br>

Abstract: I had spent the summer of 1960 studying Greek and working as a laundry truck driver for the Alert Laundry Company, who's cliental lived in the ghetto that surrounded the University of Chicago. That summer, of the thirteen laundry trucks of the Alert Laundry Company, twelve were robbed. Mine wasn't. I got to know everybody, including the robbers, who gave me a pass. That summer marked the beginning of an education that allowed me to see, firsthand, the real injustice of America, which in the course of events led to the civil rights movement, whose northern base was Chicago. Looking back over the events of my life I can say that although I was born in Iowa, I grew up in Chicago. Clearly, the University of Chicago provided me with a dual education: one that made it possible for me to earn academic degrees and another that afforded a set of experiences that transformed my life. As a result of all that, the changing times and the Chicago experience, much to the chagrin of those who hired me at Boston College, I began to teach a number of courses on social phenomenology (Schutz), attempting to do a kind of social philosophy, which, of course, was a very respectable thing, still being done today. Then in 1971 I went to Germany to perfect my German and by accident ended up at the University of Marburg (Phillips Universität Marbug), the most radical university in Germany at the time. There I was appropriately intimidated, mainly by German students, regarding my knowledge of political philosophy as it related to the most celebrated figure of the day, Karl Marx. I returned to Boston at the end of that summer harboring a passion for finding out what Marx was about. After reading several books on Marx I decided that he couldn't be as bad as his representatives portrayed him, and I started reading the man himself. Like many others I was seduced, converted, overwhelmed, transformed by the encounter, which led to a long struggle with the man and his work from which I never fully re~<br>

Abstract: I believe that in its twenty-fifth year SPEP brought to fruition a movement of incremental postmodern developments and made a full turn out of the modern orientation of its origin. That turn opened a new era for SPEP. Its origin had given SPEP life and vision and played a large role in transforming professional philosophy in the United States as it also transformed into a society that no one could have imagined in 1961.<br>

Abstract: To rush to my conclusion: while the charge of “correlation” made by the enfants terribles has led to wildly unreasonable criticisms of late Continental philosophy, it is far from unreasonable to complain that postmodern French philosophy, and SPEP along with it, has marginalized the natural sciences. We have shown some interest (via Heidegger) in “technology,” but we have avoided the confrontation with mathematics and the natural sciences that was a part of the early phenomenological movement. Up to now philosophers such as Michel Serres and Bruno Latour have been treated as minor voices, and that, I think, has to change. The future of Continental philosophy depends on it, not just the future of a Continental philosophy of religion.<br>

Abstract: The first of these four sections, entitled “Radicalizing Phenomenology,” consists of three articles, each of which pushes phenomenology beyond itself into exciting new directions. Frédéric Seyler's “Fichte in 1804: A Radical Phenomenology of Life?” compares two thinkers who stand at the ends of the chronological spectrum of the phenomenological movement—Fichte and Michel Henry—but who nevertheless share the common aim of offering a phenomenology of life. Seyler argues that this aim leads them to confront an unsurpassable limit, inasmuch as a phenomenology of life attempts to grasp something that is strictly invisible or ineffable: the absolute as life that lies beyond or underneath the subject/object split. Crina Gschwandtner's article, “Revealing the Invisible: Henry and Marion on Aesthetic Experience,” also discusses Henry and considers him in relation to Jean-Luc Marion, with a focus not on the religious implications of their work but, rather, on their aesthetics. Concentrating on the relationship between the visible and invisible and on the way that each thinker privileges the phenomenon of art, Gschwandtner uncovers parallels between and also critically interrogates Henry's and Marion's theories of art and the artist. Finally, in “Is a Hermeneutic Phenomenology Wide Enough? A Ricoeurian Reply to Janicaud's
      Phenomenology ‘Wide Open,’” Scott Davidson stages a critical engagement between Dominique Janicaud and Paul Ricoeur, arguing both that Janicaud's attempt to distance himself from hermeneutic phenomenology is unsuccessful and that the true significance of his minimal phenomenology has yet to be fully appreciated. Davidson further argues that reflecting on the relationship between minimal and hermeneutic phenomenology reveals important new possibilities for phenomenological reflection today.<br>

Abstract: It seems to me that this provides the basis for a good answer to the question that was posed at the outset of this article, that is: “Is a hermeneutic phenomenology ‘wide open’ enough for a minimal phenomenology?” This is indeed the case. For, just as Freud's mixed discourse means that each discourse points to a discourse outside itself, the same could be said of the relation between Deleuze and phenomenology.
      
               The key here is to recognize that the nonsignifying or the impersonal is on the way to meaning and on the way to consciousness. And at the same time, phenomenological discourse necessarily points back to a nonsignifying or impersonal reality that precedes and gives rise to it. The role of a hermeneutic phenomenology is to mediate between these two discourses by traveling along this path back and forth between meaning and its becoming, following its composition and decomposition in the movement from sense to non-sense, from the impersonal to the personal, from the formless to form—and back again.26<br>

Issue: philrhet.45.4.issue-4<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Stretching
         verbato its breaking point, he dramatically attempts to communicate and re-present an extraordinaryresthrough the disorienting and performative twists and turns of hyperbolicincrementumandcongeries. In a representative example, he writes:
               Amid this teeming sea of paradoxical complexities and discursive amalgamations, Taylor's excessive thought regarding “the Holy” that is “irreducibly ex-orbitant” and interrupts the “circulation of knowledge” reveals the use of hyperbole at work as he navigates across an ambiguous theo-philosophical topography. Incrementally augmenting, accumulating, and building toward this unrealizable term, he “throws beyond” incongruities in order to push toward the apprehension that “the Holy” is “that which cannot be conceived.” He is making the attempt to communicate the inconceivable through his language of excess and exaggeration, which is the only way he could make the attempt effectively, and the insight gleaned from his work is that the disorienting movement of theology and a/theology, beyond the end of theology, is equally and inevitably an impossible possibility.The trace of the fugitive gods is the nonabsent absence of the Holy. This trace is a different trace, the trace of difference itself, which can never be expressed directly, revealed totally, or known completely. It is ever elusive, evasive, excessive. Irreducibly ex-orbitant, the Holy eternally returns to interrupt the circulation of knowledge and to disrupt every form of reciprocal exchange. To hear the “inhuman,” “anonymous,” “uncanny” murmur of the Holy is to become open to that which cannot be conceived, grasped, mastered, or controlled. (1990, 119)<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur, however, does not view the movement from mimesis
      3to mimesis1as arhetoricalmoment. He employs rhetorical terminology as he discusses the techniques that the actual (as opposed to implied) author of a text utilizes in order to conceal “the violence … in the strategy of persuasion” (1988, 3:162). But he abandons this vocabulary when he approaches the reader, opting instead for the language of phenomenology and aesthetics (1988, 3:166–67). In part, he discards the language of the rhetorical tradition because of his limited view of rhetoric's capacity to produce real change in the world. He privileges poetics and philosophy “ontologically” over rhetoric, as Michael Leff has rightly pointed out (1987, 60). Ricoeur valorizes these intellectual traditions according to their ends: poetry results in a cathartic moment that purges old emotions and makes way for new ones, whereas rhetoric results in a persuasive moment that merely crystallizes the preexisting opinions of the audience. According to Ricoeur, these two ends are starkly opposed to one another: “Catharsis must, finally, be opposed to persuasion.” Unlike “all seduction or flattery” (i.e., rhetoric), catharsis stirs the emotions in order to enable “the creative imitation of human action” (1997, 66; see also 1977, 35). However, in the third volume ofTime and Narrative, Ricoeur also admits that the set of effects attached to catharsis is “complex”: “It designates first of all the effect of the work that is more moral than aesthetic: new evaluations, hitherto unheard of norms, are proposed by the work, confronting or shaking current customs” (1988 3:176). Because catharsis possesses a moral component, Ricoeur reasons, it is capable of instructing. Many rhetorical scholars would likely take issue with his assigning such seemingly “persuasive” effects to the realm of poetics rather than rhetoric. Does not Aristotle say that the stirring of emotions is as essential as logical argument to persuasion and judgm~<br>

Abstract: The volume's next two essays address issues of physiology and representation, albeit in very different ways. In “The Playwright's Perplexity: Constitution, Contagion, and Consumption in
      The Doctor's Dilemma,” Alexis Soloski traces Shaw's ambivalence toward the figure of the stage consumptive. Through Louis Dubedat, she argues, the play “somewhat in spite of itself” endorses the “conventional, sentimental narrative of the typical fictional tubercular” even as it “succeeds as a satire of medics and morals.” Sonya Freeman Loftis's “The Superman on the Spectrum: Shaw's Autistic Characters and the Neurodiversity Movement” assesses the efficacy of the provocative appropriation of Shaw by a contemporary movement, anxious to reify a distinctive public identity and history while at the same time avoid reaffirming stereotypical perceptions and anachronistic spin-doctoring. Examining Saint Joan and Henry Higgins as characters on the spectrum, her essay seeks to illuminate what is interpretively at stake within the plays they inhabit and the extrapolative implications of readingthroughthose characters to produce an “Autistic Shaw.” (As a side note, surely underscoring the fecundity of Shaw studies, these two contributors each had a first child during the gestation of thisSHAWissue. The Life Force does not believe in mere coincidence.)<br>

Author(s): Einsohn Howard Ira<br>
Abstract: Like Ricoeur, Shaw invests his ethical capital in enhancing life, not in obeying rules. In the celebrated dream sequence of
         Man and Superman, Shaw includes duty as one of the seven deadly virtues that cause more detriment than benefit. For him, there is no act, however heinous, that some well-intentioned individual has not justified under the rubric of duty. The road to hell, Shaw said famously, is paved with the good intentions of those who in the aftermath of disastrous results defended themselves by claiming that duty compelled them to do what they did. For this reason, his recording angel is not keenly interested in what Kantian precepts individuals have or have not followed. What counts for the celestial Shavian bookkeeper is whether actions make the world better or worse, whether they reduce suffering and increase happiness—with happiness defined as the joy, the wellness, that comes from serving a purpose greater than narrow self-interest. “[C]onduct,” Shaw writes, “must justify itself by its effect upon life and not by its conformity to any rule or ideal.”
               And effecting life, in the sense Shaw understands it, is not a matter of dutifully genuflecting before conventional morality but of asserting the autonomous will, even if it engenders charges of immorality. “[L]ife,” he continues, “consists in the fulfilment of will”33
            
               and not in, as he reiterates in34
            The Sanity of Art, “the fulfilment of a moral law or of the deductions of reason.”
               Even so, Shaw makes it very clear that in crowning the will sovereign he is not championing anarchy. For every sanctioned principle his visionaries disavow, they honor nine. Shaw does not condone recklessness or wild abandon. Before the will sets events in motion, prudence and deliberative judgment, he believes, should prepare the way. He is well aware that we cannot dispense with tradition entirely and reasonably expect society to remain stable. Rat~<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: An obvious criticism of Burke's idea of rhetorical transcendence is that it is utopian in the unrealistic sense. It seems so abstract in its focus on generalized terminology and images that it may have no possible concrete object. Burke realized this utopian quality reminiscent of the lack of actualized topos in More's utopian “no-place.” As rhetorician James Zappen explains, “These acts of pure persuasion are devoid of partisan advantage-seeking but also devoid of persuasive purpose. As such, they might not even exist.”
      
               The important thing to take away from Burke's ramblings, though, is the humanistic sense that the search for perfection is inherent in human nature and that understanding this utopian impulse can only help us to live and to seek happiness in a world of competing power and advantage: “Let us observe, all about us, forever goading us, though it be in fragments, the motive that attains its ultimate identification in the thought, not of the universal holocaust, but of the universal order…. [E]ach kind strives toward the perfection of its kind, and so toward the kind next above it, while the strivings of the entire series head in God as the beloved cynosure and ninecure, the end of all desire.”35
            
               By36
            GodBurke means an ultimate ideal transcending all other symbols and fulfilling all desire—the kind of nirvana that would eliminate the need for further utopia-making altogether. This, of course, is not achievable in the course of history, but the mythic experience of it would activate a downward movement in the process, bringing the transcendent ideals back into the pragmatic world of discourse and human affairs. This would be the function of utopia in Burkean terms, and it would result in a habit of mind that would amount to a large-scale educational scheme—dare I say, the education of desires. If the young were informed of the dialectical-rhetorical process of transcendence from the beginning, ~<br>

Issue: utopianstudies.23.2.issue-2<br>

Abstract: This unceasing flow is precisely what, according to Julia Kristeva, articulates the semiotic function of writing in what she calls a “pulsating
         chora”
               —an idea glossed by Brivic as “the level of maternal pulsation in language.”158
            
               Kristeva identifies this159
            choraas a “totality formed by the [semiotic] drives … in a motility that is as full of movement as it is regulated.”
               She cites Joyce's work as representative of that rare set of literary texts that “cover the infinity of the [signifying] process, that is, reach the semiotic160
            chora.”
               In that Joyce's writing confronts patriarchal regulation with this deconstructive, progressive, and chaotic flow, its attraction to feminist theorists is clear: as Brivic notes, “Joyce's experiments directly inspired two of the leading thinkers of the161
            écriture fémininemovement, Hélène Cixous and Julia Kristeva.”
               Like poststructuralist feminism, Joyce's work advances a mode of Utopianism that necessarily resists categorization. In discussing her notion of162
            écriture féminine(a literary form in which she includes Joyce's work—indeed she wrote her doctoral thesis on Joyce),
               Hélène Cixous has suggested that it is impossible to define such modes of writing and that “this is an impossibility that will remain, for this practice can never be theorized, enclosed, coded—which doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.”163
            
               While Herbert Marcuse may have suggested that the Utopian is validated by its categorization as such (and thereby by its exclusion from normative, hegemonic discourse), the mode of Utopianism expressed by Kristeva's164
            choraor Cixous'sécriture féminineis validated by virtue of the fact that it cannot be so categorized. Like Joyce's “word known to all men,”
               Utopia is too fluid for such reductive definition.165<br>

Abstract: Rowe and Koetter's book proposed a reading of twentieth-century modernist architecture and city planning that apparently revealed the fatal flaws that poisoned it from the outset. According to the authors, the peculiar admixture of blind faith in technoscience combined with a desire for a return to paradise ensured that modern architecture would be the enemy of urban life. In short, a species of technological utopianism was identified as the ultimate culprit. Overcoming the influence of utopian thinking in architecture was advanced as the only sure guarantee against repeating the failures of the modern movement and for protecting us from its tyrannical tendencies more generally.<br>

Abstract: The article focuses on the role of the “Survey on Regional Architecture in Portugal” in 1955 and its effects on contemporary Portuguese architecture. A photographic survey organizes and indexes a group of buildings with precise criteria, allowing a general panorama. In fact these built-environment, large-scale archives play an important role in heritage preservation. In the 1930s, an interesting phenomenon gathered architects who, although committed to the modern movement and enthusiasts of industrial progress, showed a growing interest in vernacular buildings and settlements. Some of these architects became photographers, attentive to a pre-industrial world that was endangered, to record timeless architecture and expose new aesthetic values. This interest generated several movements centered on an appreciation of regional architecture. Along with nostalgia, there stood out the feeling that there were still many lessons to be drawn from these threatened vernacular structures.<br>
