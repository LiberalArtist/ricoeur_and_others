  CHAPTER 2  Historical Forms of Mystification from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1ws7x0t">Intellectual Sacrifice and Other Mimetic Paradoxes</a><br>
  Abstract: In the previous chapter, we saw that for Girard the Gospels are not mythical texts, but the greatest form of demystification of mimetic victimage. In the Gospels there is no kind of confrontation with philosophy, understood as a discipline based on rational investigation. That confrontation rather takes place in the Pauline texts, where “knowledge of God” (σοφίᾳ τοῦ Θεοῦ) is contrasted with “worldly knowledge” (σοφία τοῦ κόσμου) (1 Corinthians 1:20). The former is the knowledge of God that was revealed first in the Old Testament and then by means of Christ; this must be the object of

  Abstract: Since 1961, Girard’s production has grown without interruption, to at least the same degree as his fame. Without doubt, the fascination with Girard’s thought derives from the fact that he has constructed a true “speculative cathedral,” a theory that proposes to explain everything from myths to rituals, Greek tragedies to modern novels, holocausts of historical magnitude to everyday customs. At first glance, it would seem that Girard has changed little or nothing of his speculative construction since then, but if we look closely, there are noticeable problems and corrections that threaten the very foundations of mimetic theory. Indeed, recent criticism<br>

  CHAPTER 4  The House of Labdacus: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt4qt">Intimate Domain</a><br>
  Abstract: Sophocles’s three Theban plays—
                  Antigone, Oedipus the King, Oedipus at Colonus—are not formally a trilogy. Sophocles wrote the plays across the span of his career andAntigone, whose dramatic action comes late in the chronology of Oedipus’s family, was likely written and performed a decade beforeOedipus the Kingand over three decades beforeOedipus at Colonus.¹ As a consequence, the plays that comprise the Theban cycle are most often understood to share a familial narrative drawn from myths rather than a single artistic frame of reference. InOedipus the King, Oedipus fulfills an oracle when he kills his<br>

  Book Title: Shared Land/Conflicting Identity-Trajectories of Israeli & Palestinian Symbol Use<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Frank David A.<br>
  Abstract: Shared Land/Conflicting Identity: Trajectories of Israeli and Palestinian Symbol Useargues that rhetoric, ideology, and myth have played key roles in influencing the development of the 100-year conflict between first the Zionist settlers and the current Israeli people and the Palestinian residents in what is now Israel. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is usually treated as an issue of land and water. While these elements are the core of the conflict, they are heavily influenced by the symbols used by both peoples to describe, understand, and persuade each other. The authors argue that symbolic practices deeply influenced the Oslo Accords, and that the breakthrough in the peace process that led to Oslo could not have occurred without a breakthrough in communication styles.Rowland and Frank develop four crucial ideas on social development: the roles of rhetoric, ideology, and myth; the influence of symbolic factors; specific symbolic factors that played a key role in peace negotiations; and the identification and value of criteria for evaluating symbolic practices in any society.<br>

  3  The Birth of the Symbolic Systems of Labor and Revisionist Zionism from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt60k">Shared Land/Conflicting Identity</a><br>
  Abstract: Most symbol systems are created like a seabed through a process of sedimentation. The new symbol system simply develops over time from the old one. Thus, the symbolic system of American conservatism in the 1990s clearly has evolved from an earlier conservative perspective. In other cases, however, a new symbol system may be created in response to a strong exigency, a perceived crisis. In that circumstance, the failure of the existing system to solve the crisis leads to the development of a new (often revolutionary) system of rhetoric/ideology/myth.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt60k">Shared Land/Conflicting Identity</a><br>
  Abstract: After birth, a mythic system (and both Revisionism and Labor Zionist were myth-based systems) may develop in one of four ways. The system may decline if it fails to meet the needs of the people in presenting a solution to the crisis that called it into existence or if it fails to respond to a shifting scene. To paraphrase Kenneth Burke,<br>

  6  The Essential Palestinian from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt60k">Shared Land/Conflicting Identity</a><br>
  Abstract: In chapter 4, we described the movement of the Palestinian people from a symbol system based to varying degrees on Arab, Islamic, and nationalist impulses toward a Palestinian Arab identity and movement rooted in myth. By 1937, the Palestinians had developed a symbol system that was based on ideological and mythic foundations that collapsed the scene (Palestine) and the agent (the Palestinian Arabs) into a consubstantiation. In this chapter, we examine the trajectory of Palestinian symbol use from the 1940s to 1960s.<br>

  7  From Camp David to Lebanon from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt60k">Shared Land/Conflicting Identity</a><br>
  Abstract: The slightly more than five-year period from Menachem Begin’s election as prime minister of Israel in 1977 through the war in Lebanon represents one of the most crucial periods in symbolic development in the history of Israel. This period was dominated by conflicting aspects of the Revisionist symbol system. On the one hand, Begin led Israel first to the Camp David Accords and then to a peace treaty with Egypt. In the development of the peace process, Begin’s rhetoric reflected the underlying myth of Holocaust and Redemption, including a strong commitment to maintaining Israeli control over Eretz Israel, but also<br>

  8  From the Occupation to Intifada from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt60k">Shared Land/Conflicting Identity</a><br>
  Abstract: The 1967 war and the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip produced a second al Nekba for the Palestinian people, compounding the tragedy of 1948. From 1967 until the 1993 Oslo Accords, Palestinian Arabs were either outside of historic Palestine in the Diaspora, in Israel proper as second-class citizens, or under occupation. During this period, the trajectory of the Palestinian symbol system, which had hardened into an irredentist mold that demonized Zionism and vested Palestinian Arab nationalism with essentialist qualities, slowly changed. In this chapter, we will survey the changes in Palestinian ideology, myth, and rhetoric as<br>

  12  From Symbolic Stasis to the End of Revisionism from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt60k">Shared Land/Conflicting Identity</a><br>
  Abstract: The 1996 Israeli election reflected the stasis that characterized Israeli politics for the fifteen years following the war in Lebanon. Labor and Likud existed in a kind of symbolic balance. The pragmatic Labor approach gave the party the advantage on “peace,” while Likud’s ideology and myth gave it the advantage on “security” and commitment to Eretz Israel. In this period, the stasis was broken only once, by the election of Yitzhak Rabin, whose personal credibility and gruff style reassured many Israelis that they could have both peace and security. After the death of Rabin, Shimon Peres was unable to marshal<br>

  INTRODUCTION. from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt19633g6">The Red Sea</a><br>
  Abstract: This dictum evokes a famous verse in the Quran, which affirms that “every living thing is made of water” (
                  wa jaʿalnā min al-māʾi kulla shayʾ in ḥayyin,21:30); it is implicit in Genesis I, where the earth and the heavens are created by a division of the waters; it forms a basic truth claim in modern astronomical science, so that the mere presence of water on a planet may be a sign of life; it is found in many creation myths and much common sense. Thales, who launched the great adventure of Greek philosophy, also affirmed as much. There is<br>

  Author(s) BLAKE WILLIAM<br>
  Abstract: As does his very different contemporary Goethe, Blake appears today as one of the first of the new poets to revive in his own work a more-than-literary role as (ʺvisionaryʺ) shaper-of-the-real. (See Vico, above, p. 4.) Of the prevalence of such a mythopoetic mode in a larger human history, he wrote: ʺThe antiquities of every Nation under Heaven, is no less sacred than that of the Jews. They are the same thing as Jacob Bryant, and all antiquaries have proved. How other antiquities came to be neglected and disbelieved, while those of the jews are collected and arranged, is an<br>

A projection of Surrealist yearning, the idea of a process, an ʺact of dreamingʺ by which ʺthe mind makes contact with whatever mystery it is that connects the Dreaming [the Eternal Dream Time] and the Here and Now,ʺ is fundamental to mythic thought throughout the world and is at its most developed in the traditions<br>

  Abstract: In the third hour of the night following his three days in Hell and a day in Ante-Purgatory, Dante sleeps in a flowering meadow. He feels mournful, like the swallow, which according to myth was once a ravished maiden. Probably at dawn, although the text allows the possibility that his vision lasts all night, he dreams that an eagle carries him up to the circle of fire. He compares himself to Ganymede, whom Jove, metamorphosed into an eagle, carried to the heavens, and then to Achilles, whom bright light awoke when he was carried to Sciros. When Dante revives he<br>

  Abstract: I will now bring to bear on my imaginary experiment the traditions of thought in ancient Greece, conveniently labeled “Pythagorean,” that also contained multiple theories of rebirth. Most of the doctrines of rebirth discussed earlier have both historical and contemporary relevance, but for Greece one has no choice but to deal exclusively with the historical traditions, beginning with the figure most associated with rebirth doctrines, Pythagoras. Pythagoras, like similar figures in religious history, is simultaneously a historical and mythic persona such that it makes little sense to differentiate the two. Myth

  Book Title: Cannibal Talk-The Man-Eating Myth and Human Sacrifice in the South Seas<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Obeyesekere Gananath<br>
  Abstract: In this radical reexamination of the notion of cannibalism, Gananath Obeyesekere offers a fascinating and convincing argument that cannibalism is mostly "cannibal talk," a discourse on the Other engaged in by both indigenous peoples and colonial intruders that results in sometimes funny and sometimes deadly cultural misunderstandings. Turning his keen intelligence to Polynesian societies in the early periods of European contact and colonization, Obeyesekere deconstructs Western eyewitness accounts, carefully examining their origins and treating them as a species of fiction writing and seamen's yarns. Cannibalism is less a social or cultural fact than a mythic representation of European writing that reflects much more the realities of European societies and their fascination with the practice of cannibalism, he argues. And while very limited forms of cannibalism might have occurred in Polynesian societies, they were largely in connection with human sacrifice and carried out by a select community in well-defined sacramental rituals.
      Cannibal Talkconsiders how the colonial intrusion produced a complex self-fulfilling prophecy whereby the fantasy of cannibalism became a reality as natives on occasion began to eat both Europeans and their own enemies in acts of "conspicuous anthropophagy."<br>

  Abstract: The change in Maori practice is probably the most controversial part of my argument. I present my thesis hesitantly because no one seems to have a clear knowledge of precontact or “traditional” Maori anthropophagy. In fact this phrasing might be a misnomer because New Zealand consisted of a multiplicity of Maori communities, such that, forms of anthropophagy, wherever they existed, would have shown local variations. Conventional ethnography simply constructs an ideal type of Maori cannibalism from a variety of statements—interviews with older men, myths, missionary and magistrate accounts, and even that of eyewitnesses.

  Abstract: Though the history of Neoplatonism starts, properly speaking, with Plotinus (205–70),¹ what we have called the Neoplatonic reading of Homer had its sources in habits of thought developed long before the third century and found full expression not in Plotinus himself but in Porphyry and then in the later Neoplatonists. Plotinus never mentions the name of Homer² and is very little concerned with interpretation of texts and myths from the poets. In the relatively sparse echoes of Homer and other poetry in the

  Book Title: The Fate of Place-A Philosophical History<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Casey Edward S.<br>
  Abstract: In this imaginative and comprehensive study, Edward Casey, one of the most incisive interpreters of the Continental philosophical tradition, offers a philosophical history of the evolving conceptualizations of place and space in Western thought. Not merely a presentation of the ideas of other philosophers,
      The Fate of Placeis acutely sensitive to silences, absences, and missed opportunities in the complex history of philosophical approaches to space and place. A central theme is the increasing neglect of place in favor of space from the seventh century A.D. onward, amounting to the virtual exclusion of place by the end of the eighteenth century. Casey begins with mythological and religious creation stories and the theories of Plato and Aristotle and then explores the heritage of Neoplatonic, medieval, and Renaissance speculations about space. He presents an impressive history of the birth of modern spatial conceptions in the writings of Newton, Descartes, Leibniz, and Kant and delineates the evolution of twentieth-century phenomenological approaches in the work of Husserl, Merleau-Ponty, Bachelard, and Heidegger. In the book's final section, Casey explores the postmodern theories of Foucault, Derrida, Tschumi, Deleuze and Guattari, and Irigaray.<br>

  Book Title: The Mission of Demythologizing-Rudolf Bultmann's Dialectical Theology<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Congdon David W.<br>
  Abstract: Since 1941, Rudolf Bultmann’s program of demythologizing has been the subject of constant debate, widely held to indicate Bultmann’s departure from the dialectical theology he once shared with Karl Barth. In the 1950s, Barth referred to their relationship as that of a whale and an elephant: incapable of meaningful communication. This study proposes a contrary reading of demythologizing as the hermeneutical fulfillment of dialectical theology on the basis of a reinterpretation of Barth’s theological project. As such, the volume argues that dialectical theology is fundamentally governed by a missionary logic. Bultmann’s hermeneutical theology extends this dialectical, missionary theology into the field of interpretation. Contrary to many critics, the message of God’s saving work in Christ, and not modern science, funds Bultmann’s hermeneutical program. Like Barth’s own revolution, Bultmann’s program addresses a false relation between gospel and culture. Negatively, demythologizing is a program of deconstantinizing, opposing the objectifying conflation of kerygma and culture that he calls “myth.” Positively, demythologizing is a form of intercultural hermeneutics, composed of preunderstanding and self-understanding. Demythologizing is therefore a missionary hermeneutic of intercultural translation.<br>

  Abstract: Scholars have spilled a lot of ink criticizing Bultmann’s program of demythologizing on the grounds that it ignores the truths that myths, particularly those associated with Christian faith, are uniquely able to communicate. The truth of myth is played off against demythologizing as if the latter rejects myth
                  simpliciter. One often hears that demythologizing is merely the extrication of the kerygma from the shackles of myth on the assumption that Bultmann views everything associated with the label of myth as primitive falsehood. Many suppose that demythologizing carries out its hermeneutical procedure by shucking the husk of what is ancient or<br>

  8  Eschatological Existence and Existentialist Translation from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt12878n5">The Mission of Demythologizing</a><br>
  Abstract: We noted in the previous chapter Bultmann’s claim that radical demythologizing is “the consistent application [of the doctrine of justification by faith alone] to the field of knowledge.”² This application has both a negative and a positive dimension. Negatively it is criticism of objectifying thinking within the
                     Weltbildof mythology, which I suggest we can restate ascriticism of constantinianism. Demythologizing is a critical epistemology in the sense that it subverts every attempt to interpret the kerygma in the form of aWeltanschauung. It is thus an antimythological and antimetaphysical—i.e., deconstantinizing—hermeneutic.<br>

  Abstract: Martin Heidegger expressed his hope to Bultmann in 1964 that “your whole work might not remain entirely obscured by the label ‘demythologizing.’”² In one sense it is deeply unfortunate that Heidegger’s wish was unfulfilled. Bultmann’s name is forever associated with that controversial label, to such an extent that many are unable to read him without assuming that every writing of his is a threat to the church and harmful to the faith. In another and more important sense, however, we can be
                  gratefulthat Heidegger’s wish was unfulfilled, for demythologizing remains Bultmann’s greatest gift to the church. In the words<br>

  Abstract: The terms

In biblical studies, serious interest in myth typically falls under the domain of the secular academy, whereas serious interest in “Scripture” has typically been the concern for communities of faith and the academic institutions they support. This has been most clearly articulated in Robert Oden’sThe Bible without Theology, subtitledThe Theological Tradition and Alternatives to It, in which Oden eschews questions of theology in his treatment of myth, in support of what he refers to as “the process by which biblical study is moving<br>

  Abstract: However one chooses to define myth—and as this volume demonstrates, there exists more than one viable option—it is an intrinsically comparative concept, designating as it does a broad class of cross-cultural phenomena. Consider, for example, Georges Dumézil, that great Indo-European mythologist, who made of comparison a type of fundamental intellectual principle: “On ne définit très bien les choses que par comparaison avec autre chose.”¹ To employ the concept of myth in biblical studies, then, is to situate some aspect of biblical literature in relation to “the mythical.” These comparisons may be conceptualized concretely in terms of more or<br>

For centuries, the Bible was considered the word of God, but texts emerging from excavations in Mesopotamia challenged the idea of the Bible as unique.

The scandalous manner in which various myths portrayed the gods was doubtless one of the factors that made them popular in many social circles, but these same immoral depictions raised a number of serious intellectual and ethical questions that were debated at length throughout antiquity. The fundamental question was whether these common depictions of the gods were true. If so, the gods were often exemplars of vice rather than of virtue, and human morality was<br>

  Author(s) Miller David L.<br>
  Abstract: Professor Segal’s paper, “The Life of King Saul as Myth,” was originally embedded in a longer presentation entitled “The Indispensability of Theories of Myth for Biblical Studies.” It was given to a joint session of the American Academy of Religion and the Society of Biblical Literature at their annual meetings in 2009. Professor Segal had attempted to demonstrate his thesis about the indispensability of theories of myth for biblical studies by giving a reading of the Saul narratives in the Hebrew Bible, which was informed by the hero theories of myth in the work of Otto Rank, Lord Raglan, Joseph<br>

  “Myth” in the Old Testament from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1287n15">Myth and Scripture</a><br>
  Author(s) Rogerson J. W.<br>
  Abstract: For the sake of clarity, I begin with an attempt to define the main terms that I shall use in this lecture. I wish to distinguish between the terms
                  myths, mythological elements, andmyth. The easiest term to define ismyths. Myths are literary phenomena. They can be transmitted either orally or in writing, and can be recognized as myths on account of their content. They are often stories about gods or narratives about the origin of the world and the human race, or attempts to explain the fate of humanity, attempts that are placed in the context either of<br>

  Myth and Scripture: from:

  Author(s) Callender Dexter E.<br>
  Abstract: The terms
                  mythandScripturehave often been galvanizing terms when applied to the Bible. In biblical studies, serious interest in myth typically falls under the domain of the secular academy, whereas serious interest in “Scripture” has typically been the concern for communities of faith and the academic institutions they support. This has been most clearly articulated in Robert Oden’sThe Bible without Theology, subtitledThe Theological Tradition and Alternatives to It, in which Oden eschews questions of theology in his treatment of myth, in support of what he refers to as “the process by which biblical study is moving<br>

  Author(s) Kawashima Robert S.<br>
  Abstract: However one chooses to define myth—and as this volume demonstrates, there exists more than one viable option—it is an intrinsically comparative concept, designating as it does a broad class of cross-cultural phenomena. Consider, for example, Georges Dumézil, that great Indo-European mythologist, who made of comparison a type of fundamental intellectual principle: “On ne définit très bien les choses que par comparaison avec autre chose.”¹ To employ the concept of myth in biblical studies, then, is to situate some aspect of biblical literature in relation to “the mythical.” These comparisons may be conceptualized concretely in terms of more or<br>

  Is Genesis 1 a Creation Myth? from:

  Author(s) Smith Mark S.<br>
  Abstract: Is Gen 1 a myth? The answer to this question depends on what one thinks a myth is and also on what one think about Gen 1. For believers in the Bible, the answer is, of course not. For many readers of the Bible, the idea of biblical stories as myths became a critical issue because of the discovery of tablets with stories from ancient Mesopotamia. For centuries, the Bible was considered the word of God, but texts emerging from excavations in Mesopotamia challenged the idea of the Bible as unique. When the Bible was studied in the context of<br>

  Author(s) Page Hugh R.<br>
  Abstract: In this paper I will assess the strengths, weaknesses, and implications of the use of early Hebrew poems as a control group for the testing of single theories and methodological paradigms aimed at the reconstruction of myth, folklore, and social reality in ancient Israel. Here I build on the work done within the Albright-Cross-Freedman tradition on Gen 49; Exod 15; Num 23–24; Deut 32, 33; Judg 5; 1 Sam 2; 2 Sam 1, 22, 23; and Pss 18, 29, 68, 72, and 78 (see, e.g., Cross and Freedman 1952, 1997; Geller 1979; Cross 1973; Freedman 1980).

  Author(s) Miller James E.<br>
  Abstract: Mythis a term and concept that has been used and analyzed in a variety of biblical studies for more than a century. However, the term is often poorly defined, and often this is because it is poorly understood.

  Author(s) Fitzgerald John T.<br>
  Abstract: One of the most notorious aspects of ancient Greek myth was its frequent depiction of the gods as engaging in conduct that is morally problematic. The scandalous manner in which various myths portrayed the gods was doubtless one of the factors that made them popular in many social circles, but these same immoral depictions raised a number of serious intellectual and ethical questions that were debated at length throughout antiquity. The fundamental question was whether these common depictions of the gods were true. If so, the gods were often exemplars of vice rather than of virtue, and human morality was<br>

  The Life of King Saul as Myth from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1287n15">Myth and Scripture</a><br>
  Author(s) Segal Robert A.<br>
  Abstract: The study of hero myths goes back at least to 1871, when the Victorian anthropologist E. B. Tylor argued that many of them follow a uniform plot: the hero is exposed at birth, is saved by other humans or animals, and grows up to become a national hero (see Tylor 1871, 1:254–55).¹ In 1876 the Austrian scholar Johann Georg von Hahn used fourteen cases to argue that all “Aryan” hero tales follow an “exposure and return” formula more comprehensive than Tylor’s (see von Hahn 1876, 340). In each case the hero is born illegitimately, out of the fear of<br>

  Author(s) Strenski Ivan<br>
  Abstract: Fans of Robert Segal will find him in classic form here, working the permutations and combinations of both mythical narratives and theorists that he has applied to them. Novel here is Segal’s claim that the biblical narrative accounts of the life of King Saul conform to mythical patterns. Closely examined, that is, they show themselves exemplifying classic mythical themes such as the son’s desire to kill the father. As interpreted by two major classical theorists, psychoanalyst Otto Rank, and myth-ritualist Lord Raglan, Segal works over the biblical text to show how the perspectives of both Rank and Raglan can be<br>

Tylor argued that many of them follow a uniform plot: the hero is exposed at birth, is saved by other humans or animals, and grows up to become a national hero (see Tylor 1871, 1:254–55).¹ In 1876 the Austrian scholar Johann Georg von Hahn used fourteen cases to argue that all “Aryan” hero tales follow an “exposure and return” formula more comprehensive than Tylor’s (see von Hahn 1876, 340). In each case the hero is born illegitimately, out of the fear of<br>

  Author(s) Strenski Ivan<br>
  Abstract: Fans of Robert Segal will find him in classic form here, working the permutations and combinations of both mythical narratives and theorists that he has applied to them. Novel here is Segal’s claim that the biblical narrative accounts of the life of King Saul conform to mythical patterns. Closely examined, that is, they show themselves exemplifying classic mythical themes such as the son’s desire to kill the father. As interpreted by two major classical theorists, psychoanalyst Otto Rank, and myth-ritualist Lord Raglan, Segal works over the biblical text to show how the perspectives of both Rank and Raglan can be<br>

  Author(s) Miller David L.<br>
  Abstract: Professor Segal’s paper, “The Life of King Saul as Myth,” was originally embedded in a longer presentation entitled “The Indispensability of Theories of Myth for Biblical Studies.” It was given to a joint session of the American Academy of Religion and the Society of Biblical Literature at their annual meetings in 2009. Professor Segal had attempted to demonstrate his thesis about the indispensability of theories of myth for biblical studies by giving a reading of the Saul narratives in the Hebrew Bible, which was informed by the hero theories of myth in the work of Otto Rank, Lord Raglan, Joseph<br>

  Abstract: Holocaust survivors in postwar American fiction are displaced persons estranged from all national narratives. Like the protagonist in Saul Bellow’s
                  Mr. Sammler’s Planet,they meditate on the relationship between the Earth, the Moon, and Planet Auschwitz. And if Auschwitz, as Theodor Adorno suggests, is the central event of our age, this primal catastrophe, which ushers in the postwar era, separates and estranges the survivors of the Holocaust from the myths of the American nation. The uprooted souls depicted in the fiction of Bellow, Singer, Styron, Malamud and other contemporary American writers are haunted by the Holocaust, unable to embrace the<br>

  Abstract: On January 30, 1972, British paratroopers killed thirteen Catholic demonstrators in Derry. They had been protesting the institution of forced internment without trial in Northern Ireland for Republicans suspected of IRA affiliation, as well as practices of torture committed on internees by the British authorities. The Bloody Sunday Massacre only swelled Catholic grassroots support for those who would kill for what Heaney called the Nationalist myth, the idea of an integral Ireland variously personified as Kathleen Ni Houlihan and the Shan Van Vocht: the Old Mother, the native feminine spirit of the land.

His bookThe Child and the Serpent, for example, looks for symbols of unconscious structures (the serpent) and their birth into consciousness (the child).

  Abstract: Hospitality has become the gateway to hell. I am aware that this might sound hyperbolic—I do, however, mean it seriously. One could picture Cerberus, in the antique representations of hell, guarding the entry to the netherworld, or Horus, in Egyptian mythology, weighing the good and bad actions as they are presented to him by those newly arrived, as figures of radical hospitality, since they are the ones that separate the living from the dead. In the face of today’s political rules, hospitality is not an invitation for a better life—at most, it offers a shelter—but a fully<br>

In the text, which he later included in his book on Marcel Duchamp, Lyotard recounts his interpretation of the Greek myth: Zeus had commanded the creation of the first woman, Pandora, because he was angry that fire had been stolen from heaven; Prometheus had stolen it to give to man, who made much purposeful use of it.

As he demonstrated, the issue confronts us as soon as the opening pages of Genesis.¹ Do we read this as history (cum science) or as myth, as something that happened at a certain time—history, or as (citing the description of myth offered by the Roman historian Sallust) “something that happens over and over again”?<br>

  Abstract: 1. The seemingly pedantic title

Twentieth-century plays are not the first to conform to this principle of repetition, nor are all those “modern” dramas which have adapted ancient legends.

  Book Title: Gender and Nation in Meiji Japan-Modernity, Loss, and the Doing of History<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Karlin Jason G.<br>
  Abstract: Gender and Nation in Meiji Japan is a historical analysis of the discourses of nostalgia in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Japan. Through an analysis of the experience of rapid social change in Japan’s modernization, it argues that fads (ryūkō) and the desires they express are central to understanding Japanese modernity, conceptions of gender, and discourses of nationalism. In doing so, the author uncovers the myth of eternal return that lurks below the surface of Japanese history as an expression of the desire to find meaning amid the chaos and alienation of modern times. The Meiji period (1868–1912) was one of rapid change that hastened the process of forgetting: The state’s aggressive program of modernization required the repression of history and memory. However, repression merely produced new forms of desire seeking a return to the past, with the result that competing or alternative conceptions of the nation haunted the history of modern Japan. Rooted in the belief that the nation was a natural and organic entity that predated the rational, modern state, such conceptions often were responses to modernity that envisioned the nation in opposition to the modern state. What these visions of the nation shared was the ironic desire to overcome the modern condition by seeking the timeless past. While the condition of their repression was often linked to the modernizing policies of the Meiji state, the means for imagining the nation in opposition to the state required the construction of new symbols that claimed the authority of history and appealed to a rearticulated tradition. Through the idiom of gender and nation, new reified representations of continuity, timelessness, and history were fashioned to compensate for the unmooring of inherited practices from the shared locales of everyday life. This book examines the intellectual, social, and cultural factors that contributed to the rapid spread of Western tastes and styles, along with the backlash against Westernization that was expressed as a longing for the past. By focusing on the expressions of these desires in popular culture and media texts, it reveals how the conflation of mother, countryside, everyday life, and history structured representations to naturalize ideologies of gender and nationalism.<br>

  CONCLUSION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x1k9w">Gender and Nation in Meiji Japan</a><br>
  Abstract: I began this book by considering how the Meiji Restoration had nurtured the sentiment that the revolution was incomplete. The calls to action that adhered around the notion of the “incomplete Restoration” in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries were (re)productive of the myth of the Meiji Restoration. For both the state and its critics, revolutionary action was legitimized by invoking the Restoration: the state pursued the modernization of all aspects of social life, denouncing customs and practices incompatible with its ideology of progress as backward and barbarous, while its opponents condemned the state for its decadence and superficiality arising from<br>

  Book Title: Italian Irish Filmmakers-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): Lourdeaux Lee<br>
  Abstract: "This penetrating study examines how these filmmakers confronted their cultural heritage and used it as a counterpoint to their depiction of mainstream America." --American Cinematographer In this unique film history, Lee Lourdeaux traces the impact of Irish and Italian cultures on four major American directors and their work. Defining the core values and tensions within each culture, and especially focusing on the influence of American Catholicism, he presents John Ford, Frank Capra, Francis Coppola, and Martin Scorsese as ethnic Americans and film artists. Lourdeaux shows each filmmaker on set with writers and actors, learning to bypass stereotypes in order to develop a shrewd reciprocal assimilation between his ethnic background and Anglo America. Beginning with D. W. Griffith's depiction of Irish and Italian immigrants, the author discusses Hollywood's stereotypical portrayals of ethnic priests, cops, politicians, and gangsters, as well as their surface acculturation in the movies of the 1920s. By the decade's end, John Ford was using all-American stories to embody the basic myths and tensions of Irish-American life. In his later westerns and foreign films, he tried to understand both Irish political strife and the key figures of Irish liturgy. Frank Capra pitted Italian family values against the Anglo success ethic, turning out social comedies about oppressed little people. Several decades later, Martin Scorsese and Francis Coppola were highly critical of their religio-ethnic heritage, though they gradually discovered that to outline its weaknesses, like the blind pursuit of success, was to fashion a critical mirror of mainstream America. Lourdeaux discusses a number of recent films by Coppola and by Scorsese that have not yet been analyzed in any book. And, in the chapter on Scorsese, a personal interview with the director reveals how his ethnic childhood shaped his work in film. Examining the conflicts within American culture, Lourdeaux shows how the filmmakers themselves had to confront the self-destructive aspects of their ethnic background, not only to accommodate WASP audiences but to better understand their own heritage. He also observes that ethnicity is a strong draw at the box office, as in The Godfather, because it creates a sense of the Other who can both be admired and at the same time ridiculed. Illustrated with scenes of the movies discussed, this fascinating film history tells how four of America's most famous filmmakers assimilated their ethnic backgrounds on set and on screen. "Mr. Lourdeaux walks a tricky path in analyzing the films of each [director]: avoiding the trap of excessively detailing their lives and many films, while steering clear of ethnic stereotyping. Those interested in ethnic influences on outstanding persons or in the production of films by four of the best will find the book enjoyable." --The Baltimore Sun "This is an invaluable book because it arouses critical awareness of the ethnicity underlying many Hollywood movies that might otherwise appear merely to represent American archetypes." --Journal of American Studies "A valuable addition to the literature on ethnic identity in film. The insights Lourdeaux offers into major figures like Griffith, Ford, Capra, Coppola, and Scorsese contribute significantly to our understanding of their films." --Virginia Wright Wexman, University of Illinois at Chicago "For a number of years now, church historians have been giving us an account of American Catholicism that is much richer and more varied than the older institutional accounts of the Catholic Church ever let on. In this comprehensive and insightful study, Lee Lourdeaux shows us how much the ethnic movies of directors like Ford and Capra, Coppola and Scorsese have to teach us as well about Irish- and Italian-Catholic mores and instincts." --John B. Breslin, S.J., Director "A wonderfully sensitive, intelligent study of the complex issue of how the Catholic imagination works in the creative personalities of those raised in the Catholic heritage." --Andrew M. Greeley<br>

  Abstract: By exploring the question of what republicanism meant to the rebels of 1916, before the Rising became burdened by the weight of its own myth, this chapter seeks to identify some connections between the history of an event and its commemoration. It emphasises how unpredictable the Rising’s success in creating popular support for republicanism was, and argues that this contingent outcome was largely a product of its wartime context. Although the Rising is now synonymous with republicanism, its ideological significance was less apparent at the time: many rebels fought for Irish freedom rather than a republic.

  Abstract: This volume has traced the development of the Traveller image as ‘Other’ through mythical and binary discourses of alterity. Until the recent arrival of a more overtly multicultural society in Ireland Travellers have constituted the ‘Other’ for mainstream Irish society. As ‘Other’ they have often acted as objects on whom power is exercised. Their representation and the roles constructed for them have been determined primarily by the settled community and have been influenced by the need to define national, social and class identity. This project of representation has used the tools of mythology and history. These two related aspects of<br>

In this environment Gnosticism flourished, and Origen was the first not only to refute Gnosticism, but also to offer an alternative Christian system that was more rigorous and philosophically respectable than the mythological speculations of the various Gnostic sects.

Legend is a neutral and useful term because it allows for the association of both history and reality. Its description will usually reflect belief about what may be historical although unverifiable. In that sense, the traditions about certain biblical figures have often been regarded as historically reliable; they have also often been regarded as unverifiable.

Perhaps not. By offering a distinctive and in many ways innovative reading of this teaching of the Apostles’ Creed, Balthasar sought to challenge an age of overly reductive scientistic rationality, underscoring in Catholic theology the permanently valid interplay of literary symbolism, metaphysics, dramatic beauty, and Trinitarian mystery.

  Book Title: Reconfiguring Myth and Narrative in Contemporary Opera-Osvaldo Golijov, Kaija Saariaho, John Adams, and Tan Dun<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Dun Tan<br>
  Abstract: Yayoi Uno Everett focuses on four operas that helped shape the careers of the composers Osvaldo Golijov, Kaija Saariaho, John Adams, and Tan Dun, which represent a unique encounter of music and production through what Everett calls "multimodal narrative." Aspects of production design, the mechanics of stagecraft, and their interaction with music and sung texts contribute significantly to the semiotics of operatic storytelling. Everett's study draws on Northrop Frye's theories of myth, Lacanian psychoanalysis via Slavoj Žižek, Linda and Michael Hutcheon's notion of production, and musical semiotics found in Robert Hatten's concept of troping in order to provide original interpretive models for conceptualizing new operatic narratives.<br>

Often riots have drawn the attention of historians to an aspect of Welsh society that would otherwise have been hidden under the layers of the myth of tolerance. Secondly, major social conflicts frequently generate a large amount of comment and this enables a reconstruction of attitudes and structures of relationships to be undertaken for the past.

It developed as an academic discipline during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, but it has important forerunners in earlier historiography, geography, travel writing, philosophy, comparative linguistics and jurisprudence. There are many ways of writing the history of anthropology, just as there may exist, in any given society, competing versions of national history or origin myths, promoted by groups or individuals with diverging interests.

  Author(s): Liep John<br>
  Abstract: The contributors to this volume reexamine the interconnectedness of culture and creativity in an increasingly hybrid world. They argue that while many of the old certainties about high culture and artistic canons may now be disintegrating, culture and creativity themselves are still very much a reflection of social processes involving power and the control of resources. Case studies include youth subcultures in Europe; experimental theatre derived from the Brazilian candomblé dance; the role of memory in mythology among the Pukapukan of Polynesia; the evolution of football and polo in Argentina; gender relations in Algerian raï music; the notion of authenticity in artistic movements in Zanzibar; traditional and modern practices of the Lio in Indonesia; and kula exchange and social movements in the Trobriand Islands in the Pacific.<br>

  5  The Paradoxical Pathways of the First Kanak Woman Writer: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt18kr78q">The Literatures of the French Pacific</a><br>
  Abstract: The two previous chapters have tracked the differences in the shared rewriting of history and of the importance of home in contemporary New Caledonian literatures, in settler literatures (to be considered more fully in later chapters), but most particularly in the three major Kanak versions of the story of the first ancestor, Kanaké/Kënâké. Very different perspectives – political, feminist, and mythico-poetical – are at work within the third spaces constructed by these Kanak rewritings of origin. Each writer, I argued, attempts to connect to a lost or buried Kanak cultural core through his/her exploration and reconstruction of history in necessary<br>

  Abstract: ‘The truth about stories,’ writes Native American author Thomas King, ‘is that’s all we are’ (2003: 2). From family stories, origin myths, fantastic fables or historical tales; the human being is a ‘story-telling animal … a teller of stories that aspire to truth’ (MacIntyre, 1981: 201). It is in narrative form that we store and retrieve our memories and transmit our histories, cultures and identities. As individuals, we live by storying; repeatedly telling ourselves and others who we are, what we do and where we belong. We think in story form, we remember in story, we imagine the past and<br>

  Abstract: In a cyber world rapidly globalizing economically and therefore also radically shifting socially, culturally, and politically, one clear reaction has been for some to recast themselves in a mythical past set in stone. Whether withdrawing into isolated enclaves or confronting the outside world violently, signs of cultural and religious fundamentalism can be seen everywhere. For as Paul Tournier (1968) pointed out long ago, however disrupting social change, everybody needs a sense of place, an awareness of belonging to a location, a culture, a community.<br>

  Abstract: In religion, myth, legend, and above all in the arts there is an imaginary space populated with messengers: It is the world of angels, of placeless mediators between heaven and earth. The study of angels (‘angelology’¹) is an epiphenomenon of monotheism: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam have added a more or less extensive army of angels to the statuary isolation of their God; the constitutional invisibility, unrepresentability, and remoteness of God is therefore supplemented with the offer of something holy that is visible, representable, and close, which takes on an allegorical form in angels. Angels are not simply there, but rather<br>

  Book Title: Nowhere in the Middle Ages-  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): LOCHRIE KARMA<br>
  Abstract: Literary and cultural historians typically cite Thomas More's 1516
         Utopiaas the source of both a genre and a concept. Karma Lochrie rejects this origin myth of utopianism along with the assumption that people in the Middle Ages were incapable of such thinking. InNowhere in the Middle Ages, Lochrie reframes the terms of the discussion by revealing how utopian thought was, in fact, "somewhere" in the Middle Ages. In the process, she transforms conventional readings of More'sUtopiaand challenges the very practice of literary history today.<br>

  Author(s) Henry Barbara<br>
  Abstract: In recent debates, notions of identity are predominantly seen as coined within the framework of modernity and subsequently criticised by postmodern thought. This chapter will explore the relation of these two modes of thinking with regard to the term identity. Attention will be focused on the controversial question of the relation of myth to the identities of the West (e.g. individual, group and national identity), and the objective will be to explore how this relation can become a philosophical testing ground for a notion of political identity that is far removed from any hegemonic claims over the various

  Author(s) Feldman Allen<br>
  Abstract: At no other time more than in the present day has individual, social and institutional memory come under such concerted pressure, critique and exposure as a fragile foundation for truth and facticity. This current reluctance to authenticate social memory is intimately tied to well-known postmodernist depredations, which profoundly disenchanted the authority of tradition and authenticity, and emptied core institutionalised myths of their temporal and semantic continuity. As institutionalised memory fails to provide overarching master narratives that can win cultural consent, it has also become increasingly disjunctive with previously unnarratable history and experience.

  Author(s) KING JOYCE E.<br>
  Abstract: “Dysconscious racism” is a form of racism that tacitly accepts dominant white norms and privileges. It is not the
                  absenceof consciousness but animpairedconsciousness or distorted way of thinking about race as compared to, for example, critical consciousness. Uncritical ways of thinking about racial inequity accept certain culturally sanctioned assumptions, myths, and beliefs that justify the social and economic advantages white people have as a result of subordinating others. Anything that calls this ideology of racial privilege into question inevitably challenges the self-identity of white people who have internalized these ideological justifications.

                  Dis-enclosure: The Deconstruction of Christianity, though revealing one of its essential structures, is that a deconstruction of Christianity should be understood as a form of demythologization. Or, as Nancy has it, Christianity “understands itself in a way that is less and less religious in the sense in which religion implies a mythology (a narrative, a representation of divine actions and persons)” (D37/57). The seemingly strange statement that the Christian religion increasingly understands itself “in a way that is less and less religious,” is a reformulation of Nancy’s central thesis that Christianity is a<br>

  Literary Creation, Creation ex Nihilo from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c5cjjf">Re-treating Religion: Deconstructing Christianity with Jean-Luc Nancy</a><br>
  Author(s) McKeane John<br>
  Abstract: In
                  Dis-enclosure, Jean-Luc Nancy suggests that in Western culture “God’s act of creation” has provided “the least bad analogical recourse” for designating the “void-artist-body [corps-vide-artiste]” (D69/99; first trans. modified). Working backward, from this we can posit, still speaking analogically, that God’s act of creation generated the myth or concept of creation that is involved in the process and results of literary writing. Such a myth of creation should be understood in at least two senses: first, myth as an originary tale (récit) of foundation that has come down to us via the Judeo-Christian tradition (Genesis), and second, myth in<br>

  Book Title: Writings on Medicine-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Meyers Todd<br>
  Abstract: At the time of his death in 1995, Georges Canguilhem was a highly respected historian of science and medicine, whose engagement with questions of normality, the ideologization of scientific thought, and the conceptual history of biology had marked the thought of philosophers such as Michel Foucault, Louis Althusser, Pierre Bourdieu, and Gilles Deleuze. This collection of short, incisive, and highly accessible essays on the major concepts of modern medicine shows Canguilhem at the peak of his use of historical practice for philosophical engagement. In order to elaborate a philosophy of medicine, Canguilhem examines paramount problems such as the definition and uses of health, the decline of the Hippocratic understanding of nature, the experience of disease, the limits of psychology in medicine, myths and realities of therapeutic practices, the difference between cure and healing, the organism's self-regulation, and medical metaphors linking the organism to society. Writings on Medicine is at once an excellent introduction to Canguilhem's work and a forceful, insightful, and accessible engagement with elemental concepts in medicine. The book is certain to leave its imprint on anthropology, history, philosophy, bioethics, and the social studies of medicine.<br>

  CHAPTER 7  The Afterlife of Judaism: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c999h9">Provocations to Reading: J. Hillis Miller and the Democracy to Come</a><br>
  Author(s) Sussman Henry<br>
  Abstract: Judaism, so the common myth runs, is the Abrahamic¹ religion devoid of an afterlife. Where first Christianity and then Islam are quite explicit regarding the determination of the life hereafter by the quality of the life lived in this world, picturesque almost to the degree of luridness in representing the conditions, qualities, and experience of Heaven and Hell (and Purgatory, where applicable), Judaism hedges its bets and is far more reticent in the sphere of eschatology.² The liturgy of the Days of Awe, the New Year’s festivals that stage the collective public acknowledgment of mortal human vices, breeches in morality,<br>

  Abstract: Unlike many of the other contributors to this volume, I regret to say that I never had the occasion to study under Hillis Miller in graduate school. And until October of 2002 , I had never enjoyed the benefits of J. Hillis Miller’s prodigious gift for collegiality.¹ When I undertook a course of graduate study in the field of American literature nearly three decades ago at the University of Chicago, I did so under the tutelage of James Edwin Miller, Jr., in the methodology of the myth-symbol school of literary interpretation whose dominance of the field of American literary studies<br>

But at a pragmatic level, the presence of woodland and its

  two  Satan’s Biography: from:

  Abstract: There is no one “biography” of Satan. There is no authoritative body of text we can refer to when we speak of Satan, rather Satan appears like a shape-shifter, and every story gives him another face and body, deploying the old stereotypes, but adding new elements at the same time, creating a curious mixture of familiarity and strangeness. The story that is retold here is the story of the Satan who grew out of various Jewish and Christian traditions, a Satan whose origins were inspired by the ancient near Eastern combat myths.¹ The most recent biography of Satan was published<br>

  three  Satan in Story and Myth from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cg4ks4">Facing the Fiend</a><br>
  Abstract: Satan is part of the myth of evil and if we assume that the story is one way to approach the reality of evil, we need to examine the myth in more detail. From a secular viewpoint, any metaphysical approach to the question of evil does not work. The responsibilities for all human actions lay, since Kant, in the agent’s will and accordingly, so does the decision to commit an evil deed. Nevertheless, despite all efforts to explain human behavior with psychology, sociology, biology, and psychoanalysis, there seems to be an explanatory gap when it comes to actions that hurt<br>

  Abstract: Blood Meridian or The Evening Redness in the Westwas published in 1985 and is today considered Cormac McCarthy’s masterpiece. After publication, the novel received only lukewarm critical reception, but is now generally regarded as part of the American canon of literature, and is compared to Hermann Melville’s great American mythMoby Dick. The narrative’s protagonist is a nameless youth, referred to as Kid, who leaves home at fourteen and joins a gang of scalp hunters under the leadership of Captain John Joel Glanton. The gang is paid by Mexican governors to kill Indians, in particular Comanche warriors who regularly<br>

  Book Title: The Joshua Delusion?-Rethinking Genocide in the Bible<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Moberly R.W.L.<br>
  Abstract: Many Christians wrestle with biblical passages in which God commands the slaughter of the Canaanites - men, women, and children. The issue of the morality of the biblical God is one of the major challenges for faith today. How can such texts be Holy Scripture? In this bold and innovative book, Douglas Earl grasps the bull by the horns and guides readers to new and unexpected ways of looking at the book of Joshua. Drawing on insights from the early church and from modern scholarship, Earl argues that we have mistakenly read Joshua as a straightforward historical account and have ended up with a genocidal God. In contrast, Earl offers a theological interpretation in which the mass killing of Canaanites is a deliberate use of myth to make important theological points that are still valid today. Christopher J. H. Wright then offers a thoughtful response to Earl's provocative views. The book closes with Earl's reply to Wright and readers are encouraged to continue the debate.<br>

  Abstract: From the time of the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, people of British origin have shared the area of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island, traditionally called Acadia, with Eastern Canada's Algonkian-speaking peoples, the Mi'kmaq. This historical analysis of colonial Acadia from the perspective of symbolic and mythic existence will be useful to those interested in Canadian history, native Canadian history, religion in Canada, and history of religion.<br>

  Abstract: Within both British and Mi’kmaq communities, the need for a sense of rootedness and continuity of place fuelled religious imaginations, giving rise to religious symbols that confronted the necessities of place while accounting for particular experiences. The lives that revolved around these were encrusted with myths that articulated specific instances of the unity provided by the symbols. In this sense, the religious imagination of all Acadia’s people struggled with the problem of identity and origins in a new world. Yet the problem was resolved in a critically divergent manner by each community so that, overwhelmingly, two distinct visions of human<br>

  CHAPTER 4  The Myth of Natural Law from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cn6sv1">God and the Grounding of Morality</a><br>
  Abstract: Natural moral law conceptions, grounded as they traditionally have been on metaphysical or theological principles, are myth-eaten and they ought to be discarded; aseptic, demythologized conceptions of “natural law,” like those set forth by Professor Hart in his
                  The Concept of Law,are essentially sound and are fundamental in displaying the moral foundations of legal systems. Yet we must also come to understand that assent to the fundamental rules of human conduct that Hart notes is compatible with an acceptance of a thorough ethical relativism or conventionalism. I would like here to back up these controversial claims. In the first<br>

  Abstract: As to the possibility of discovering “what actually happened,” my doctorfather, J.

The vampire, with roots in medieval European folklore, and the zombie, with origins in Afro-Caribbean mythology, have both undergone significant transformations in global culture, proliferating as deviant representatives of the zeitgeist.<br>

                  wheresomething happened is an important part of knowingthatit happened. As texts, some named places are interconnected, while others are more independent (on related Pueblo geographic sensibilities, see, e.g., Harrington 1916; Ortiz 1969, 1972; Silko 1999). Some texts are sociological, others historical, some mythological, others political, economic, religious, or ecological (cf. Thornton 2008 on Tlingit place-names).

  Author(s) Jancewicz Bill<br>
  Abstract: While some theorists have suggested that translation is impossible (Payne 1971), to a large degree Western civilization and culture has depended upon translated documents originally written in one language into some other, usually more common, language. A large portion of our current understanding of philosophy, history, mythology, and religion comes to us through translated documents. What could we know of Aristotle, Plato, Moses, or Muhammad without contemporary translations of their writings into our mother tongue? From the philosophy of Immanuel Kant to the literature of Victor Hugo, the breadth of human knowledge is inextricably linked to the translation of documents<br>

  Book Title: The Rhizomatic West-Representing the American West in a Transnational, Global, Media Age<br>
  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): Tatum Stephen<br>
  Abstract: Using Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's concept of the rhizome, Neil Campbell shows how the West (or west-ness) continually breaks away from a mainstream notion of American "rootedness" and renews and transforms itself in various cultural forms. A region long traversed by various transient peoples (from tribes and conquerors to immigrants, traders, and trappers), the West reflects a mythic quest for settlement, permanence, and synthesis-even notions of a national or global identity-at odds with its rootless history, culture, and nature. Crossing the concept of "roots" with "routes," this book shows how notions of the West-in representations ranging from literature and film to photography, music, and architectural theory-give expression to ideas about identity, nationhood, and belonging in a world increasingly defined by movement across time and borders.
      The Rhizomatic Westoffers a new vision of the American West as a hybrid, performative space, a staging place for myriad intersecting and constantly changing identities.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1dgn4wh">The Rhizomatic West</a><br>
  Abstract: As I discussed in the previous chapter, Sergio Leone’s films were seen by some as the death knell of the Western and by others as its regenerative force, breathing new life into a tired, mythic formula and seeing the genre as the site for cultural critique and counterhegemonic practice. The established generic grid of the Western proved elastic and porous enough for new filmmakers looking to utilize its broad expectations and codes for different purposes, building on the promising works of directors such as Nicholas Ray, Sam Peckinpah, and Robert Altman. Often these innovations came from outside the Hollywood mainstream,<br>

  Abstract: Transatlantic Voicesis the first collection of critical essays by European scholars on contemporary Native North American literatures. Devoted to the primary genres of Native literature-fiction, nonfiction, drama, poetry-the essays chart the course of recent theories of Native literature, delineate the crosscurrents in the history of Native literature studies, and probe specific themes of trauma and memory as well as changing mythologies. These essays also incorporate incipient transnational and transcultural methodologies in their approach to Native North American writing.<br>

  Abstract: “When I was seeking some meaning in literature for myself,” Vizenor recalls, “some identity for myself as a writer, I found it easily in the mythic connections” (quoted in Owens,
                  Other Destinies239). His earlier autobiographical essays, collected inInterior Landscapes: Autobiographical Myths and Metaphors, equate fact with myth and myth with truth in accordance with the etymology ofmyth: “word, truth, speech” (Greekmuthos>*Indo-Europeanmudh, “to think, imagine”). In early Greek usage myth designates an oral pronouncement made to an audience, and Vizenor follows this mold as a maker of myth, neither in the Tolkien political or C.<br>

  “June Walked over It like Water and Came Home”: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1djmc5d">Transatlantic Voices</a><br>
  Author(s) SHACKLETON MARK<br>
  Abstract: The opening section of
                  Love Medicine(1984, rev. 1993) closes with the death of June Kashpaw, “a long-legged Chippewa woman,” on the eve of Easter Sunday: “The snow fell deeper that Easter than it had in forty years, but June walked over it like water and came home” (1, 7). Such overt Christian symbolism has prompted the Native American poet and critic Elizabeth Cook-Lynn (Crow Creek Sioux) to criticize Erdrich for her supposed adulteration of aboriginal writing and “the myths and metaphors of sovereign nationalism” with “Christian-oriented” prose (84, 85). The majority of critics, however, read Erdrich’s use of Christian<br>

L’identité serait ainsi sortie de ses frontières pour permettre à chacun de créer et multiplier à sa guise autant d’identités qu’il le souhaite.

Of course, not everyone speaks so contemptuously, adopting instead a more conciliatory tone (or is it condescending?). “We” now know that myths are childlike attempts on the part of primitive societies to explain the<br>

  Book Title: The Southern Hospitality Myth-Ethics, Politics, Race, and American Memory<br>
  Publisher: University of Georgia Press<br>
  Author(s): Richardson Riché<br>
  Abstract: Historians have offered a variety of explanations of the origins and cultural practices of hospitality in the antebellum South. Economic historians have at times portrayed southern hospitality as evidence of conspicuous consumption and competition among wealthy planters, while cultural historians have treated it peripherally as a symptomatic expression of the southern code of honor. Although historians have offered different theories, they generally agree that the mythic dimensions of southern hospitality eventually outstripped its actual practices. Szczesiul examines why we have chosen to remember and valorize this particular aspect of the South, and he raises fundamental ethical questions that underlie both the concept of hospitality and the cultural work of American memory, particularly in light of the region's historical legacy of slavery and segregation.<br>

  Abstract: As a break from their ordained labors, what might the Muses today do on their lunch hour? This collection of witty, shrewd, and imaginative essays addresses interdisciplinary topics that range widely from Shakespeare, to psychoanalysis, to the practice of higher education today. With the ease born of deep knowledge, Marjorie Garber moves from comical journalistic quirks (GÇ£Fig LeavesGÇ¥) to the curious return of myth and ritual in the theories of evolutionary psychologists (GÇ£Ovid, Now and ThenGÇ¥)._x000D_ Two themes emerge consistently in GarberGÇÖs latest exploration of symptoms of culture. The first is that to predict the GÇ£next big thingGÇ¥ in literary studies we should look back at ideas and practices set aside by a previous generation of critics. In the past several decades we have seen the reemergence ofGÇöfor exampleGÇötextual editing, biography, character criticism, aesthetics, and philology as GÇ£hotGÇ¥ new areas for critical intervention. The second theme expands on this observation, making the case for GÇ£cultural forgettingGÇ¥ as the way the arts and humanities renew themselves, both within fields and across them. Although she is never represented in traditional paintings or poetry, a missing MuseGÇöwe can call her AmnesiaGÇöturns out to be a key figure for the creation of theory and criticism in the arts.<br>

The Priestly material has been described in various ways; it has been described as “

This necessity is doubled when we recognize that the

  1  Disability Studies of Rhetoric from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1j2n73m">Disability Rhetoric</a><br>
  Abstract: I will begin by suggesting that, as historian Martha Rose writes, “ideas about disability in the ancient world are part of our [contemporary] common consciousness” (2003, 2). We have always had disability myths, and these myths have always been rhetorically significant and rhetorically contested. I would suggest that common contemporary ideas about disability are always prefaced by,<br>

  Abstract: As Rosemarie Garland-Thomson writes, “Seeing disability as a representational system engages several premises of current critical theory: that representation structures reality, that the margins constitute the center, that human identity is multiple and unstable, and that all analysis and evaluation has political implications” (1997b, 19). With this in mind, I will pause here to create a quick overview of some of the myths of disability that are ubiquitous across cultures and eras and that condition our understanding of disability (and thus of all identity and all bodies). This investigation of disability myths is an extension of my interrogation of the<br>

  Abstract: So far I have offered a brief guided tour through rhetorical history, a moving through and with the bodies of this history. I have suggested that we can read embodied rhetoric and bodied rhetorical history as powered by tension around normativity. I have also explored disability myths and disability rhetorics. My argument is that disability has myriad meanings, many of them positive and generative.
                  Mētis, I will show, is the craft of forging something practical out of these possibilities, practicing an embodied rhetoric, changing the world as we move through it. The key examplar ofmētisis the disabled Greek<br>

  Abstract: The celebration of Hephaestus, his craft, his cunning, his ability, as well as the deification of his disability are means of challenging held perceptions about the mythical character, but also about all of us—defined as we all are by concepts of ability, by rhetorics of normalcy. An epideictic and forensic exploration of his myths does not just martial praise or blame through his body or question the truth or falsity of rhetorical history; this rhetorical work should shift body values and roles, becoming a deliberation on embodied possibilities.<br>

  Abstract: THE DEGREE OF reverence accorded a subject in the nineteenth century was directly proportional to Mark Twain’s impulse to burlesque it. While many sober Christians would contend that Christ’s advent hardly seems the stuff of burlesque, popular reverent regard for Christianity’s foundational narrative demanded that Twain use the form as he had so many other genres of belief. The story of Christ’s humble nativity, teaching, crucifixion, and resurrection surpasses even the Adam and Eve mythos as a recognized and revered narrative structure. While Twain adopted and adapted the Adam and Eve story, notably in “The Tournament in 1870 A.D.” (1870),<br>

  FIVE  Rivalry with the Father: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1m3nxp7">Language and Desire in Seneca's "Phaedra"</a><br>
  Abstract: In Greek myth the youthful hero’s initiatory passage from adolescence to adulthood often has a double component: martial deeds (rivalry with or imitation of the father) and a sexual adventure, trial, or temptation. Familiar examples, with success (overt or implicit) in both areas, are the stories of Bellerophon, Peleus, Meleager, Telemachus, Theseus (in Bacchylides 17) and in displaced form the tales of Orestes and Perseus. Failures include Actaeon, Adonis, Hylas, Pentheus, and the “flower children,” Narcissus, Hyacinthus, and Cyparissus. The myth of Theseus (along with that of Perseus) is the success story par excellence.¹ This pattern is still present in<br>

  Abstract: Naming the age is one important way in which people respond to collective experience. On the debit side there are ‘hard times’, ‘times of trouble’, ‘ages of iron’; on the credit side, ‘good times’, ‘years of plenty’, ‘days of wine and roses’ and, retrospectively, ‘golden ages’. These enter into songs, sayings, mythologies. They send messages about the past, and prepare people for emotions to come: ‘Come listen a while, I’ll sing you a song / Concerning the times – it will not be long . . .’.<br>

Theories included creation by gods and spontaneous generation. Common concepts included great floods to punish sins and re-create the world, and creation of life in a primeval ocean by successive steps. In the West the myth of dualism of body and soul emerged. The dualist, creationist view was opposed from ancient Greece onward by more materialist concepts, some of which emphasized that diverse elements could be combined randomly to form<br>

  Book Title: The Vision of the Soul-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): Wilson James Matthew<br>
  Abstract: Ours is an age full of desires but impoverished in its understanding of where those desires lead-an age that claims mastery over the world but also claims to find the world as a whole absurd or unintelligible. In
      The Vision of the Soul, James Matthew Wilson seeks to conserve the great insights of the western tradition by giving us a new account of them responsive to modern discontents. The western- or Christian Platonist-tradition, he argues, tells us that man is an intellectual animal, born to pursue the good, to know the true, and to contemplate all things in beauty. Wilson begins by reconceiving the intellectual conservatism born of Edmund Burke's jeremiad against the French Revolution as an eff­ort to preserve the West's vision of man and the cosmos as ordered by and to beauty. After defining the achievement of that vision and its tradition, Wilson off­ers an extended study of the nature of beauty and the role of the fine arts in shaping a culture but above all in opening the human intellect to the perception of the form of reality. Through close studies of Theodor W. Adorno and Jacques Maritain, he recovers the classical vision of beauty as a revelation of truth and being. Finally, he revisits the ancient distinction between reason and story-telling, between mythos and logos, in order to rejoin the two.Story-telling is foundational to the forms of the fine arts, but it is no less foundational to human reason. Human life in turn constitutes a specific kind of form-a story form. The ancient conception of human life as a pilgrimage to beauty itself is one that we can fully embrace only if we see the essential correlation between reason and story and the essential convertibility of truth, goodness and beauty in beauty. By turns a study in fundamental ontology, aesthetics, and political philosophy, Wilson's book invites its readers to a renewal of the West's intellectual tradition.<br>

This habit breeds an unhappy myth of its own: mankind was once subject to the vague powers of hearsay, superstition, and old wives’ tales, but has emerged triumphant from such antiquated miasma into the knowing precisions of a rational age. While such a myth gained traction in the modern age, particularly during the Enlightenment, its basic form dates back to Plato. Or rather, it<br>

  Abstract: On the surface, veteran trauma is layered with mythic references that make it in/visible to those not materially, literally experiencing it, rendering it legible, but in ways that naturalize and invoke unreflective ways of seeing. Put differently, the struggle with combat trauma is envisioned as a warrior project in which only those who embody a heroic, if not Homeric, ethos are able to take on and defeat the shock, pain, and distress of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Indeed, one does not have to look hard to see how images of Achilles and Odysseus saturate cultural attempts to redress the phenomenon,<br>

                  Apologyshows a man driven by a provocative pronouncement from the Delphic oracle to devote his life to solving its riddle. Pleading his own defense before an Athenian jury, Socrates presents a carefully constructed speech, rich in mythological allusions. He compares himself to Achilles (28c) and likens his life’s work to a Herculean labor (22a).¹ A more subtle and also more powerful point of reference is another figure, the Theban hero Oedipus, whose life was as profoundly shaped<br>

  Abstract: Fiction that plays seriously with reality is likely in particular to consider how received interpretive frames can themselves be reinterpreted. And of course such frames are often themselves stories. There is, then, a significant area of overlap between certain kinds of magic realist fiction and fictions which unsettle those traditional founding stories that we call myth. One novel that could be described both as magic realism and as a parodic version of myth is Thomas King’s

  Abstract: Thus far in this exploration of the fictions of postmodern realism we have considered three oxymoronic categories of the “middle space”: historiographic metafiction, magic realism, and parodic myth. We have seen how each in its palimpsestic boundary-crossings offers specific culturally sensitive possibilities for narrative-as-ethics. Now, in this chapter, I want to look at a particular non-verbal form of storytelling, and that is photography. I am going to argue that, because photographs are both dependent on the givenness of the physical world and yet at the same time manifestly constructed, they can be read as paradigmatic of postmodern realism.

When these stories involve heterosexual intercourse, it is usually the offspring of such intercourse that are of interest. The narrative function of these stories of sexual union can vary widely. Often the stories are explanations for unusual physical strength, the heroic make up of one or more of the protagonists. The superhuman is explained by its genesis. in the Bible this mythical theme is barely visible.¹ When a text such as Ps 2:7, for example, states of the king that<br>

  Author(s) BARRETO RAIMUNDO C.<br>
  Abstract: Religion played a crucial role in European expansionism. Toward the end of the Middle Ages, the rise of the Spanish Empire, fostered by the myth of the Reconquista, blended nationalist and religious motives. According to that myth, “Spain was born as a nation convinced that God had entrusted it with the defense of the Catholic faith against all Muslims, Jews, heretics, and other unbelievers.”¹ Under that banner, the Spaniards invaded and explored the “New World … convinced that this was a sacred trust so that they could bring their religion to the benighted people in these lands.”²<br>

  Abstract: Violence is the ethos of our times. It is the spirituality of the modern world. It has been accorded the status of a religion, demanding from its devotees an absolute obedience to death. Its followers are not aware, however, that the devotion they pay to violence is a form of religious piety. Violence is so successful as a myth precisely because it does not seem to be mythic in the least. Violence simply appears to be the nature of things. It is what works. It is inevitable, the last and, often, the first resort in conflicts. It is embraced with<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1tm7j16">Engaging the Powers</a><br>
  Abstract: How did the Domination System get started? The myth of redemptive violence gives this answer: war, conquest, plunder, rape, and enslavement are all ordained in the very constitution of the universe, which itself is formed from the corpse of a murdered goddess. “Civilization” is a condition of periodic or perpetual warfare, “peace” the achievement of warfare, “prosperity” the fruit of warfare successfully accomplished. If human beings are created from the blood of a slaughtered god, how can one expect from them anything but violence?<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1tm7j16">Engaging the Powers</a><br>
  Abstract: The good news is that God not only liberates us from the Powers, but liberates the Powers as well. The gospel is not a dualistic myth of good and evil forces vying for ascendancy, as in the myth of redemptive violence. It is a sublimely subtle drama about the intertwining of good and evil in all of historical reality. The Powers are not simply evil. They are a bulwark against anarchy, and a patron, repository, and inspirer of art. They inculcate values that encourage interdependency, mutual care, and social cohesiveness. They encourage submission of personal desires to the general good<br>

  Book Title: Der russische Symbolismus-System und Entfaltung der poetischen Motive, Band 3 Mythopoetischer Symbolismus 2. Lebensmotive<br>
  Publisher: Verlag der österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften<br>
  Author(s): HANSEN-LÖVE AAGE A.<br>
  Abstract: Der lange erwartete dritte Band der Gesamtdarstellung der mythopoetischen Motive des russischen Symbolismus schließt nach der Analyse des Frühsymbolismus der 90er Jahre des 19. Jahrhunderts (Band 1, Wien 1989) jene der kosmischen Symbolik des religionsphilosophischen Symbolismus 1900–1907 ab (Band 2, Wien 1998). Der vorliegende Band widmet sich der Lebenssymbolik jener Kernphase des Symbolismus – also den "Neomythen“ von Apoll, Dionysos und Sophia ebenso wie den Diskursen des Erhabenen, der Apokalyptik und der "Lebens-Kunst“ als Gesamtkunstwerk der Dichterexistenz des Mythopoeten. Im Mittelpunkt steht das lyrische wie essayistische Werk von Andrej Belyj, Aleksandr Blok, Vjaceslav Ivanov, Maksimilian Vološin und anderer Vertreter der zweiten Symbolistengeneration um 1900. Wie in den bisherigen Bänden wird eine systematische Präsentation der mytho- und metapoetischen Hauptmotive der Epoche angeboten und darüber hinaus eine Zusammenschau der theoretischen Schriften ihrer Protagonisten. Gegenläufig zur Konstruktion der religionskünstlerischen Symbolik wird deren allmähliche Dekonstruktion erkennbar – ein Prozess der Symbolauflösung, der auch radikale Auswirkungen auf die Konstruktion des Lebensmythos dieser Künstlergeneration hatte. Letztlich wird schrittweise erkennbar, wie das ursprünglich optimistische, positive Konzept eines Neomythologismus in dessen grotesk-karnevaleske Ironisierung umkippt. Das Modell einer revolutionären Religionskunst scheitert, die Dichtung der russischen Symbolisten jener Jahre trägt den Sieg davon. Wie die beiden vorherigen Bände versteht sich auch Band 3 als Katalog und Wegweiser zugleich, der alle wesentlichen lyrischen Primärtexte erfasst und über einen ausführlichen deutschen wie russischen Index zugänglich macht.<br>

H.-L. 1989a), der sich mit dem "diabolischen Symbolismus" (= S I) der Frühphase auseinandersetzt (also der Dichtung der "Dekadenten" 1890 – etwa um 1900) und dem Band II (A. H.-L. 1998a), der sich der "kosmischen Symbolik" des S II widmet. Wie in den beiden vorhergehenden Bänden wurde mit größter Ausführlichkeit zum einen die Dichtung bzw. Lyrik der<br>

  Einleitung from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1vw0qr1">Der russische Symbolismus</a><br>
  Abstract: Wiederkehr ist etwas dem Mythos Immanentes – und das in zweierlei Hinsicht: Wiederkehr ist einmal die Weise des Auftretens des Mythos in der Gestalt seines Erzähltwerdens. Der Mythos selbst ist eine Art des "Erzählens", für die das Prinzip der Wiederholung unabdingbare Voraussetzung ist. Zugleich ist der einzelne Mythos immer bloß die Wiederholung eines einzigen Ur- und Ausgangsmythos,² der als kosmischer UR-TEXT alles immer schon
                  in nuceenthält bzw. vorwegnimmt. Im Gegensatz zum zielstrebigen Voranschreiten des epischen und mehr noch des romanhaften, novellistischen Erzählens (sei es in Wort oder Bild) ist das Kompositionsprinzip des Mythos eigentlich narrativ, im wörtlichen Sinne prähistorisch.<br>

  1.  Die Ordnung der Götter: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1vw0qr1">Der russische Symbolismus</a><br>
  Abstract: Die "Kulturgötter" des mythopoetischen Symbolismus (S II) befinden sich (und das in zunehmendem Maße) diesseits der kosmischen und himmlischen Sphäre, von der bisher die Rede war: Sie sind schon weitgehend personifiziert, differenziert und – was besonders auffällt – aus einer ungeheuren Menge archaischer, antiker, orientalischer Götter und Dämonen selektiert: Der mythopoetische Götterhimmel des russischen Symbolismus um 1900 rechnet zwar durchaus mit der als gegeben angenommen (und weitgehend literarisierten) klassischen "Götterfamilie" (samt allen Halbgöttern, Heroen u.a. mythologischen Figuren), beschränkt sich aber im Rahmen des konkreten

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1vw0qr1">Der russische Symbolismus</a><br>
  Abstract: Die Polarisierung des Apollinischen und Dionysischen kündigte sich schon in der deutschen Romantik (im romantischen Neomythologismus F. Schlegels, Novalis und v.a. dann in der "Mythologie" Schellings)¹ an, wobei das Apollinische mit dem "Klassischen" mit Rationalismus, Aufklärung, Humanismus identifiziert wurde, wogegen das Dionysische dem Archaisch-Mythischen, Naturhaft-Organischen, Kollektiv-Unbewußten und "Volkshaften" – im Geiste der Romantik – gleichgesetzt wurde. Diese pro-dionysische Einstellung² findet sich dann wieder in Nietzsches Gegenüberstellung von Apoll und Dionysos (in seiner "Geburt der Tragödie"),³ deren Einfluss auf die russische Moderne (insbesondere aber auf die symbolistische Mythopoetik und Religionsphilosophie) nur als total bezeichnet werden kann.<br>

  Abstract: Anders als in der "orthodoxen" Mythopoesie Ivanovs sind in der frühen Dichtung Bloks und vor allem Belyjs die (jedenfalls für die europäische Kultur) universellen Symbole und Mythologeme zwar auch an den hellenischen Götterhimmel gebunden, dieser wird aber äußerst selektiv behandelt und mit heterogenen Motiven der slawischen und germanischen (v.a. folkloristischen) Symbolwelt kontaminiert und im Rahmen eines sehr spezifischen Gruppen- oder Individualmythos aktualisiert und damit zum Bestandteil einer eigentümlichen mythopoetischen Pragmatik (man denke etwa an den

Existenz) als solches, der – schon aus Gründen der Vollständigkeit – nicht übergangen werden kann. Am häufigsten begegnet dieses Paradigma in der Mythopoesie Ivanovs, während es bei den anderen Symbolisten in den oben behandelten Paradigmata (alsput’, videnie, ožidanie, pereroždenie, nadežda, ljubovetc.) implizit enthalten ist.<br>

  Abstract: In recent years, Douglas Holmes and I have been working toward an articulation, and a refunctioning even, of ethnographic research practices so basic to the identity of anthropology.¹ It is remarkable to reflect on how much research in social and cultural anthropology, especially in the United States, has consisted of variations on a particular aesthetic of practice that can be condensed to a near-mythic scene of encounter—a Malinowskian one, or latterly, a Geertzian one (e.g., the famous opening of Geertz’s “Deep Play” essay²).

With Plath, we once more begin “in a kingdom by the sea,” before all separations and departures.

  Book Title: The Superstitious Muse-Thinking Russian Literature Mythopoetically<br>
  Publisher: Academic Studies Press<br>
  Author(s): Bethea David M.<br>
  Abstract: For several decades David Bethea has written authoritatively on the “mythopoetic thinking" that lies at the heart of classical Russian literature, especially Russian poetry. His theoretically informed essays and books have made a point of turning back to issues of intentionality and biography at a time when authorial agency seems under threat of “erasure" and the question of how writers, and poets in particular, live their lives through their art is increasingly moot. The lichnost’ (personhood, psychic totality) of the given writer is all-important, argues Bethea, as it is that which combines the specifically biographical and the capaciously mythical in verbal units that speak simultaneously to different planes of being. Pushkin’s Evgeny can be one incarnation of the poet himself and an Everyman rising up to challenge Peter’s new world order; Brodsky can be, all at once, Dante and Mandelstam and himself, the exile paying an Orphic visit to Florence (and, by ghostly association, Leningrad).This sort of metempsychosis, where the stories that constitute the Ur-texts of Russian literature are constantly reworked in the biographical myths shaping individual writers’ lives, is Bethea’s primary focus. This collection contains a liberal sampling of Bethea’s most memorable previously published essays along with new studies prepared for this occasion.<br>

  Abstract: The entries in this volume cover a huge amount of territory, but even so represent only a portion of David Bethea’s wide-ranging interests over the past three decades. One figure will serve as portal into these selected essays, arguably the fulcrum and inspirati on for Bethea’s mythopoetics: Alexander Pushkin. The shade of that great poet hovers over Bethea’s other perennial companions: Vladimir Nabokov, Vladislav Khodasevich, Joseph Brodsky, Gavrila Derzhavin. From this magical zone of Russian writers with Pushkin at its core, one question will be central. How, and through what charmed intermediaries, does a poet create and then continue to<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1zxsj7q">The Superstitious Muse</a><br>
  Abstract: Any national literature is to some significant extent a mirror held up to its people’s collective countenance: its myths, aspirations, national triumphs and traumas, current ideologies, historical understanding, linguistic traditions. But it is also more than that—more than a reflection in the glass of what has come before and what is now, even as one glances into it, passing from view. It is, in a real sense, generative of new meaning, and thus capable of shaping that countenance in the future. For the society that takes its literary products seriously, the text of a novel or poem can be<br>

Archaeologists and anthropologists provide countless examples of societies, “ancient” in time or “primitive” in development, where time was experi enced mythically rather than historically, where only those details of life that fit into and recapitulated the master plot of a sacred tale were worthy of remembrance.² The British social anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski defined myth as<br>

  Abstract: As one considers any biographical treatment of Alexander Pushkin it is prudent to bear in mind the words of the eminent cultural historian, literary theorist, and biographer of the poet Yury Lotman. In his biography Lotman “wanted to show how, like the mythological King Midas who turned everything he touched to gold, Pushkin turned everything he touched into creativity, art. [But] Midas starved to death — his food became gold.”² This metaphor is strikingly apropos when it comes to the facts of Pushkin’s life. Let us take for an example the seemingly straightforward case of the poet’s hair color. In the<br>

  Chapter 9  Pushkin’s Mythopoetic Consciousness: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1zxsj7q">The Superstitious Muse</a><br>
  Abstract: Pushkin was possessed of a richly mythopoetic consciousness. He was also, as numerous friends attest, intensely superstitious. Indeed, for a poet of Pushkin’s range and energy, it is not surprising that some of his finest works are motivated thematically on the dual and interpenetrating notions that myths can, literally, come to life and that forces beyond one’s control can prearrange one’s destiny. Yet Pushkin never made the connection between certain crucial myths (or beliefs, superstitions) and his own unfolding biography
                  explicit.He was protected from this not only by his ownamour proprebut by the carapace of what Lydia<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1zxsj7q">The Superstitious Muse</a><br>
  Abstract: Like the bread and salt that are their folk embodiments, the values of generosity and hospitality are very old in the Russian mentality. And no writer is considered more “Russian” in this sense of spiritual generosity and inexhaustible “giftedness” than Alexander Pushkin. But what exactly does this mean, once one leaves the porous level of cultural myth? “There should not be any free gifts,” writes the social anthropologist Mary Douglas, since each gift and each personality donating and receiving each gift belongs to a larger system of ongoing and mutually implicating relations. “Gift cycles engage persons in permanent commitments that<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1zxsj7q">The Superstitious Muse</a><br>
  Abstract: Central to any understanding of Joseph Brodsky as poet and thinker is his myth of language, his belief in words, and not just any words but specifically poetic words, ability to restructure time and to outwit states, tyrants, history itself. “Prosody is simply a repository of time within language,”² writes Brodsky in a statement repeated many times over in different guises and contexts. Poetic words, by their very nature, got there, and are always still getting there, first. Indeed, what makes this idea a myth in the first place, that is, something larger than the life it explains, is these<br>

  Abstract: Having spent more than twenty-five years thinking about social change in Oceania, in particular about the historical changes reflected in the mythological narratives of Palau (Belau), I did not anticipate how difficult the challenge would be to consider—prompted by the invitation to participate in today’s panel—sudden, rapid, or traumatic change. Would this mere augmentation of the rate of acceleration necessitate a dramatic reformulation of the almost canonical post-Sahlins model for studying the “anthropology of history” as the transformation of the structures of reproduction? That is, is sudden change (let me use the word “sudden” to stand as a<br>

  Abstract: The romance archetype occupies uneasy ground within our current interpretive landscape. Twenty-first-century society is the child of a demythologizing and ironic age, an age that gave birth to a Freudian critique of rational behavior, a Marxist critique of capitalist inequality, a deconstructionist critique of the privileged interpretation, and a pluralist critique of Western hegemony. We are expected as scholars to look beyond received wisdom for new insights, beneath the surface for deeper readings, in the cracks of discourse for divergent positions. We are suspicious of monolithic doctrines, airtight systems, and political bias. Equally, however, we are the children of an<br>

  Abstract: Between 1948 and 1967 the story of Kfar Etzion, one of the best-known cases of heroism in Israel’s War of Independence, became the defining myth in religious Zionism. No other story or single event in the history of religious Zionism has attained such mythical proportions and had so much influence on religious Zionists. The essence of religious-Zionist belief, how to live a life of purity and holiness and how to die a hero’s death, all for the sanctification of God’s name (

Whether we embrace the functionalism of the Polish British fieldworker Bronislaw Malinowski or the structuralism of the great French theorist Claude Lévi-Strauss, myth is eternal, as it is designed to be. Its source and its power are both attributable to that particular, enduring capacity of myth to transcend time: mythic narrative creates, sustains, and maneuvers the very origin of our existence.

As a country that used to define itself in ethnically homogeneous terms, Germany has only belatedly and reluctantly come to acknowledge its status as a destination for immigrants. While narratives of immigration have long been at the core of America’s cultural mythology, no comparable tradition exists in Germany aside from the relatively recent phenomena of

  Book Title: Numinous Subjects-Engendering the Sacred in Western Culture, An Essay<br>
  Publisher: ANU E Press<br>
  Author(s): Tatman Lucy<br>
  Abstract: Part religious studies, part feminist theory, part philosophy, part indescribable: such is Numinous Subjects. Described by the author as 'a kaleidoscopic exploration of why three gendered figures of the sacred matter within western culture,' the experience of reading this text truly is akin to gazing through a constantly turning kaleidoscope. Images, concepts, phrases and quotes are continually revisited, recombined, though never repeated in quite the same way. From these tumbling constellations arises a new understanding and wary appreciation of the figures of the virgin, the mother, and the whore. Drawing on the insights of thinkers as diverse as Rudolph Otto, Julia Kristeva, Simone de Beauvoir, and Martin Buber, Numinous Subjects simultaneously expands and focuses our attention on the myth of the sacred and its implications for female subjects in western culture today.<br>

  Abstract: Myths. Stories that reveal and establish, simultaneously, the ‘what’ and the ‘why’ of everything that matters. Stories that tell of creation: the creation of the world, if it is the world that matters, or the creation of the heavens, if the heavens matter, the creation of this particular mountain, this specific stream, this exact rock, this kind of herb – if they are what matters to those keeping the myth alive.

In response then … It seems to me that the numinous, expressed more fully as the 
                  mysterium tremendum et fascinans, both embodies and posits the terrifying convergence of immanence and transcendence, or, the coming together of feminine extremes.

  Abstract: Both the people (

The mapping of contemporary social organization onto events of the past and the invocation of mythic histories to explain the contemporary relations of social groups is significant in attempting to explain the apparent rank ordering of the social groups.

  Book Title: Wittgenstein Reads Freud: The Myth of the Unconscious-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Descombes Vincent<br>
  Abstract: Did Freud present a scientific hypothesis about the unconscious, as he always maintained and as many of his disciples keep repeating? This question has long prompted debates concerning the legitimacy and usefulness of psychoanalysis, and it is of utmost importance to Lacanian analysts, whose main project has been to stress Freud's scientific grounding. Here Jacques Bouveresse, a noted authority on Ludwig Wittgenstein, contributes to the debate by turning to this Austrian-born philosopher and contemporary of Freud for a candid assessment of the early issues surrounding psychoanalysis. Wittgenstein, who himself had delivered a devastating critique of traditional philosophy, sympathetically pondered Freud's claim to have produced a scientific theory in proposing a new model of the human psyche. What Wittgenstein recognized--and what Bouveresse so eloquently stresses for today's reader--is that psychoanalysis does not aim to produce a change limited to the intellect but rather seeks to provoke an authentic change of human attitudes. The beauty behind the theory of the unconscious for Wittgenstein is that it breaks away from scientific, causal explanations to offer new forms of thinking and speaking, or rather, a new mythology.<br>

  Foreword from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2tt8cj">Wittgenstein Reads Freud: The Myth of the Unconscious</a><br>
  Author(s) DESCOMBES VINCENT<br>
  Abstract: In its original version, Jacques Bouveresse’s essay on Wittgenstein and psychoanalysis bears both a title and a subtitle, each of them unusually explicit:
                  Philosophy, Mythology, and Pseudo-Science: Wittgenstein Reads Freud. The subtitle,Wittgenstein Reads Freud, defines the book’s subject—namely, Wittgenstein’s judgments on Freud and, more generally, his attitude toward the man and his enterprise. The title,Philosophy, Mythology, and Pseudo-Science, announces the ultimate thrust of the entire discussion by introducing three intellectual categories: a new idea can come from eitherphilosophy,mythology, orscience. We can see that among these three registers, which share responsibility for intellectual invention, science<br>

Nor is it as rare as revolution itself. Violence is basic to society and polity, especially to their foundation and consolidation.

  Abstract: “The highest and, indeed, the truly serious task of art,” states Nietzsche, is “to save the eye from gazing into the horrors of night and to deliver the subject by the healing balm of illusion from the spasms of the agitations of the will” (
                  Birth118). For Nietzsche, this constitutes the supreme achievement of Attic tragedy, in which the frenzied and annihilating power of Dionysus is contained by and expressed through Apollo’s “healing balm of blissful illusion” (127). Consequently Nietzsche defines “the tragic myth” as the “symbolization of Dionysian wisdom through Apollinian artifices” (131). It would seem that the more<br>

                  Inherit the Wind (1960). Here, we think, reason and science ran rings around obscurantism and faith, and that victory marked the end of the Bible’s credibility as an infallible source of divine wisdom. While obviously this did not mark the end of religion, it set strict limits to the scope of religion’s claims, particularly in the public sphere. Religion,<br>

  Book Title: Pushkin's Historical Imagination-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Evdokimova Svetlana<br>
  Abstract: This book explores the historical insights of Alexander Pushkin (1799-1837), Russia's most celebrated poet and arguably its greatest thinker. Svetlana Evdokimova examines for the first time the full range of Pushkin's fictional and nonfictional writings on the subject of history-writings that have strongly influenced Russians' views of themselves and their past. Through new readings of his drama,
      Boris Godunov; such narrative poems asPoltava, The Bronze Horseman,andCount Nulin; prose fiction, includingThe Captain's DaughterandBlackamoor of Peter the Great; lyrical poems; and a variety of nonfictional texts, the author presents Pushkin not only as a progenitor of Russian national mythology but also as an original historical and political thinker.Evdokimova considers Pushkin within the context of Romantic historiography and addresses the tension between Pushkin the historian and Pushkin the fiction writer . She also discusses Pushkin's ideas on the complex relations between chance and necessity in historical processes, on the particular significance of great individuals in Russian history, and on historical truth.<br>

  Book Title: Faces of History-Historical Inquiry from Herodotus to Herder<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): KELLEY DONALD R.<br>
  Abstract: In this book, one of the world's leading intellectual historians offers a critical survey of Western historical thought and writing from the pre-classical era to the late eighteenth century. Donald R. Kelley focuses on persistent themes and methodology, including questions of myth, national origins, chronology, language, literary forms, rhetoric, translation, historical method and criticism, theory and practice of interpretation, cultural studies, philosophy of history, and "historicism."Kelley begins by analyzing the dual tradition established by the foundational works of Greek historiography-Herodotus's broad cultural and antiquarian inquiry and the contrasting model of Thucydides' contemporary political and analytical narrative. He then examines the many variations on and departures from these themes produced in writings from Greek, Roman, Jewish, and Christian antiquity, in medieval chronicles, in national histories and revisions of history during the Renaissance and Reformation, and in the rise of erudite and enlightened history in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Throughout, Kelley discusses how later historians viewed their predecessors, including both supporters and detractors of the authors in question.The book, which is a companion volume to Kelley's highly praised anthology
      Versions of History from Antiquity to the Enlightenment,will be a valuable resource for scholars and students interested in interpretations of the past.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bsjw">Metaphysics in Ordinary Language</a><br>
  Abstract: In this essay, I make a suggestion about the role of Platonism in the development of the modern epoch. It has become quite common to find in the scholarly literature the claim that such originators of modernity as Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Descartes were influenced by Plato’s geometrical cosmology. According to this view, the mythical description of the cosmos as constructed from a variety of pure geometrical figures, which Plato records in the
                     Timaeus, is the prototype for the late Renaissance and early modern conviction that philosophy is written in the book of nature in the languages of mathematics.<br>

The Sephardic component, which was layered onto older, preexisting strata of Jewish populations, and would in turn be superseded by other arrivals, was henceforth dominant in population and cultural influence, in keeping with a brilliant, carefully preserved heritage. The favorable reception of Jews by Sultan Bayezid II is not a myth, even if<br>

  Biblical Prophets and Their Illustration in Islamic Art from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fgz64">A History of Jewish-Muslim Relations</a><br>
  Author(s) Milstein Rachel<br>
  Abstract: The Muslims’ interest in the Bible is based on the Qurʾanic message that presents Muhammad as the “seal of the prophets,” that is to say, a natural continuation of the Jewish and Christian monotheism. In accord with this idea, the Qurʾan adopts the biblical historiography with certain of its theological and mythological aspects. Various biblical episodes appear in the Qurʾanic text, either as short references or as detailed stories, serving as archetypes for Muhammad himself.<br>

  Jewish Pilgrimages in Egypt from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fgz64">A History of Jewish-Muslim Relations</a><br>
  Author(s) Youssef Suzan<br>
  Abstract: Cults of saints are a fundamental phenomenon in Egyptian popular culture. They attest to the preservation of a large share of archaic beliefs associated with magical and totemic practices and with agrarian mythologies. The cult of “saints” (
                  awliyaʾfor Muslims,qaddissinfor Christians,siddiqinortsaddiqimfor Jews) manifests that continuity in everyday practices, most often orally but sometimes in written form. What is being played out is the relation between human beings and their environment but also the relation to their humanity itself, to the mental and symbolic universe reflected in language, religion, and art, all within an extreme<br>

  Book Title: Homo Narrans-The Poetics and Anthropology of Oral Literature<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Niles John D.<br>
  Abstract: It would be difficult to imagine what human life would be like without stories-from myths recited by Pueblo Indian healers in the kiva, ballads sung in Slovenian market squares, folktales and legends told by the fireside in Italy, to jokes told at a dinner table in Des Moines-for it is chiefly through storytelling that people possess a past. In
      Homo NarransJohn D. Niles explores how human beings shape their world through the stories they tell. The book vividly weaves together the study of Anglo-Saxon literature and culture with the author's own engagements in the field with some of the greatest twentieth-century singers and storytellers in the Scottish tradition. Niles ponders the nature of the storytelling impulse, the social function of narrative, and the role of individual talent in oral tradition. His investigation of the poetics of oral narrative encompasses literary works, such as the epic poems and hymns of early Greece and the Anglo-SaxonBeowulf, texts that we know only through written versions but that are grounded in oral technique. That all forms of narrative, even the most sophisticated genres of contemporary fiction, have their ultimate origin in storytelling is a point that scarcely needs to be argued. Niles's claims here are more ambitious: that oral narrative is and has long been the chief basis of culture itself, that the need to tell stories is what distinguishes humans from all other living creatures.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fh9rr">Homo Narrans</a><br>
  Abstract: Oral narrative, or what we call storytelling in everyday speech, is as much around us as the air we breathe, although we often take its casual forms so much for granted that we are scarcely aware of them. It is also an ancient practice. The early Greeks called it 
                  mûthos, a word that we often translate “myth” but that encompassed storytelling in many forms. To judge from the cuneiform records of ancient Sumeria, the papyri of early Egypt, the earliest bamboo and bronze inscriptions of ancient China, and other records that have come down to us from the dawn of<br>

  Abstract: People have speculated a good deal about who Homer, the 
                  Beowulf poet, the author of the Chanson de Roland or the Nibelungenlied, and similar shadowy persons from the past were and when and where they lived. Such questions have an obvious bearing on our understanding of texts that reveal key aspects of earlier modes of thought and cast light on many aspects of mythology, legendry, and popular belief, at the same time as they put the art of poetry on magnificent display. Although some curiously exact opinions about the authorship, audience, date, and provenance of such narratives have been expressed,¹<br>

  Abstract: Explorations of “experience” are never straightforward, however, for once we begin to clarify its nature, we run into a host of problems. The intimate, experiential side of homelessness or any other abjection is just as mythic and just as cultural as the public, horrific side. There are also questions of how one goes about knowing what other people experience and the rhetorical uses to which expressions of experience are put. In turn, any attempt to build effective theories of experience is complicated by the fact that people’s lives can entail very different ways of being. The category of experience is<br>

Despite the metafictional character of his de-naturing of traditional narratives, his ex-posing of the ideologies concealed behind Western myths, and his interrogation of the hidden structures of thought and feeling (Logos and Eros) in which writer and reader are enmeshed, Robbe-Grillet’s detecting project can itself be generated only from within the traditional frames of language, myth, and feeling.<br>

  Abstract: HERMENEUTIC PHILOSOPHIES and traditions have existed for centuries, flourishing especially in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in Germany and other parts of continental Europe. They were concerned originally with understanding the Bible and other sacred texts, and with the interpretation of Roman law, which ruled parts of the Continent as late as the nineteenth century. But by extension all sorts of other texts could be subjected to hermeneutic techniques: the works of Plato and Aristotle, commentaries on the Bible and the Talmud, poetry and drama, myths and legends.<br>

  Book Title: Michel Tournier and the Metaphor of Fiction-  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): PLATTEN DAVID<br>
  Abstract: Michel Tournier is a writer who explores complex philosophical questions in the guise of concrete, imagistic narratives. This comprehensive study privileges the notion of literary reference, by which the world of text is understood or experienced in metaphorical relation to the world outside of it. Metaphor, in the context of Tournier’s fiction, shows how the fantastic merges with the real to provide new perspectives on many diverse aspects of the modern world: the Crusoe myth, Nazism, the value to society of art and religion, and the nature of education. This book elucidates an aesthetic of Tournier’s fiction that encompasses the writer’s stated ambition to ‘go beyond literature’.<br>

  13  Revising Jezebel Politics: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjbrv">Black Intersectionalities</a><br>
  Author(s) Leath Jennifer S.<br>
  Abstract: The failure of respectability and the incessant onslaught of cultural attacks against
                  allblack sexualities invite us to “crawl back” (Long, 1999: 9) through the lives of Jezebel, imagining adeviantfuture (Cohen, 2004), a “still unfolding” revolution (Walcott, 2006). A careful review of the mythological, historical, and biblical lives of “Jezebel” unearths the value of reappropriating Jezebel as a model for radical uses of the erotic. The queerness of her faith; the deviance of her sexuality; the bold pluralism of her politics: these are qualities that fill the interstices of hegemonichis-stories of Jezebel.

  Abstract: The subtitle of Hazlitt’s
                  Liber Amoris; or, the New Pygmalion, published anonymously in 1823, promises a retelling of Ovid’s Augustan myth of transformation set in Regency England, a translation from classical to modern times. Unlike Ovid’s poetic invention of a distant mythological past, Hazlitt’s prose version takes place in the quotidian world of London’s lodging houses. However, early nineteenth-century London has no pagan Venus who can effect the metamorphosis required by Hazlitt’s narrator. Obviously, like Mary Shelley’sFrankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus(1818), the subtitle is ironic, and questions the pertinence of classical mythology to the modern world. There is<br>

  Author(s) Mehlman Jeffrey<br>
  Abstract: “The Figure of the Youth as Virile Poet” is a confusing text, but it does have a recognizable armature of sorts, pertaining to the three references to a muse said to be “a kind of sister of the Minotaur.” The mythographer immediately thinks of Ariadne and Phaedra, but because she first appears in relation to a “younger figure,” a “son still bearing the antique imagination of the father,” Phaedra-and-Hippolytus (rather than Ariadne-and-Theseus) seems the more apt allusion. This impression is reinforced by a number of additional elements. First, there is the somewhat jarring insistence on the “virility” of the poet-youth,<br>

  Book Title: Médée protéiforme-  Publisher: Les Presses de l'Université d'Ottawa<br>
  Author(s): Carrière Marie<br>
  Abstract: Le mythe de l'infanticide Médée a toujours connu une fortune littéraire et la littérature féminine contemporaine ne fait pas exception. L'analyse comparée de huit textes de femmes de divers horizons tente de cerner les enjeux de cette figure irréductible pour une pensée féministe actuelle sur la maternité, le sujet et l'écriture mythique.En s'interrogeant sur la pertinence particulière de la tragédie d'Euripide aux reprises médéennes, explicites ou sous-entendues, des femmes, cette étude comparée se penche sur des textes du théâtre de Marie Cardinal, de Deborah Porter, de Franca Rame et de Cherríe Moraga, et des romans de Monique Bosco, de Christa Wolf, de Bessora et de Marie-Célie Agnant. À travers ses incarnations transculturelles, le mythe de Médée éclaire les affres de l'exil et de l'exclusion, ainsi que certaines visions du maternel qui préféreraient peut-être rester dans l'ombre de nos présuppositions et de nos règles sociales. Bien qu'il n'y ait pas plus monstrueux ou fou que l'acte infanticide, Médée, elle, n'est pas monstre, pas folle, mais lucide, humaine à part entière, comme la voulait Euripide, alors qu'elle s'en prend à ses enfants, à la culture défectueuse, à l'histoire des hommes. La réécriture au féminin de Médée force aussi une conception du sujet qui ne revêt pas facilement sa cohérence. Mais la poétique même de cette Médée retranscrite au féminin fait preuve de sa flexibilité, son indétermination, son pouvoir de transcender la simple répétition de son mythe, vu ici autrement et différemment.<br>

  Book Title: Médée protéiforme-  Publisher: Les Presses de l'Université d'Ottawa<br>
  Author(s): Carrière Marie<br>
  Abstract: Le mythe de l'infanticide Médée a toujours connu une fortune littéraire et la littérature féminine contemporaine ne fait pas exception. L'analyse comparée de huit textes de femmes de divers horizons tente de cerner les enjeux de cette figure irréductible pour une pensée féministe actuelle sur la maternité, le sujet et l'écriture mythique.En s'interrogeant sur la pertinence particulière de la tragédie d'Euripide aux reprises médéennes, explicites ou sous-entendues, des femmes, cette étude comparée se penche sur des textes du théâtre de Marie Cardinal, de Deborah Porter, de Franca Rame et de Cherríe Moraga, et des romans de Monique Bosco, de Christa Wolf, de Bessora et de Marie-Célie Agnant. À travers ses incarnations transculturelles, le mythe de Médée éclaire les affres de l'exil et de l'exclusion, ainsi que certaines visions du maternel qui préféreraient peut-être rester dans l'ombre de nos présuppositions et de nos règles sociales. Bien qu'il n'y ait pas plus monstrueux ou fou que l'acte infanticide, Médée, elle, n'est pas monstre, pas folle, mais lucide, humaine à part entière, comme la voulait Euripide, alors qu'elle s'en prend à ses enfants, à la culture défectueuse, à l'histoire des hommes. La réécriture au féminin de Médée force aussi une conception du sujet qui ne revêt pas facilement sa cohérence. Mais la poétique même de cette Médée retranscrite au féminin fait preuve de sa flexibilité, son indétermination, son pouvoir de transcender la simple répétition de son mythe, vu ici autrement et différemment.<br>

Ayant assuré la gloire de Jason et des Argonautes à la poursuite de la Toison d’or qu’elle dérobe à sa Colchide natale, Médée devient migrante et étrangère parmi les Grecs, mais elle est par la suite abandonnée par Jason qui désire se remarier avec la fille du roi Créon².

  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Miller Jane Ann<br>
  Abstract: In this penetrating biography, Brodsky's life and work are illuminated by his great friend, the late poet and literary scholar Lev Loseff. Drawing on a wide range of source materials, some previously unpublished, and extensive interviews with writers and critics, Loseff carefully reconstructs Brodsky's personal history while offering deft and sensitive commentary on the philosophical, religious, and mythological sources that influenced the poet's work. Published to great acclaim in Russia and now available in English for the first time, this is literary biography of the first order, and sets the groundwork for any books on Brodsky that might follow.<br>

  Abstract: The struggles for recognition by minorities in the 1990s acquired a particular sensitivity in France, where the myth of Republican, universal and difference-blind citizenship was less corroded than in many other Western countries, a phenomenon that was also experienced by, for example, sexual and gender minorities, and that has delayed the introduction of postcolonial studies and multiculturalism in France (Nordmann & Vidal 2004).

  Abstract: The growth of freedom has been the central theme of history, Lord Acton believed, because it represents God’s plan for humanity. One does not need such a Whiggish view of history to notice that the history of the West, at least, has indeed been a story of the development of freedom (whether actualized or idealized). We trace the origins of Western civilization back to the Greek “emancipation” of reason from myth. Since the Renaissance, there has been a progressive emphasis, first on religious freedom, then political freedom, followed by economic freedom, colonial and racial freedom, and most recently sexual and<br>

  Abstract: Ever since Homer—or the gaggle of bards who have come down to us under that name—sat down to commemorate in epic poetry the Greek siege of Troy, artists have been inspired to find in historical events the stuff of literature. Indeed, until Heinrich Schliemann’s excavations in Asia Minor in the 1870s, the

  Book Title: Religion after Religion-Gershom Scholem, Mircea Eliade, and Henry Corbin at Eranos<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wasserstrom Steven M.<br>
  Abstract: By the end of World War II, religion appeared to be on the decline throughout the United States and Europe. Recent world events had cast doubt on the relevance of religious belief, and modernizing trends made religious rituals look out of place. It was in this atmosphere that the careers of Scholem, Eliade, and Corbin--the twentieth century's legendary scholars in the respective fields of Judaism, History of Religions, and Islam--converged and ultimately revolutionized how people thought about religion. Between 1949 and 1978, all three lectured to Carl Jung's famous Eranos circle in Ascona, Switzerland, where each in his own way came to identify the symbolism of mystical experience as a central element of his monotheistic tradition. In this, the first book ever to compare the paths taken by these thinkers, Steven Wasserstrom explores how they overturned traditional approaches to studying religion by de-emphasizing law, ritual, and social history and by extolling the role of myth and mysticism. The most controversial aspect of their theory of religion, Wasserstrom argues, is that it minimized the binding character of moral law associated with monotheism.<br>

  Abstract: The most influential and brilliant students of Hermann Cohen (1842—1918), the neo-Kantian Jewish philosopher of Marburg, largely rejected one of his fundamental views on Judaism. Opposing his characterization of Judaism as the religion definitively opposed to myth—Judaism as virtually identical with a demythologized Enlightenment rationality—these post-Cohenian thinkers turned to a view of myth as a creative and living force. At least three Cohen students, Franz Rosenzweig, Ernst Bloch, and Ernst Cassirer, wrote revolutionary works that innovatively reassessed the relations between myth, the History of Religions, and Judaism. These figures were joined by a much larger cohort in<br>

I have only traced here a few of those contexts, the turn to myth in Weimar thought, Paris in the thirties, Christian Kabbalah, Heidegger, Jung, fictional androgynes, Nietzsche, Schelling, Goethe, Hamann, Kierkegaard, proud and tragic nationalisms, and so on.

  Abstract: Paradise Lostis not an orthodox poem and it needs to be rescued from its orthodox critics. This book contends that the best way back to the poem Milton composed, rather than the one the orthodox would have us read, is to reassert the importance of Satan, heretic and hater. I shall be doing this in various ways. One is through revising the history of the Satan that Milton reimagines for us, since a mistaken idea about it has been widely accepted in recent years. It is the combat myth, I argue, that has always been at the center of<br>

  Abstract: We have just been exploring the contrasting but related activity of the poem’s two protagonists, Son and Satan, in Book 10. This opposition, which is essential to the combat myth Milton is retelling, is actually signalled very early in the poem and pervades it from then on. But so many things are happening in the first few lines of

Apart from some fifteen new lines, there were no other important changes between the two editions, yet the alteration of its external form shifts the way in which one perceives the poem’s informing structure, what Aristotle called themythos. The longest books of the first edition were the last four. These were divided into six for1674. Most of the extra lines also occur in the second half of the poem, changes that had<br>

The symbolic registers of the nation usually increase proportionately to the length of time spent outside the nation, and the loyalties that bind the “imagined community” (Anderson) diverge into smaller communities bound by gender, class, caste, religion, home region, profession, language, and dialect.

  Abstract: If the Samson story had been decontextualized in order to pave the way for New Testament contextualizations, two versions of which are afforded by the sixteenth-and seventeenth-century prayer books, there was during the Renaissance, especially among typologists, a parallel effort to offer recontextualizations from materials that had been repressed by Reformation theologians but that now acquired new importance and relevance, particularly in the world of politics.

  Realist from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zv117">Eros the Bittersweet</a><br>
  Abstract: It is nothing new to say that all utterance is erotic in some sense, that all language shows the structure of desire at some level. Already in Homer’s usage, the same verb (
                  mnaomai) has the meaning ‘to give heed, to make mention’ and also the meaning ‘to court, woo, be a suitor.’ Already in ancient Greek myth, the same goddess (Peithō) has charge of rhetorical persuasion and the arts of seduction. Already in earliest metaphor, it is ‘wings’ or ‘breath’ that move words from speaker to listener as they move eros from lover to beloved. But words that are written<br>

  THREE  The Idea of the Play from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zv1rc">Shakespeare</a><br>
  Abstract: Two related myths of closure inscribe themselves within most modern attempts to understand the literary past. Both are myths of community. The first evokes an unfallen, preindustrial age without moral uncertainty, personal anomie, or economic alienation: this is the era inhabited by Benjamin’s storyteller or D. W. Robertson’s Chaucer, an era in which everyone’s experience was more or less public and shareable, as were the norms by which to judge it. Though hardly a world without sin and error, it at least permitted sin to be identified and at best was a world in which poetry mattered, not as unacknowledged<br>

  INTRODUCTION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvh3g">Symbol and Truth in Blake's Myth</a><br>
  Abstract: This book attempts to elucidate some fundamental problems in Blake’s myth and in the theory of imagination on which it is implicitly founded. Despite years of trying earnestly to see the myth as philosophically coherent, I have come to believe that it contains serious inconsistencies and owes its lines of development to Blake’s unceasing effort to reconcile them. I am deeply indebted, as will be obvious, to the rich variety of insights available in Blake scholarship, but I shall argue against both prevailing views that assume coherence in Blake’s myth: the orthodox claim that it never changed, and the revisionist<br>

  ONE  Vision and Perception from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvh3g">Symbol and Truth in Blake's Myth</a><br>
  Abstract: Any attempt to understand what Blake’s poems mean must begin by considering how they mean, for he and his modern interpreters assert that his meanings are fundamentally symbolic and are to be understood in a special way. In the twentieth century symbolism has been intensively studied in a wide range of disciplines, including anthropology, depth psychology, linguistics, and philosophy, not to mention literary criticism (usually drawing on one or more of the above). Blake, by contrast, had no such developed body of theory to work with, although he was of course familiar with the speculations of mythographers and iconographers. In<br>

  TWO  The Truth of Symbols from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvh3g">Symbol and Truth in Blake's Myth</a><br>
  Abstract: Even when we have understood that Blake’s theory of perception is grounded in the Divine Body of Jesus, an unresolved antinomy remains. Are symbols arbitrary and inadequate images from the fallen world that will be superseded in Edenic perception, or are they the very basis of experience and the guarantee of truth? Blake’s answer, ultimately, is that symbols become true by being organized into myth, where they take on conceptual form and are available to imaginative interpretation. But before we consider how his myth works, we need to examine closely the basis of its symbols in a theory of perception.<br>

We shall now move toward an examination of the myth in which he organized them, and raise more directly the problem of interpretation in its dual form: Blake’s understanding of his symbols’ meaning, and the various kinds of understanding that modern readers bring to them. I propose to begin by considering some representative modern theories of symbolism, taking care at each point to note essential differences from Blake’s theory, but at the same time establishing perspectives that will help to illuminate the peculiar difficulties of his<br>

  Abstract: Blake’s myth is above all else psychological. His cosmology, theology, and even epistemology are all transpositions of the central inquiry into the self. This is no disinterested quest. Like many in his age Blake was haunted, if not obsessed, by dividedness within the self and between self and world. As Hegel said in his first published work, division or discord
                  (Entzweiung)“is the source of the need for philosophy.” And both Hegel and Blake were convinced that harmony must be achieved by restoring the fruitful interaction of opposites, not by abolishing them. “When the power of unification disappears from the<br>

  Abstract: Modernist literature has a deserved reputation for being radically experimental in theme, structure, and technique. And yet the more one ponders it and its successors in the century, the more its collective voice appears to speak elegiacally, that is, in accents reflective of one of the most traditional and conventional of literary modes. Recently Peter Sacks (1985, 2) has reminded us that “the myth of the vegetation deity” is one of the elegy’s central conventions all of which may be “not only aesthetically interesting forms but also the literary versions of specific social and psychological practices.” Both the presence and<br>

  Book Title: Living Prism-Itineraries in Comparative Literature<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): KUSHNER EVA<br>
  Abstract: She discusses the current state of comparative literary studies and the renewed role of comparative literature in a world that is at once more plural and more globalized, as well as some of the debates now taking place within literary criticism as a whole, including the interchange between comparative literature and cultural studies, the re-envisaging of the Renaissance, the work of Northrop Frye, myth and literature at the end of the twentieth century, modern drama, and post-colonialism. To play an important role in the human sciences, comparative literature had first to free itself of a number of restrictive habits, such as an insufficiently critical literary history. In order to do this, it had to think theoretically, but without yielding to the temptation of letting theory become an end in itself. Kushner demonstrates that, while under strong pressures to be a more rigourous science, comparative literature has realized that in the human sciences the validation of knowledge has to seek its own tests and criteria, becoming increasingly more open to individuality, difference, and life situations and controlling its tendency to universalize. With its emphasis on whether literary history is possible and the problems it raises for literary theory and for comparative literature in particular, The Living Prism adds an important dimension to the ongoing debate about criticism and comparative literary studies.<br>

  Abstract: The search I wish to describe is not directed, as the title might suggest, towards the anti-Petrarchan tradition, which has been a rich source of obverse images of the idealized Other – usually woman – so characteristic of Petrarchism itself. Where Petrarch and his followers idealize and even worship, anti-Petrarchism levels, satirizes, and ridicules. Where Petrarch and his followers create a myth, anti-Petrarchism demythologizes and demystifies.

  Book Title: Living Prism-Itineraries in Comparative Literature<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): KUSHNER EVA<br>
  Abstract: She discusses the current state of comparative literary studies and the renewed role of comparative literature in a world that is at once more plural and more globalized, as well as some of the debates now taking place within literary criticism as a whole, including the interchange between comparative literature and cultural studies, the re-envisaging of the Renaissance, the work of Northrop Frye, myth and literature at the end of the twentieth century, modern drama, and post-colonialism. To play an important role in the human sciences, comparative literature had first to free itself of a number of restrictive habits, such as an insufficiently critical literary history. In order to do this, it had to think theoretically, but without yielding to the temptation of letting theory become an end in itself. Kushner demonstrates that, while under strong pressures to be a more rigourous science, comparative literature has realized that in the human sciences the validation of knowledge has to seek its own tests and criteria, becoming increasingly more open to individuality, difference, and life situations and controlling its tendency to universalize. With its emphasis on whether literary history is possible and the problems it raises for literary theory and for comparative literature in particular, The Living Prism adds an important dimension to the ongoing debate about criticism and comparative literary studies.<br>

  19  In Search of the Obverse Side of Petrarchism from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt801kq">Living Prism</a><br>
  Abstract: The search I wish to describe is not directed, as the title might suggest, towards the anti-Petrarchan tradition, which has been a rich source of obverse images of the idealized Other – usually woman – so characteristic of Petrarchism itself. Where Petrarch and his followers idealize and even worship, anti-Petrarchism levels, satirizes, and ridicules. Where Petrarch and his followers create a myth, anti-Petrarchism demythologizes and demystifies. It is a trend that its idealistic counterpart almost seems to demand, and their duality seems omnipresent in European literature as part of the even more basic duality between idealistic and realistic traditions from classical times<br>

  Abstract: Responding to a request for a course-outline proposal, this essay will be a set of prolegomena pointing out the pedagogic and theoretical potential of reflecting on myth in its multiple relationships to literature in any culture. The course would begin with an attempt to delineate literariness in relation to the already familiar materials (from the past near or far of the writer’s own culture, from the oral tradition, from the past and present of other civilizations, and so on) proposed by the collective imagination to the writer’s creativity. We would also explore the common ground of myth and literature as<br>

  26  Greek Myths in Modern Drama: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt801kq">Living Prism</a><br>
  Abstract: To study the reappearances of myth in literature is to encounter the paradox of permanence and transformation. The haunting question that arises for the critic and the historian as well as for the theoretician of literature and those who study the anthropological, psychological, and sociological aspects of imagination is that of the resilience of myths. How is it that these ancient narratives – very often Greek myths in the case of the literatures of the West – survive and revive with ever-renewed meaning for writers, readers, and spectators of subsequent periods?

  Author(s) McRae Kenneth D.<br>
  Abstract: In spite of notable efforts by medieval theologians and modern constitutional lawyers to render their respective crafts esoteric, some things remain fundamentally simple. That is to say, their essentials can be understood by lay people possessing a little detachment and good will. Among these simple matters we may rank the basic relationship between Francophones and Anglophones in Canada, which appears reasonably clear to most informed observers outside the country, but which is obscured for many Canadians by the shadows and myths of the cave society in which they pass their lives. My main argument in this paper is that the<br>

  Reflections on Political Marketing and Party “Decline” in Canada . . . or, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the 1988 Election from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt806sg">Democracy with Justice/La juste democratie</a><br>
  Author(s) Tanguay A. Brian<br>
  Abstract: Are Canada’s political parties in “decline” ? Do they matter less to voters and citizens now than they did during that mythical golden age of Macdonald, Laurier, Mackenzie King, and St. Laurent? Are they less successful now than they once were in mobilizing voters, structuring political choices, or generating policy ideas? These are the sorts of questions that Khayyam Paltiel addressed in one of his last published works (Paltiel, 1989), a wide-ranging survey of the impact of changing political technologies (polling, consulting, direct mail, and so on) on the health of party organizations in both Canada and the United States.<br>

  Abstract: The “other country” which is conjured up in Alice Munro’s writing evidences a mythic and mystic landscape of origins strewn with aesthetic traces, which belong in the temporal category of the ephemeral, the half-glimpsed, the transient, such as footprints dissolving on sand, or mist burning away in the sunshine. Munro creates a territory which relies on flux density, on energy and forces. Her ephemeral traces are not melancholy, they are cosmic, they move along lines of deterritorialization and reterritorialization that belong in the machinery of desire, on the surface of fluid planes.

  Author(s) Pérez-Gómez Alberto<br>
  Abstract: THE BIBLICAL DESCRIPTION of the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem has generated many diverse architectural speculations throughout our history. According to tradition, the Temple followed the designs of God and therefore could be interpreted as the archetypal work of architecture - a work that revealed a true order beyond the whimsical tastes of man and any temporal expressions of political power. In diverse times and cultures, mythical accounts of technological making and building demonstrated mankind’s keen awareness of the problems involved in transforming a given “sacred” world for the sake of survival.

Although Frye uses European existentialism and the Russian Revolution as examples of differing social structures and philosophies, the underlying comparison he draws throughout the essay is between Canada and the United States. Assuming Canada’s overriding mythology to be pastoral, Frye found it an easy step to emphasize that Canada, unlike the United States with its history of revolution and technological productivity, is<br>

  Book Title: Rewriting Apocalypse in Canadian Fiction-  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Goldman Marlene<br>
  Abstract: Rewriting Apocalypse in Contemporary Canadian Fiction is the first book to explore the literary, psychological, political, and cultural repercussions of the apocalypse in the fiction of Timothy Finley, Michael Ondaatje, Margaret Atwood, Thomas King, and Joy Kogawa. While writers from diverse nations have adopted and adapted the biblical narrative, these Canadian authors introduce particular twists to the familiar myth of the end. Goldman demonstrates that they share a marked concern with purgation of the non-elect, the loss experienced by the non-elect, and the traumatic impact of apocalyptic violence. She also analyzes Canadian apocalyptic accounts as crisis literature written in the context of the Cold War - written against the fear of total destruction.<br>

  INTRODUCTION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt80hzf">Rewriting Apocalypse in Canadian Fiction</a><br>
  Abstract: The apocalyptic paradigm pervaded Canadian literature from its beginnings. In documenting their experience, the explorers and settlers who left the Old World and arrived in the territory north of the forty-ninth parallel drew on the narrative of apocalypse - a story whose key vision portrays the “old world” being replaced by the new. This conceptual substitution, however, was never entirely successful, creating an ironic tension. For even though the explorers and settlers invoked apocalypse, the myth of a decadent earthly world abruptly and violently transformed into a perfect heavenly world never accurately defined the Canadian experience - an experience perhaps<br>

  CONCLUSION: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt80hzf">Rewriting Apocalypse in Canadian Fiction</a><br>
  Abstract: Fashioning an ending for a book about fictions that advocate skepticism about endings is, admittedly, a tricky business. However, in light of this study’s findings that it is dangerous to ignore the myth of the end, it seems prudent to offer some concluding remarks. This study began with the desire to explore the treatment of the apocalyptic paradigm from the ex-centric perspective of contemporary Canadian writers. In effect, their works confirm Ronald Granofsky’s observation that 1945 was “the year a certain innocence ended for the human race, a Second Fall” (2). Using the grammar of apocalypse outlined in the introduction,<br>

  Abstract: The legend of Parsifal and the quest for the Holy Grail has been one of my favorite stories since boyhood. The many versions I have encountered have never failed to fascinate and ignite the imagination. The long acquaintance with the story and the personal cultural tendrils that take me into the Celtic world are sufficient (though perhaps not necessary) to recognize an adequate treatment of the material when it is presented. Such a recognition was not forthcoming in my reading of Lévi-Strauss’s discourse on the myth (1985, 219-34). But my respect for Lévi-Strauss’s immense contribution to scholarship remains constant.

  Book Title: Chora 2-Intervals in the Philosophy of Architecture<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Parcell Stephen<br>
  Abstract: Karsten Harries provides a new and long-overdue reading of Martin Heidegger's well-known essay "Building Dwelling Thinking." Donald Kunze and Stephen Parcell consider possibilities of meaningful architectural space for a visual culture, continuing themes they addressed in Chora 1. Further reflections on the spaces of literature, cinema, and architecture include an interview with French writer and film maker Alain Robbe-Grillet and articles by Dagmar Motycka Weston on the surrealist city, Tracey Eve Winton on the museum as a paradigmatic modern building, and Terrance Galvin on spiritual space in the works of Jean Cocteau. Jean-Pierre Chupin and Bram Ratner explore historical themes in their essays on French Renaissance architect Philibert de l'Orme and the Jewish myth of the Golem. Gregory Caicco addresses ethical questions in his essay on the Greek agora and the death of Socrates, as does Lily Chi in her meditation on the critical issue of use in architectural works. A concern with architectural representation and generative strategies for the making of architecture is present throughout, especially in the essay by Joanna Merwood on the provocative House by British artist Rachel Whiteread.<br>

  Abstract: The title, Figuring Grief, refers to the narrative process whereby mourning is depicted. In her textual analysis, Smythe explores various connections between representation and consolation. Drawing on genre and narratological theory, she outlines the development of the "fiction-elegy" as a sub-genre and suggests that the modernist writings of Woolf and Joyce are paradigmatic examples of the form. She then uses these paradigms as suggestive "reading models" for the interpretation of works by Gallant, Munro, and other contemporary fiction-elegists. Figuring Grief offers new readings of specific works and suggests that new ways of reading are both demanded and rewarded by a poetics of elegy.<br>

  Abstract: Few episodes in the postwar history of Czechoslovakia have received greater attention than the Prague Spring, when reformers in the Czechoslovak Communist Party (KSČ) attempted to create a democratic socialism in the heart of the Soviet bloc, creating unprecedented opportunities for political liberalization, social mobilization, and internationalism in a Stalinist regime that had previously been one of the most conservative in Eastern Europe. The subsequent invasion of Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact troops contributed to the commemoration of the Prague Spring as a national rebellion against Soviet hegemony, a myth that Czech and Slovak historians have been laboring to confront since<br>

  Abstract: The French creators of the Cannes International Film Festival had always envisioned the event functioning as a subtle assertion of patriotism. From the outset Cannes was conceived as a national-Republican response to Fascist Italy’s Venice festival (originating in 1932). However, as is often recounted, the German invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 brought a sudden halt to the first Cannes festival fortnight.¹ War in Europe meant that a competitive celebration of cinema was no longer a priority. Re-launched in 1946, a series of successful mountings of the festival eventually did bolster the myth of French cultural superiority. In Paris<br>

My contention here is that this dialectic of myth and enlightenment is structured by an entwinement of mimicry, mimesis, and sacrifice which not only underlies the book’s ‘excursus’ on Odysseus and its celebrated chapter on anti-semitism, but arguably furnishes it with its fundamental conceptual core. Though each of these concepts are undoubtedly complex, mobilized to distinct purposes in different parts of Adorno’s oeuvre in particular, their deployment inDialectic of Enlightenmentseems to harbour the<br>

  Abstract: In maintaining the character of Marçal’s poetry as praxis, in Chapter Three I examined poetry as the space where the process of the reconfiguration of reality takes place. Moving from myth to the various levels of reality, I have shown that Marçal concentrated her agency as a writer upon the action of
                  mettere al mondo il mondo. The results attestes to her emergence as a woman poet, and reveales the prevalence of poetic action upon the theme of birth as Marçal’s specific form of creating a novel iconographic female universe.

  Abstract: Americans seem confident in the mythical notion that the United States is a free nation dedicated to reproducing the principles of equality, justice, and democracy. What has been ignored in this delusional view is the growing rise of an expanded national security state since 2001,¹ and an attack on individual rights that suggests the United States has more in common with authoritarian regimes like China and Iran “than anyone may like to admit.”² I want to address this seemingly untenable notion that the United States has become a breeding ground for authoritarianism by focusing on four fundamentalisms: market fundamentalism, religious<br>

  Abstract: It is commonly thought that the greater the degree of abstraction used in describing phenomena the less understanding we have with respect to their concrete features. I want to challenge that myth by showing how mathematical abstraction—the characterization of phenomena using mathematical descriptions that seem to bear little or no relation to concrete physical entities/systems—can aid our understanding in ways that more empirically based investigations often cannot. What I mean here by “understanding” is simply having a theoretical account of how the system is constituted that enables us to solve problems, make predictions, and explain why the phenomena<br>

  3  The Emergence of Humphreys as a Postcolonial Writer from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qhf1h">Emyr Humphreys</a><br>
  Abstract: This chapter is concerned with Humphreys’s early fiction: the first six novels published between 1946 and 1957 and particularly the seventh,
                  A Toy Epic, which was finally published in 1958. The main postcolonial strategies that Humphreys has used throughout his career emerged and were refined during this period: the use of Wales as the location of the plot, the use of Welsh history and myth, the discussion of the variety of Welsh life. The focus of the discussion will be on the ways in which these techniques evolved and the reasons behind their use – the extent to which those reasons<br>

  Abstract: Using indigenous myth within a work of fiction is an established postcolonial strategy of resistance. The fact that Humphreys made a practice of using classical myth in a variety of narrative techniques in his fiction before he began to use Celtic myths predominantly does not prevent his use of indigenous myth being considered as a deliberately anti-imperial strategy. ‘The Land of the Living’ sequence is perhaps the best, certainly the most complex, example of his use of a variety of tales from
                  The Mabinogion, although the Blodeuwedd archetype has occurred in his fiction throughout his career.² Humphreys has written extensively<br>

The important fact about the stories of Adam and Eve contained in the first chapters of the Book of Genesis is not that there is some similarity between them and the other creation myths one can find in the ancient Middle East, but rather the striking differences between the Adam and Eve story and the other stories.

An analogous opposition would seem to be a good starting point for my argument. “Genetic endowment and cultural heritage evolve according to opposite laws.... Biological evolution sprouts new branches that do not cross-fertilize, branches that never again unite once they have become solid.

  Author(s) Yearwood Gladstone L.<br>
  Abstract: THE HARDER THEY COME (1971) is a chant of black dreams and frustrations. It is the story of a betrayal, the loss of innocence and the intrusion foreign values and technologies into the contemporary Caribbean. Writers Perry Henzell and Trevor Rhone craft a narrative about a mid-20th century Jamaican folk hero Ivanhoe ‘Rhygin’ Martin, whose mythic fight against the established order parallels the day-to-day struggle of society’s disenfranchised. In the film, Ivan is trapped between two worlds—the persistent poverty of Jamaica’s suffering underclass and an alluring metropolitan North American lifestyle.

  Abstract: Gossip is to modern drama what myth was to ancient tragedy. Gossip, like myth, offers playwrights a selection of favourite story types, well stocked with embarrassing details. Gossip, like myth, brings secrets into the public light, charming audiences with the socially cohesive pleasures of other people’s pain. Gossip, like myth, unites communities against deviance in the cause of normality or, with equal efficiency, against normality on behalf of popular subversion. Ancient myth, however, handing down the world-historical heritage of atrocious deeds, concerned itself primarily with relations of kinship; modern gossip, by contrast, retailing damaging new information pertaining to just about<br>

Evanescence is found in the ‘in-between’. The evanescent moment is defined as the event of ‘the philosophical realisation of the art of politics’ (Rancière 1995: 19). As these three trajectories of art, politics and philosophy coalesce to transform themselves as in-between discourse, they emancipate the evanescent moment from being an ideational or mythic impossible utopia, opening out the possibility of a realizable utopia.

  Abstract: A dense mythology surrounds the origins of Venice and its early development as a democratically inclined republic. This mythology was lovingly crafted by propagandists of the later regime, ably assisted by itinerant intellectuals, then and now, all keen to establish Venice as a republican exemplar for their own political purposes. Venice has a remarkable history. It is a rare example of an autonomous polity that survived for more than a millennium, from the barbarian invasions that presaged the fall of Rome at the start of the fifth century ce to the arrival of Napoleon in 1797, when the city surrendered<br>

  Author(s) Lyon Ann<br>
  Abstract: The English Parliament is the subject of much mythology, both in its origins and in its development. It is often suggested that prior to the Norman Conquest, rather than having government imposed from above, the English governed themselves through local assemblies often referred to as folk moots (Oman 1919). The best evidence for pre-Conquest folk moots comes from place names such as Thingwall on the Wirral peninsula, Merseyside, and a lost

Not defined simply as a co-ordinate on a map, home encompasses neighbourhoods, nations, traditions, customs, narrative, myth, the tangible, the imaginable, the dream, as well as each individual’s relation to Being. Home has relevance to all humans: despite its multifarious manifestations, our diverse relationships with home – whether positive, negative, or ambivalent – can be life-long and pervasive, creating and rekindling memories, inspiring desires and the imagination, shaping who we are, and how we relate to the Other.

  Book Title: Post-beur Cinema-North African Émigré and Maghrebi-French Filmmaking in France since 2000<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Higbee Will<br>
  Abstract: Since the early 1980s and the arrival of Beur cinema filmmakers of Maghrebi origin have made a key contribution French cinema's representation of issues such as immigration, integration and national identity. However, they have done so mostly from a position on the margins of the industry. In contrast, since the early 2000s, Maghrebi-French and North African émigré filmmakers have occupied an increasingly prominent position on both sides of the camera, announcing their presence on French screens in a wider range of genres and styles than ever before. This greater visibility and move to the mainstream has not, however, automatically meant that these films have lost any of the social or political relevance. Indeed in the 2000s many of these films have increasingly questioned the boundaries between national, transnational and diasporic cinema, whilst simultaneously demanding, either implicitly or explicitly, a reconsideration of the very difference that has traditionally been seen as a barrier to the successful integration of North African immigrants and their descendants into French society. Through a detailed study of this transformative decade for Maghrebi-French and North African émigré filmmaking in France, this book argues for the emergence of a 'Post-Beur' cinema in the 2000s that is simultaneously global and local in its outlook. Its key features include: A comprehensive overview of the key developments in Maghrebi-French and North African émigré filmmaking in France since the 2000s: counter-heritage cinema and the memorialisation of France’s colonial past; journey narratives and the myth of return; the ‘mainstreaming’ of Maghrebi-French directors and stars; representations of Islam. Detailed case studies of key films from the 2000s that have yet to receive scholarly attention, such as Hors-la-loi, Dernier maquis and Vénus noire. An in-depth analysis of trends in production, distribution and exhibition as they relate to Maghrebi-French and North African émigré filmmakers in the 2000s.<br>

Through the storytellers’ words, we experience the physical and emotional context of their work.

Street-level stories, like other narratives both grand and mundane, help us understand how sense and meaning are made and how norms are conveyed and enforced.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5149/9780807869864_shaikh">Sufi Narratives of Intimacy</a><br>
  Abstract: This chapter explores the ways in which Ibn ʿArabī’s propels the reader into a different realm of imagining gender by presenting powerful antinomian images of the feminine, sexuality, and women. I begin by examining his depictions of the divine feminine and his related claim that God is most perfectly witnessed in women. His argument is peppered by constant invocations and references to the deep existential intimacy between man and woman as reflected in the primordial myth of Adam and Eve’s creation. This leads us to examine Ibn ʿArabī’s ideas on sex and sexual intimacy between men and women and how<br>

  CHAPTER 1  Epic Traditions, Performers, and Audiences from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/j.ctt1wf4d5p">Storytelling in Siberia</a><br>
  Abstract: An oral epic tradition composed of alternating sections of narrative poetry and song, olonkho demonstrates many of the characteristics common to other epic narrative traditions that recount at length the adventures of legendary, historical, or mythical heroes surmounting the challenges facing them or their people.¹ The oldest known epic poem, the Babylonian
                  Epic of Gilgamesh, dates back to 1700 bce (Abusch 2001, 614). Homer’sIliadandOdysseycontinue this tradition in a poetic recounting of the events surrounding the Trojan War.² Today, epic poetry can be found in many countries, including India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, and Tibet, as well as<br>

  Abstract: “We moderns possess the concept but have lost sight of the plane of immanence….” (D. G. 1994: 104). All the foregoing is merely the development of the founding intuition, deductively effectuated by indigenous theoretical practice, of the mythology of the continent, which concerns a milieu that can rightly be called prehistorical (in the sense of the celebrated absolute past: the past that has never been present and which therefore is never past, while the present never ceases to pass), and that is defined by the ontological impenetrability of all the “insistents” populating and constituting this milieu—the templates and standards<br>

  Abstract: What becomes of the social memories of settler colonialism and white minority rule when the myth-laden, sociocultural world of their making lies in ruins?¹ The end of apartheid and the transition to parliamentary democracy triggered what amounted to a crisis of collective memory that left citizens of the “new South Africa” without the stable reference points necessary for building a shared sense of national identity. Pierre Nora captured a sense of this dilemma in his famous aphorism: “We speak so much of memory because there is so little of it left.”² What should be remembered and how? Where do old-fashioned<br>

  Abstract: Another way to approach the enigma of the meeting place is historically. Perhaps the reason why it is so difficult to reconcile its desirable properties with anything remotely suggested by contemporary urban space is that love of any kind is irreconcilable with enclosure. The meeting place inhabited by de Tocqueville’s contradictory crowd, at once hypersociable and neurotically individualistic, produces these dysfunctional social forms because it intensifies the oscillation between Lack and Plenty (which, in the Platonic myth, are the parents of Eros)—but what if Eros has different parents, or like the “bastard reasoning” associated with Pothos is ignorant of<br>

I thought the divagations through the forest of other people’s ideas would eventually bring me to a place where these different testimonies met. The mythological stories would at last yield a common pattern or motivation. Writing the book would be an act of seducing the readers, but I would remain in control: the shape of the outcome would be veiled—the labyrinth we have had to pass through, the burden of being heir to millennia of interpretation, was a kind of initiation, a Dantean reminder that<br>

  Book Title: Agitating Images-Photography against History in Indigenous Siberia<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Campbell Craig<br>
  Abstract: Agitating Imagesprovides a glimpse into the first moments of cultural engineering in remote areas of Soviet Siberia. The territories were perceived by outsiders to be on the margins of civilization, replete with shamanic rituals and inhabited by exiles, criminals, and "primitive" indigenous peoples. The Soviets hoped to permanently transform the mythologized landscape by establishing socialist utopian developments designed to incorporate minority cultures into the communist state. This book delves deep into photographic archives from these Soviet programs, but rather than using the photographs to complement an official history, Campbell presents them as anti-illustrations, or intrusions, that confound simple narratives of Soviet bureaucracy and power. Meant to agitate, these images offer critiques that cannot be explained in text alone and, in turn, put into question the nature of photographs as historical artifacts.<br>

  Abstract: Almost the greatest barrier to Australia’s spatial history is the date 1788. On the one side, anterior to and beyond the limits of Australian ‘history’, lies a hazy geo-historical tradition of surmise, a blank sea scored at intervals down the centuries by the prows of dug-outs, out-riggers and, latterly, three-masters; it is a ‘thick horizon’, a rewarding site of myth and speculation. But it lacks substance; cause and effect do not converge in its events, but spread out behind like the wake. After 1788, all is solid. Even the weather seems arrested.

                  [pharmakois]” useful in the generation of a republic are myths of humanity’s essential kinship, whereby citizens may be taught to “regard the other citizens as their brothers and children of the self-same earth.”¹ Let there be Enlightenment, said the creators of French republicanism, believing that the establishment of a more humane, revolutionary order depended upon the resurrection and secular conversion of an idea of social brotherhood associated with early Christianity.

  Abstract: The myth of the “country of the future,” which has governed the modern Brazilian imaginary, has inevitably entailed the gradual erasure of Portugal as a primary cultural point of reference. This myth is the result of a complex historical and cultural metamorphosis that started with the Christian utopian vision of the “earthly paradise” that was projected onto Brazil from the moment of the Portuguese arrival in 1500. Both mythical-utopian visions underscore the movement from a colonial to a postcolonial era, as well as the peculiar relationship between a weak (former) colonial power on the edge of Europe and the enormous<br>

  Abstract: Chapters 1 and 2 situate the reader within the currents of history and intellectual thought that have influenced the ideas of national identity for both Portugal and Brazil. Although the two nations are treated separately in each chapter in order to highlight individual particularities, comparative allusions are made in order to illustrate the ways Brazil and Portugal impinge upon each other’s respective national identity formation. Before embarking on the literary and philosophical discussions that will occupy all subsequent chapters (chapters 3 through 5), discussions that emphasize the notion of the weakening of the nationstate and its correlative myths or utopias<br>

  Abstract: During Carnaval, half-dressed women show their tanned bodies to the beat of the samba rhythm.

  Abstract: As we saw from the previous chapter, there are various ways in which ordinary people attempt to convert the state for social use via an idiom of privatization. This involves an elaborate discursive ensemble that includes urban myths and legends about negotiation of the public sphere, and the various practices of gift exchange by which people attempt to coalesce the scale of kinship and social ties with that of the bureaucratic state apparatus. I also noted the degree to which politicians attempt to conceptually assimilate the state to their own persons by appropriating tropes of culture heroism that have notions<br>

  Abstract: This chapter focuses on disability studies and the representation of disabled people in literature. In turning to such literary representations, I continue the methodological predisposition of reading literature for social analysis, further illustrating the kinds of theoretical calibrations central to the readings being expounded in this book. But here a difference in focus has to be noted from the outset. Whereas in the previous chapters the theoretical calibration had to do with aligning a discursive genre or paradigm (e.g., tragedy, urban myths, literature of the ex-centric) to a reading of various dimensions of the African postcolony, here the analysis centers<br>

  Abstract: DURING 1987 the Australian press reported frequently that Aboriginal art, especially Western Desert¹ acrylic “dot paintings,” had become flavor of the month in New York, Paris, and Munich. “Flavor of the month” is an odd descriptor Australians overuse to resolve the incompatibility of such reports of Australian success overseas with a cherished and characteristic myth of the second-rate, sometimes labeled “cultural cringe.” Indeed, Australia now has a suspiciously elaborate terminology for identifying the contradictions of colonialism and creativity.

  Abstract: An omnivoyant eye, a power from above, capable of encompassing by its constant gaze all life on earth and of simultaneously controlling and regulating with a most detailed perfection the existence of individuals, animals, plants, machines, institutions placed under its inspection: the myth of an omnivoyant and omnipotent center of surveillance has persisted, from Christian mystics of the late Middle Ages to nineteenth-century liberal utilitarians, from technocratic fictions (Orwell’s
                  1984) to some of the most recent global governance and planetary sustainability utopias (late-twentieth-century environmentalism). Jeremy Bentham first formulated¹ the myth and, later, Michel Foucault theorized it as a panoptic society.²<br>

  Author(s) Gragnolati Manuele<br>
  Abstract: One of the reasons Dante’s magnum opus is called a “comedy” is its use of a comic register as the leading one. This choice forms the basis of the poem’s capability to encompass reality in all its spectra and to combine, for instance, myth with fragments of everyday life and chronicle, theoretical speculation with personal issues and political tirades, sublime love poetry with debased language, mystical ardor with spiteful irony. Like life or history, Dante’s

For American psychiatrists and many psychotherapists, this means we should use the “five-of-nine” rule and similar rules announced in the DSM-IV, the bible of psychiatry.

  Abstract: The Inka Empire stretched over much of the length and breadth of the South American Andes, encompassed elaborately planned cities linked by a complex network of roads and messengers, and created astonishing works of architecture and artistry and a compelling mythology-all without the aid of a graphic writing system. Instead, the Inkas' records consisted of devices made of knotted and dyed strings-called khipu-on which they recorded information pertaining to the organization and history of their empire. Despite more than a century of research on these remarkable devices, the khipu remain largely undeciphered.<br>

Finally it evokes the devouring mouth of the grave, the sepulcher that swallows every beautiful person and thing (in Latin,

  Abstract: In keeping with what was announced in the title to these studies, we have not set out to provide an exhaustive account of the relationship between myth, metaphor, and logos; we purport only to exemplify a particular manner of questioning, a particular analytic approach. This admission of the modesty of our enterprise is even more pertinent, perhaps, to the complex field of 
                  transitions from metaphors to concepts, which we will now attempt to contour with reference to the paradigm of ‘verisimilitude’, ‘truthlikeness’, or ‘probability’ [Wahrscheinlichkeit].¹ In this case, the metaphor has been absorbed by the word; although it has been<br>

  Book Title: The Aesthetics of Antichrist-From Christian Drama to Christopher Marlowe<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): PARKER JOHN<br>
  Abstract: The Antichrist myth in particular tells of an impostor turned prophet: performing Christ's life, he reduces the godhead to a special effect yet in so doing foretells the real second coming. Medieval audiences, as well as Marlowe's, could evidently enjoy the constant confusion between true Christianity and its empty look-alikes for that very reason: mimetic degradation anticipated some final, as yet deferred revelation. Mere theater was a necessary prelude to redemption. The versions of the myth we find in Marlowe and earlier drama actually approximate, John Parker argues, a premodern theory of the redemptive effect of dramatic representation itself. Crossing the divide between medieval and Renaissance theater while drawing heavily on New Testament scholarship, Patristics, and research into the apocrypha,
      The Aesthetics of Antichristproposes a wholesale rereading of pre-Shakespearean drama.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt14brrn7">A Companion to the Works of Johann Gottfried Herder</a><br>
  Author(s) Gaier Ulrich<br>
  Abstract: Contrary to the widespread prejudices that the eighteenth century, being a period of rational enlightenment, was an “extremely barren epoch for research in mythology”¹ and that the call for New Mythology toward the end of the century signaled an anti-rational criticism of enlightenment,² myth plays a central role as early as in the works of Christian Wolff (1679–1754) and Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten (1714–1762), protagonists of German Enlightenment philosophy. They represent, to a certain extent, the two traditions of the mythical mode of thinking,³ which can be linked, respectively, to Plato (427–347 B.C.) and Aristotle (384–322 B.C.).<br>

  Abstract: Writing in 1982, the photographer and curator Janos Frecot claimed that “die Stunde Null in ihrer Offenheit scheint aktueller denn je” (the Zero Hour in its openness seems more urgently contemporary than ever).¹ If, given the manifold continuities in societal and political structures that followed the end of the war, particularly in West Germany, the caesura of the “Zero Hour” (or “Stunde Null”) is a myth rather than a historical fact, its value as the emblem of a missed opportunity was nevertheless something that was invoked, as here by Frecot, in attempting to imagine an alternative German society.

  Book Title: Luis de Góngora and Lope de Vega-Masters of Parody<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): KERR LINDSAY G.<br>
  Abstract: Co-Winner of the 2014 Publication Prize awarded by the Association of Hispanists of Great Britain and Ireland Kerr traces the processes and paradoxes at work in the late parodic poetry of Luis de Góngora and Lope de Vega, illuminating the correlations and connections between two poets who have more often than not been presented as enemies.The analysis follows the parallel development of the complex parodic genre through Góngora's late mythological parody, from his 1589 Hero and Leander romance through to his culminating parody, La fábula de Píramo y Tisbe (1618) and Lope de Vega's alter ego Tomé de Burguillos, whose anthology, Rimas humanas y divinas del licenciado Tomé de Burguillos, was published a year before Lope's death, in 1634. Working from the premise that parody provides a Derridean supplément to exhausted, dominant genres (e.g. pastoral, lyric, epic), this study asks: what do these texts achieve by their supplementarity, and how do they achieve it?, and, the overarching question, why do these erudite poets turn to parody in an age of decline? Lindsay Kerr received her PhD in Spanish at Queen's University Belfast.<br>

  Abstract: La fábula de Píramo y Tisbe(1618) is, in the vein of Góngora’s Hero and Leander poems, a ludic expansion of a myth whose classical origins (Ovid’sMetamorphoses) and enduring popularity draw our poet like a moth to a flame. The 508 verses ofPíramo y Tisbetell the tale of two young lovers whose only original mode of communication is through a chink in the wall between their adjoining houses, although Góngora invents an African maid (‘fatal carabela’, v. 137) who ferries notes between them. The two agree to meet at the tomb of Ninus; however, a mountain lion,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt1t6p5zq">Luis de Góngora and Lope de Vega</a><br>
  Abstract: The parodic poetry written by Luis de Góngora and Lope de Vega at the end of their professional careers and in the winter of their years unquestionably brings forth something new, built from the bricks of ancient and contemporary poetic monuments. These poets utilise parody as a process that, paradoxically, ends and begins simultaneously in order to engage with the literary past, question its legacy, and redirect future poetics. Góngora’s mytho-parodic trajectory and comic culmination, and Lope’s final theatrical extravaganza as Tomé de Burguillos, reveal a wealth of common practices. Primarily, against the traditional critical tendency to pit our authors<br>

In examining the cultural and social myths surrounding women’s role in Spanish society, Aldecoa deconstructs traditional patriarchal paradigms and offers a new, more complex understanding of women’s identity, free from existing hierarchical and binary structures. This rejection of the patriarchal system that pervades the fabric of Western culture is further extended by Aldecoa in her depiction of the Civil War and<br>

  Abstract: The theorists and writers who have tried to define and categorise magical realism have been keen to distinguish the mode of writing from fairy tales and other well-known vehicles for the fantastic and miraculous. Flores (1995, 115–16) writes: ‘the practitioners of magical realism cling to reality as if to prevent ‘literature’ from getting in their way, as if to prevent their myth from flying off, as in fairy tale to supernatural realms’. Leal likewise strives to separate magical realism from the common fantastical genres: ‘magical realism cannot be identified either with fantastic literature or with psychological literature, or with<br>

  Abstract: Histories are never just neutral accounts of the past. Rather, past events are selected, shaped, and linked into narratives that are told in order to make sense of, and give meaning to, the present. Individuals, families, religious communities, political parties, and other groups use them as vehicles to communicate how they arrived where they are, how they want to be seen and understood. Above all, the cultural construction of these narratives, understood in the broadest possible sense, is one of the central planks in the formation of national identity, the collective myth-making which so often essentializes the otherwise contingent nation-state.<br>

Are there times and places on which tragic thinking can have no purchase? If so, is our anti-mythic age of science and reason, of democracy and rapid technological progress an era unsuited to tragic art?

  Author(s) Dvorak Marta<br>
  Abstract: According to Northrop Frye, English-Canadian literature is marked by a five-century-long oscillation between the romantic tendency, on the one hand, moving in the direction of myth and metaphor and their formulaic units, and the realistic tradition, on the other hand, moving in the opposite direction, displacing or adjusting such improbable formulas so as to produce verisimilitude (Frye 1976, 36–37). English-Canadian cultural production can thus be situated at opposite extremes. In the period between 1918 and 1967, a large part is grounded in the themes and motifs of the folktale, in the structures of the mythopoeic or marvelous, and in<br>

  Abstract: While at the beginning of the twentieth century literary theory and criticism had been busy tackling the question of whether there was a genuinely Canadian literature at all, a new cultural self-awareness arose in the late 1950s. As internationally Canada was poised between the traditional model of Great Britain and the overwhelming cultural, economic, and political influence of the United States, cultural unity and self-confidence in its own literary and cultural achievements developed slowly. Unlike the United States, Canada lacked founding myths and master narratives that could be applied to the nation as a whole because of the intranational dualism<br>

  Author(s) Gerhardt Uta<br>
  Abstract: The relationship between Talcott Parsons’s scholarship and Max Weber’s classic thought has been debated in two recent contexts in American sociology. According to one viewpoint, Parsons’s thought can be traced back to genuinely American intellectual origins, and was not, under Weber’s influence, “made in Germany,” incorporating the often-invoked Heidelberg myth in the 1920s—as some European disciples, including me, are said to assume (Camic, chapter 12, this volume). The other view stemmed from an anti-Parsonian impetus in the early 1970s, when three authors claimed to be preserving Weber’s greatness as they attempted to “de-Parsonize Weber” (Cohen, Hazelrigg, and Pope 1975a).¹<br>

The present volume focuses on the divergence between Western and Eastern evolution, on the different relationship of learned demonology to popular belief systems in the two parts of Europe. It discusses the conflict of saints, healers, seers, shamans with the representatives of evil; the special function of escorting, protecting, possessing, harming and healing spirits; the role of the dead, the ghosts, of pre-Christian, Jewish and Christian spirit-world, the antagonism of the devil and the saint.<br>

Author(s): Duranti Alessandro<br>
Abstract: Ahearn, always a perceptive writer, brings out a fear that many linguistic anthropologists have but rarely expressthe fear of being assimilated to sociocultural anthropology and thus losing their identity through the forfeiting of their specificity. This is the flip side of William Labovs original wish that sociolinguistics might disappear once linguistics agreed to see language as a social phenomenon (that this has not happened is both an indictment of linguistics narrowmindedness and a validation of Labovs and other sociolinguists efforts to develop sociolinguistics into a vibrant independent field). The question then arises why we should worry about being assimilated. Shouldnt we, on the contrary, welcome such a possibility, to be seen as a validation of our work or as the mainstreaming of our concerns? The problem is not in the future, which cannot be predicted, but in the past. Everything we know from our earlier experiences warns us that an anthropology without a distinct group of language specialists is likely to be an anthropology with a nave understanding of communication. We have seen it happen already. When anthropology departments decide not to have a linguistic subfield, thinking that they dont need one, their students tend to take language for granted, identifying it with a vague notion of discourse. It is for this reason that we need to sharpen our historical, theoretical, and methodological understanding of what it means to study language as culture. We owe it first to our students.<br>

Author(s): Juillerat Bernard<br>
Abstract: Doctrine and method, theory and interpretation are not necessarily coordinate. Were such coordination possible, a metacritical stance would be required. By accepting uncritically the presuppositions that lie behind psychoanalytic metapsychology, Juillerat abrogates, in my view, ethnological responsibility, that is, the responsibility to measure in a receptive manner the presuppositions of ones hermeneutic against those of the culture one is studying. Though his attention to ethnographic detail leads Juillerat to refine psychoanalytic doctrine, it confirms the epistemological and hermeneutic assumptions of that doctrine (e.g., notions of the unconscious, id, ego, and superego, drives, repression, and, indeed, psychic space). Yafar myth and ritual as he presents them become allegories of that doctrineallegories, I would argue, of allegories. There would appear to be no escape, were it not for the Yafar voices that sound through Juillerats psychoanalytically predetermined presentations. (He offers us almost no contextualized verbatim texts in these essays, though he does in his monographs.) They remind us that, as LviStrauss demonstrated, myths are readily translated one into another, particularly when they are decontextualized. What is of ethnographic, indeed, psychoanalytic import is howand perhaps whytranslation is arrested and a particular myth (e.g., the Oedipal tale) becomes so authoritative that it has the power of promiscuous reduction. Though fascinated by the range of Yafar cultural expression, Juillerat fails to consider the implications of Yafars refusal to reduce their corpus of mythology and ritual to a single mytha singular ritual.<br>

Abstract: This idea of the deliberate recovery of theological tensions by crossing religious boundaries can be understood in terms of the ecumenical concept of the complementarity of conflicting doctrinal formulations. Opposing doctrinal formulations are regarded as complementary expressions of a theological truth so profound as to be irreducible to any single formulation. For the ecumenical use of the complementarity concept, see, e.g., Avery Dulles, “Paths to Doctrinal Agreement: Ten Theses,”

Abstract: For the notion of strategic essentialism, see Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, “Subaltern Studies: Deconstructing Historiography,” in her
            The Spivak Reader, 214–21. Serene Jones has drawn attention to the fact that the poststructuralist theoretical assumptions about the always oppressive nature of binarisms do not necessarily hold up under the pressures of concrete political struggles and that, in order to strengthen the bond of solidarity for a coalition of diverse social and cultural identities, what is called for is some kind of grand narrative that clearly defines the powers to be resisted and dismantled. I think this applies to a coalition of different religious identities as well.

Abstract: Nevertheless, empiricism does not have the last word—it perhaps never has the last word, not even in what might be called “positivist empiricism,” and certainly not in practical theology, as this discipline is characterized by the interaction between empiricism and normativeness. We both share this conviction—the fifth characteristic. Therefore human rights—no matter how contested they are, which is neither surprising nor extraordinary—offer an important perspective, as the normative criteria they embody always require critical and constructive reflection. In the last part of the article I have even presented them as regulative principles of truth and justice, as a result of which they offer a kind of worldview‐related and morality‐related infrastructure for the social institutions that determine human actions in societal and personal life—the sixth characteristic. After all, for both Browning and me the ultimate issue is—the seventh characteristic—the vitality of the Christian tradition in terms of relevance and identity in the context of a multicivilization society.<br>

Abstract: My encounter with this student suggests another way of thinking about the political value of rewriting. Countering all the more blasé signals my students were giving me that it was most naive to think the retelling of stories from another point of view could have any political impact, it is evidence that women’s rewritings of classic texts can still affect young women, still make them think and make them want to contribute to the discussions, the debates that shape the public sphere. Although we need, of course, to factor in serendipity—the student was on holiday and thought she had discovered a little‐known book when in fact it was a
      New York Timesbest seller—there is definitely a sense in which her discovery marked a moment in her life and signals the development of a feminist consciousness (broadly defined as a certain awareness of gender identity combined with a critical position in respect to misogyny and patriarchy and a conviction that things can be changed). There is no denying that increasing individualization at all levels of society has caused the loss of a sense of collective action and political projects. This is equally true for ideas of improvement, emancipation, and modernization, the responsibility of which has largely been shifted to the individual, whose “human rights,” as Bauman argues, are redefined as “the right of individuals to stay different and to pick and choose at will their own models of happiness and fitting life‐style” (2000;2005, 29). In this deregulated and privatized sociopolitical context that knows no common cause, re‐vision can only fail to formulate enabling fictions for a better future for all. Yet in its capacity to speak to individuals, it can still draw them into visions of community and collectivity. Re‐vision may thus not be the lifeline that is to haul us out of patriarchy any more, but as a structure of address that engages readers into contemplating differences, it remains one of the ways in which we keep sane and critical and thinking, moved by the stories of long‐forgotten lives into participating in an open public sphere.<br>

ROSEMARY MITCHELL University of Leeds J. G. A. POCocK. [[END 06A00070]] [[START 06A00080]] Barbarism and Religion: Volume Three, The First Decline and Fall. New York: Cam- bridge University Press. 2003. Pp. xiii, 527. $60.00. In reviewing for this journal the first two volumes of J. G. A. Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters. Gibbon's readers had to wait until 1781 for the story to pick up again. Exposition of this "first decline and fall" in fact occupies only the last hundred pages of Pocock's volume and therefore serves as both a climax to the Pocockian story so far, and a bridge to the next volume. Volume one of Barbarism and Religion situated Gibbon intellectually within a number of different European "Enlightenments"; volume two located him on a different axis, among the various writers of "narratives of civil government" in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. (We are still missing the parallel vector running through ecclesiastical histori- ography, although Eusebius, Augustine, Orosius, and Otto of Freising figure prominently here. Christianity only begins to signal its importance with chapter fifteen of Gibbon; where he used ecclesiastical author- ities, up to that point, it was to document civil rather than sacred history.) Volume three moves in a third, diachronic dimension, tracing the transformations of key themes, in particular the idea of "decline and fall" itself, from very ancient origins up to the Scot Adam Ferguson's Progress and Termination of the Roman Republic (which appeared seven years after Gibbon's first volume and is thus offered for comparison rather than direct influence). The flight of concepts and motifs is dizzying, the lengthy quotations apposite, and as with the previous volumes, one can scarcely miss a sentence without losing a nuance or a parenthetical qualification. The theme of decline and fall, which informs the conception and beginning of Gibbon's book, would eventually yield to "barbarism and reli- gion" as its principal causes in later volumes (along with over-taxation, which Gibbon mentions at the close of chapter fourteen). But behind that idea, which only gradually emerged from Polybian political cycles via medieval notions of the translatio imperii, lay much else, including sequential recognitions of crucial turn- ing points in Roman history going back to Gracchan land reforms in the late second century B.C.E. The core problem, historiographically, remains how to explain why Gibbon, committed from an early stage to a Tacitean narrative, chose to begin his account not with the Julio-Claudians but instead at the "Antonine moment" of imperial zenith achieved by Trajan. (As he once did with cinquecento Florence, Pocock inclines to define major turning points or episodes, both historical and intellectual, in terms of "moments"-a historical Constantinean and historiographical Zosiman moment lie ahead, and the Machiavellian version even puts in a cameo appearance when this volume reaches the early eighteenth century.) Gibbon knew intimately the char- acter of Augustan rule and the flaws of the late republic; he had read his Sallust as well as Tacitus. The later imperial historians, especially Appian of Alexan- dria and Ammianus Marcellinus, also figure in this account as historians of decline, but of a decline that takes a great deal of time-all the way to the "Illyrian" recovery of the late third century-really to become unmistakeable. The subjects confronted by Gibbon's nearly two millennia of predecessors include the military problem of restless troops settling in an empire that has con- quered all its rivals and closed itself off from further expansion; the civic conflict between virtue and cor- ruption (or rather, the way in which virtue leads to military conquest and empire, which in turn produce an oriental softness); the role of the soldiers in making emperors and especially the legions' realization, in the Year of Four Emperors (68/69 C.E.), that emperors could be made "elsewhere than Rome"; the place of the Augustinian-Orosian "two cities" view of history; the vicissitudes in republicanism (an issue revived in the fifteenth century by Leonardi Bruni, who as a non-Roman concerned mainly with Florence was able to see the empire's longue duree for the first time as declinatio rather than translatio and to initiate, though not complete, a gradual transition in historiography from the latter to the former); and the extension of citizenship to the provinces, along, soon, with the capacity of provincials to be proclaimed emperor. All of these streams converge, not entirely satisfactorily AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 470 APRIL 2004 [[END 06A00080]] [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility. This volume is every bit as persuasive as its prede- cessors and, perhaps because it is as much recit as the others were peintures, it is also rather more compelling a read. More than the first two volumes of his work, volume three of Barbarism and Religion leaves one hanging; like Gibbon and his first readers, we are only at the Milvian Bridge, pondering what will follow with Constantine. One hopes that, unlike those readers, we will not have to wait five years for the next episode. DANIEL WOOLF University of Alberta [[END 06A00080]] [[START 06A00090]] LAWRENCE W. MCBRIDE, editor. Reading Irish Histories: Texts, Contexts, and Memory in Modem Ireland. Port- land, Oreg.: Four Courts Press. 2003. Pp. 233. $55.00. The final essay of this collection closes with the following sentiment from Sean Farrell Moran: "Like Socrates and Plato who stood firmly against the influ- ence of myth in Athenian democracy, academic histo- rians will step in to attempt to correct the misconcep- tions of Irish citizens" (p. 218). In the previous essay, one such "academic historian," Ben Novick, stepped into the breach in the following fashion: "Writing, as discussed throughout this book, is a primary means of disseminating information" (p. 211). Socrates and Plato have indeed met their match. It is perhaps unfortunate that this collection, edited by Lawrence W. McBride, closes with one of the most arrogant pieces of scholarship that I have ever had the displeasure of reading. The conceit of the comparison quoted above, and the condescension of statements such as "Perhaps we should pity the peasants. They made the mistake of remembering their past incor- rectly" and "The common Irish man and woman must then be re-educated about Ireland's past and abandon their memories" (p. 218), make it difficult to commend the essay as a fine conclusion to an exceptional book. One can only hope that Moran is trying to be ironic. But it would be unfair to condemn this book on the basis of one author's misguided faith in the powers of the "academic historian." Indeed, the book, although most worthy at times, has enough problems without that. The intention of the collection is clearly estab- lished in the editor's preface: to "examine how a variety of historical narratives were delivered through the written word, but with special attention paid to how readers might have reacted to these texts" (p. 13). The difficulty is that the reader is the one consistent absentee from the essays that follow. From Paul Townend's chapter on the reading rooms of the na- tional movements of the late nineteenth century to Novick's chapter on the newspaper of the Irish Volun- teers, the reader is little more than a shadowy figure. Even the most basic details are ignored; there is no attempt to estimate circulation figures for books or newspapers. Anne Kane's attempts at "reconstructing" (p. 46) what a newspaper reader during the land war might have felt amounts to little more than an essay in speculative sociology. Paul Ricoeur and Clifford Geertz seem to get more attention than the actual people who "may have" (p. 46) and "could well have" (p. 56) responded to the newspapers examined. It also seems unlikely that any farmer facing eviction could have conceived of the land war as a "ritual process" (p. 45). But Kane's essay is not the only one at fault in this fashion. The extent of the readers' absence almost begs one to question why the editor made such a particular point of drawing "special attention" to the reader at all. This is not a fault particular to this book or to these essays. Beyond specific accounts by a reader reacting to a text, which in turn have all the inherent linguistic and interpretative pitfalls of any other text, there are very few ways to interpret the readers' response to any type of narrative. Timothy McMahon is one of the few authors in this collection who actually quotes from the men and women who attended the Gaelic Summer Colleges that he examines. His essay is one of the collection's most valuable as a result. Colin Barr's piece on university education, again valuable in its factual content, has nothing to say about the students or how the changes in the universities effected them AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 471 APRIL 2004 [[END 06A00090]]<br>

More than the first two volumes of his work, volume three of Barbarism and Religion leaves one hanging; like Gibbon and his first readers, we are only at the Milvian Bridge, pondering what will follow with Constantine. One hopes that, unlike those readers, we will not have to wait five years for the next episode. DANIEL WOOLF University of Alberta [[END 06A00080]] [[START 06A00090]] LAWRENCE W. MCBRIDE, editor. Reading Irish Histories: Texts, Contexts, and Memory in Modem Ireland. Port- land, Oreg.: Four Courts Press. 2003. Pp. 233. $55.00. The final essay of this collection closes with the following sentiment from Sean Farrell Moran: "Like Socrates and Plato who stood firmly against the influ- ence of myth in Athenian democracy, academic histo- rians will step in to attempt to correct the misconcep- tions of Irish citizens" (p. 218). In the previous essay, one such "academic historian," Ben Novick, stepped into the breach in the following fashion: "Writing, as discussed throughout this book, is a primary means of disseminating information" (p. 211). Socrates and Plato have indeed met their match. It is perhaps unfortunate that this collection, edited by Lawrence W. McBride, closes with one of the most arrogant pieces of scholarship that I have ever had the displeasure of reading. The conceit of the comparison quoted above, and the condescension of statements such as "Perhaps we should pity the peasants. They made the mistake of remembering their past incor- rectly" and "The common Irish man and woman must then be re-educated about Ireland's past and abandon their memories" (p. 218), make it difficult to commend the essay as a fine conclusion to an exceptional book. One can only hope that Moran is trying to be ironic. But it would be unfair to condemn this book on the basis of one author's misguided faith in the powers of the "academic historian." Indeed, the book, although most worthy at times, has enough problems without that. The intention of the collection is clearly estab- lished in the editor's preface: to "examine how a variety of historical narratives were delivered through the written word, but with special attention paid to how readers might have reacted to these texts" (p. 13). The difficulty is that the reader is the one consistent absentee from the essays that follow. From Paul Townend's chapter on the reading rooms of the na- tional movements of the late nineteenth century to Novick's chapter on the newspaper of the Irish Volun- teers, the reader is little more than a shadowy figure. Even the most basic details are ignored; there is no attempt to estimate circulation figures for books or newspapers. Anne Kane's attempts at "reconstructing" (p. 46) what a newspaper reader during the land war might have felt amounts to little more than an essay in speculative sociology. Paul Ricoeur and Clifford Geertz seem to get more attention than the actual people who "may have" (p. 46) and "could well have" (p. 56) responded to the newspapers examined. It also seems unlikely that any farmer facing eviction could have conceived of the land war as a "ritual process" (p. 45). But Kane's essay is not the only one at fault in this fashion. The extent of the readers' absence almost begs one to question why the editor made such a particular point of drawing "special attention" to the reader at all. This is not a fault particular to this book or to these essays. Beyond specific accounts by a reader reacting to a text, which in turn have all the inherent linguistic and interpretative pitfalls of any other text, there are very few ways to interpret the readers' response to any type of narrative. Timothy McMahon is one of the few authors in this collection who actually quotes from the men and women who attended the Gaelic Summer Colleges that he examines. His essay is one of the collection's most valuable as a result. Colin Barr's piece on university education, again valuable in its factual content, has nothing to say about the students or how the changes in the universities effected them AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 471 APRIL 2004 [[END 06A00090]] [[START 06A00090]] Reviews of Books and Films and their learning. The academic career of one Galway student, H. Fitzwalter Kirker, is traced in its entirety, but only in a footnote. The reader gets at least something approximating a lifeline in the piece by McBride on the young reader and the teaching and learning of Irish history. That "young people are by nature curious" (p. 114), however, seems an inade- quate point on which to hang a conclusion. The book is at its strongest in the essays by Jose Lanters and Gregory Castle, which focus on the work of T. W. Rolleston and Standish O'Grady, respectively. Both historians are examined in the context of their contemporaries; both essays actually attempt to fulfill the claims they make for themselves in their opening pages. The same cannot be said, however, for Eileen Reilly's piece on J. A. Froude. Its bland rehearsal of his life is punctuated with references to his visits to Ireland and quotations from some of his more offen- sive diatribes on the Irish people. She offers little or no comment on the bigotry that billowed forth from his pen. For example, one is told of Froude's dislike for Daniel O'Connell but not the reason why. Novick's piece on the military education of the Irish Volunteers begins with an interesting description, but it is rather disappointing thereafter. Although the material is fascinating, the author's conclusions are not. At one point, he deduces that "The pattern of military education seen in the Irish Volunteer and the Workers' Republic lends weight to the idea of the Rising as blood sacrifice, since the key strategist, Joseph Plunkett, never wrote military columns for the Irish Volunteer" (p. 198). At no point does it occur to Novick that the rebels might not have printed their plans in the paper because letting the authorities in Dublin Castle know in advance was not really part of the plan. How useful, indeed, is an examination of the Irish Volunteer's role in the training of the rebels when even the author concedes that details of training on urban insurrection were "left to the writers of the Workers' Republic" (p. 210); when the author gives approximately nine lines of consideration to what he adjudges to be the more important source? Through- out there is little sense of the eye of Dublin Castle watching over what was published and curtailing what could be written. This is a worthy but a frustrating book. There is a lot of value in each essay in terms of the material that is brought to light, but there is also the crushing weight of the artificial framework under which the essays are forced to labor. Like Froude, it is perhaps this book's "portion in life to please no one faction" (p. 140). ANNE DOLAN Trinity College Dublin [[END 06A00090]] [[START 06A00100]] COLIN NEWBURY. Patrons, Clients, and Empire: Chief- taincy and Over-Rule in Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. New York: Oxford University Press. 2003. Pp. xii, 328. $72.00. It is a brave historian nowadays who admits that his or her current academic preoccupations began in the 1950s, but an unrepentant Colin Newbury tells us that imperial history at Oxford University is peculiarly marked by continuity. He says that literary theory has dominated the study of discourse for too long (al- though presumably not at Oxford), and it is time to get back to the study of political discourse using the time-honored model of patron-client relations. Drawing on his extensive knowledge of African and Pacific imperial history, with the addition of material on South and Southeast Asia, Newbury presents a well researched and cogently argued case for the persis- tence of precolonial clientage networks in certain British and French colonies. Patron-client modeling was refined by social scientists in the 1960s and 1970s, when it became a useful way of explaining why inde- pendence had brought relatively little change to the administrative systems of former colonies. That polit- ical and economic relations in some colonies can be analyzed effectively using this theory is clear; whether the exercise speaks to wider debates about empire is another question. The omission of colonies of settle- ment, along with almost all of the Portuguese, Dutch, and German empires, weakens the case considerably. Newbury draws on a wide, although extremely selec- tive, range of secondary literature to supplement his own research, wisely conceding that authors may not like the use he makes of their material. He feels no need to address the epistemological and methodolog- ical concerns raised by authors whose work he mines for empirical detail. He excludes pioneering cross- disciplinary studies, such as Jean and John Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution (1991) and Nicholas Thomas, Colonialism's Culture: Anthropology, Travel and Government (1994), which have done so much to shape current debates in postcolonial anthropology. Newbury calls for more interaction between social scientists and historians, but he does surprisingly little to encourage it. If patron-client brokerage really is the best model, Newbury should be able to tackle other theories with confidence, demonstrating their inade- quacies through constructive engagement. Instead he revives battles won long ago, such as the critique of "collaboration" and "indirect rule" analysis. There are still some historians who work with these terms, but far more interesting is the much larger number of scholars tackling more recent debates. This book's contribution to imperial historiography is therefore difficult to assess. Newbury hopes that it will help to determine whether imperial rule suc- ceeded or failed "in 'preparing' [its colonies] for the exigencies and responsibilities of devolved govern- ment" (p. viii). One wonders whether this is still a pressing question, however. It has been a long time since independence for many of the countries Newbury discusses. Scholars posing broader questions about colonialism's legacy will wonder about the cost of Newbury's ruthlessly exclusive approach.

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] I wish to thank the editors of the AHR, first, for inviting me to consider the issues in this essay, second, for the helpful comments of Acting Editor Jeffrey Wasserstrom, and, third, for the quite stimulating commentary of several anonymous reviewers. 1 See Eric Foner, ed., The New American History (Philadelphia, 1990); Foner, ed., The New American History, rev. and expanded edn.

Beard.4 But during the 1970s, the claims being made for a national mind or culture were challenged by social historians. Intellectual history was chastened and transformed by the confrontation with social history. Eschewing their former embrace of synthesis, intellectual historians pulled back to study more precisely defined themes and thinkers.5 Not only intellectual history but other subfields accommodated social history's provocation to rethink conventional gen- eralizations. In addition, a professional, even "social-scientific," concern for precision and specificity of reference collaborated-sometimes with forethought, often not-with a sharpened awareness of difference and conflict that came from social movements outside the academy to undermine older composite narratives. Neither the frame supplied by Charles and Mary Beard in The Rise of American Civilization (1927), with its dramatic narrative of conflict between the "people" and the "interests," nor the consensual pluralism that succeeded that interpretation in the 1950s survived.6 If the consensus historians underplayed conflict, the Beards' approach, for all of its sympathy for the dispossessed, was found to be inadequate as well. Their narrative revealed little feel for the diversity of Americans, and it paid scant attention to non-whites. Most important of all, while their narrative voice was sympathetic, one did not discover the quotidian life or hear the voices of those groups that have found voice in more recent historiography. Judged by newer historiographical expectations, The Rise of American Civilization seemed "thin," compared with the increasingly popular "thick" description that was built, in part, on the enormously influential anthropological work of Clifford Geertz.7 In the past quarter century, there has been a proliferation of exciting new research, much of it bringing previously overlooked or explicitly excluded groups and events into the light of history. The number and variety of American stories multiplied. Suddenly, there were histories where there had been none or where the available histories had not been attended to by professional historians: histories of African Americans in the era of slavery and beyond; of Native Americans; of workers at home in their communities, at work, and at play; of women at home and outside of the home and of gender relations more generally; of consumption as well as production; of ethnic minorities and "borderlands"; of popular culture and other "marginal" forms of cultural production; of objects and material culture; of whites and whiteness as historical subjects; of non-state international and intercultural relations; and much more. [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 4Frederick Jackson Turner never completed a major synthesis, but one can see how he might have done that work in his posthumously published The United States, 1830-1850 (New York, 1935); Charles A. Beard and Mary R. Beard, The Rise of American Civilization (1927; 2 volumes in 1, New York, 1930).. In fact, the Beards participated in this shift with the publication of The American Spirit: A Study of the Idea of Civilization in the United States (New York, 1942). 5 For an early anticipation of this development-from the point of view of intellectual history-see Lawrence Veysey, "Intellectual History and the New Social History," in Paul K. Conkin and John Higham, eds., New Directions in American Intellectual History (Baltimore, Md., 1979), 3-26. See also, in the same volume, David A.

These developments were occurring at a moment when the number of American historians was expanding to an unprecedented degree. Disciplinary expansion both allowed and prompted increased specialization. And that worried some, who began to speak of hyperspecialization and fragmentation. The structure of specialization derived in large part from the impact of a social history that often fused the group-based particularity of focus with ideological commitments to class and identity-based social movements. This pattern of work discouraged the integration of particular histories into some kind of synthesis.8 Traditionalists, perhaps not surprisingly, were unnerved by these develop- ments.9 But even some proponents of the newer history worried. Early on, Herbert G. Gutman, one of the leading figures in the movement to write a history that included all Americans and that recognized differences-class, ethnic, racial, gender-was concerned that instead of enriching and enlarging the usable history of the United States, the new scholarship was failing to do that, perhaps making it in fact less usable. The "new social history," he wrote in the introduction to his collection of pioneering essays in the field, "suffers from a very limiting overspe- cialization." Take an Irish-born Catholic female textile worker and union organizer in Fall River involved in a disorderly strike in 1875. She might be the subject of nearly a dozen sub-specializations, which would, he feared, "wash out the wholeness that is essential to understanding human behavior."10 Later, in the wake of a national meeting of writers at which historians and history seemed to be largely ignored in discussions of the political and cultural situation in the aftermath of Richard Nixon, Gutman mused aloud in the pages of The Nation over whether the failure of historians to incorporate social history's findings into a new synthesis had seriously diminished, even evacuated, history's possible contribution to public debate."1 In the mid-1980s, in what turned out to be a controversial pair of articles, I raised a related question: how might one construct the (to my mind) needed synthesis of recent historiography on the United States.12 There was considerable negative reaction to those articles, coming from two different positions.

These arguments were equated with a carelessness about scholarly rigor.13 The other, and more widespread position, focused on the risks of a national narrative itself. It was evidently feared that such a narrative would, by definition, re-exclude those groups and themes that had so recently been brought under the umbrella of history and would re-inscribe a "master narrative" dominated by white, elite males.14 By the end of the 1980s, however, the question of synthesis had become less controversial. The issue became more practical, more professional in some sense: how to do it and how to do it within the parameters of inclusion that had been central to the discussion from the beginning. It was on this note that Alice Kessler-Harris, the author of the chapter on social history in The New American History (1990 edition), addressed the question. In the last section of her essay, with the section title of "The Problem of Synthesis," she acknowledged the problem and explored various possible ways to overcome "fragmentation" and move toward synthesis.15 A different issue emerged in the 1990s. Poststructuralist literary and cultural theory, sometimes broadly and even more vaguely characterized as postmodernism, was and is suspicious of any aspiration toward a comprehensive narrative. It is to this body of theory that we owe the commonplace use and misuse of the epithet "master narrative."16 These theories have been rather slow to penetrate workaday historical practice among American historians. Levels and types of awareness of them vary: from shocked indignation at the whole idea, to vague awareness and thoughtless dismissal, to intellectual fascination largely in isolation from the making of one's own histories. In his recent book, Beyond the Great Story: History as Text and Discourse (1995), Robert Berkhofer seeks to force more attention to these issues. Insistently, but not always consistently, he urges historians to recognize the dimensions of the postmodern crisis that surrounds them. He seems more interested in sounding the alarm about the quicksand before us than in guiding us [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 13 Eric H.

But either way, he intends to challenge the very possibility of narrative synthesis.17 While these worries, proposals, and polemics were being fashioned, the daily work of historians proceeded. Among the products of that work have been a good number of explicitly synthetic volumes. There is, of course, no clear or settled notion of what defines a work of synthesis. I have used a rather generous definition. Some of the books I am calling synthetic might alternatively be designated as monographs-archivally based but exceptionally ambitious books that tackle big questions and seek to frame a large field or to provide an interpretation for an audience well beyond specialists. Others are more obviously synthetic, relying heavily on secondary literature to establish the state of the art in a broad field for a wide audience, including, often, students and the general public. With this diversity of form, purpose, and audience in mind-as well as a concern for a reasonable distribution of fields and periods-I have, with the help of the editors of the American Historical Review, selected a few recent synthetic works for examina- tion.18 The very existence of these books mutes the question of whether we need synthetic works or whether, under the constraints of present historiographical practice, synthesis is possible. In fact, the seeming proliferation of syntheses at present-and their variousness-suggests that the field of American history is at a formative (or reformative) moment that invites synthesis: the quest for new understandings that has undermined established narratives has now, perhaps, prompted new efforts at crystallizing a very unstable body of historical writing into new syntheses. A different question, however, provides the focus of this essay. What strategies for narrative synthesis are available to historians today? How might we think about the relation between a particular structure of narrative synthesis and the author's purpose or interpretation? How do these different strategies relate to current historiography? What particular work do they do, within the profession and beyond it? And finally I want to ask some questions about the firmness of the boundaries (mostly geographical) that define what is and is not captured in synthetic narratives of U.S. history. These works do not, of course, cover the whole field of synthetic works. More and other books could have been chosen, but these eleven books (and several others mentioned along the way) at least represent different kinds of history, different [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 17 Robert F.

Hine and John Mack Faragher (TheAmerican West). In fact, I have recommended each to non-historians asking for a literate one-volume history of the United States.

Together, the eleven total nearly 6,000 pages of outstanding historical writing. If nothing else, I can conclude that synthetic narrative invites long books. Because I cannot claim special knowledge in any of the fields being synthesized in these books, I do not propose to do the kind of analysis one would find in specialized reviews. Such criticisms that I have will be framed from the position of my interest in synthetic narrative. I say that in part to be honest about my own limitations in appraising these books but also for another, more positive reason. I want to insist that narrative synthesis is a form of knowledge, indeed, a particularly powerful form of creating, not simply summarizing, knowledge. I hope to get past or under the story enough to probe the implications of different modes of structuring a narrative synthesis. The way different narrative strategies construct that knowledge is important. While inclusion is one of the tests our generation will rightly ask of synthesis, there are other important historiographical issues that are embedded in the question of narrative synthesis.19 The more seriously we consider possible narratives of American history, the more we may be prepared to ask questions that press beyond inclusion. We may even be both bold enough and hopeful enough to worry a little about the language of inclusion, if not the principle. Is there perhaps more than a hint of dominant culture noblesse oblige in the language of inclusion? Might not a more sophisticated notion of the temporal and geographical boundaries of American history, including an awareness of the diasporic stories within American history, complicate and enrich the notion of inclusion?20 Can the historical and historiographical terrain be opened a bit more in a way that enables a deeper, denser, and more complex historiographical exploration of justice and difference at the center of American history? Might democracy be the word, the concept, the commitment that will move us in that direction? As I examine the stack of books before me, I propose to keep these issues in mind and to return to them at the end of this essay. JON BUTLER'S Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776 (2000) covers the whole mainland British colonial space and history, and it addresses a wide range of themes. In fact, themes, not time or chronology, organize his story. His brief, often one-word, chapter titles reveal a very distinctive type of synthesis, one immediately accessible to the reader, whether professional or lay: Peoples, Economy, Politics, Things Material, Things Spiritual. It is a reasonable progression, and in each case he brings together a good deal of material. Although his theme is transformation, Butler also claims (following recent historiography) a more inclusive geography, making more of the middle colonies than would have been the case a generation ago. In some ways, his manner of organizing the material topically bears a relation to [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 19 I do not propose to go into theories of narrative or even my own notions, but I will here indicate that my understanding has been greatly influenced by the work of Paul Ricoeur, Time and Narrative, Kathleen McLaughlin and David Pellauer, trans., 3 vols. (Chicago, 1984-88). 20 Such thinking is not restricted to specialists in the profession exploring the theme of diaspora. The novelist Russell Banks has recently argued that the focus for a synthesis of American history ought to be the African diaspora. See "The Star-Spangled Novel," Los Angeles Times, July 2, 2000.

If Hofstadter's book was intended to provide a snapshot that would serve as a starting point, Butler's title ("Becoming America") and his stated intentions announce change as his theme. He means to persuade the reader of a broad pattern of transformation that produced a distinctive and modern society in advance of 1776 and that in turn spawned the first modern revolution. Such an argument demands more complex and careful attention to process and cause than his framing of the book seems to allow. While he has surely gathered together a considerable body of material (his notes run to fifty pages), he has not produced a synthetic narrative of change over time, one that sketches a develop- mental sequence that integrates disparate elements in the interest of a causal interpretation. By bounding each unit of synthesis, Butler is stuck with a structural isolation of topics that undercuts narrative explanation. Given that Butler's theme is transformation, this narrative structure is crippling. For reasons related to structure and style of argument, Butler's claims for American modernity are quite vulnerable. While there are doubtless some specific ways in which the British North American colonies became "modern" before independence, they were not uniformly modern-over space or in all aspects of life. Many historians would readily grant numerous anticipations of modernity by the middle of the eighteenth century, but few would insist, with Butler, that so much modernity had been achieved so soon, implying that only a few pre-modern anomalies remained on the eve of revolution.22 Most give a significant role to the revolution.23 But the most serious problem is not with the phenomena he notices or does not notice, even if there is some real unevenness on this point. Rather, it is Butler's teleology of the modern, combined with his exceedingly loose, elusive, and, as is so often said today, undertheorized definition of modernity. Add to this an unneces- sary but apparently irresistible tendency to claim American uniqueness and "firsts" for nearly everything he identifies as modern in America. He names a number of phenomena that he considers evidences of the modern-polyglot, slaves, cities, market economy, refined crafts and trades, religious pluralism, and "sophisticated politics." Without further historical specification and theoretical precision, one can indulge in reductio ad absurdum. With the exception of religious pluralism, all of these qualities probably described Athens in the age of Aristotle at least as well as the British colonies. In fact, I suspect that Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker, relying on their recent book The Many-Headed Hydra: Sailors, Slaves, Commoners, and the Hidden History of the Revolutionary Atlantic (2000), would argue that the [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 21 Richard Hofstadter, America at 1750: A Social Portrait (New York, 1971). 22 Jon Butler, Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776 (Cambridge, Mass., 2000), 1. 23 See, for example, Gordon S.

In the end, however, it is diversity, which he tends to equate with multiculturalism, that for Butler makes Americans modern. But if we look around, we cannot but wonder about his claims for a uniquely polyglot society. This assertion may be quite vulnerable from any sight line approaching a global perspective. Can he fairly claim that New York City harbored a level of diversity "never before gathered together"?25 Might not this be as plausibly said of Constantinople during the period covered by Butler's book? And did not the Ottoman Empire-of which Constantinople was the capital-far exceed the religious and ethnic diversity of the British colonies? My point here is partly one of fact, of care in making comparative statements without comparison. More important, however, are the criteria of the modern. Few, if any, major political bodies in the past half millennium more successfully accommodated diversity than the Ottomans, yet that achievement has never brought them recognition for a precocious modernity. One needs greater defini- tional and descriptive specificity to make the argument he claims. Because of the breadth and generality of synthetic narratives, it is especially important to be clear about key concepts. Similarly, he tends to claim the realization of "Americanness"-here equated with some vague notion of modernity-for events that, however interesting in themselves, hardly sustain his assertion that they designated "the American future."26 For example, writing of the French Huguenots, a group he knows well, he notes their assimilation, and he calls this "American."27 Well, of course it is, but so are the endogenous marriages that continue for various groups well into the twentieth century-sometimes because of racial difference and even legislation (as in the case of African Americans) or out of choice, as in the case of Scandinavians in the upper Midwest. Or to take a more ominous subject, it seems a bit fatalistic to say that colonial encroachment on Indian land "predicted" nineteenth-century relations with the Indians.28 Oddly, such a claim, while taking the moral high ground, nonetheless erases the postcolonial history of the United States by denying contingency and thus diminishing both the capacity and moral responsibility of all later actors or potential actors. The twin and linked teleologies of "modern" and "American" produce a distorting and de-historicizing synthesis. If there is a problem with the sort of synthesis Butler has written, what precisely is it? He makes historical claims about patterns and meanings of development on the basis of a narrative structure that effectively isolates and de-historicizes his themes. By not constructing a developmental narrative that integrates the various themes now separated in distinct chapters, the process and complexity of develop- ment is obscured. While his chapters are full of relevant and interesting details of [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 24 Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker, The Many-Headed Hydra: Sailors, Slaves, Commoners, and the Hidden History of the Revolutionary Atlantic (Boston, 2000). 25 Butler, Becoming America, 9. 26 Butler, Becoming America, 36. 27 Butler, Becoming America, 22.

In the absence of a narrative of change to explain and interpret, he resorts for a theme to repeated assertions of "modernity." The issue is not so much the claim for an eighteenth-century American modernity-although I am myself drawn to much more complex, nuanced, and contradictory discussions of that theme-as it is the incapacity of the particular model of synthesis he deploys to advance that theme or argument. Philip D. Morgan's Slave Counterpoint: Black Culture in the Eighteenth-Century Chesapeake and Lowcountry (1998) is at once similar to Butler's and quite different. Both focus tightly in each chapter on a particular topic or theme; there is little play among the different themes in both cases. While Butler's themes propose a reorganization of material, thus giving an impression of freshness, Morgan's quite important questions are phrased in well-established ways. While Butler's structure works against his theme of transformation, Morgan's similar structure better fits his goals for the book, partly because transformation plays a smaller role in his analysis than one might expect. Slave Counterpoint addresses nearly all the issues raised by a half century of vigorous scholarship on the beginnings of slavery, the practices of racial slavery as a labor and social system, and the nature of African-American culture in early America. It is a book of enviable learning: with a seeming total command of the historiography and an impressive knowledge of a substantial archival base, Morgan proceeds to pose (or re-pose) difficult historiographical issues. Again and again, he offers compelling answers. Want to know what scholarship has disclosed about slavery and African-American culture in the eighteenth-century Chesapeake and Lowcountry? Look to Morgan's synthesis of a generation of scholarship. To have done that is to have done a great deal, and he has done it magnificently. Yet one gets the sense of a summary volume, a volume driven by the past, by past questions. Synthesis can either cap a phase of scholarship or initiate another. I think Morgan's book falls into the former category, while Ira Berlin's new book, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (1998), which also relies on a generation of scholarship and addresses many of the same issues, has the potential to become a new starting point. Berlin has captured the shift to an Atlantic perspective that has increasingly characterized scholarship by early modern Europeanists, Africanists, Latin Americanists, and historians of British North America. In this sense, his work, at least the early parts that sketch out and populate the Atlantic littoral, points forward.29 In a dramatic opening section, Berlin, relying more on secondary literatures than does Morgan, locates his story in very broad understandings of time (periodization) and space (the Atlantic world), the dimensions of which are shadowy, almost invisible, in Morgan's account. He locates Africans in an Atlantic history connecting four continents and in a rich and growing historiography reaching out from Europe, Africa, Latin America, and North America.30 One [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 29 Ira Berlin, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (Cambridge, Mass., 1998). 30 Berlin's powerful evocation of the Atlantic builds on many predecessors. At minimum, mention should be made of Philip D. Curtin's The Atlantic Slave Trade: A Census (Madison, Wis., 1969); and The AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 138 Thomas Bender [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] wishes Berlin had sustained this perspective in the later sections. But even if he narrows the story to the territory that later became the United States and loses the multiple histories implied by his portrait of the Atlantic world, the beginnings of stories, whether novels or histories, are heavy with intention and implication that can, I hope, be built upon.31 In fact, the four Atlantic continents remain an always changing aspect of American and African histories. Attending to, or at least recognizing, that larger and continuing extended terrain of American history would enrich the story of the making of African Americans and America, a historiography that is at present too much captured by an implicit and too simple assimilation or "Americanization" model. Nonetheless, Berlin has provided a powerful image of the creation of the Atlantic world and of the origin of modern slavery within it. Morgan has a quite different strategy. His domain is not the Atlantic but the South, or two regions of the South, which he is anxious to reveal as differentiated. Thus his is a comparative history, comparing two regions within the South. Suggesting a certain scientific aspiration, he refers to his delimited space as a kind of laboratory, a site for an "indirect experiment."32 This approach offers him much. He is able to focus tightly on his questions and generally achieves sharply phrased answers. Yet, like any good scientific laboratory, his field of inquiry is almost hermetically sealed. A two-hundred-page part of the book titled "The Black World" begins with a fifteen-page section on "Africans." Yet it is in only one paragraph at the beginning and a few other scattered references that one reads anything about Africa. His story rarely strays east (or south or north or west) of the Maryland/ Virginia and South Carolina boundaries. His comparative method has impressive rigor. Yet one senses that not only does his approach trap him within a particular place, he is also caught within a very confining net woven from the existing historiography. As Walter Johnson pointed out in a review of the book in this journal, his questions are smaller than the stories he has unearthed.33 Much like another important book on African-American history, Herbert G. Gutman's The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom (1976), this book, for all its synthetic aspirations, cannot capture some of its best material within the tightly bounded historiographical questions and issues that frame it.34 As in the case of Berlin's book, Morgan's is quite explicit about time and space. There is a well-thought-out chronology of change, and one of his major arguments is that the South, and thus the black as well as white experience, was not uniform over space. He shows real and important distinctions between the experience of [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] Rise and Fall of the Plantation Complex (New York, 1990; 2d edn., 1998); and John K.

Yet by treating both the temporal and spatial aspects of the story as sites (and very limited ones) rather than as processes of historical making, he weakens the capacity of his local analyses to explain change over time and, to a lesser extent, space. His major explanatory claims appear in the introduction. They are not only brief but also separate from the rich stories he tells and the analyses he makes of historiographical questions.35 The expansiveness of Many Thousands Gone, by contrast, evokes a strong sense of change, of process. It achieves a narrative synthesis of the movement of Africans onto the Atlantic and into the Western hemisphere. The difference between this approach and the tightly controlled analysis crafted by Morgan is striking. Like Morgan's, Michael Schudson's book, The Good Citizen: A History of American Civic Life (1998), is organized around fairly established questions- especially one big question. Has American civic life deteriorated over the course of the past three centuries? Naturally, the question is of a different order than those driving Morgan's analysis. It has not been generated by disciplinary scholarship. It arose out of American public life. Schudson thus draws on history and other disciplines to address directly a public question, one endlessly repeated today and, as he shows, in the past. Schudson himself, we should note, is not a historian. He was trained as a sociologist, and he teaches in a Department of Communication. While he reveals an impressive command of the relevant historiography, historians are not his primary reference group or audience.36 Although I am sure specialists will find some of his formulations to be of considerable historiographical significance and likely to encourage new lines of research, his intention, again, is different: his audience is a general one, and he seeks to bring historical knowledge to bear on a civic issue. What he is doing points toward the most important work that one kind of successful narrative synthesis can do, for the profession and for the public. By openly declaring his address to a public issue and for a public audience, Schudson participates in a very important tradition of historical writing. Some of the very best professional historians of the United States in this century have done precisely that: Frederick Jackson Turner, W. E. B. Du Bois, Charles Beard, and Richard Hofstadter all focused on issues, worries, or preoccupations of fairly general interest to write synthetic works that importantly rephrased fundamental themes in American history. This mutual enrichment of public and professional discourse is perhaps the ideal cultural work of narrative synthesis. Let us hope that historians can do this more often and more effectively. Yet as I make this point, I realize that all of the historians just named, including Schudson himself, were either trained as social scientists or did not recognize a significant boundary between history and the [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 35Morgan, Slave Counterpoint, xv-xxiv. I should note that my concerns about boundary setting in Morgan's book do not apply nearly so much to Philip D. Morgan, "The Black Experience in the British Empire, 1680-1810," in The Oxford History of the British Empire, Vol. 2: The Eighteenth Century, P. J. Marshall, ed. (Oxford, 1998), 465-86. 36 This command is at once impressive and sometimes puzzling. In discussing the Founding and the Constitution, he does not mention Gordon Wood's The Creation of the American Republic, 1776-1787 (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1969). Nor, in writing about the first decades of the nineteenth century, does he mention either of two key books by Robert H. Wiebe, The Opening of American Society: From the Adoption of the Constitution to the Eve of Disunion (New York, 1984); and Self-Rule: A Cultural History of American Democracy (Chicago, 1995).

Is this a mere coincidence, or is it an issue to be addressed by the profession? While I would not place Schudson's book in the same class as the scholarship produced by the short list of great historians, he has written a fine book. It is a book about change over time, and he establishes three eras of citizenship and participa- tion, each clearly defined. He does not devote much attention to how each configuration changes into the next, but he effectively characterizes their differ- ences, even in some very brief summaries, as in the following paragraph from early in the book: Another way to characterize the past three hundred years of political change is to say that the type of authority by which society is governed shifted from personal authority (gentlemen) to interpersonal authority (parties, coalitions, and majorities), to impersonal authority (science, expertise, legal rights, and information) ... The geographical center of politics has shifted from the countryside to the cities to the suburbs and perhaps, today, to "technoburbs," "postsuburbs," or "edge cities," or whatever we name our newer habitations. Correspondingly, the kind of knowledge a good citizen requires has changed: in an age of gentlemen, the citizen's relatively rare entrances into public discussion or controversy could be guided by his knowledge of social position; in the era of rule by majorities, the citizen's voting could be led by the enthusiasm and rhetoric of parties and their most active partisans; in the era of expertise and bureaucracies, the citizens had increasingly to learn to trust their own canvass of newspapers, interest groups, parties, and other sources of knowledge, only occasionally supported by the immediacy of human contact; and in the emerging age of rights, citizens learn to catalog what entitlements they may have and what forms of victimization they may knowingly or unknowingly have experienced.37 This paragraph reveals the argument and the narrative strategy that Schudson uses to undercut the widespread notion of civic decline: rather than a story of decline, it is one of restructuring, one that recalibrates citizenship and civic practice in relation to changing values and social experiences. What some, including me, see as the erosion of our public life and the thinning of American political culture, he presents as a complex rearticulation of expectations and institutions. Whether one fully agrees with Schudson or not, the book and the point of view it ingeniously argues constitutes an important contribution of contemporary civic life. And a narrative strategy of restructuring (as opposed to the usual rise or fall scenarios) deserves a place in the historian's menu of narrative types. "Presentist" purposes may, however, carry the danger of anachronistic readings. Schudson is vulnerable on this score, especially in his consideration of the colonial period. He too easily asks how democratic any phase of political life was. A commitment to explore the fate of democracy in our past-something I endorse- surely includes recognizing when democracy is not an available concept. He might better have asked how the legitimation and exercise of power worked. Indeed, such a deeper historicism would complement his anti-anti-Whig approach. Similarly, while a then-and-now binary invites sometimes interesting questions and offers some illumination of past and present, it also invites problems. Again, one sees this risk in Schudson's work. False categories of judgment are explicitly or implicitly brought to bear.

Voters then were expected to have "local knowledge-not of laws or principles, but of men."38 The binary obscures the role of principles in the past and knowledge of men in the present. Most important of all, it diverts our attention from the principles that it was thought would aid voters in judging character.39 Sometimes, by focusing so much on the party system that we worry about today, he overlooks those important issues that eluded the parties or that parties avoided. Substantive issues-the reason citizenship and civic life are important-are marginalized in his account of the different concepts and patterns of public life. The result, whether intended or not, is a form of consensus history.40 "Progress or decline is not the real question," Schudson concludes.41 He converts that question into one of restructuring that points to his core argument: there must be a fit between forms of citizenship and forms of everyday life, between values and institutions, between aspirations and commitments. It is that historically informed understanding that allows him in his conclusion to speculate in quite promising ways about an evolving pattern of citizenship that may yet serve our collective hopes and needs. Still, his conclusion leaves me uneasy. Like the journalistic coverage of politics today, the substance of political conflict is subordinated to discussion of the "health" of the system, of the institutions and practices. By contrast, the tensions, conflicts, and substantive issues that made politics so important in the development of the United States and in the lives of individuals are at the center of Eric Foner's The Story of American Freedom (1998). Foner's book has an uncanny resemblance to one that at first glance might seem utterly unrelated: Richard Hofstadter's The American Political Tradition and the Men Who Made It.42 Of course, Foner inverts the point Hofstadter sought to make. If Hofstadter famously played down conflict and (less remarked upon) paid little attention to the social making of political ideologies, Foner emphasizes conflict and the changing historical construction and reconstruction of the idea and ideology of freedom. Foner's work is much more explicitly sensitive to social history, even if it parallels Hofstadter's in its interest in ideology and the limits and possibilities of American political culture. While Hofstadter was alternately comic and ironic, bitterly so at times, in The American Political Tradition, Foner's Story of American Freedom is strikingly fair and straightforward. Yet the underlying hope is similar. As James Oakes has perceptively noted, Foner's narrative is undergirded by an unstated but firm liberal ideal of freedom- one that at once shares in an Enlightenment universalism and [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 38 Schudson, Good Citizen, 81. 39 See Joyce Appleby, Inheriting the Revolution: The First Generation of Americans (Cambridge, Mass., 2000). 40 See, for example, his summary judgment of the party system at Schudson, Good Citizen, 132.

Both appraised American political culture and its prospects from the position of a richer, more textured liberalism than we usually recognize in current debates.44 In thinking about the core issue in Foner's narrative, therefore, it seems fair to consider it to be the quest for a democratic liberalism, insisting on the relevance and indispensability of the modifier inserted before liberalism. One might thus characterize Foner's as a democratic synthesis, which, as I suggested above, offers a stronger and more egalitarian standard of judgment than commonplace invoca- tions of inclusion. It offers as well the implication of voice and empowerment. To Foner, as he indicates in his introduction, "abstract definitions" of freedom are not the focus. His concern is "with the debates and struggles through which freedom acquires concrete meanings, and how understandings of freedom are shaped by, and in turn help to shape, social movements and political and economic events."45 The result is a narrative that is at once focused yet always open to an examination of larger issues, structures, and events that intersect with and often drive his story. It is a dynamic story, filled with actors, with agents making freedom and using freedom. He selects key events or controversies of different eras, events that are widely contested (slavery, labor and property, the role of the state, social movements). Of course, coverage is selective; the gain is the richness deriving from a series of concentrated focal points. In each case, he examines the conflict, the parties contending, and the stakes. He does not hesitate to declare justices and injustices, to name winners and losers, and he does so from a consistently democratic perspective. Foner thus achieves inclusion without the dilution conse- quent with the faux openness characteristic of talk radio and without the postmod- ern hesitations that undermine moral judgment.46 The American West: A New Interpretive History (2000) by Robert V. Hine and John Mack Faragher spans the whole of American history, from "the European invasion" until the present.47 The book is written in the spirit of Frederick Jackson Turner.

That openness allows them to tell the history of the United States as a story of successive frontiers, including a fascinating rethinking of American regionalism as urban-centered at the end of the twentieth century.48 In fact, the chapter on the postwar era is a tour de force-imaginative, original, and quite compelling. In Turnerian fashion, they argue that "westering defined America's unique heritage."49 To a very impressive degree, they give substance to this claim, but recent historiography makes that claim, even for western history, problematic. As Hine and Faragher show, in the nineteenth century as well as today, the West (and the United States) was formed by migrations from west to east and south to north, and even in a limited way north to south, as well as east to west. The notion of westering is so strong in American and European history and culture, it is difficult to construct an alternative narrative structure, though no less important for the difficulty.50 This worry does not, however, undercut another summary point they make: the "frontier is our common past."51 The book is grounded in social history. Of all the books under consideration here, The American West is probably the most sensitive to the categories of experience and groups previously excluded from mainstream narratives of Ameri- can history. Their work goes well beyond mere representation of such groups and categories; previously invisible groups, whether Native Americans, migrating women, African-American settlers, working people, or the people of the border- lands, are actors who contributed to the shaping of history. But there are limits to this achievement. While there are multiple positions and voices represented in their narrative, only rarely does their narrative bring the reader inside group life. There is not much inquiry into the interior experience and subjective meanings shared by the various groups identified and recognized.52 While the story could have been situated in a wider context, one that revealed the global reach of the empires or, later, the importance of global markets, in its particular geographical focus the book consistently avoids privileging the English line of settlement. Other settler efforts are considered and sometimes compared. As is often the case with synthetic histories, however, there is a tendency to do the work of inclusion at a particular moment, and then lose the group at issue.

At times, the transnational themes they develop are extremely illuminating. They refer to what would later be characterized by theorists of the global cities as a "dual economy" in describing the role of foreign migrants, especially Chinese, in the nineteenth-century California agricultural economy.53 Likewise the interplay of national and international in their discussion of the Zimmerman telegram inviting Mexico to ally with Germany in World War I and in their discussion of San Francisco's "commercial hinterland."54 But, as in the case of Butler's book, there is a bit of parochialism in making claims of distinction. Perhaps such assertions can be demonstrated, but more rigorous definitions and empirical research than we have here are required to establish, for example, that the United States is today the world's most multicultural society.55 How would it compare with Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, whose citizens speak more than 100 languages and live on almost numberless islands? The social-history approach, whatever its success in representing difference, has in this instance under-represented national political institutions and policies. The development of the West, as Richard White and other historians of the West have pointed out, was profoundly indebted to what western Republicans now call "big government," for water, transportation, Indian removal, and, more recently, direct investment, as in defense contracts and installations and aerospace industries.56 The political economy and the role of markets, as has already been suggested, do not get the attention they deserve. We often overlook how much industry was in the West, and how much western industries-from milling and meatpacking to mining-were integral to the industrial system of the United States. And we forget how much the astonishing productivity of western agriculture enabled the formation of a large urban industrial labor supply. More of these dimensions of western history might have been included if only in the interest in enabling the story better to tell the national experience. If Hine and Faragher encompass both the full geographical and temporal dimensions of western history, Linda Gordon's microhistory builds out from a very delimited western space, the Sonoran highlands of Arizona, to develop a highly innovative narrative synthesis that locates itself at the various and causally interrelated scales of town, region, nation, and the transnational. Her work reminds us that there is a difference between a mere local study and a microhistory. The local histories of villages, towns, and cities, so common in the 1970s, tended to use global concepts but within artificially bounded fields of inquiry. One of the most famous of them all, Kenneth Lockridge's study of Dedham, Massachusetts, offered an isolated inwardness as a principal finding, although it was a finding that derived [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 53Hine and Faragher, American West, 358-60. 54 Hine and Faragher, American West, 395-97, 414.

Mostly, her account is the story of the arrival and fate of Catholic orphans from New York who were to be placed in Catholic homes. The homes were Mexican as well as Catholic, and that was the problem and the focus of conflict. The conflict played out along class, ethnic, religious, and gender lines, and it eventually reached the Supreme Court. It is a compelling and very human narrative, but one that also addresses a whole range of analytical and interpretive issues of broader interest to historians. Bringing the issues of gender, class, and race into relation with each other allows for an appraisal of their relative importance in this particular historical explanation. I think that her story reveals class to be more important than her conclusion argues, but the real point to be made is that only a narrative synthesis that brings diverse threads together will enable the historian and the reader to make this kind of judgment. These complex ends are achieved in part by her adoption of an imaginative literary strategy. Gordon's book is constructed of two types of chapters. One is quite often a broad frame for local events. In these chapters, her perspective as narrator is exterior to the action. The issues addressed are frequently structural and, as often as not, extend beyond the community. Here, one gets an analytical explanation of the relation of local experience to larger national and international cultural, political, and economic developments. Between these chapters, she has crafted others that get inside the culture of the community, providing wonderfully rich, thick descriptions of daily life and the development of the conflict. With oral histories as well as fragmentary documentary evidence, she brings the reader very close to the experience and voices of the community. The play between these accounts and the more conventional chapters produces an unusual but powerful synthesis. Whether a microhistory qualifies as a synthesis, even by my generous definition, may be debated. But the singular relevance of this book for the discussion of synthesis concerns not scale but its literary ambition, the literary experiment that gives structure to the book. Those who would write other syntheses-at various scales-will, I hope, be encouraged, even inspired, to experiment with novel narrative strategies in the interest of more powerful representations of the past. Quintard Taylor presents a third version of western history, In Search of the Racial Frontier: African Americans in the American West, 1528-1990 (1998). He offers a broad synthetic account that characterizes the experiences of African Americans over a very long period of time.

Drawing on a substantial body of scholarship, most of it published in the past quarter century, he aims to "reconstruct the history of African American women and men" in the West over five centuries, although mostly his focus is the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Taylor's central themes are the quest for community by blacks and the relative degrees of freedom and opportunity they find in different times and places. The conjuncture of the map of African-American presence and the conventional history of the West that his story brings out compels rethinking of both African-American and western history. He makes the point, for example, that the issue of Texas independence in 1836 was not simply, as myth, even the more recent multicultural version, would have it: Anglos and Tejanos in Texas confronting a despotic government in Mexico. It was also an Anglo effort to preserve slavery.60 More broadly, the map literally reveals that African Americans in the West were overwhelmingly city and town dwellers, and it is that fact that unifies their experience. The kind of synthetic narrative that he has constructed provides an invaluable service at a particular moment, crystallizing a generation of scholarship, making generalization possible. His work not only informs the public of the dimensions of previously unrecognized histories, it also provides a base for the next generation of scholarship. In a similar way, another recent synthesis, one that focuses on a more narrowly defined but also more developed area of scholarship, reveals the harvest of recent scholarship on work and workers. American Work: Four Centuries of Black and Vhite Labor (1998) by Jacqueline Jones at once brings this rich scholarship to a wider audience and proffers a fresh way of framing the field.61 If The American West, In Search of the Racial Frontier, and American Work cover very long chronological spans, books by David M. Kennedy and Fred Anderson address short periods. Their focus is also quite different, since both concentrate on political and military history. Kennedy's Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945 (1999) addresses what might well be called "high politics," while Anderson's The Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754-1766 (2000) brings social history and high politics into fruitful play, finding in that interaction the terms of his central argument about the nature of power in the British Empire. At the outset, both books locate their stories in a broad international context. Kennedy's book begins at the close of World War I, and the first character introduced is Lance Corporal Adolf Hitler, who was in a military hospital recovering from a poison gas attack when he heard the news of Germany's surrender.

The geography of Washington, D.C., even that of the White House, and the biographies of three men-Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Hitler-are more important to Kennedy's story than the world beyond the borders of the United States or, for that matter, than the American people of his subtitle. One of Kennedy's aims is evidently to urge upon Americans a greater attention to and sense of responsibility in the larger world, yet with the exception of the excellent discussion of the differing explanations of the economic crisis offered by Herbert Hoover and Roosevelt, there is surprisingly little incorporation of inter- national elements into the dynamic of the story. For all the importance of the larger world, for Kennedy, as for many Americans, whether professional historians or not, the international is a sort of "other," something "over there," if I may reverse the title of one of Kennedy's earlier books.62 Kennedy- also pays little attention to social history, not even to social histories that have sought to better explain the politics of the interwar years.63 Nor does the book address intellectual history, the history of science and technology (except briefly in connection with war production), the states, education, urban history, and much more. In fact, the book would have been more accurately described by the title of William E. Leuchtenburg's classic, F.D.R. and the New Deal, 1932-1940, which is here superseded and extended into the war years.64 So titled, adding the war to the New Deal, one could have no objection to this extraordinarily well-written, deeply researched, and compellingly argued book. But is it a history of "the American people"? Freedom from Fear is a masterful narrative on the terms it has assumed for itself. Yet having said that, historiographical questions remain. Kennedy apparently assumes that three voices are the important ones; not many other voices are heard, even though each of a small clutch of additional figures is presented very effectively as a full human being: Lorena Hickok, Eleanor Roosevelt, Harry Hopkins, Raymond Moley, Herbert Hoover, John L. Lewis, and A. Philip Randolph, among a few others. History for Kennedy, unlike for the other authors of these syntheses, is made by select leaders, not by ordinary people. What is remarkable, therefore, is the illusion of synthesis that is achieved. The book was published in a series that promises narrative syntheses of the defining periods of American national history. Most so far published accept traditional definitions of periods, and they are framed as political history, but none is so severely restricted as this one, which won the Pulitzer Prize in part because it was recognized as a work of grand synthesis. Dramatic changes in the historiography of the American field make it seem anachronistic. Yet its success makes the point that political history in the grand [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 62 David M. Kennedy, Over Here: The First World War and American Society (New York, 1980).

Fred Anderson's Crucible of War again engages us with the question of elites and ordinary people, and it provides -a promising approach. While Kennedy seems quite confident of the importance of a few leaders, Anderson seems to be ambivalent, and that ambivalence enriches his history. Although I think the principal contribution of Crucible of War to our understanding of the British Empire is grounded in the social history of the political and military experience of ordinary Americans, the dramatic focus, as with Francis Parkman's great nineteenth-century narrative, is on two great leaders of the French and Indian War, the marquis de Montcalm and James Wolfe.65 Yet, as Alan Taylor has insightfully insisted, Anderson has rewritten the story of their confrontation in a way that diminishes these actors, especially Wolfe.66 To be sure, Anderson's book goes beyond Parkman in its respect for Native Americans, their agency, and their role in the empire (and the role of the empire and war for them). He also modifies Parkman on a point that is central to the book's contribution to imperial history: unlike Parkman, Anderson not only notices but makes much of the division between English colonials and English metropolitans. These differences in expectation and experience make the war in his view a "theatre of intercultural interaction."67 Like Butler, Anderson seeks to diminish the role of 1776 in understanding the development of what became the United States. Historians, he argues, will better understand the creation of the United States by closely examining the Seven Years' War and, more generally, by challenging the usual tendency to "take as our point of reference the thirteen rebelling colonies, not the empire as a whole."68 Yet, even as he argues the importance of getting behind the Revolution of 1776 so that one can discover the eighteenth century as it was experienced, the revolution remains a touchstone for him. More than anything else, he wants the reader to recognize that the shots fired in the Seven Years' War were the ones with implications around the world. But he keeps de-historicizing his story to use it to diminish the shot of lesser implication (in his view) heard 'round the world in 1775. When one begins the book, there is a sense of excitement. Here is a history of the United States ready to take the globe as its context. Before the narrative even begins, the reader is presented with a portfolio of maps. Only two of eight describe the British colonies; no more than four of them consider North America at all. The portfolio begins with a world map, revealing the global distribution of the battles that marked the Seven Years' War. There are also maps of the Indian subcontinent, Central Europe, and the Caribbean. The introduction promises a book that will make the world, or at least the full extent of the British Empire, its context and subject. We are told that "if viewed from Montreal or Vincennes, St. Augustine, Havana, Paris or Madrid-or, for that matter Calcutta or Berlin-the Seven Years' War was far more significant than the War of American Independence."69 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 65 Francis Parkman, Montcalm and Wolfe, 6th edn., 2 vols.

We get very little of Asia (although Manila makes a brief but important comparative appearance), the Caribbean, Africa, and continental Europe. Of course, other European powers are part of the narrative, but they only have walk-on roles. We learn little of them at home or about the ways leaders or ordinary citizens interpret events, while we are, by contrast, led through elaborate accounts of high British politics. The preface, presumably written last, sketches an extraordinary agenda for what would be a stunning book. Unfortunately, Anderson did not write the book he there described. Still, judged in terms of what it did rather than what it proposed to do, it is an outstanding work of craft. It will no doubt be our generation's account of the Seven Years' War. As military history, it is superb, and it contributes importantly-but not so grandly as some of the opening rhetoric promises-to the non-controversial but still unclear issue of the causal relations that connect the Seven Years' War to the coming of the revolution. Anderson in fact offers a rich Anglo-centric narrative that explores and explains the different meaning of the war both as strategic event and as experience for the British of the metropole and in the colonies. It is written with verve and confidence-and a seemingly complete command of the materials, primary and secondary. One of its themes is the misperception of events by political elites; with the exception of William Pitt, surely Anderson's hero in this story, they fail to understand the different meaning of the war and empire for ordinary soldiers and colonial subjects. He thus makes cultural issues the heart of the book. Military and political elites play a dramatic role in the narrative, but causation for Anderson- and here he points to important newer developments in military and diplomatic history-is to be found in the culture of everyday life.70 In making this point, he not only offers an important interpretation of the war (building in part on his previous book on Massachusetts soldiers), he also reveals the empire to be less solid, more a matter of continuous negotiation, than historians often consider such entities, whether empires or nations or states.71 MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN ANDERSON, Ira Berlin, referring to the earliest history of Afro-European North America, and Daniel T. Rodgers, addressing the early twentieth century, incorporate the Atlantic, or at least the North Atlantic, into their narratives of American history. Berlin and Rodgers write very different kinds of history and focus on different periods. Berlin's is a social history, while Rodgers has written an intellectual history, or, perhaps, a history of political culture. Yet both Berlin and Rodgers recognize the complex webs that route movements-of people, of ideas, of money, of things-in the Atlantic world. The transnational terrains that Berlin and Rodgers evoke establish larger and truer frames for national histories than do notions of bounded and self-contained regions or nations. The first section of Berlin's Many Thousands Gone, a portrait of the Atlantic littoral, describes a world framed by cities and the sea, little divided by national [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 70 Anderson, Crucible of War, 453-54. 71 See Fred Anderson, A Peoples' Army: Massachusetts Soldiers and Society in the Seven Years' War (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1984).

Berlin's opening tableau describes the emergence of the Atlantic world as an ever- expanding historical terrain, where the African presence is pervasive on the sea and in the cities, including Lisbon, where they made up 10 percent of the population in the sixteenth century. He evokes a world defined by a network of cosmopolitan cities populated by creolized peoples. African people were not only omnipresent, they were often crucial cultural and economic brokers, helping to knit this new world together. Berlin lets go of this powerful frame and image in his later chapters, where he narrows the focus to regional difference within the bounds of British North America. Still, the book's protean beginning remains in the reader's mind, inviting others to realize its narrative logic and moral meaning.72 In Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age (1998), Daniel T. Rodgers also achieves a richer historicism by expanding the space of analysis. One small indication is in the subtitle. He refers to "social politics," not the more usual "welfare state." His approach, examining relations in space as well as over time as fields of contingency, makes the welfare state a problematic common term. When he uses the more general and more mobile term "social politics," he effectively historicizes the concept, lineage, and practice of the welfare state. The development of a social politics has other possible paths and outcomes besides evolution into the national welfare state.73 The national welfare state thus becomes a historically and place-specific invention rather than a universal or, worse, the teleological endpoint of American liberal narratives-an endpoint surely upended by the politics of the last quarter of the twentieth century. Following the pioneering work of James T. Kloppenberg, who also assumed a Euro-American context for progressivism and social democracy, Rodgers ap- proaches this age of reform as at once a transnational and national issue.74 A variety of reforms-from urban planning to social insurance to regulation of capitalism- are examined as products both of general, transnational ideas and of particular, national political cultures. The complex narratives thus developed by Rodgers and Kloppenberg-ones that recognize, especially in the case of Rodgers, the historicity of the balance between national and transnational-are a major advance in the narrative synthesis of a national history. Both Rodgers and Kloppenberg impress on the reader that ideas could cross the Atlantic in either direction. This is salutary; American intellectual history is too often thought by Europeans and Americans as well to be either insignificant or derivative, not quite up to equal participation in an international world of ideas. This common point is handled differently in each book. While Kloppenberg notes [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 72 One hopes this extension of the historiographical terrain will continue and that connections as well as comparisons will be made between the North Atlantic and the South Atlantic and between the Atlantic slave trade and the slave trade that turned to the east, to the Muslim empires of the Mediterranean and today's Middle East. Big as it is, the Atlantic does not capture the logic and dimensions of slavery in this era. 73 See, for example, the argument (somewhat dependent on Rodgers's work) in Thomas Bender, "Cities, Intellectuals, and Citizenship in the United States: The 1890s and 1990s," Citizenship Studies 3 (1999): 203-20. 74 Daniel T.

Rodgers, by contrast, focuses on the specific transit of ideas and emphasizes the way intellectuals and reformers on either side of the Atlantic drew selectively on these ideas, depending on personal taste and local circumstance. The result is a fundamental and valuable reorientation of the way we might understand intellectual history. The conceptual opening they have created invites a yet more radical under- standing of the territory and movement of ideas. Let me go back to the title of Rodgers's book. I think that "Atlantic Crossings" projects too narrow an under- standing of the implications of the book. It emphasizes the movement of people and ideas back and forth across the Atlantic. To that extent, it recalls a much older Anglo-American historiography of "trans-Atlantic influences."75 Rodgers goes well beyond this historiography in showing that, in important respects, Europe was partly Americanized and the United States was partly Europeanized by the phenomena he describes. But his really important accomplishment is to get away from the "influence" model, to displace the linear A to B notion of intellectual history. But he could have gone farther yet. There is more to the circulation of ideas than this framing recognizes. It is more than an Atlantic crossing, more than a link between Western Europe and the United States. The whole Atlantic, South Atlantic as well as North Atlantic, and, indeed, increasingly, parts of the Pacific world better describe the extent of the intellectual network his book evokes. In regard to urban development and reform, an important theme in Rodgers's book, it is clear that there is a global conversation at work. Rather than the linearity of steamship crossings (the dustjacket illustration) between the port cities of Western Europe and New York, I imagine a Great Bazaar of urban ideas, technology, and aesthetics hovering over the Atlantic, with many traders and buyers. This exchange is not, of course, symmetrical, and that itself is an issue, but participation was nearly global in 1900. Progressive ideas, especially those dealing with urban reform and technologies, traveled through many circuits and with different voltage, but nearly the whole world was connected, not only Western Europe and the United States. Simply look at the cities of Eastern Europe, Latin America, parts of Africa, Central and East Asia. Surely, they were part of an international conception of urbanism-and of urban commercial culture. The remnants of the era make it clear that New York and Chicago, no less than Lyons, Cairo, Buenos Aires, or Shanghai, were local instances of a global process of city-making. THESE LAST COMMENTS SUGGEST what I take to be the next challenge of narrative synthesis. But before I conclude, let me briefly review what has been accomplished by the cohort of synthetic histories considered here. These books reveal, even verify, the capacity of narrative synthesis to achieve inclusion and to respect issues of identity. Moreover, it seems possible in synthetic narratives to combine structure [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 75 See Frank Thistlethwaite, The Anglo-American Connection in the Early Nineteenth Century (Philadelphia, 1959).

The volumes here examined reveal many narrative strategies and quite different relations to a wider reading public. There is no single model, and no one volume (yet) does all the things we might fairly expect in a realized synthesis. In addition, these books, both in what they do and do not do, suggest to me the value of embracing a narrative core that is a more explicit and deeper exploration of democracy and difference, freedom and empowerment, contest and justice. Such a focus promises a sharper analytical history, one more historical and less susceptible to teleology, whether of modernity or anything else. It seems plausible to propose that a wider canvas, a supranational context, may in fact enhance the examination of these issues. The work of Hine and Faragher, Berlin, Gordon, and Rodgers in particular enables one to imagine an even more radical synthesis of national history, one that operates on multiple geographical scales, from narratives smaller than the nation to supra-national ones-thus identifying the nation as a product of history as well as an object of historical inquiry. Such a framing of national history will increase awareness of the complexity of the multiple axes of historical interaction, causation, and identity formation. While I mean these concluding comments to suggest an ambitious new agenda for the discipline, we must not overlook an already existing and compelling example. Decades ago, David Brion Davis embarked on a multivolume history that considered all these issues. He brought them together in his majestic synthesis that explores slavery and freedom in the Atlantic world, a history of nearly global reach that is also-and I emphasize this fact-a history of the United States.76 My point, then, is that such histories can be written, have been written, and I trust that more will yet be written. The present moment seems especially propitious for such histories. The relation of the nation to both subnational and transnational solidarities is very much in question. It is a public concern as well as an object of interdisciplinary scholarly inquiry. Historians surely have an open invitation to rethink the boundaries of national histories.77 Colonial historians have been moving in this direction for some time, redefining their field as the Atlantic world long before the globalization talk. Likewise, Rodgers and Ian Tyrrell, both of whom work on the modern period, moved in this direction fairly early and for a different reason: their concern about the claims of American exceptionalism.78 With these various concerns at work, we may fairly expect a movement of American historians and other historians as well toward a wider sense of their fields.

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important proponents, is thus linked by the Comaroffs forward to colonialism and to contemporary globalization, and backward in time to Part of this article was presented in a much earlier version at the Twentieth Anniversary Conference of the Journal of Southern African Studies, York, 1994; I would like to thank the participants as well as those who subsequently commented helpfully, including David Maxwell, Norman Etherington, Ed Wilmsen, and Paul Landau.

Missionaries were, in effect, agents of a first wave of globalization. The missionary movement was an early exemplar of a transnational global movement, while the intellectual claims of missionaries to universality paralleled the modernist claims of a globalizing colonialism. The struggles over the texture and composition of everyday life that took place on the frontiers of colonial society in nineteenth-century southern Africa therefore tell us something not only about the nature of colonialism but also about modernity and its considerable discontents, as well as about the resistance of the colonized to the European colonial project. In this sense, a quest for origins informs the narrative structure of both books.2 Indeed, one of the reasons that this seminal text engages us so closely is its concern with the narrative of dispossession and resistance, with a beginning and therefore, implicitly, some hope for an end-an only ambivalently postmodern narrative, in fact, despite some alarm in southern Africanist circles over Of Revelation and Revolution as a postmodern nail in the coffin of materialist history.3 This focus lends moral urgency to the Comaroffs' consideration of the distant initial encounters between white missionaries and the southern Tswana in the early nineteenth century. Volume 2, for example, opens with a striking vignette: Tswana soldiers refuse to defend the white regime in 1994, as Afrikaner patriots launch a last-ditch raid on Bophuthatswana. As homeland structures crumble around them as they write, the Comaroffs acknowledge that endings and beginnings are never entirely neat. "And yet in many respects, the narrative of Tswana colonization had completed itself, finally running its course from Revelation to Revolution."4 Doubtless the authors would now adopt a less utopian position, but their enthusiasm for revolution and for endings is important, and typical of South African historical writing from the decades before the end of apartheid.5 2 Catherine Desbarats, "Essais sur quelques elements de l'6criture de l'histoire am6rindienne," Revue d'histoire de l'Ameriquefranqaise 53, no. 4 (Spring 2000): 491-520, provides an interesting model, inspired among others by Paul Ricoeur, Hayden White, and Kerwin Lee Klein, for the reading of various historical approaches to the colonial encounter as forms of narrative romance, given the inescapable narrativity of the historical text. Susan Newton-King, also drawing on Ricoeur, similarly reflects on the inescapable imposition of an artificial order on colonial encounters by the historian of colonialism.

These authors take a variety of positions on the issues of whether or not the Comaroffs are postmodern and whether or not the rise of postmodernism in post-apartheid South African academic historical scholarship has been a positive development in a field that was previously (and in many ways still is) passionately materialist in approach. 4 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: xiii. 5 The original title of the series was reportedly From Revelation to Revolution, planned at a time before the release of Nelson Mandela. In a recent conversation with Homi Bhabha, however, John Comaroff is considerably less sanguine about the end of apartheid in South Africa and popular enthusiasm for Mandela outside South Africa, which he sees as a last gasp of modernist optimism in AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 436 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh In a similar vein, at the heart of Volume 1 is a crucial chapter, "Through the Looking Glass: Heroic Journeys, First Encounters." This chapter sets out to explore "the initial meeting of two worlds, one imperial and expansive, the other local and defensive."6 In marvelously evocative detail, the authors describe the initial entry of envoys of the London Missionary Society (LMS) in 1816 into the Tswana capital, Dithakong (seen by the missionaries themselves as a sacred journey into the land of Satan), a subsequent meeting, and the complex negotiations that took place throughout over the terms of the mission. A key metaphor is furnished by the mirror that the LMS envoy John Campbell presented as a gift to the Tswana chief, Mothibi, symbolizing the Western effort to reconfigure Tswana consciousness and the Tswana notion of the self. These initial encounters prefigured the colonial encounter to come: "the square enclosure and all that 'took place' at the center of the most public of Tswana spaces was ominous, foreshadowing a methodical reconstruction of their symbolic map."7 The Christian missionary project, this chapter further suggests, was from the start central to the creation of the dialectical oppositions of colonialism, ironic in view of its claim to erase difference. For the Comaroffs, the colonization of the Tswana thus began (although it certainly did not end) with the word, in the sense both of Bible and of cultural text, with the advent of white Protestant missionaries and their claims to possess the revealed divine word-albeit a word made flesh, clothed in material power. The roots of colonization were in a series of knowledge claims and a set of hegemonic cultural discourses, which would bolster the later seizure of land and of labor. Many scholars have explored the linkage between knowledge claims and colonial power, an issue that has long lain at the heart of postcolonial scholarship and that occupies an increasingly central place in the study of imperialism from a diversity of perspectives.8 Nonetheless, Of Revelation and Revolution furnishes a particularly influential and important statement of the position, in part because it provides a great deal of flesh on the bones of a theoretical model of cultural colonialism. The work moves from the field of discourse alone to examine in great detail concrete material struggles over the remaking of everyday life, including Tswana efforts to resist cultural colonialism. More controversially, perhaps, Of Revelation and Revolution also attempts to make explicit the links in southern Africa between a postcolonial setting.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 437 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne political, economic, and cultural colonialism-fields the authors argue are in any case impossible to disaggregate.9 The programmatic claims that lend Of Revelation and Revolution its force also, however, cause some interesting tensions in the book. The need to make linkages and the Comaroffs' explicit commitment to the exploration of large-scale processes lead the authors to oversimplify in places. Not only that, but the imperatives of a dialectical method push the Comaroffs at times (despite their parallel stress on indeterminacy and their very explicit engagement with the costs and benefits of a dialectical analysis, especially in Volume 2) into tighter methodological corners than they might themselves like. The links between early nineteenth-century cultural colonialism and late nineteenth-century political colonialism are not as direct or as ontologically indissoluble as the Comaroffs assume they are, while the relationship of "modernity" to colonialism furnishes matter for debate, with considerable contemporary implications. The very boldness of the Comaroffs' arguments has indeed contributed to a mixed reception among scholars of southern African history and of religion in Africa, with some enthusiastically welcoming the methodological innovation of the Comaroffs and others casting doubt in a number of ways. In the second volume of the series, the Comaroffs seem to me to have backed down somewhat from some of their bolder claims, despite their spirited engagement with the critics. This in itself provides an interesting case study of the evolution of ideas during a turbulent decade in South African history. In what follows, I would like to engage with this important work in several ways. First, I want to lay out my understanding of the theoretical guidelines in the opening volume, with particular attention to the issue of hegemony and power. Second, I want to provide an alternate reading of the opening encounters between Tswana and missionary, focusing on other intermediaries and on the fact that, even before the advent of European missionaries, the region was already affected by colonialism. I shall use this example to ask whether a dialectic model does not in some ways oversimplify complicated situations and make it hard to account for fudging across the fault lines. I shall further ask whether the result is not a rather muted account of individual agency and an attenuated depiction of the multiple uses of mission Christianity, both as language and as practice. This is not, however, to deny the latent authoritarian potential of much missionary activity, particularly in a colonial context. Third, I also want to gesture, albeit sketchily, toward some issues associated with narrative and chronology, suggesting that the schematic narrative about "modernity," industrialization, and globalization that undergirds both volumes, though provocative and important, also offers a number of hostages to fortune. These include an undue stress on the capacity of missionaries to induct converts into the global economy by changing their consciousness; rather, I see converts struggling to adapt to an overpowering global economy, among other things by trying to use Christianity in a variety of ways, with greater or lesser degrees of success. Having said all that, does this fact-mongering matter?-What are the Comaroffs doing that might go beyond reading the content of particular 9 Colonialism was simultaneously a "process in political economy and culture," and these dimensions were "indissoluble aspects of the same reality, whose fragmentation into discrete spheres hides their ontological unity."

Throughout, I want to take up some concerns of African historians and anthropologists with questions of narrative, voice, and agency in Of Revelation and Revolution. THE INITIAL CHAPTER OF THE FIRST VOLUME is a careful theoretical exposition. Although the authors rather cheerfully direct those with little stomach for theoretical discussions to skip theirs and, en bon bricoleur, to pick up the narrative at a later point, the opening discussion of anthropological concepts is in fact crucial for an understanding of what both this book and its later companion seek to accomplish. I would accordingly like to pause upon it. The stated goal of the work is to present an anthropology of the "colonial encounter," in this case between British Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana, with the larger implication that the missionaries acted as the cultural arm of colonialism, while the dilemmas of the Tswana in their confrontations with colonialism mirrored, if they obviously did not precisely reproduce, the experience of other colonized African groups in South Africa. The Comaroffs state that they hope that their discussion of this particular mission will accomplish three other things: to anticipate later modes of consciousness and struggle in South Africa; to look at an example of historical processes that were happening across Africa and indeed much of the non-Western world; and to examine analytic issues to do with the "nature of power and resistance." With reference to this latter objective: How, precisely, were structures of inequality fashioned during the colonial encounter, often in the absence of more conventional, more coercive tools of domination? How was consciousness made and remade in this process? ... How were new hegemonies established and the "ground prepared," in [Antonio] Gramsci's phrase, for formal European political control? ... Even more fundamentally, how are we to understand the dialectics of culture and power, ideology and consciousness that shape such historical processes?'1 From the vantage point of 1991, the Comaroffs placed their project into a historiographical framework that has since changed considerably, in no small part due to their own work."1 At the time, the Comaroffs castigated anthropologists for 10 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 6. 11 Among many possibilities, some works of particular importance to southern Africa include Paul Stuart Landau, The Realm of the Word: Language, Gender and Christianity in a Southern African Kingdom (London, 1995); Henry Bredekamp and Robert Ross, eds., Missions and Christianity in South African History (Johannesburg, 1995); Pier M. Larson, "'Capacities and Modes of Thinking': Intellectual Engagements and Subaltern Hegemony in the Early History of Malagasy Christianity," AHR 102 (October 1997): 969-1002; Richard Elphick and Rodney Davenport, eds., Christianity in South Africa: A Political, Social, and Cultural History (Berkeley, Calif., 1997); and many other works discussed in David Chidester, Judy Tobler, and Darrel Wratten, Christianity in South Africa: An Annotated Bibliography (Westport, Conn., 1997). The sheer diversity of recent approaches to the history of mission Christianity, a growth field, is impossible to capture in a footnote but is suggested by works such as David Maxwell and Ingrid Lawrie, eds., Christianity and the African Imagination: Essays in Honour of Adrian Hastings (Leiden, 2001); Nicholas Thomas, "Colonial Conversions: Difference, Hierarchy and History in Early Twentieth-Century Evangelical Propaganda," in Hall, Cultures of Empire; Susan Thorne, Congregational Missions and the Making of an Imperial Culture in Nineteenth- Century England (Stanford, Calif., 1999); Peter van der Veer, ed., Conversion to Moderities: The Globalization of Christianity (London, 1996); Robert W.

Historians paid more attention to missions but in the 1960s and 1970s often focused on the theoretically crude question of "whose side were the missionaries really on?" By the 1980s, mission history had been more fruitfully incorporated into work on such long-term processes as colonial conquest, capitalist expansion, state formation, and proletarianization. The methodological innovation of the Comaroffs in the early 1990s was, however, to underscore how much this new approach was itself limited by its "preoccupation with political economy at the expense of culture, symbolism, and ideology."12 They echoed the 1986 claim of Terence Ranger that most of the historiography of early missions to that point had overestimated the political and economic factors in its expansion-in a manner, according to the Comaroffs, stemming ultimately from oppositions between mind and matter at the ontological roots of our social thought.13 In rejecting a narrowly political-economic approach, the authors believed they could better answer the questions of why it was that missionaries succeeded in effecting broad social, political, and economic changes without substantial material resources (a question that, of course, assumes that this was accomplished by missionaries). What was needed, the Comaroffs claimed, was a study of consciousness: of why people articulated belief in certain things, why they took others for granted, how colonialism and consciousness were inextricably intertwined. It is in this sense that missionaries were most clearly colonial agents: they sought to remake the lifeworld of the Tswana, indeed, to colonize their consciousness. They did not necessarily seek directly and simplistically to incorpo- rate the Tswana into an unequal colonial world: they had dreamed instead of a "global democracy of material well-being and moral merit," in the Comaroffs' phrase.14 Nonetheless, their actions contributed to building an empire of inequality. This claim rests on the additional argument that the missionaries were the products of post-Enlightenment modernity, creations and agents of rationalization in the Weberian sense. Similarly, Tswana interlocutors made a variety of unexpected uses of the evangelical message, and of evangelical attempts to remake their world, again with unpredictable results. In sum, the encounter between colonial evangelism and the southern Tswana can best be described as a "long conversation," a continuing process in the course of which "signifiers were set afloat, fought over, and recaptured on both sides of the colonial encounter."15 Over the course of this conversation, the Tswana came to conceive of themselves as constituting a separate, Translating the Message: The Missionary Impact on Culture (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1989); and V. Y. Mudimbe, The Invention of Africa: Gnosis, Philosophy, and the Order of Knowledge (Bloomington, Ind., 1988). The Currents in World Christianity Project, at the University of Cambridge, has also since 1996 lent considerable impetus to the scholarly study of missions. A longstanding African literature reconsiders missions and the truth claims of missionaries, often from a theological perspective: for example, J. N. K. Mugambi, From Liberation to Reconstruction: African Christian Theology after the Cold War (Nairobi, 1996). Many works by African scholars are less well distributed in the West than they might be, given material constraints. From a wide variety of directions, missionary activity has become a newly invigorated area of research since the 1990s, although some of the more difficult underlying issues are perhaps not adequately discussed in all the literature. 12 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 8. 13 Terence Ranger, "Religious Movements and Politics in Sub-Saharan Africa," African Studies Review 29 (1986): 1-69. 14 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 12. 15 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17-18.

At the same time, the "forms" of the "European worldview" became inscribed on the "African land- scape": "not only did colonialism produce reified cultural orders, it gave rise to a new hegemony amidst-and despite-cultural contestation."16 Throughout this discussion, the Comaroffs reject the poststructuralist claim that all meanings are equally tenuous and open to contestation, regretting the episte- mological hypochondria and consequent intellectual immobility to which postmod- ern critiques have given rise in academia-even as the authors uphold some of the central insights of such critiques, notably their insistence that the indeterminacies of meaning and action be addressed by scholars.17 What poststructuralists cannot address is the basic question of how some meanings get widely accepted over significant periods of time by those against whose interest it is to believe them. This is the problem of hegemony, raised by Gramsci (however sketchy his discussion in the Prison Notebooks) and developed by many social theorists.18 The Comaroffs offer a solution, though over-schematic in the literal sense of the word. They see human consciousness as existing on a spectrum from "hegemony" to "ideology." At the hegemony end of the spectrum, one finds the taken-for-granted inscribed in everyday life-those beliefs that are not questioned because they are not even noticed as beliefs. At the other end, one finds articulated ideology, which is available for debate and which often tries to bring into consciousness the hegemonic beliefs of earlier stages. Culture in general is the "space of signifying practice, the semantic ground on which human beings seek to construct and represent themselves and others-and hence, society and history."l9 Somewhat oddly, hegemonic concepts are described as "constructs and conventions that have come to be shared and naturalized through a political community," while ideology is "the expression and ultimately the possession of a particular social group, although it may be widely peddled beyond."20 This psychological structure seems artificial and unwieldy; it is unclear why the province of the hegemonic idea should be the political community (a tricky concept to define in any case), while ideology is described not only as the product of communities (rather than at least sometimes of individuals) but as the province of the social rather than, say, political or even self-consciously intellectual groupings. The definition of the political is murky here, as it is throughout the book, despite (even sometimes because of) the painstaking effort of the authors to demonstrate the deeply political nature of the everyday stuff of life; what is lacking here and elsewhere is a willingness to limit and define the nature of the political in such a manner as to make it meaningful to call something political in the first place. Be that as it may, this construction of group political psychology permits the Comaroffs to draw conclusions that are critically important for their overall project. Indeed, the reconstruction of struggles over the stuff of everyday life that takes pride of place in the second volume depends ultimately on this theoretical 16 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 18. 17 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17. 18 Antonio Gramsci, Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci, Quentin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith, trans.

Given the place of hegemony and ideology on an ever-changing spectrum, the two are constantly fluid; meanings are always being made and remade, as ideology challenges hegemony to reveal itself, and it is in the inchoate, fluid space between hegemony and ideology that human consciousness is at its most creative. Given that hegemony is constructed largely through the "assertion of control over various modes of symbolic production: over such things as educational and ritual processes, patterns of socialization, political and legal procedures, canons of style and self-representation, public communication, health and bodily discipline and so on," the realm of "symbolic production" is (presumably) political because it is a site for power struggles. This means both that the "symbolic production" is political and that resistance to modes of symbolic production that generate hegemony is political. Modes of resistance run across as wide a spectrum as modes of control, with at one end organized protest and other movements readily recognized as political by the West; at the other end are "gestures of tacit refusal and iconoclasms, gestures that sullenly and silently contest the forms of an existing hegemony."21 It is thus in this light that missions must be seen. They sought to extend hegemonic control over indigenous peoples by changing their worldviews to a point that new ways of behaving and seeing the world were completely internalized. Resistance to the specific forms of Christianity was also resistance to the message behind the signs. In the purest sense, resistance to Christian forms was resistance to the content of capitalism and to the global capitalist system; this is indeed a critical plank of Jean Comaroff's fascinating (if not uncontroversial) reading of African independent churches as quintessentially subversive because they appropriated and yet subverted Christian forms, in her important 1985 study Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance.22 Christian missions must also be re-read. Their gestures and ritual must be analyzed in order to see how missionaries were attempting to change far more than religious allegiance, acting as emissaries of modernity and economic transfor- mation. Finally, conversion was inextricably political, and as such a suitable site for political competition between colonizers and the colonized. The extremely rich remainder of this book and its successor volume work out the implications of these theoretical positions through a quite brilliant analysis of the nineteenth-century "colonial exchange" between the southern Tswana and the Nonconformist missions to them run first by the London Missionary Society (pioneers in the field) and then by their later-arriving brethren, the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society. An additional important project of the authors throughout this study is to demonstrate the importance of an imagined Africa to the British sense of themselves and more broadly to the construction of modernity. As the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2, as part of a series of seven propositions about colonialism, "colonialism was as much involved in making the metropole, and the identities and ideologies of colonizers, as it was in (re)making peripheries and colonial sub- 21 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 31. 22 Jean Comaroff, Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance: The Culture and History of a South African People (Chicago, 1985).

A final critical point is that the authors see the interaction between missionary and Tswana as a form of dialectic between two key groups of interlocutors, dependent on the notion of difference. In the second volume, the Comaroffs acknowledge with more force than in Volume 1 the existence of overlap on the ground, and they reemphasize that the idea of difference was created by the dialectical process, despite some merging of lifeways on the ground and the mutual influence of Tswana and British. Note their comment that "neither 'the colonizer' nor 'the colonized' represented an undifferentiated sociological or political reality, save in exceptional circumstances."25 Since the end product of the colonial encounter was so clearly the production of difference and a series of deeply embedded dialectical oppositions, the Comaroffs nonetheless argue that this is the most productive optic through which to view the early nineteenth-century encounter between European mission- aries and Africans. This model is furthermore essential to their theoretical account of the formation of hegemony. ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE FOUND MOST PERPLEXING about the work of the Comaroffs is, nevertheless, the question of the extent to which it is appropriate to describe the Tswana encounter with Christianity as a form of dialectic. This question implies the ancillary question of who the agents of the dialectic were at given moments. On the face of it, these are tendentious concerns, since colonialism was so clearly in many ways a dialectic between colonized and colonizer, just as colonialism clearly generated reified views of colonizer and colonized alike. Missionaries themselves usually understood their activities in dialectical terms. Yet I think one can ask whether a dialectical approach to the history of Christianity in colonial contexts 23 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 22. 24 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 86.

This is above all because of the rapidity with which Christianity was out of the hands of the missionaries and settlers who brought it, the corresponding importance of non- Europeans in the spread of Christianity, the multiplicity of uses to which diverse interest groups of all ethnicities put Christianity as both a language and a practice, and the political and cultural complications of regions with multiple power players. These issues are brought out by a re-reading of the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana that occupy so key a role in the first volume of Of Revelation and Revolution. I should add that I made similar comments about the opening phases of the mission in an unpublished conference paper after the publication of Volume 1. The Comaroffs respond generously to this paper in Volume 2, as they do to a number of other critics, using the occasion to clarify and amplify their understanding of a dialectical approach. I do not want to beat a dead horse. Nonetheless, I think there are some useful differences of interpretation at stake, and so will abuse the Comaroffs' patience by briefly recapitulating a potential alternate reading of these opening gambits, before returning to the wider issue of different approaches to mission history.26 Let me first make a comment about regional issues. The lands of the southern Tswana were disrupted by colonialism, drought, hunger, and regional conflict well before the formal advent of missions. Furthermore, as Johannes du Bruyn has underscored, the lands inhabited by the southern Tswana were so profoundly affected by the Cape Colony to the south that it is problematic to frame a discussion of cultural colonialism primarily in terms of Europe and the Transvaal. In particular, the colonial firearms frontier moved with great speed, was highly destructive, and was arguably more important earlier than the Comaroffs suggest. Many different armed bands, some of them ethnically mixed, decimated peaceful groups in conflict situations exacerbated by hunger.27 Arguments about the regional context for evangelical missions to the Tswana are also implicit in a much wider body of literature about the so-called mfecane (or difaqane)-terms that have been much disputed by historians. Traditionally, the mfecane was a term given to the widespread wars, famines, and refugee movements that shook (and temporarily depopulated) much of the interior of southern Africa in the early nineteenth century, the impact of which on the Tswana the Comaroffs date from 1822. There is no space here to explore that debate, although it will be helpful to know that a 26 My re-reading of the opening encounter is based on my own work on LMS archives, which I consulted primarily with the aim of writing about contestation over the uses of Christianity within the Cape Colony and with a focus on Khoesan not Tswana uses of Christianity. It seems to me fruitful, however, to unite diverse perspectives on a very complex subject.

There were four LMS delegations to the Tswana to establish a mission, not two as the Comaroffs have it. 27 Johannes du Bruyn, "Of Muffled Tswana and Overwhelming Missionaries: The Comaroffs and the Colonial Encounter," South African Historical Journal, no. 31 (1994): 294-309; Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 275-76.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 444 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh critical issue is whether or not covert slave trading from the Cape Colony and Portuguese territories was at the root of disruptions that have more traditionally been ascribed to the many conquests of the Zulu kingdom in the region of what is now Natal. The point I want to emphasize here is not only the great disruption in the region but also the plausibility of historian Neil Parsons's argument that Tswana territory had already been subject since the seventeenth century to political unrest and the large-scale movement of populations. Parsons in fact suggests that the roots of disruption and state formation in the area may well lie in destabilization that considerably antedated the 1820s and may in turn be linked in at least some way to eighteenth-century slave trading to the north and the rise of the predatory Cape Colony to the south.28 Scholars also tend to see later Afrikaner settler colonialism in the region as part of the same broad processes. All this calls into question the determinative impact of mission Christianity in an already destabilized region. Maybe political colonialism did precede cultural colonialism after all? How might we need to reconceptualize the Christian/Tswana encounter if we think of it as taking place in some sense in a frontier zone, or even a borderland, with multiple players, already characterized by cultural admixture, politically influenced uses of Christianity, and political turbulence? The Comaroffs are of course sensitive to these hugely important issues. I think nonetheless that they could emphasize regional complexity more and the power of missionary Christianity somewhat less in their discussion of the roots of material change (at both ends of the nineteenth century), as well as pay more attention to the implications for their overall theoretical argument of the fact that Africans tried to experiment in response to very difficult local conditions. It is also important that the missionaries entered as potential power brokers in a turbulent environment but were initially weak, able to manipulate power if and only if they could make the right alliances. With these types of broad issues in mind, the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana, so well described by the Comaroffs, might be re-read as conversations between a number of actors. Four LMS delegations traveled between 1813 and 1817 to the southern Tswana settlement known to the missionaries as Lattakoo (later Dithakong) to try to persuade the Tswana to accept missionaries. It is perhaps symbolically appropriate that none of these delegations was exclusively white. In addition to the delegations' African members, even the missionaries themselves included a black West Indian man and a Welsh speaker. Neither, come to that, was the Tswana polity entirely "Tswana." The Thlaping polity was relatively multi-ethnic; the chief Mothibi, for example, was half !Kora (a Khoekhoe-speaking group) and (like others of the chiefly lineage) married a !Kora woman. More significantly, the Europeans were not the only, or even the most important, players promoting an evangelical mission. Key from a Tswana perspective were regional actors, the Griqua (as they 28 Julian Cobbing, "The Mfecane as Alibi: Thoughts on Dithakong and Mbolompo," Journal of African History 29, no. 3 (1988): 487-519; Caroline Hamilton, ed., Mfecane Aftermath (Johannesburg, 1996), including Neil Parsons, "Prelude to Difaqane in the Interior of Southern Africa c. 1600-1822," 323-49; Neil Parsons, "Kicking the Hornets' Nest: A Third View of the Cobbing Controversy on the Mfecane/Difaqane," address to the University of Botswana History Society, Gabarone, Botswana, March 16, 1999 (available online through the University of Botswana History Department web page, at http://ubh.tripod.com/ub/np.htm).

The Griqua were clusters of settlers in the region of Khoekhoe descent, some of whom had white fathers and Khoesan mothers, and many of whom had migrated from the Cape Colony, epitomizing the remaking of identity in the wake of colonialism. Groups spearheaded by Griqua had established regional hegemony through their access to arms and horses. They provided important trade links with the Cape Colony and were sources of trade goods for the Tswana. The Griqua were already using Christianity in a variety of complicated ways, as a token of equality with white settlers, as justification for what Robert Ross has termed "sub-imperialism" with regard to the unconverted Tswana, and indeed as a basis for their reconstituted polities. Alliances with missionaries gave these emergent polities potential access to diplomacy and markets, including the arms trade, in addition to spiritual concerns. Indeed, on the way to Mothibi's settlement, British LMS inspector Campbell had helped compose a formal written constitution for a Griqua group, reflecting the symbolic uses of the language of law. The language of Christianity was already on the loose in the interior, in other words, and subject to interpretation in Griqualand as much as in the seminaries of Europe.29 The (Khoekhoe) !Kora had also been exposed to Christianity and were also competing by the 1820s to obtain guns and horses from the Cape Colony. The decision of Mothibi and his counselors about whether to accept an LMS mission was thus complicated by the fact that the LMS came under the protection of the powerful Griqua Kok clan. During a second LMS delegation to the Tswana (overlooked by the Comaroffs), for example, Adam Kok presented newly arrived missionaries to Mothibi and acted as their translator. Mothibi was anxious not to offend the powerful Kok family, but worried because his own people had since turned against the mission. In fact, he eventually sent these missionaries away altogether. When two missionaries told Mothibi that one of them "wrought in wood, and one that was to come wrought in Iron, that we would do all the work for him in that way that he wanted," Mothibi was pleased and told Kok "he could not think of rejecting those that came with or through the medium of him." When the missionaries pursued the issue of teaching, however, Mothibi worriedly told Kok that "he would not be instructed, and if A. Kok should endeavour to press it sharply upon him, and his refusal cause a variance between them, he said that he would rather take the flight from Lattakoo, with people." Kok had to reassure Mothibi that the Griqua leader would not force the Tswana chief to relocate if the Thlaping 29 This discussion both here and below draws on Robert Ross, Adam Kok's Griquas: A Study in the Development of Stratification in South Africa (Cambridge, 1976); Elizabeth Elbourne and Robert Ross, "Combating Spiritual and Social Bondage: Early Missions in the Cape Colony," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa; Alan Barnard, Hunters and Herders of Southern Africa: A Comparative Ethnography of the Khoisan Peoples (Cambridge, 1992), 156-75, 193-94; Martin Legassick, "The Northern Frontier to c. 1840: The Rise and Decline of the Griqua People," in Richard Elphick and Hermann Giliomee, eds., The Shaping of South African Society, 1652-1840 (Middletown, Conn., 1988), 358-420; Nigel Penn, "The Orange River Frontier Zone, c. 1700-1805," in Andrew B.

If missionaries were initially dependent on Griqua intermediaries, they were also materially dependent for travel and translation on Khoesan hired in the colony. The Khoekhoe and San had long borne the brunt of brutal colonial subjugation and were in many cases more receptive to conversion than groups beyond the Cape Colony. The Comaroffs indeed have a wonderful discussion of the occlusion of such intermediary figures from missionary accounts of putatively solitary heroic jour- neys.31 I would go further than the Comaroffs, however, and suggest that at least some of these companions saw themselves as fellow missionaries. On the first delegation, Campbell was accompanied by a number of Khoesan Christians from the Cape. Their prayers and preaching had made a pilgrimage route of their journey through a country of which they saw themselves as taking spiritual possession. They were active in trying to persuade Tswana individuals to accept missionaries.32 In 1814, a synod of the southern African LMS missionaries had "set aside" in a religious ceremony several men of Khoesan descent to act as LMS agents in the interior, several of whom, including Griqua leader Andries Waterboer, subse- quently played important roles in the politics of Transorangia. Cupido Kakkerlak, a product of Eastern Cape mission schools whose letters reveal a passionate spirituality, also itinerated in the region, attempting, albeit with little success, to evangelize among the !Kora. These men were employed by the LMS. As the Comaroffs point out, the society would devote much energy to reining in and controlling "native agents" after the earliest years of the mission. Nonetheless, evidence from the Cape suggests that there was also considerable evangelical activity by converts who were not formally paid by missionary societies, including elephant hunters such as Hendrik Boesak or long-range wagon drivers. In addition, as mission stations became more like churches and congregations fought for independence from missionary control around the mid-century mark, congregations had more authority, not less. My point is that evidence from elsewhere in southern Africa suggests that Christianity was spread by people with long-range contacts other than missionaries, presumably not necessarily in orthodox form. The central- ity of Khoesan people (and later other Africans) to European-led missions to the Tswana suggests a wider oral evangelical culture that the written records would not completely reflect.33 Be that as it may, the importance of Khoesan agents to the Tswana mission is most clearly exemplified by the fourth delegation to Lattakoo, led by a former 30 Robert Hamilton to LMS Directors, Griquatown, April 28, 1816, London Missionary Society Papers, South Africa Correspondence-Incoming, 6/3/C, Council for World Mission Archives, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (hereafter, LMS-SA).

Read brought with him an unusually large group of people of varied ethnic origins, mostly Khoesan, including, more problematically, his own Khoekhoe wife, Elizabeth Valentyn, and his pregnant former mistress, a San woman, Sabina Pretorius, whom he claimed to have met by accident on the road. At least ten Khoesan men and six Khoesan women accompanied Read, all of whom were church members and some of whom were "zealous persons."34 It is indeed possible that the Khoesan of the Cape Colony saw this as a Khoesan mission to the Tswana, brokered by their kin among the Griqua. In any case, once Robert Moffat took over the Lattakoo station in 1821 from Read (disgraced for his adultery), he would fight successfully to diminish the influence of the Khoesan group from the Cape Colony, whom he then firmly wrote out of the history of the station. He dismissed several for immorality, despite the resistance, in which women played prominent roles, of members of the group. Moffat also found himself opposed by Griqua factions, many of whom resented his power-mongering presence.35 Before the late 1810s, the earliest LMS agents in southern Africa were not particularly good or even very enthusiastic apostles of capitalist cultural practices, mostly because they were so poor themselves and so looked-down-upon by many respectable members of colonial society. More than a few also tended to believe in dreams, to hear the personal voice of God, or to look for the imminent end of the world. Those missionaries who were closest in time to the Enlightenment, in sum, acted least like the bourgeois agents of respectability described by the Comaroffs as quintessential exemplars of the rationalizing project of modernity. The colonial unrespectability of early missionaries was compounded by the fact that perhaps a third of them married African women before 1817, while several were involved in sexual scandals. Others took high-profile political positions that were unpopular among settlers. The Comaroffs pick up the story as Moffat, in common with many of his fellows, was urgently trying to reclaim the moral high ground and to reinvent the mission as visibly respectable and as focused on "civilization." A lot of this is more about the internal history of the LMS than about African Christianity; we certainly in general need more of the latter and perhaps less of the former. Nonetheless, it argues for the importance of local detail, and for the centrality of fractures within as well as between groups. It also points forward to ways in which converts would later need to perform "civilization" and "respectability" in order to maneuver on the colonial stage, not solely because their consciousnesses had been colonized. From the start, tensions among evangelicals themselves were fueled by anxiety over the rapid removal of Christianity from the control of white missionaries. This tension was arguably innate to a type of evangelical Christianity based on textual interpretation and the notion of divine inspiration, as well as being the product of Tswana reconstruction of Christian forms. Certainly, missionaries soon lost control even of "orthodox" Christianity. Among the northern Tswana, Paul Landau has brilliantly documented the use of Christianity by junior royals to challenge existing authority in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in ways that escaped 34 LMS-SA, 6/4/A: James Read to Joseph Hardcastle, Bethelsdorp, August 7, 1816. 35 See Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman. AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 448 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh a series of rather peripheral white missionaries. Among the southern Tswana, Thlaping elites also exploited divisions among missionaries to their own political ends. In 1842, for example, Tswana elite men successfully appealed to LMS superintendent John Philip to fire missionary Holloway Helmore for excessive interference in congregational affairs, including deposing Mothibi's son as a deacon.36 Missionaries to the Tswana experienced other humiliations. The coherent Tswana group targeted by the mission decamped, to be replaced by a more motley group of refugees. The mission was battered by raids from various groups, could not protect its members, and was not successful at all until it started picking up displaced persons in the 1830s. A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS arise from this type of re-reading. At a macro level, the region was already turbulent and populations were mobile, so Christianity scarcely arrived as the harbinger of globalization in anything other than an ideological sense. This raises in turn the thorny and ultimately unanswerable question of whether Christianity would have had the capacity to colonize minds without the prior disruption of material conditions. We are back at the difficult issue of how determinative "culture" is by itself. Perhaps in the end, this rejigging of chronology strengthens the Comaroffs' fundamental argument about the inextricability of "culture" and material struggle. It does nonetheless pose all the more sharply the question of how Christianity-and religious innovation, more broadly defined- functioned in a frontier zone in a manner that was independent of the machinations of white missionaries.37 Also at the "macro" level, the Tswana were not entirely "local," nor were they unused to cultural difference. In a multi-lingual, multi-religious environment, were missionaries really needed to contextualize "Tswana custom"? Missionary papers record Mothibi making distinctions between !Kora, Tswana, and colonial Khoekhoe customs, for example. I would not want to deny the importance of local identity, or to exaggerate the degree of long-range contacts of the southern Tswana, in contrast to the remarkable global reach and global identity claims of the early missionary movement. There are issues of tremendous importance raised by that contrast. But it also seems important that there were other regional interlocutors who were of greater material importance initially to the Tswana than the Europeans, and with whom they already had the kind of cultural interchanges that might have permitted the type of self-consciousness about "Tswana" identity that the Comaroffs see as the fruit of the "long conversation." This is also a way of asking about what the southern African interior looked like before formal European colonialism and whether the communities of the region were really as settled as they appeared. There are echoes here of an older debate about whether the encounter with the "macrocosmic" claims of the "world religions" Christianity and Islam shattered the 36 Landau, Realm of the Word; Elbourne, Blood Ground. On Helmore's dismissal, see LMS-SA, 19/2/A: James Read to LMS Directors, Philipton, June 3, 1843. The LMS Directors overturned the dismissal and censured Philip. 37 An interesting point of contrast is provided by Janet Hodgson, "A Battle for Sacred Power: Christian Beginnings among the Xhosa," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa.

As Terence Ranger has argued, whatever the intellectual issues at stake, African societies, at least in the southern African interior, have to be recognized as also "macrocosmic" in the sense that they had long-range contacts, exchanged ideas over large swathes of territory (as the rapid spread of prophetic movements suggests), and rubbed up against a wide variety of different groups.38 The relative mobility of different communities was also a factor in breaking down localism. This type of approach, to my mind, decenters the European missionary-at least until the missionary came backed up by a colonial economy and a colonial army. The power exerted by the conditions of the "frontier zone" of the region is represented by the fact that even missionaries were compelled by material circumstances to take on features of African polities. The Comaroffs highlight the vision of Kuruman mission head and former gardener Robert Moffat, and his wife Mary, like that of many early nineteenth-century Nonconformist missionaries, as one of an unrealistic rural idyll, in which they sought to remake Africa in the image of a vanishing and imagined rural utopian Britain. One could, however, go further in considering the contradictions of Kuruman. Robert Moffat acted in many ways like an African leader as well as like a nostalgic Scot, and he needed to do so because of the material conditions of the frontier. In the 1820s, he proved unable to retain the allegiance of existing chiefs, for whom he was too clearly a competitor. As the refugee crisis accelerated, however, Moffat was able to gather together dispossessed people. The price of their admission was allegiance to the religion of the leader, since religion was used to rebuild communities. The currency of power was people. In similar ways, the control of women and their reproduction was important to the maintenance of the power of the patriarch, whether African chief or mission station head-Moffat even went so far, for example, as to attempt to discipline publicly Ann Hamilton, the wife of his colleague Robert Hamilton, for refusing to sleep with her husband.39 Moffat was more a part of the African frontier world than he might have liked to admit. A further critical point raised by this case study is that Africans transmitted Christianity more effectively than missionaries did. The centrality of Africans to the spread of Christianity means that much of the early history of the mission is unrecoverable. It is often unclear what kinds of Christianity were spread orally, for example. In other parts of southern Africa, prophetic figures emerged from time to time to use aspects of the Christian message in a context that suggests how quickly its language became unhinged from missionary guardianship. For example, Xhosa prophet and war hero Makanda Nxele (Makana), who led a Xhosa attack on the colony in 1819, had an earlier flirtation with the LMS; he was refused the right to work as a native agent when he insisted that there was a god for the white man and a god for the black man, and that he himself was related to Jesus Christ. The examples could be multiplied, as the Comaroffs would certainly agree. The lines 38 Terence Ranger, "The Local and the Global in Southern African Religious History," in Hefner, Conversion to Christianity, 65-98. 39 Karel Schoeman, A Thorn Bush That Grows in the Path: The Missionary Career of Ann Hamilton, 1815-1823 (Cape Town, 1995); LMS-SA, 8/3/B: Robert Moffat to LMS, Lattakoo, July 12, 1821. AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 450 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh between orthodoxy as the missionaries perceived it and African prophetic innova- tion were fluid and could be crossed in both directions, explaining the anxiety of white missionaries to bring Christianity back under control. In contrast to the Comaroffs, who emphasize the orthodoxy of the Nonconformists (whom they see in rather stereotypical, indeed Victorianist, terms), I would contend that this anxiety was familiar from debates within the European churches as well; after all, Methodism had once been perceived from within the citadels of Anglican orthodoxy in ways similar to Nonconformist views of African ecstatic innovation.40 If in the early days of missionary activity, Christianity was never fully in the control of the white missionaries who had brought it and only became popular once it was spread mostly by Africans and then transformed in the process, what does this imply about how we might conceptualize the study of colonial missions? I have suggested in the past that the messy scenario I outline above, with its complications and its fudging across the fault lines, calls into question the utility at the micro level of a strict dialectical approach to the history of colonial Christianity. The ghost of French structuralist understandings of G. W. Hegel's master-slave dialectic seems to me to hover over and to constrain the first volume. In response, however, the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2 that I have too conventional an understanding of their view of dialectical processes. A dialectic is not a "formal, abstract, or strictly teleological movement through time and space," in a Hegelian sense. Rather, it is a "process of reciprocal determination; a process of material, social and cultural articulation-involving sentient human beings rather than abstract forces or structures."41 Colonialism is dialectical because it creates binary understandings of difference and depends on the idea of opposites; it is also presumably dialectical because colonial interaction shapes both the colonized and the colonizer in new ways. Returning to the issue at the end of Volume 2, the Comaroffs reiterate (although this seems to me a somewhat different take) that by "dialectics" they mean "the mutually transforming play of social forces whose outcome is neither linear nor simply overdetermined." Defined thus, they add, "it is hard to imagine how colonial history could be regarded as anything else."42 In a weak sense, this is undeniable. Furthermore, on this model, it may not matter that the early encounter between missionaries and Tswana was so much messier than a "dialectical" account would suggest. The Comaroffs' point is precisely that out of difference and mess colonialism created binary opposites. At the same time, the exact nature of this process is often hard to capture. It is interesting to hear John Comaroff raise, in a recently published transcribed conversation with Homi Bhabha, what he terms the question of theory related to "the old Manichean opposition between colonizer and colonized, those 'iteratively marked,' positionally conflated points of reference around which the human geography of empire is so widely imagined. How, other than purely by descriptive insistence, does one displace the crushing logic of binarism in terms of which 40 Among many possibilities, see Deborah Valenze, Prophetic Sons and Daughters: Female Preaching and Popular Religion in Industrial England (Princeton, N.J., 1985). 41 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 29. 42 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 410. AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 451 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne colonial worlds are apprehended and narrated?"43 I think this is a genuine point of tension for the Comaroffs, and quite rightly for many others. Perhaps my own discomfort arises from the difficulty of defining who the agents of dialectic are. In the end, the Comaroffs are interested in doing a historical anthropology of colonialism, more than of religion in colonial contexts. In this optic, the fault line of interest is that between colonized and colonizer. Religious belief did not, however, adhere to that fault line, even though both colonized and colonizers mobilized religion to the ends of power struggle. Nor of course was Christianity itself static. At the same time, the very notion of ethnic difference was still in the process of being worked out more broadly well past the early era of industrialization; therefore it was incorporated differently into the views of colonial evangelists at different times. From the point of view of the Comaroffs' overall narrative structure, this leads us away from the Enlightenment and onto the terrain of more immediately nineteenth-century colonial concerns. On this model, colonial conquest and the need to maintain and justify white rule shaped the mid- nineteenth-century culture of white Christianity. The end was not contained in the beginning but formed by colonial processes. Be that as it may, it is instructive that the Khoesan themselves were not able indefinitely to maintain the interstitial status to which Christianity gave them some access. By the early 1850s, many living in the Cape Colony were forced to choose between the colonial binaries of "black" and "white," in the 1850-1853 frontier war in which many people of Khoesan descent rebelled to fight against the "white" colony, as "race" became the determinant of colonial identity.44 The example also underscores the importance of "black" and "white" as colonial binaries arguably of more importance than "English" and "Tswana." All this should not, however, lead us to read the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in terms of the mid-nineteenth. There is a basic problem here that dogs the Comaroffs throughout the books. Christianity is both text and practice, and therefore difficult to pin down. Not only that, it also permits and contains a wide variety both of practices and of different interpretations of its central themes. As text, Christianity became a free-floating signifier. As a practice, it was fought over bitterly by those who wanted to benefit from it. It is therefore difficult to identify Christianity clearly with one side of a dialectical or even dialogic model. This is all the more problematic because it is hard to define Christianity clearly, other than by appeals to authority. There was considerable scope for Africans to reinvent Christianity even from the beginning of the mission described by the Comaroffs. In some ways, this is precisely the Comaroffs' point: the signs of Christianity were fought over by competing ethnic groups. The Comaroffs nonetheless cannot bring themselves to see acceptance of Christianity in its unadulterated mission form as anything other than a defeat for 43 Bhabha and Comaroff, "Speaking of Postcoloniality," 22. 44 Elbourne, Blood Ground, 345-76; Robert Ross, "The Kat River Rebellion and Khoikhoi Nationalism: The Fate of an Ethnic Identification," Kronos: Journal of Cape History/Tydskrif vir Kaaplandse Geskiedenis 24 (November 1997): 91-105.

This position ultimately obscures complexity. EVENTUALLY, ONE MUST CONFRONT the type of question raised by Leon de Kock, about disciplinary conventions and the fetishization of the archive.45 De Kock argues that historians have spent too much time in their reaction to this wonderful book looking for factual flaws. To put the question in its boldest form, are the details really that essential to the overall project? Perhaps less tendentiously, what are the Comaroffs doing that goes beyond the reading of the words of colonists? The Comaroffs are important precisely because they move beyond words to decipher the gestures of people in the past. They put an anthropologist's emphasis on ritual and performance. They add thereby a crucial dimension to our reading of culture-bound historical archives. The Comaroffs' understanding of performance goes well beyond the staged performances of religious rites (although they acknowledge at the same time that people used the framework of religious ritual as a springboard for their own acting out of emotions and ideas). The missionaries are described as performing civilization, in the hope of educating the Tswana to adopt Western cultural practices through the power of display. In response, the Tswana performed noncompliance or acted out cultural bricolage. The tangible display of the body interests the Comaroffs, just as the material suffering of the colonized body that we readers know is to come provides a moral template for our reading of the early nineteenth century. The authors are particularly interested in space and the disposition of the body in space: their analyses frequently return, like the apartheid state itself, to issues of the control of the movement of African bodies.46 The Comaroffs are in some ways mistrustful of the self-interested and one-sided colonial text and find more solidity in the unspoken exchanges of bodily perfor- mance. It is this approach that both furnishes the greatest richness of the books and yet at the same time has excited unease in some interlocutors. If the evidence that remains of Tswana actions is mostly accounts of their physical activity, does that not place the reporter (the anthropologist, the historian, or even the reader) in the privileged position of interpreting Tswana actions, leaving the Tswana themselves rarely free to speak directly in their own voice? Is this even an accurate assessment of the nature of the historical record, or are there more extensive Tswana records? J. D. Y. Peel and Terence Ranger have both queried the absence of Tswana 45 De Kock, "For and Against the Comaroffs." 46 For example, Volume 2 tellingly argues that integral to the late nineteenth-century struggle over African labor was a further struggle over the "distribution of people in space and, concomitantly, their passage across the social landscape." This is a typical discussion of space that appropriately reflects the struggle of the apartheid state to control the physical body, just as slavery had earlier lent mastery of the body to the slaveowner.

The Comaroffs have responded that community historical narrative was not a genre espoused by the Tswana. They argue, furthermore, that the quest for "narrative" is elitist: it is "a short step from the stress on narrative to the history of elites, thence to elitist history."48 The issue remains uneasily unresolved. For Paul Landau, the Comaroffs themselves have a culturally constrained view of what constitutes "genuine narrative." They pay "little attention to genealogy, song, Tswana conversation, letters, political speech, tales, myth or church charters- because they are not 'genuine' narratives. Consequently Tswana people's ideas of fulfillment and transcendence do not show themselves in either volume."49 Even the Tswana intellectual and politician Sol Plaatje's great novel Mhudi, which draws on Tswana traditions about the difaqane, has been brought into the fray: for the Comaroffs, the fact that Plaatje himself claims that he could only gather material in fragments suggests that the southern Tswana indeed did not have a tradition of sustained historical narrative as late as the early twentieth century, even though Mhudi is more conventionally seen as a reflection at least to some extent of more sustained Tswana oral tradition.50 There is another critical debate at work in these discussions of agency and voice. The Comaroffs are very clear that missionary activity was part of the victimization of Africans. Much recent scholarship on southern African Christianity emphasizes instead the agency of Africans in using and reshaping Christianity to their own ends, as the focus has shifted away from missionaries and onto African Christians. In some ways, the Comaroffs want to restore a sense of moral indignation at the ways in which colonial missions did change the consciousness of Africans in a damaging fashion. Ironically, this may involve seeing people as victims who did not necessarily see themselves that way at the time-another issue of authorial voice. The Comaroffs' anger represents nonetheless an important strand of longstanding protest across the colonized world at the "colonization of the mind."51 It is impossible to deny that many Christian missionaries had a profoundly negative 47 J.

Furthermore, as Peggy Brock has persuasively argued, missionary institutional structures affected the degree of control missionaries could exert over congregations, and these structures were affected by indigenous social arrangements as well as by state power.53 I would further contend, in ways there is not space to elaborate on fully here, that shame was a key element of colonial control. Mission education could and did reinforce this. At the same time, Christianity could also provide a language through which to reclaim dignity and deny the shaming process. I think it is important in sum to see Christianity as a language with many possible uses. Conversion, for example, fulfilled a wider and more flexible range of functions than is suggested by the Comaroffs' reduction of it to a symbolic field of struggle over capitalism. A reading that focuses too exclusively on Christianity as a language of cultural domination rather than a language with a multiplicity of possible meanings pays too much attention to the Western roots of Christianity and not enough to the multiple uses to which Africans very quickly put it. I make this comment in awareness of the extent to which the Comaroffs emphasize the need to explore African perspectives through every possible means, and the extent to which they clearly do this. However, conversion was even more of an empty signifier than the Comaroffs suggest, and some of these significations did not have a lot to do with rational capitalism. On the other hand, conversion was also an act, with attached rituals and beliefs, and this is important for understanding what the act meant in the immediate rather than long-term sense. Even if I am not completely at ease with a victimization model, I would want to add that these were and are enormously complicated processes. They had deep and often painful implications for many. This demands humility from any historian. Undergirding much of the above has been a historian's concern with chronology, which, while justified, cannot do full justice to the rich ferment of ideas in these remarkable books. The Comaroffs in fact comment on what they see as different disciplinary conventions and their inherent costs and benefits. They see real and longstanding differences, as they remark at the end of Volume 2, between the ideal type of a more conventional historian and the archetypal historical anthropologist: "differences between the ideographic and the nomothetic, between the effort to arrive at the fullest possible description of events in their infinite particularity and the desire to pick out general principles across time and space." The latter approach, they underscore, "demands a certain boldness of abstraction" and is "inherently risky."54 Although one would hope that historians are not as painstak- ingly antiquarian and abstraction-averse as this implies, there is some justice to the 52 A wonderfully instructive example of the ambiguities of Christian liberal control of the education system in South Africa, just before apartheid, is furnished by Shula Marks, ed., Not Either an Experimental Doll: The Separate Worlds of Three South African Women (London, 1985). 53 Peggy Brock, "Mission Encounters in the Colonial World: British Columbia and South-West Australia," Journal of Religious History 24, no. 2 (June 2000): 159-79. 54 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 411.

The very manner in which they offer up a multitude of bold ideas, fizzing with possibility, also ensures that they offer a number of hostages to fortune. The Comaroffs are, for example, probably the most influential of recent scholars to argue for tight linkage between missionary activity, "modernity," "Enlighten- ment," and globalization. As Brian Stanley points out, this is also a question that has been much debated in the past few years by Christian theologians and mission theorists, with theologians paying particular attention to the damage done by the universalist truth claims of mission Christianity.55 More broadly, the Comaroffs are participating in a vast debate about modernity and postmodernity among social, political, and cultural theorists that it would be foolhardy to venture upon here. Their contribution is both important and vexed: important because they show the culturally constrained nature of claims to "modernity," vexed because despite everything they reify the truth claims of modernity and have too neat a view of the "Enlightenment," despite substantial historical debate on the utility of the concept. In so doing, they exaggerate the long-term influence of mission Christianity on the material subjugation of the Tswana, particularly by minimizing the impact of illiberal forces and overemphasizing cultural change. This could be true, however, and the significance of the Comaroffs' analysis of practice still be undimmed. The Comaroffs see "modernity" as "always historically constructed." It is in their view "an ideological formation in terms of which societies valorize their own practices by contrast to the specter of barbarism and other marks of negation."56 The Comaroffs link modernity to a view of the self as a rights-bearing atomistic individual, ultimately the "fully fledged bourgeois subject." They further associate modernity with a wide-ranging series of cultural and economic practices, including but not limited to dependence on a worldwide market, industrialization, the use of money, the use of "advanced" agricultural practices, the promotion of individuated space, and a sense of the body as private.57 It is part of the great richness of the Comaroffs' approach that they so fruitfully link cultural and economic practices, refusing to prioritize one over the other. At the same time, this view of modernity is slippery-and this is both its richness and an occasional source of frustration. The Comaroffs move between presenting the truth claims of modernity-its "text," if one likes-and the concrete material practices that advocates saw as characterizing the modern. The authors' desire not to take the truth claims of missionaries at face value make it difficult for them to spell out what, if any, were the irreducible material practices that defined modernity. If there weren't any, however, what was the material force behind the cultural claims and practices of missionaries? Yet it is arguable that at least some of what the Comaroffs identify as the 55 Brian Stanley, "Christian Missions and the Enlightenment: A Reevaluation," in Stanley, ed., Christian Missions and the Enlightenment (Grand Rapids, Mich., 2001), 1-2. Stanley points to David Bosch's Transforming Mission: Paradigm Shifts in Theology of Mission (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1991) as a seminal text for Christian theologians of mission in a postmodern context. 56 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 32. 57 A particularly influential figure for the Comaroffs' reading of the creation of the modern self in Volume 2 is Charles Taylor, whose Sources of the Self is a seminal text for their work. Taylor is of course a Christian Hegelian, whose view of the emergence of the modern self is certainly influenced by Hegelian dialectics, in however inexplicit a fashion.

There are echoes here of the great debates between radical and liberal historians in 1970s and 1980s South Africa, split over the origins of apartheid.58 For the "radical" school, liberalism, in both its ideological and economic sense, contributed to the economic domination that was at the root of apartheid. Radical historians argued that late nineteenth-century British capitalism precipitated and anticipated many features of South African society under apartheid, just as the Comaroffs here blame nine- teenth-century British liberal ideas about such things as money, markets, the individuated self, and the primacy of certain gender roles for the mental prepara- tion of the Tswana for labor oppression. Indeed, in their 2000 article "Millennial Capitalism: First Thoughts on a Second Coming," the Comaroffs explicitly link what they term the "Age of Revolution" (1789-1848) to the current "Age of Millennial Capitalism" with their similar anxieties and ontological challenges.59 This article makes explicit the magical, mystical elements of neoliberalism, and its culturally constrained forms, in contrast to neoliberals' claims to rationality and access to universal truth, just as Of Revelation and Revolution describes culturally constructed views of "modernity" and a "modern" economy. This is very helpful. Nonetheless, I think it would also be useful in Of Revelation and Revolution to be more explicit about actual intellectual debates among and between people: to have more ideology in places and less hegemony. The argument made by many, that early twentieth-century white liberals in practice came to support racist segregationist policies, while in ideological terms liberalism's support of the free market economy and nonviolent political action left it with little space to mobilize opposition to apartheid, all adds up to a trenchant and at least partially justified critique. By leaving out of the picture the intellectual shifts in liberalism (and among the opponents of liberalism) on the ground in the nineteenth century (and implicitly in the twentieth), however, the Comaroffs, like other authors, conflate several ills into one. Disciplinary specialists might want to throw further darts at the Comaroffs' narrative superstructure. Must industrialization and by implication modernity really begin in 1789? This is very French. What might be the impact of the questioning by economists of the linearity and suddenness of industrialization in Britain, which now looks more like an extended messy process than a "revolution" within neat chronological parameters? What difference does it make that the evangelical movement had many roots in seventeenth and eighteenth-century continental pietism? If Protestantism is the necessary condition of capitalism, where does this leave Catholic countries (not least France)? The point I want to close on is, however, that of tragedy. If there is, as I have suggested, an implicit narrative of origins that runs throughout Of Revelation and Revolution and lends the work its moral passion, this is not, for all that, a straightforward linear narrative of beginnings and ends. Rather, it is marked by 58 Christopher Saunders, The Making of the South African Past: Major Historians on Race and Class (Cape Town, 1988), describes the liberal/radical split. 59 Jean Comaroff and John L.

The Nonconformist missionaries who labored so intensely to change the daily lives of Africans in order to induct them into the "modern" economy did not foresee the devastating consequences of that economy for the Tswana peasantry (as might be said of some of the missionaries' modern counterparts, development workers). At the same time, the Comaroffs write as though missionaries inducted the Tswana into the global market and colonized their consciousness in a way that made their engagement more likely. It seems to me just as possible that the global market and related economic coercion came crashing into the lives and consciousness of the Tswana in a way about which they could do little, particularly as their contact was frequently mediated by coercive legislation on the part of the colonial state.60 Missionaries reflected the efforts of other Westerners to moralize the market: to see it as a force for moral good. In this, they shared the ambiguities (and guilty conscience?) of nineteenth-century liberalism. It does not take a great leap of the imagination to find contemporary parallels in the neoliberal discourse, and of course the Comaroffs are right that this putatively universalist creed contains deeply embedded culturally specific assumptions, as did nineteenth-century Anglo- American liberalism itself.61 If nonetheless market expansion is relatively inevita- ble, then is it not appropriate to ask on what terms this expansion might be the most moral? Or is the most appropriate response full-fledged resistance? Must the global marketplace necessarily be bad, on average, for Africa? From a somewhat different point on the ideological spectrum, one might also ask whether in fact Africa is incorporated into the global market on the equal terms supposedly demanded by neoliberal economics. These are clearly issues beyond the scope of this article, but not without historical parallels. In late nineteenth and early twentieth-century terms, the Tswana, it could be argued, were crowded out of an agricultural market in which many were making profits and farming more effectively than whites, in fact, in order to favor white farmers artificially and in order to bolster labor for the mines, again through "artificial" restraints on movement, through the theft of land, through racially targeted taxation, and through coercive legislation. This antici- pated many of the later strategies of apartheid.62 It is not as clear to me as it is to the Comaroffs that the questions some missionaries and Africans were asking about the possibility of a just economy were not the right ones, even if the culturally constrained answers they gave were so obviously, hopelessly wrong. I do not have answers to these questions either-merely some sympathy with the misguided quest for certainty in a rapidly changing, brutal, and deeply uncertain economic universe. 60 This is a point also made by Landau, "Hegemony and History." 61 Uday Mehta, Liberalism and Empire: A Study in Nineteenth-Century British Liberal Thought (Chicago, 1999); Mehta, "Liberal Strategies of Exclusion," in Stoler and Cooper, Tensions of Empire, 59-86. 62 Ted Matsetela, "The Life Story of Mma-Pooe: Aspects of Sharecropping and Proletarianization in the Northern Orange Free State 1890-1930," in Shula Marks and Richard Rathbone, eds., Industrialization and Social Change in South Africa (New York, 1982), 212-37; Charles Van Onselen, The Seed Is Mine: The Life of Kas Maine, a South African Sharecropper, 1894-1985 (Cape Town, 1996). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh I HAVE SUGGESTED THROUGHOUT THIS ESSAY that the Comaroffs present nineteenth- century missionaries as fairly powerful figures, able to effect changes in the consciousness of Tswana interlocutors, despite the resistance of many. In contrast, I see Christianity as important but, with some important exceptions, not necessarily white missionaries themselves. I also suggest that the linkages between political and cultural colonialism are often unclear in Of Revelation and Revolution, and that the role of "cultural colonialism" is overdetermined. If it is possible to guess about such counterfactuals, I suspect that at least some of the missionaries whose work has been scrutinized by the Comaroffs would ironically have preferred the Comaroffs' account of their activities to mine, however doubtless upset they would have been at the implication that their preaching laid the groundwork for the Tswana's entrapment within enslaving capitalist systems. But the Comaroffs do give the missionaries credit for a coherent, rationalizing, globalizing system that taught one universal truth. They also recognize the missionaries' own belief that they might instill into their converts the necessary principles of "civilization" to transform totally their supposedly primitive economies and to move them rapidly up the scale of human development toward settled commercial societies. My own interpretation, while recognizing the tremendous importance of the universalizing project as a mode of domination, calls into question the capacity of Christianity to convey as effectively as it would have liked a message of unifying orthodoxy, or indeed the overall ability of missionaries to accomplish their objectives. From the very beginning of the activity of Christians in Africa, as elsewhere in the world, Christianity was out of control, unorthodox, and an available subject for reinter- pretation in light of the needs of its interlocutors. Ironically, in sum, it is not always wise to take missionaries at their word.

When we within our several disciplines respond to this task with all the vitality and resources at our disposal, then, I believe, knowledge will indeed grow from more to more, and life will be increased without the illusions of power or servitude to the tyranny of idols.<br>

Abstract: The Captivity of Innocencesuccessfully concludes an innovative study of primeval myth in J’s Genesis. Its argument about exilic authorship serves as a springboard for a free and erudite exploration of biblical concerns with name, exile, and the paradoxes of divine-human relations. Very few biblical scholars today can compass this range of biblical, literary, and philosophical literature with such finesse. At a time when biblical studies incorporate a wider range of methods than ever, LaCocque, like Roland Barthes (whom he cites), powerfully combines traditional and more contemporary intellectual paradigms. Advanced students and scholars will find inThe Captivity of Innocencea far-reaching and engaging reading of Genesis 11 by a virtuoso of biblical studies.<br>

Abstract: Pablo Wright observes that while I leave behind Geertz’s concept of a cultural system with respect to morality, I retain the Geertzian concern with symbols and meaning. I would not dispute Wright’s statement that meaning is the master concept on a methodological level prior to the substantive issue of evil but would stress that in addition to idiom, code, practice, and symbol, experience must figure into a comprehensive account. Wright’s evocative references to “moral installation in the world” (one might consider terms like investment, suffusion, and tonality, as well as installation) and morality as a “practiced ontology in the micropolitics of social life” deserve further elaboration. Wright endorses a pluralized notion of moralities, but I reiterate that even more important is an adjectival sense of moral rather than the nominal morality. Like Parkin, Wright poses the question of how to reintroduce the ethnographically salient notions of cosmological and radical evil once evil is first construed as a human and intersubjective phenomenon. The answer is to ask how these dimensions come into play in the experiential immediacy of social life, for example, how a cosmological battle between angels and devils is experienced concretely on the human scale. Finally, he suggests that concepts of power from Otto and the shadow from Jung may be alternatives to the notion of evil, though I rejoin that they are just as much in need of critique with respect to Christian overtones. They may be valuable for the study of morality but are not suitable replacements for evil in the sense for which I have argued.<br>

Abstract: Within the theoretical framework of Roland Barthes's writings on myth and ideology, this essay seeks to expose the historical legitimation project through which the mythmaking, universalizing rhetoric of musical genius that has long surrounded the figure of Ludwig van Beethoven came to infiltrate scholarship on Josquin des Prez, culminating in his late twentieth-century apotheosis. Contextualizing the composer's reception history with respect to the debates between Joseph Kerman and Edward Lowinsky in 1965 and especially the 1971 Josquin Festival-Conference, the author suggests that the ideological refashioning of Josquin in the image of Beethoven has simultaneously shaped and derailed the intellectual trajectory of early music scholarship in the past thirty years. By privileging a discourse of musical genius in the service of which, among other concerns, the canon of works attributed to the composer is being decimated beyond historical recognition, the richness and complexity of the musical culture of which he was a vital part risks being overshadowed and obfuscated by the disproportionate amount of attention invested in his singular accomplishments. The essay advocates a resolute historicization of sixteenth-century discourses of creative endowment, a critical reassessment of the role of authentication scholarship in Josquin studies, and a renewed sensitivity to the imbrication of mythologies of musical genius in music historiographies of both the past and the present.<br>

Abstract: Review of Robert D. Romanyshyn's The Wounded Researcher: Research with Soul in Mind, New Orleans, Louisiana: Spring Journal Books, 2007. Robert Romanyshyn has written a treatise on the question of understanding that brings together the fields of phenomenology and depth psychology. Following the thought of C. G. Jung, Romanyshyn has presented an archetypal view of the dilemma of psychological research that he sees as a story of loss, mourning, descent, re-search and homecoming expressed in the mythical image of Orpheus. Going deeper into the actual process of psychological research, Romanyshyn looks to the ancient art of alchemy as providing a model of the attitude and action of imagination that most closely suits psychological life.<br>

Abstract: The L.D.S Church's use of commemorative rituals and narrative history to simultaneously adapt and maintain identity is not unique, but it is uniquely available to analysis because of the immediacy of the change and the Saints' devotion to record-keeping. Thus, the drama of LDS survival during the Progressive Era illuminates age-old religious strategies for adaptation to social norms, which strategies preserve the faithful's confidence in the timelessness of their god's moral and ecclesiastical order. More narrowly, these events in American church history are critical for understanding how the civilly disobedient Saints finally accepted the rule of federal law without losing their religion.<br>

Author(s): Wittgenstein David<br>
Abstract: Paul Ricoeur and Clifford Geertz have been concerned with the notion of human action as text. This text, like all texts, has manifest and hidden meanings. The hidden meanings indicate a "semantic" function of social activities, in the sense that they provide members of a society with readings of their experience, by telling them about themselves, their values, beliefs, and cultures. Ricoeur's and Geertz's ideas are used to examine the notion of "education as text". Because Ricoeur and Geertz stress hidden meaning, their ideas lead us to an analysis of the "hidden curriculum". The hidden curriculum is a reading of an educational text, normally performed by students. However, as Ricoeur argues, texts can be read by anyone. The question then arises: which sort of hidden curriculum is read not only by the students, but by all members of society? What sort of reading of society's experience is provided when education is a text read by all? I propose the hypothesis that education then becomes a text about society's myths and sacred beliefs.<br>

Abstract: The introduction of entrepreneurial education (EE) in the Israeli education system is discussed in this article as an example of the introduction of new curriculum. We argue that this introduction should be construed as a consequence of major ideological changes in Israel and its education system, a change from collectivist to individualistic values. We open with an analysis of a Ministry of Education publication that introduces the EE program and find that it is loaded with references to Zionist myths. We suggest that relying on references to these myths in promoting EE reflects a need to disguise the discontinuity between the social values behind the new curriculum and the traditional collectivist values of pioneering Zionism. We note that the Israeli programs exercise EE in groups, whereby the responsibility for the new ventures is shared by the group members. We suggest that adopting the group method indicates a compromise between a completely individualistic and competitive approach to entrepreneurship and a collectivist approach to coping with new tasks-which is more in line with traditional Zionist values. We argue that the change of atmosphere from collectivism to individualism is a result of demographic and economic processes that have occurred since the establishment of the Israeli state, and that these processes may be exposed through observing the Israeli youth movements and the public discourse. We believe that the gradual shift from collectivism to individualism is a central factor in explaining the timing of EE's introduction in Israel.<br>

Author(s): Thomas Robert<br>
Abstract: This paper attempts to uncover the mytho-symbolic parallels between the social-psychological theories of noted sociologist W. I. Thomas and the vision of moral-religious transformation recorded in John Bunyan's "The Pilgrim's Progress." Thomas' emphasis on the "definition of the situation," precise stages of moral development, and the four wishes are seen to be derived from Bunyan's themes of spiritual instruction along Christian's journey, his progress through various stages of sanctification, and the various spiritual polarities established by Bunyan as structuring principles of his text. Thomas is understood to have distorted Bunyan's vision of ultimate transcendence by equating salvation with adoption of the Protestant ethic and its institutional context of the American political and economic status quo.<br>

Abstract: The use of theories of Sanskrit syntax by Utpaladeva and Abhinavagupta to explain the action of monistic Śaiva myth and ritual is examined. These thinkers develop a distinctive approach to syntax that reductionistically emphasizes the role of the true Self/Śiva as omnipotent agent, in opposition to the denigration of agency by the majority of Hindu as well as Buddhist philosophies. An analogy to the Indian discussions is seen in the typological effort of Kenneth Burke's "Grammar of Motives," and it is suggested that indigenous theories of action syntax would be a useful focus for comparative research.<br>

Abstract: The very definition of myth is problematic today; here narrow, partial, "monomythic" definitions are rejected in favor of a complex, inclusive one, the seventeen items of which are then discussed. A mythological corpus consists of a network of myths, which are culturally-important imaginal stories conveying, by means of metaphor and symbol, graphic imagery, and emotional conviction and participation, the primal, foundational accounts of the real, experienced world, and humankind's roles and relative statuses within it. Mythologies may convey the political and moral values of a culture, and provide systems of interpreting individual experience within a universal perspective, which may include the intervention of suprahuman entities, as well as aspects of the natural and cultural orders. Myths may be enacted or reflected in rituals, ceremonies, and dramas, or provide materials for secondary elaborations. Only a polyphasic definition will provide appreciation of their manifold roles within a society.<br>

Abstract: The thesis of this paper is that an absolute origin of evil, arising from the free will of a creature, must be incomprehensible. Although Augustine occasionally acknowledges this point, nevertheless in a number of better-known passages (chiefly in The City of God) he attempts to give a causal account of the fall of Adam and/or Satan. Much of the subsequent Christian tradition has unfortunately followed his lead, and major recent commentators routinely ignore or passively approve of his conceptual error. Augustine offers three unacceptable explanations of the fall, which conflict variously with his own doctrines of divine omnipotence, the goodness of creation, and creaturely free will and responsibility, as well as violating the canons of sound argumentation and explanation. First, his contention that free creatures made "out of nothing" inevitably fall makes the fall seem ontologically necessary (unfree) and thereby lays the ultimate responsibility for it on the Creator. Second, the appeal to pride as an explanation is a spurious causal account, for "pride" is only a synonym for "fallenness" itself and not a possible antecedent condition in a being created good and not yet fallen. Finally, his assertion that the first sin is intrinsically comprehensible, but not comprehensible to us because we are fallen, is an obfuscation masquerading as an explanation, for we have no warrant for supposing that this assertion is true or even meaningful. Instead of seeking causal explanation Augustine should have stayed with his own wiser observation that an evil will has no efficient cause. Theology of the Augustinian sort (which comprises much of the Christian tradition) ought to concede that the fall as a work of genuine freedom is an absurd "fact," an incomprehensible given which steadfastly and in principle resists causal explanation. The concluding section of the paper draws upon Ricoeur's insights to tell why the narrative structure of the "Adamic myth" (which has important positive functions of its own) begets as an unfortunate byproduct this tendency to spin out a causal account of the first evil, with the conceptual confusion resulting from it.<br>

Abstract: Anecdotal evidence suggests that many qualitative researchers have had the experience of discovering that their informants had told them lies. This is quite different to those instances where faulty memory, subjective perception, partial or erroneous knowledge, a desire to give the researcher what they think they want, or even where a 'personal myth' comes in to play, because a lie is a conscious and deliberate intention to deceive. What should researchers do when they discover that they have been misled? What are the implications for qualitative methodology and its practitioners in the light of the criteria for good practice outlined in the Tooley Report? This article draws on two examples of informants who lied, in order to explore some of the questions and issues that can arise. It suggests, tentatively, that generic criteria may not always be sufficiently sensitive to cope with complexities of social life.<br>

Abstract: Aleksej Losev's definition of myth centres on the concept of detachment. In modern times detachment has most often figured in the context of philosophical aesthetics, where it is a cognitive category akin to Kant's "disinterestedness" or the Russian formalists' "estrangement." However Losev's usage also makes reference to the ontological sense of detachment as contemplative ascent (cf. Meister Eckhardt's "Abgeschiedenheit"). Thus, Losev's concept of myth combines both senses of detachment, binding perceptual attitude and being together in a double movement of resignation from the world and union with meaning; this movement literally makes sense out of reality. It therefore bears comparison to the treatment of distanciation in contemporary hermeneutics, where detachment is a key condition of understanding. By investigating Losev's connections to other Russian thinkers, the author makes a case for a distinct Russian tradition of hermeneutic philosophy (V. Ivanov, G. Shpet, A. Bakshy, A. Losev).<br>

Abstract: In the 1950s and 1960s Freudian theory was deemed to be a vital part of the sociological tradition, but since then it has fallen from favor, largely because of the simplifications and misinterpretations both by Freud's sociological critics and by his supporters. Chief among such misunderstandings is the tendency to view Freud's social theory as a variant of that of Hobbes, in which a selfish and asocial human nature is made social through the imposition of external constraints; these constraints, as Durkheim stated, eventually are "internalized" into the personalities of social beings. Against such a claim this paper argues that Freud's views differ profoundly from those of Hobbes and that the myth of the Hobbesian Freud has so distorted Freud's most fundamental concepts that their social theoretical significance has been largely obscured.<br>

Abstract: L'AERES dialogue avec certains organismes de recherche pour tenir compte de leurs missions
spécifiques dans le système d'évaluation. Mais cette démarche ne semble pas, au moins pour le moment,
devoir être formalisée ou étendue. Ce dialogue est facilité par le nombre restreint des organismes et c'est
évidemment plus difficile de le mener avec les quelque deux cents autres établissements d'enseignement
supérieur que l'agence doit auditer. Mais on peut imaginer quelques options entre lesquelles les établisse-
ments auraient à choisir. Et ceux qui souhaiteraient une évaluation encore plus spécifique pourraient être
amenés à en assumer une partie du coût.<br>

Abstract: In Sumatra's Angkola Batak culture, rituals celebrating major kinship-related events such as marriage have many layers of social and symbolic meaning; they have political, kinship, musical, mythic, and philosophical dimensions as lengthy, oratory-filled ceremonies that unite wife-giving lineages with wife-receivers. This article examines several ways that the interpretive approach that is discussed in the introduction can help students of Indonesian ritual grasp diverse aspects of Batak marriage rituals such as their hidden symbolic organization and their practical political implications. The article deals with a short sequence of adat dance staged for anthropological research purposes. (Adat, once translated as customary law, roughly means Angkola ceremonial life, kinship norms, and political thought; adat is eminently flexible, redefined by each Batak generation.) The choreography of the dance (wife-receivers dancing with wife-givers), songs, clothing, the political biographies of the participants, and the fact that the event was staged render the ceremony open to both structural and social contextual inquiry.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur distills this point well: "When we discover that there are
several cultures instead of just one and consequently at the time when we acknowledge
the end of a sort of cultural monopoly, be it illusory or real, we are threatened with the
destruction of our own discovery. Suddenly it becomes possible that there are just
others, that we ourselves are an 'other' among others" (History and Truth [Evanston,
Ill., 1965], p. 278).

Abstract: Jonathan Z. Smith's essay "Map Is Not Territory" was a watershed event in the academic study of religion, but, this author contends, for reasons yet to be adequately addressed by the discipline. Indeed, as argued in this essay, Smith's "Map" is best understood as a Romantic manifesto performed in a register indebted to Wordsworth and Wallace Stevens (following such precursors as Kant, Coleridge, and Ralph Waldo Emerson) as opposed to the Romantic register of Mircea Eliade (which was much indebted to the late German Romanticism of Hegel). Consequently, to practice the academic study of religion in a manner consistent with Smith's intervention involves a specifically Romantic mode of literary engagement with the textual remains by which one traces the careers of myth, ritual, and experiences of transformation among individuals and groups.<br>

Abstract: The method adopted in this study of Meir Shalev's poetics involves the simultaneous application of two complementary theories: the theory of literary mythopoesis (based on Aleksei Losev's personalistic theory of myth) and the theory of the origins of signs, language and culture developed by Eric Gans. It is shown that images of incorporated memory in the novel function as synergetic mechanisms both of turning signs into personalities and of turning personalities into signs. The unity of the body and memory representations appears to be the prominent feature of Shalev's postmodern fiction, which serves as the significant step in the development of magical realism in Israeli literature.<br>

Abstract: This article concerns itself with establishing and defining the concept of prophetic politics as a narrative-based political leadership. It focuses on the use of religious, mythical and otherwise culturally dominating narratives which are often taken for granted or as 'common sense.' By a skilful politician, these stories can be given new forms and used as tools of leadership. This article explores the differences between traditional prophesies in the religious context and political prophesies and shows how with the use of prophetic narratives the politician is able to keep politics from stagnation since every moment and every decision can be endowed with special importance in actualizing the vision that remains the fascinating but elusive goal of politics - whatever it is narrated to be. This might re-invigorate the citizens to participate more in politics. The focus of the article is on American politics since the American civil religion and the narrative tradition of the jeremiad provide ample tools for political prophets, but the concept is not restricted solely to America. I argue that well told narratives have great influence on how people think and that can be manipulated politically. This type of leadership opens new vistas for political candidates, but it also opens new vistas for researchers to use in their study of politics.<br>

Abstract: Mythical configurations of a personal deity and a dominant sexual identity are part of our western history. In particular, the religious myths of patriarchy have privileged a male God and devalued female desire—and, with her desire, sexual difference. There can be no facile way beyond these myths. Instead the proposal here is for feminist theologians to attempt new configurations of old myths and disruptive refigurations, i.e. transformative mimesis, of biased beliefs. Myth and mimesis can enable expression of multiple identities. Only identities-in-process preserve the possibility for a peaceful revolution of our desires and our differences, religious and sexual.<br>

Abstract: Bible reading occurs at intersection of perpetually shifting canons—of textual meaning, interpretative strategies, and preferred textual menu for particular contemporary consumption. Such continual up-to-datedness is the Bible's, as it is the classic's, only survival kit. Contemporary reading is the only reading—ever. Post-modernism's biblical reading menu is notable for its post-modernist yields of meaning; but textual post-modernism—aporias, textual unboundedness, canonical on-edgedness, apocryphalism, etcetera—is typical of biblical texts' ur-post-modernism (the Bible living up, of course, to applied post-modernist reading expectations). All such reading is an aestheticisation, a fictionalising process—abusive naturally; constructively abusive, perhaps; but always catachretical, demythologising, a negative theology. But, of course, this is utterly inevitable for now.<br>

Abstract: The story of the Fall inscribes the myth of a fallen language as the absolute other of the original sacred. Hence the dualistic scheme between a fallen materiality and a metaphysical God. This article explores how the death of this God is not merely a secular turn, but the opening of a different, anti-theological, or fallen religiosity that allows us to trace the sacred in unexpected places—also within fallen language. Translation and literature will be explored as instances where language performs its own fallenness— its materiality, arbitrariness and difference—and thereby releases a sacred expression. The essay considers 17th-century theologian Martin de Barcos' letters regarding translation, Derrida's essay 'Des Tours de Babel' and notions of literariness based on Blanchot and Mallarmé.<br>

Abstract: In this article alternative history is regarded not as a postmodern genre of Since Fiction but as a universal mode of thinking and storytelling. Its research is especially effective in discussions of historical-mythical pseudo-chronicles of lost civilizations, such as Agnon's Ir u-mloa, his Holocaust opus magnum. The article is devoted to the story from this volume "In Search of a Rabbi, or The Spirit of the Ruler" (Ha-mekhapsim lahem rav, o be-ruakh ha-moshel). The method lays open the author's complex historical and historiographic conceptions hidden in plots and characters, as well as in symbols of historical alternativeness such as "Crusher of Grits" (Kotesh grisin).<br>

estatiche, di un grande traffico spirituale intomo alla suora: le scrissero senza tregua religiosi e
prelati,... ma le scrissero soprattutto dame dell'alta aristocrazia, dai vicini ducati di Mantova e
. Savoia alle lontane plaghe di Spagna, Boemia, Baviera. Roma intervenne allora col solito rigore;
senza emettere condanne, le proibl ogni corrispondenza con Testerno. Cos! calô su di lei un
silenzio non piu rotto da fatti straordinari né da rumori del secolo, fino alla morte, avvenuta il 12
febbraio 1671".<br>

Abstract: C'est Descartes lui-même qui recommande ce procédé : « Mais, puisque Votre Altesse
remarque qu'il est plus facile d'attribuer de la matière et de l'extension à l'âme, que de lui attri-
buer la capacité de mouvoir un corps et d'en être mue, sans avoir de matière, je la supplie de
vouloir librement attribuer cette matière et cette extension à l'âme; car cela n'est autre chose
que la concevoir unie au corps » (Lettre à Elisabeth du 28 juin 1643, dans Œuvres philoso-
phiques, op. cit., t. Ill, p. 47).<br>

Abstract: Daß die Verstiegenheiten und Mißbräuche, welche die Scholiasten der Spätantike seit
der Kaiserzeit mit der Etymologie getrieben haben, aller ernsten Grundlagen entbehrten
und reine Fabrikation ebenso mittelmäßiger wie phantasievoller Wichtigtuer darstellten,
die sich „Philologen" und „Grammatiker" nannten und noch bis in die byzantinische Epoche
hinein fortwirkten, ist allgemein bekannt (s. zum Beispiel die vielfachen Entlarvungen dieses
durch die Jahrhunderte mitgeschleppten Ballastes von Pseudogelehrsamkeit bei W. G. Ruther-
ford, A Chapter in the History of Annotation, Being Scholia Aristophanica, Bd. III, London
1905, S. 392 etc). Daß die ebenso irrationalen und vielleicht noch geschmackloseren ety-
mologischen Spekulationen, die man im 20. Jahrhundert auf die Wortgruppe έρμηνεία, έρμη-
νεύειν, ερμηνευτικός anwendete und immer noch anwendet, im gängigen akademischen Lehr-
betrieb heute ernst genommen werden und sich professoraler Autorität erfreuen, ist nicht
nur ein bildungsgeschichtliches curiosum, sondern ein Zeugnis irrationaler Aushöhlung der
„geisteswissenschaftlichen" Fakultäten. Als Beispiel seien nur erwähnt Karl Kerényi, Her-
meneia und Hermeneutike, Ursprung und Sinn der Hermeneutik in ders., Griechische Grundbegriffe,
Fragen und Antworten aus der heutigen Situation, Zürich 1964, 42-52, und F. K. Mayr, Der
Gott Hermes und die Hermeneutik in Tijdschrift voor Filosofie, 30, 1968, 525-635. Wie der Autor
des zuletzt genannten Artikels selbst, auf Heideggers Formulierung zurückgreifend, sagt,
ist das „Spiel des Denkens verbindlicher als die Strenge der Wissenschaft"... Wohin eine
im Banne Heideggers stehende „Begriffsgeschichte" führt, kann man bei der Lektüre dieses
Schwalls besser „verstehen"... Wie wenig Tragweite die immer wieder angeführte (Techné)
hermeneutike in der Epinomis 975 c hat, sagt der Text selbst: bei der Kunst Orakel zu inter-
pretieren, die weder Seelengröße noch Weisheit hervorbringt, weiß der „Interpret" nur,
was er sagt, ob es jedoch wahr ist, hat er nicht gelernt (τό λεγόμενον γάρ οίδεν μόνον, εΐ
δ' αληθές, ούχ έμαθεν). Übrigens kommt das Wort έρμηνευτική in den pseudo-platonischen
Definitiones in seiner sonst gebräuchlichen Bedeutung vor, 414 d 4: "Ονομα διάλεκτος άσιλιθετος
έρμηνεντική τοϋ τε κατά τής ουσίας κατηγορουμένου και παντός του μή καθ' έαντοϋ λεγομένου.
(Nomen, zuzusammengesetzte Ausdrucksweise für etwas seinem Wesen entsprechend
Bezeichnetes, sowie auch für alles von diesem Ausgesagtes). — Pierre Chantraine, Dictionnaire
Etymologique de la Langue Grecque, Histoire des Mots, Paris, 1970, S. 373, sagt ausdrücklich,
„Terme technique sans étymologid'. Vgl. auch F. Solmsen, Ein dorisches Komödienstück in Rheinisches
Museum für Philologie NF 63, 1908, 329-340. (dort s. 336 f über den ionischen Ursprung
der Worte έρμηνεΰσα, έρμηνεύς).<br>

Abstract: Der Begriff der Dialektik, der zur Beschreibung einer derartigen Verbindung zwischen
Ursprung und Ziel gern reserviert wird, wäre hier unangemessen, weil er die Differenz unter-
schlägt, die Trieb und Mythos wie Unsichtbares und Sichtbares trennt. Freuds Deutung bringt
den Mythos im Trieb zum Verschwinden, aber umgekehrt den Trieb im Teufel zur Präsenz. Die
kulturtheoretischen Erzählungen der Psychoanalyse verschaffen dieser Präsenz eine Bühne, die
nicht nur der Vorführung des Teufels, sondern auch der Demonstration der eigenen erkenntnis-
kritischen Leistung dient; vgl. dazu H. Böhme: Fetischismus und Kultur, a.a.O. [Anm. 9] 408ff.<br>

Abstract: This article explores the narrative representation of the desert in Leslie Silko's Ceremony and Ibrahim Al-Koni's The Bleeding of the Stone. In both novels, the physical is transformed into an existential realm, through which questions about human existence are raised. The desert is a microcosm that allows for a re-enactment of the story of creation. It is also the catalyst in the protagonists' initiation processes and the loci for the ceremonies necessary for restoring balance in the universe. But whereas Silko's novel celebrates desert myths as the infallible source of wisdom, Al-Koni's text regards the desert as a stimulus for Sufi quest. يلفتنا في كثير من روايات إبراهيم الكوني النظر إلى الصحراء بوصفها وسيله إلى فهم الحياه نفسها، حيث تبدو مركز العالم، وما سواها هو الهامش وأهله الأغيار، كما أن حقيقة الإنسان هي حقيقة الصحراء. ونجد أنفسنا في روايات ليزلي مارمون سيلكو بإزاء نصوص تستحضر الأرض بحيث تدمج بين الزمني والفضائي، وتبني الأسطورة الضاربة في عمق الزمن واللاوعي، وذلك في اﻵني والمعيش وفضاء الشخصيات المتفاعلة. تحاول المقالة استكشاف التمثيل السردﻱ للصحراء على مستوى الرؤية والتقنيات في رواية نزيف الحجر للكوني والطقوس لسيلكو، ملقية الضوء على نقاط الالتقاء والاختلاف بين عالميهما، وصولاﹰ إلى تأويل علاقة النص بالصحراء والعالم .<br>

Abstract: The superfluity arises from the fact that this "double of Krsna" never has to
take the reins, since Nala is driving; see Hiltebeitel, Rethinking, 232-33. As men-
tioned in n. 7 above, J. Brockington finds this "implausible." For valuable discus-
sion of the "avatära" theme in both epics, and especially in the Rämäyam, see
also Robert P. Goldman and Sally J. Sutherland, trans. The Rämäyam of Välmlki,

Abstract: H.V., 18, waar een dialectiek aanvaard wordt in dp idee van „natuurlijke theo-
logie": als „natuurlijk" wil zij steeds filosofisch zijn en als theologie wil zij niet „natuur-
lijk" zijn (p. 17). Maar Ricoeur acht het theologisch geloof in de „verborgen zin" ver-
want met de (natuurlijke, wijsgerige) oorspronkelijke affirmatie (p. 18), hoezeer dit alles
„troublant" is (p. 18), en hoezeer ook het primaat in deze wijsgerig-theologische eschato-
logie aan de theologische eschatologie wordt geschonken. Dit is voor Ricoeur zo zeker,
dat een wijsgerige ontmythologisering van de christelijk-theologische mythe voor hem
gelijk staat met een wijsgerige zelfmoord.<br>

Abstract: Because they escape precise modal qualification, Troost suggests that insight into disposi-
tions can only be gained in an idea-ruled (idee-matig) understanding, in an idea-regulated 'on
the way' in the transcendental direction of time. For reformational philosophy this raises an
old and prima facie purely theoretical problem: Do the modalities 'continue' right into the
heart? One could paraphrase Troost's view for example such that for him the heart should
primarily be sought 'below' or 'behind' the act structure, and that the dispositions — relative
to this vertical axis — constitute a horizontal layer in which the lower substructures are
interwoven with the act structure. In that case the integration of the lower structures in the act
structure would take place via the dispositions rather than through a direct relationship with
the heart. This notion — for which hints can be found in Dooyeweerd — would in any case
lead to an appreciably more nuanced picture of the 'binding' and 'releasing' of substructures.
If I understand Troost correctly, he would allow this interpretation for the substructures,
though not for the modalities. His caution concerning the 'continuing' of the modalities 'into
the' heart is epistemological: the cosmological concentration of the modal functions in the
heart is a transcendental idea; at best we see dots (the idea-regulated 'on the way' in the
transcendental direction of time), but we should not turn them into lines.<br>

Abstract: In From Beast to the Blonde, Marina Warner studies the status of fairy tales as historical documents which
give an account of women's daily experiences, as they illustrate their particular rites of passage and the relevance
of maternal figures in their lives. The resonance of Mother Goose is taken by Warner "either as a historical source,
or a fantasy of origin" which she can trace into ancient traditions, like the Islamic or the Christian, and which
adds credibility to the stories (1994, xxiii).<br>

Author(s): Galavielle Jean-Pierre<br>
Abstract: The myth of an economy where nobody could have a predominant position, has lost its credibility. The presentiment of a high risk of social explosion makes companies undertake tentative moral legitimation. Thus, a new paradigm develops according to which the firm has to care for the satisfaction of public interest if "it wants to try to win forgiveness" for misbehavior towards the decorum rules of the atomicity of competition. Thus, there is a wave of "business ethics industry" building up. However, the stock exchange performances considered as ethical, are not different from others! The market does not seem to be able to say why it might be interesting to invest in stock considered as ethical. Moreover, opinion polls reveal a very significant discrepancy between the characterization of "the responsible company" as defined by itself or by notation agencies and, on the other hand, the hierarchy of criteria according to the answers of polled people. When companies and agencies favor sustainable development and good governance, rejecting child labor and so on, polled people consider that the paramount criterion of ethical conduct is personnel management. The problem is right here. Such is the view of a positively critical economist, situated at the point where macroeconomics meets corporate management.<br>

Abstract: We respond in language to catastrophic, or traumatic, shocks to symbolic systems, for which the fall of the Tower of Babel can be seen as a mythic model. One response is an exploration of new uncertainties; another is a fearful rigidity that seeks to return to an imagined Adamic wholeness of language; another is an effort to transcend language altogether. This essay examines two contemporary responses to a perceived "fall" of language-several case studies of Oliver Sacks's and two novels by Don DeLillo-and places them in the context of the twentieth-century "linguistic turn" in the humanities and social sciences and what I call a "counterlinguistic turn" that is contemporaneous with the linguistic turn and represents developments of some of its key assumptions.<br>

Abstract: On peut noter que Jean-Francois Billeter etablit une distinction generale entre les
deux systemes de pensee, grecque et chinoise, qui recoupe, dans ses grandes lignes, celle
exposee par Jullien: "On peut apercevoir [...], me semble-t-il, une difference fondamen-
tale entre la pensee grecque et la tradition intellectuelle qui en est issue d'une part, et
l'ensemble (ou presque) de la pensee chinoise de l'autre. Notre tradition intellectuelle a
eu tendance a privilegier la conscience thetique et la conscience reflechie, qui font toutes
deux abstraction du mouvement, du changement, des transformations dans lesquels nous
sommes continuellement pris dans les faits. [...] La philosophie a par consequent eu dans
notre civilisation une vocation "theorique," contemplative. La pensee chinoise me parait
avoir ete, dans l'ensemble, beaucoup plus fidele aux donnees de lexperience commune, au
rapport spontane que nous entretenons avec nous-memes et avec les choses dans le cours
de nos activites. Elle a donne la priorite aux formes que notre vie consciente prend lorsque
nous nous mouvons, que nous agissons, etc., et a celles que la realite a pour nous dans ces
moments-la" ("Comment lire Wang Fuzhi?" 111-12).<br>

Abstract: Dans cette perspective, toute pratique de lecture
peut être décrite comme un mouvement en trois temps :
«avant lire »/«lire »/«après lire». Des «intérêts
à la lecture » qui trouvent leur origine dans la situation
du lecteur - « avant lire » - incitent à un « faire » - « lire » -
qui porte à conséquences, immédiates ou différées
- «après lire» - et qui consolident en retour les «intérêts
à la lecture ». L'accent mis classiquement sur la seconde
phase (« lire ») - qui est aussi la plus difficilement
accessible à l'enquête - est alors déplacé sur les deux autres.<br>

Abstract: The structural analysis of myth is a prime focus of anthropological interest, largely because of the efforts of Levi-Strauss. This paper uses some Levi-Straussian ideas to develop a strategy for myth analysis that I call the non-sense-in-myth strategy (NIMS). The strategy is given a trial run on a well-known and (I believe) much-misunderstood myth: Adam and Eve in Eden. The structure identified has an evolutionary character consistent with many modern understandings concerning the nature of human reality. NIMS, a mediator between Levi-Straussian intellectual leaps and a real methodology, indicates the value of cautious optimism concerning the question "Can structural analysis of myth become a scientific endeavor?"<br>

Abstract: Lucy Bregman's approach to Schreber's "Memoirs" is scrutinized and found to be based on a number of fallacious and contradictory assumptions that call her interpretation of the book as personal religious myth into question. A social constructionist approach to mythology maintained by Berger and Luckmann is advanced, suggesting that at best Schreber's work qualifies as a quasi-mythical attempt to explain the source of his personal sociopsychic suffering. The family and interpersonal dynamics of Schreber's quasi-myth are investigated. Similarities to other cases of psychotic quasi-myths are noted and a general relationship between oppressive socialization and psychotic communications is advanced, as well as a specific alternative interpretation of Schreber's work to that proposed by Bregman.<br>

Abstract: A presente análise do conto "Seqüência", do livro Primeiras estórias, de Guimarães Rosa, pretende demonstrar um recurso recorrente de estruturação das "estórias" do autor. Esses enredos mobilizam, de uma maneira geral, o motivo da viagem e, de uma maneira particular, o percurso do eterno retorno. Nesse trajeto estrutura-se a travessia por um rito de passagem, cujo desfecho dá-se, com uma espécie de sobrelevação lendária, numa paisagem mítica. Para perfazer esse processo, o autor parte de um motivo da cultura popular que acaba amalgamado ao universo da tradição erudita, por meio de referências à tradição da história do gênero da narrativa e de seus códigos míticos. /// This analysis of "Seqüência", a short story from the book Primeiras estórias, by Guimarães Rosa, aims at showing a recurrent device used in the author's stories. These plots have, in a general sense, the motif of travel and, in a strict sense, the journey of eternal return. In this path, the traverse is structured through a rite of passage, whose completion occurs at a mythical scenery as a sort of legendary lifting. In order to accomplish this process, the author's starting point is a motif of popular culture, which ends up by being amalgamated to the universe of the erudite tradition, through references to the narrative genre historical traditions and to its mythical codes.<br>

Abstract: La stèle du Bronzo est gravée d'un oiseau "levé", en plein vol, la tête tournée vers l'extérieurs, superposé à un filon de quartz blanc; une crosse, également traitée en champlevé, lui barre le passage. En première lecture, une identification plausible du genre volatile semblait prévaloir et le colombidé emportait notre adhésion. Mais une analyse plus posée et un effort de déconstruction graphique du motif permettront cette fois de reprendre et d'affiner la reconnaissance, en décrivant les différents filtres autorisant tel ou tel rejet de catégorie ou d'espèce, pour ne conserver en dernier ressort que les meilleurs prétendants à la seule confrontation possible, celle qui oppose les corvidés aux colombidés. La représentation du Bronzo est en définitive équivalente en substance et en structure aux scènes figurées sur les stèles voisines dans lesquelles un phallus s'oppose qu tranchant d'une lame de hache (Mané Rutual), tandis qu'un cachalot affronte la coalition des animaux et des outils de l'homme (Table des Marchand). A "flushed" bird is engraved on the Bronzo stela, in full flight, its head turned to the exterior, superposed over a white quartz vein; a crook, equally treated in cut-away engraving, bars its passage. At a first reading, a plausible identification of the bird seemed to prevail and the Columbidae met with our approval. However, more deliberate analysis and an effort at the graphic deconstruction of the motif allows the identification to be reconsidered and improved, by describing the various filters authorising the rejection of such or such a category, finally preserving the best claimants to the only possible confrontation, opposing Corvidae to Columbidae. The Bronzo representation is equivalent in substance and in structure to the scenes on the neighbouring stelae where a phallus is opposed to the sharp edge of an axe blade (Mané Rutual), while a sperm-whale confronts the coalition of animals and human tools (Table des Marchand). However Bronzo is a deformed toponym, untranslatable as such; why not search in a more or less recent past, through some unavoidable semantic or linguistic evolution, for traces of a probable or possible mutation of the word? At the end of a brief investigation, we suggest that the expression Men Bran Sao, "The Stone of the Standing Raven", known from the early 19th century, is the name of this monolith. Nevertheless, the last time that a bird was directly observed on this stela was during the 5th millennium; the two closely conected fragments, on the model of the neighbouring Grand Menhir, prove that the stone has not been displaced since that distant period. We consequently propose this explanatory hypothesis to explain in Bronzo such a radical change of name: a zoomorphic mythical entity that we recognize as a pigeon, attached since time immemorial to the stela in question, passed under the influence of the Brittonic language and the new culture to the designation of another ornithological entity, the raven. If a bird as clearly identified as the Bronzo has played a determining role in the mythical Neolithic Armorican bestiary, like the sperm-whale, a scientific step is now necessary to find some hidden occurrences in other poorly understood signs, since such an important representation in our interpretive schema, unique in Brittany, cannot remain isolated. We correspondingly claim, in this coherent and logical research prolonging the Bronzo discovery, that the only possible appropriate solution for the famous "horn" signs is a bird shown full on, in flight, with spread wings.<br>

Abstract: Ruskin's complex attitude toward women has long been important to feminist and Victorian studies; over a quarter-century ago Kate Millett published Sexual Politics and its famous attack on Ruskin's essay "Of Queens' Gardens." She charged Ruskin with promoting a sugar-coated but perfidious system of separate spheres for men and women. Yet shortly after Ruskin produced that idealized vision of housewife-queens in 1865, he created a new ideal queen in his mythological study The Queen of the Air (1869), this time elaborated from Athena. Through his mythopoesis, Ruskin disrupts both conventional gender categories and his own implication in them. Ruskin presents a series of binary oppositions that he immediately conflates: Athena and Medusa, air and earth, bird and snake, formation and destruction, science and myth, male and female. Ruskin documents the instability of his oppositions through a bizarre "natural language" where real-life creatures such as birds and snakes serve as eternal hieroglyphs, signifying universally recognizable abstractions. That seemingly fixed signs in Athena's hieroglyphic code inevitably change is clear from Ruskin's acknowledgment of Darwin's evolutionary theory. But evolution slips into a wild image of degenerative metamorphosis, where all the divisions that Ruskin has so laboriously noted dissolve. Since Ruskin identifies Athena with each seemingly opposed animal signifier in his language of living hieroglyphs, he subverts all linguistic difference and ultimately feminizes signification itself. Through myth Ruskin creates a mutable language, one where genders as well as signs become mobile rather than fixed.<br>

Abstract: The rhetoric of social work often seeks its legitimacy and authority on the idea that knowledge can be translated into skills. Knowledge is made in universities in the form of timeless, objective, context-free truths about people and social institutions. Such knowledge rationalizes and justifies the professional practices of social work. It is not clear, however, that the knowledge-into-skills story fully explains social work practices. Practice is often ineffective and tends to throw social workers into moral quandaries, leaving them to practice in a context of faith and doubt. In addition to skills, social workers share values, purposes, the wielding of and submission to power, and mythic stories. Timely, value-expressive, contextual knowledge helps social work to create and maintain social solidarity and to shift its dispositions of skills, purposes, power, and myth to keep up with the pace of social change.<br>

Abstract: Hannah Arendt's and Charlotte Delbo's writings about the Holocaust trouble our preconceptions about those who do evil and those who suffer evil. Their jarring terms "banal evil" and "useless knowledge" point to limitations and temptations facing scholars of evil. While Arendt helps us to resist the temptation to mythologize evil, Delbo helps us to resist the temptation to domesticate suffering.<br>

Journal Title: Popular Music<br>
Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i371785<br>
Date: 10 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): Vianna Jonathon<br>
Abstract: Popular music plays important roles in two related films portraying Brazilian slum life. Based on a 1953 play by Vinícius de Morais, Marcel Camus's 1959 film Orfeu Negro, and a 1999 feature by Brazilian director Carlos Diegues titled Orfeu, augment traditional samba styles with bossa nova and rap, respectively. Interpreting musical style as allegorical texts within fictive landscapes, this paper examines conflation and conflict among musical meanings, Brazilian social histories, and discursive identities marking the twentieth century. Broad aspects of Brazilian political and socio-cultural development are implicated, such as authoritarianism, the politics and sociology of race, technological advances, mass media, and modes of modernisation. Here, bossa nova and rap engage society through reflexive and generative interpretations within a narrative designed to illustrate connections between processes of innovative, trans-national cultural production, myths of national identity, social change, and the powerful role of popular music in film.<br>

Publisher: Religious Ethics, Inc.<br>
Issue: i40000905<br>
Date: 4 1, 1980<br>
Author(s): McCann Dennis P.<br>
Abstract: This essay explores the imaginative foundations of ethics, not by presenting a theory about the moral imagination, but by reconstructing the hermeneutic strategy underlying Reinhold Niebuhr's proposal for "an independent Christian ethic." The thesis is that Niebuhr's ethic cannot adequately be evaluated without careful attention to his hermeneutics, what he described as "the mythical method of interpretation." This point is argued first, by reconstructing Niebuhr's hermeneutics; second, by showing how his hermeneutics determines the strategy of his ethics; and third, by using this focus to clarify certain issues separating Niebuhr and some of his recent critics, specifically, William Frankena's criticism of his metaethics, Gene Outka's objections to his normative ethic of love as self-sacrifice; and John Howard Yoder's rejection of the strategy of his Christian realism as a whole. The essay is presented in the hope that Niebuhr's example will encourage American religious ethicists to explore the relationship between hermeneutics and ethics with greater intellectual sympathy and theoretical sophistication. The example of Niebuhr's "independent Christian ethic" is commended as one attempt to map the formal and substantive ways in which religious visions help shape our dispositions and moral choices.<br>

Abstract: This article constitutes an exploration of Mahmud Darwish's poem, "The Hoopoe," as part of a study on the relationship of myths to culture, in general, and to literature and poetry, in particular. It starts from the hoopoe as a mythical symbol pulling the text in two directions. First, a direction that relates the poem, through time, to the realms of the universe, dream, and poetry, using the language of insinuations and allusions; second, a fictional direction that makes of the the poem-through evocation of previous quest journeys, including texts by Al-Jahiz, Avicenna, Al-Suhrawardi, Al-Hallaj, Aristophanes, and Farid Al-Din Attar-a quest into the depths of the individual and the collective self. Memory, history, and language, culminate in the discovery of the mother-land. Thus, Darwish's poem may be classified as poetry, prose, drama, and epic. It is, in fact, a mixture of all these genres, as well as a literary myth narrating the story of the search for a sacred time-the time of beginnings, and of childhood. /تمثل المقالة حفراﹰ استبطانياﹰ في قصيدة "الهدهد" لمحمود درويش - ضمن بحث في علاقة الأساطير بالثقافة عامة وبالأدب والشعر خاصة - انطلاقاﹰ من الهدهد كرمز أسطوري يتجاذب النص في اتجاهين اثنين: أ- اتجاه جدولي، يصل القصيدة - عبر الزمن - بعالم الكون وعالم المنام وعالم الشعر في لغة اللمح والإشارة٠ ب- اتجاه أفقي قصصي، يجعل من القصيدة - عبر رحلات نموذجية سابقة ومن خلال نصوص حاضرة غائبة للجاحظ، وابن سينا، والسهروردي، والحلاج، وأرسطوفان، وفريد الدين العطار، وغيرهم - رحلة في أعماق الذات الفردية، وفي أعماق الذات الجماعية ذاكرة وتاريخاﹰ٠ تجمع قصيدة درويش بين "الشعر" و"النثر" والمسرحية والملحمة، كما أنها أسطورة أدبية تقص علينا قصة بحث عن زمن مقدس هو زمن البدايات والطفولة٠‬<br>

Abstract: The rationalist fantasy of the Enlightenment is the myth of the nonviolent origins of virtue, typically represented through the image of rational birth. This myth falters when Odoardo Galotti, invoking the second birth of reason, kills his daughter. This article examines Lessing's Die Erziehung des Menschengeschlechts-essentially a treatise on the phylogeny/ontogeny distinction-in terms of a recuperative rationalist gesture that continues to inform Freud's oedipal theory as well as Claude Lévy-Strauss's understanding of the "cerebral savage." These theories are not treated as methodological frameworks for reading Lessing but rather as evidence of the tanacity of Enlightenment desires, which are already problematized by texts like Emilia Galotti.<br>

Abstract: On étudie, dans les textes de deux poètes nicaraguayens, Pablo Antonio Cuadra et Ernesto Cardenal, le recours au temps des mythes primordiaux par l'actualisation de la figure du héros fondateur et, parallèlement, la projection d'une situation historique présente dans une perspective eschatologique où la fin des temps est aussi la fin et l'accomplissement du Temps. Se estudia, en los textos de los dos poetas nicaragüenses Pablo Antonio Cuadra y Ernesto Cardenal, el recurso al tiempo de los mitos primordiales por la actualización de la figura del héroe fundador y, paralelamente la proyección de una situación histórica presente a una perspectiva escatològica, en la que el fin de los tiempos es también el fin y el cumplimiento del Tiempo.<br>

Abstract: Richard Rorty uses Nietzsche to show that people need to create themselves because there is no foundationalist language which they can establish as an anchor. Although this perspective is Nietzschean, it is not Jamesian, and so Rorty misappropriates James when he conflates James and Nietzsche as like-minded progenitors of the mythologizing of a privileged vocabulary. This essay evaluates Rorty's reading of James by considering whether truth in Rorty's textualist sense can abide by the stream of thought. Although James does mythologize privileged vocabularies, he believes that words need to reflect the world more accurately (something Rorty would never say) by abiding by the flux of experience. As such, James recognizes the value that old words have as tools. Whereas Rorty shows disdain for old words, James shows us the cash value those words have in helping us to do anything from paying our bills to constructing more practical and effective theories.<br>

Abstract: O presente artigo propõe uma interpretação do fenômeno Chico Xavier na cultura e na sociedade brasileira. A partir do reconhecimento da importância cruciai de seu modelo mítico de espírita exemplar, o lugar de absolute destaque ocupado pelo médium mineiro na história do kardecismo brasileiro será interpretado à luz de urn código cultural articulado em sua biografia, que busca sintetizar os personagens paradigmáticos do "santo" e do "caxias". Desdobrado na unidade de sua obra mediúnica e trajetória pública, o tipo de espiritismo construído em Chico Xavier evidencia a proposta kardecista dominante ao longo do século XX, enquanto modelo de cidadania, prática religiosa e projeto nacional. The present article is a reading of the place of the phenomenon Chico Xavier in the Brazilian culture and society. Starting from the recognition of his crucial importance as a mythical model of exemplary spiritualist, the absolute prominence of the medium in the history of the Brazilian spiritualism will be interpreted in the light of a cultural code articulated in his biography, that synthesizes the Brazilian mythical characters of the "saint" and of the "caxias". Unfolded from his life and works the model of spiritualism built by Chico Xavier evidences the kardecismo's dominant religious point of view along the 20th Century, while citizenship model, religious practice and national project.<br>

Abstract: Although today much of the Mayo-Yoreme sacred myths and their inherent symbolism is rather esoteric knowledge, known to a few only, the community's performance of the responso (ritual of honoring the dead) is important for the re-establishment of relationships between humans and the supernatural beings and between living persons and the ancestors. The communal experience of the responso and the sense of beingenjoined are characteristic of the spiritual experience and fundamental to the musical experience as well Since life/death of any individual is an experience tied to other individuals, I argue that a philosophical inquiry of selfhood—of both the individual and the community—may help us reason about and make possible an understanding of the responso.<br>

Abstract: Ce texte propose un examen de la figure d'Eva Perón, épouse du président populiste de l'Argentine, Juan Perón, comme icône de l'identité argentine. Elle est récupérée comme un espace d'identification inéluctable dans l'imaginaire politique national et la représentation que l'on se fait d'elle varie selon la conjoncture et les acteurs en jeu. L'« Evita populiste » incarne une image maternelle de protection des secteurs populaires, tandis que l'« Evita Montonera » et l'« Evita piquetera » dessinent les contours d'un profil révolutionnaire. Qu'en est-il alors de l'appropriation que fait la Présidente actuelle de l'Argentine, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner? Ce travail a comme but d'examiner la spécificité des différentes lectures du mythe et de montrer que loin d'avoir diminuée, l'importance de cette figure reste fondamentale dans les manières de faire encore aujourd'hui de la politique en Argentine. Este texto propone un análisis de la figura de Eva Perón, esposa del presidente populista de la Argentina, Juan Perón, como ícono de la identidad argentina. Dicha figura se constituye en un espacio de identificación ineluctable para el imaginario político nacional, pero las representaciones que se construyen varían en función de la coyuntura política y de los actores involucrados. La "Eva populista" encarna una imagen maternal y protectora de los sectores populares, mientras que la "Evita montonera" y la "Evita piquetera" evocan un perfil revolucionario. ¿Que tipo de apropiación propone la Presidente actual de la Argentina, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner? Este trabajo tiene como objetivo examinar la especificidad de las diferentes lecturas del mito y mostrar que lejos de haberse disipado, la importancia de esta figura continua marcando la forma actual de hacer política en Argentina.<br>

Abstract: In an empirical study using five real-world creative teams from an advertising agency, participants were given a strategic brief for a new beverage product and asked to design the layout for a print ad. Think-aloud concurrent protocols obtained from each team's copywriter, art director, and the two working together were analyzed to examine the creative process and its relationship to the created advertisement. Interpretive analyses of the protocols reveal that the teams access culturally available plot patterns but in different ways. In this study and with the particular materials and situational context explored here, four of the five teams chose to pursue a single mythic structure to the apoarent detriment of their final product. Only one team engaged in fully diversified idea generation involving a wide range of alternative scenarios. Not coincidentally, as a tentative conclusion, this more flexible team produced the ad judged most successful by advertising professionals. This still-to-be-tested exploratory finding deserves further investigation in future research that embodies various methodological refinements.<br>

Abstract: The winter of discontent continues to exert a powerful hold over the British political imaginary. It acts as a discursive key to a collective mythology seemingly appealed to, and conjured, in each wave of industrial unrest, in each hint of political turmoil and, until recently, whenever the election of a Labour Government looked credible. In this paper I consider the rhetorical strategies and linguistic devices deployed by the tabloid media in the narration of the events of the winter of 1978-79. I argue for an interpretation of the winter of discontent as a moment of state crisis. By crisis however I do not refer to the mere accumulation of contradictions but rather to a moment of transition, a moment of decisive intervention. Within such a framework, the winter of discontent emerges as a strategic moment in the transformation of the British state, and perhaps the key moment in the pre-history of Thatcherism. For, as I hope to demonstrate, the initial appeal of the New Right was premised upon its ability to offer a convincing construction of the winter of discontent as symptomatic of a more fundamental crisis of the state. In such a moment of crisis, a particular type of decisive intervention was called for. In this discursive construction of crisis the New Right proved itself capable of changing, if not the hearts and minds of the electorate, then certainly the predominant perceptions of the political context. It recruited subjects to its vision of the necessary response to the crisis of a monolithic state besieged by the trade unions. This was perhaps the only truly hegemonic moment of Thatcherism. It occurred well before Mrs Thatcher entered Number 10. It is thus not surprising that one of the most enduring and distinctive legacies of Thatcherism has been the new political lexicon of crisis, siege and subterfuge born of the winter of discontent.<br>

Abstract: Serge Lifar built his career during the 1930s, a decade crucial to understanding his 'années noires'-or 'black years', as the French historian Henry Rousso called the period of the German occupation of Paris (1940—1944). Lifar's powerful and respected position at the Paris Opéra, the social connections he had built and maintained and the psychological impact of exile: all these elements help clarify Lifar's accommodating attitude towards the German occupants of his adopted city. During the 1930s Lifar came to be accepted in French intellectual society as the 'heir' of Serge Diaghilev. Through his publications he made a powerful contribution to the process by which Diaghilev's Ballets Russes assumed its paramount position in the development of modern ballet, a process set in motion by the impresario himself. Lifar played this role chiefly in France. In the English-speaking world, where relatively few of his books appeared in translation, other writers served to canonise the Diaghilev endeavour, albeit for somewhat different ends. A list of Lifar's publications in Russian and other languages (French above all) displays the growing influence of his actions and authority, the power of his connections (inherited primarily from Diaghilev), and his relentless will to overcome the problems of emigration as he secured not only success as a dancer and choreograph but also a public reputation as an intellectual. The recent discovery of new evidence has led to the identification of the respected Pushkin authority Modeste Hofmann as the writer whose unacknowledged work enabled Lifar to establish himself as an historian. This evidence, provided by Hofmann's grandsons André and Vladimir Hofmann, raises serious questions about the authority of Lifar's books. An interplay of subjective relationships is woven into the texture of these narratives in which survival and ambition, a paternal attitude and filial respect, exist in constant tension. Neither the making of these books nor the myth of Russian dance which they espouse can be understood without placing their authors in the milieu they shared in Paris as Russian émigrés.<br>

Abstract: The analogy between Plato's notion of khora in the Timaeus and Derrida's notion of khora as a surname for différence should include the mythic elements described in the opening verses of Genesis. The elements are not an irrational chaos but provide a principle of indeterminacy that gives creation unprogrammability, risk, and the possibility of the event.<br>

Abstract: To discuss the practice of memory and its relations to politics, social scientists rely on three kinds of practices - memorialising, memorising and the act of remembering/forgetting. The commemoration of "1857" is unique in that official celebrations of the event have been instituted even as 1857 continues to refigure in myths and endures as a symbol of popular resistance. The articles in this special issue address the seeming contradictions and complexities that "remembering" 1857 involves, and the tension that prevails between different kinds of recall.<br>

Abstract: This article explores how the concept of ecosystem ecologies, one of the most influential models of systems thinking, was developed in relation to the radioactive aftermath of US nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific Islands. Historian Richard Grove has demonstrated how tropical island colonies all over the globe served as vital laboratories and spaces of social, botanical, and industrial experiment in ways that informed modernity and the conservation movement. I propose a similar relationship between the militarized American island colonies of Micronesia and how their constitution as AEC laboratories contributed to both atomic modernity and the field of ecosystem ecology. This was enacted through metaphorical concepts of island isolation and distributed visually by Atomic Energy Commission films that upheld an aerial vision of the newly acquired atolls for an American audience. Finally, the myth of isolation is also at work in the ways in which Marshall Islanders exposed to nuclear fallout became human subjects for radiation experiments due to the idea of the biological isolate.<br>

Abstract: The works of Lewis and Girard share several central interests but seem divided by opposite views of myth. Lewis' novelistic retelling of the myth of Cupid and Psyche, however, provides a bridge: it depicts an ancient society organized around sacrifice and myth as understood in Girard's cultural theory and tells a Girardian story of conversion, in which the narrator discovers the imitative and rivalrous nature of her desire. Her rivalry and reconciliation with the story's true god carries the novel beyond Girardian myth to a contrary kind of narrative identified with fairy stories, which can extend Girard's approach to Christian conversion.<br>

Abstract: Paradise Lost traces evil through three inceptions-Satanic, Adamic, and historical. Each origin seems to envision a different etiology: Satanic evil springs exclusively from the self in an instant of radical "Pelagian" freedom. Adamic evil emerges from the ambiguous interplay between self and seductive environment. Historical evil contaminates the whole race by means of necessary "Augustinian" inheritance. Ricoeur's analysis of the "Adamic Myth" and original sin clarifies etiological traditions Milton assimilates from Christian symbol, myth, and dogma. Through Ricoeur, we can identify the contrasting modalities of evil (inherited and imitative, physical and moral, ontological and existential, necessary and free, communal and individual) fused in Paradise Lost. Ricoeur's work reveals Milton's text to be a subtly inclusive etiological myth, one whose complex genesis of evil recovers Scripture's fullness of meaning in a new mythopoesis.<br>

Abstract: Historiography in Francoist Spain (1939-75) sought to affirm the morally and historically correct role of the regime within the flow of Spanish history. As an important vehicle of dissidence, the novel of memory stands in sharp contrast to Francoist history: it explores the past largely eschewed or appropriated by the regime and contests the so-called truths that Franco shaped through the discourse of myth. This essay examines the role of subjective memory as a challenge to historiography and discloses the narrative strategies novelists used to counter the government's myths. Unlike Francoist historiography, the novel of memory lays out history as a series of disruptions and undermines the referential illusion of truth and wholeness in our understanding of the past.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur Nabila<br>
Abstract: The "Myth of Creation" in its East African formulation is the central chapter in a book entitled, The Sacred Meadows, by an Egyptian anthropologist who did his field work in the early seventies among the Lamu community in Kenya on the shores of the Indian Ocean. The translator, in her own introduction to the translation, presents the outline of the book and provides the geographical and cultural context of the community in question. The author, in this translated chapter, sets out by exposing his theoretical position which combines both Structuralism and Functionalism. Insights from Claude Lévi-Strauss and Bronislaw Malinowski as well as those of Paul Ricoeur and Victor Turner join to develop the author's notion of myth and its symbolic mode. Then the text of the myth, in its Lamuan formulation, is narrated, followed by a close reading and analysis of its binary oppositions, mediating terms, and the underlying existential contradiction at its crux. Angels, jinn, light, fire, earth, wind, water, Adam, Eve, Cain, Abel, Satan, serpent, etc. are the agents of this sacred narrative and cosmic drama. The textual unfolding of the myth is followed by an analysis, which makes use of the structural method and explores the semantic connotations of Swahili words and idioms to explain the logic of the symbolic exchange and the rigor of thought. The themes of unity and multiplicity and their different combinations are delineated in this analysis and the repetitions and their relation to transcendence are explained.<br>

Abstract: Methods and results of the structural study of myth and Old Testament source and textual criticism are applied in this analysis of the myth of Moses. The context of the myth is first traced out through the historical circumstances conditioning the myth's textual development, and the major contradiction underlying the myth is identified. The myth is then shown to have served as a model through which the Israelites could resolve their conflicting political and religious aspirations through the details of Moses' life as presented in the myth.<br>

Author(s): Watts Karin R.<br>
Abstract: This paper focuses upon the prevalent complementary definitions of myth and history and questions their analytic utility with reference to literary documents that bespeak the transition between mythic and historic cognition. In the style of ethnosemantic analysis, these definitions are treated as a semantic domain and subjected to formal analysis. The components elicited constitute a new definition - more precisely, a two-dimensional model of the relationship between myth and history. Subsequently, the model is applied to a series of books from the Bible with the conclusion that men and women are structurally equal since, in their roles as social actors, both represent different components of myth as well as history.<br>

Abstract: This paper explores the
         sugyain the Babylonian Talmud that includes the story of the Oven of Akhnai, in BTBaba metzi‘‘a58b––59b, expanding earlier studies by Jeffrey Rubenstein and Charlotte Fonrobert. It shows that two scriptural quotations involving, respectively, David and Tamar, situated in the first part of thesugya, anticipate the subsequent story and clarify how it functions as a ““foundation myth”” of the Beit Midrash (Fonrobert), and, therefore, of male identity (Boyarin). I suggest that the entiresugyaconstructs male identity by way of contrast with two ““others,”” the divine and the female realms, which are excluded from the Law-making process. The danger of verbal wrong, however, reveals the necessity of reintroducing the excluded ““others.”” The text achieves this by recognizing the existence of a transcendent justice, and by making Tamar, a foreign and female character with no access to the Law, a model of delicacy in verbal communication.<br>

Abstract: The academic study of Kabbalah has largely been limited to myth and symbol as the two viable forms of kabbalistic discourse. In this essay, I resist those limitations and explore two other possible literary forms: history and fiction. I do not mean history in any positivistic sense but closer to Steven Greenblatt's description of new historicism as cultural poetics. This suggests that literature not only reflects a historical setting but also creates that setting, constructing reality in its own image and directing it toward its desired ends. In looking at Lurianic Kabbalah as fiction, I raise the issue of the “real” and the “true” as it relates to fictive narratives more generally. This essay does not claim that the kabbalists in question did or did not intend to write cultural poetics or fiction. Rather, I use cultural poetics and fiction as possible lenses through which a nontraditional interested reader (i.e., one not invested in the literature as authoritative) can read these texts in a way that can speak to the contemporary world in which we live and think.<br>

Abstract: The combinatory and ludic polyculturalism, the parodic transmutation of meanings and values, the open, multilingual hybridization [which] are the devices responsible for the constant feeding and refeeding of this “baroquizing” almagest: the carnivalized transencyclopedia of the new barbarians, where everything can coexist with everything. They are the machinery that crushes the material of tradition, like the teeth of a tropical sugarmill, transforming stalks and husks into bagasse and juicy syrup.

Abstract: Fitzgerald's nostalgic style, though, set an example of how a nostalgic narrative could be structured, and in its aftermath it was used by such different authors as Evelyn Waugh in
      Brideshead Revisited(1945), Anthony Burgess inA Clockwork Orange(1962) and the works of Kazuo Ishiguro. The author's own later work employs it as well. The technique of using the reader's textual memory in order to evoke a phenomenological nostalgic experience is very evident in both versions ofTender Is the Night(the 1934 original, and Malcolm Cowley's 1951 restructuring). In the 1951 version, the structure of the narrative closely follows the pattern of happiness and reflection. An early description of a Swiss valley communicates an awe of life and nature: “The sun swam out into a blue sea of sky and suddenly it was a Swiss valley at its best—pleasant sounds and murmurs and a good fresh smell of health and cheer” (9). In the transitory third book, “Casualties: 1925,” the tone has changed from appreciative to melancholic, as in this description of the small town of Amiens: “In the day-time one is deflated by such towns, with their little trolley cars of twenty years ago crossing the great grey cobble-stoned squares in front of the cathedral, and the very weather seems to have a quality of the past, faded weather like that of old photographs” (138). At the end of the novel both Dick and Nicole Diver become obsessed with youth and the past as well as with time: “for Nicole the years slipped away by clock and calendar and birthday, with the added poignance of her perishable beauty” (228). Toward the end of the novel, Nicole's last sight of Dick—“her eyes followed his figure until it became a dot and mingled with the other dots in the summer crowd” (386)—forces the reader to reflect in a reversed movement. Instead of vanishing like Dick, this image suggests a backward recollection of what was a Swiss valley “at its best.”<br>

Rather, as DuBose argues, based on the painful experience of his wife's miscarriage, as “‘child’ and ‘parent’ disappeared, our bodies and our society
      dys-appeared, and our connections and hopes re-appeared” (374). Jabbeh Wesley attaches the reappearance of the hopes for the healing and reconstruction of her Liberian world to people's ability and willingness to truly experience the painful process of grief and, perhaps informed by that cathartic experience, allow compassion and empathy to guide their relationship to others.<br>

Abstract: Some time ago, Paul Ricoeur pointed out that “the symbol gives rise to thought.”
      
               These diasporic religious communities enable us to find a new beginning for thought that has the possibility of avoiding the exclusivity and elitism that has too often accompanied the objective meaning of thought as a science of the rational. Not only these diasporic religions, but also the very conundrum of the continent of Africa as a whole, to echo Skinner at the beginning of our paper, may serve in the same manner as one of the most important ways that thought might be renewed—and the relationship of thought to action and performance.38<br>

Abstract: Second, how do we account for the fact that the processes of public memory are both created by individual choices and nurtured in collective contexts? Many scholars have productively addressed this question by unpacking specific examples in which individuals or groups vie to control public memories. The critical framework I recommend offers a more systematic approach to this issue. To view representations of the past through the nested lenses of rhetoric, public memory, and the agential spiral is to focus on how human beings—individually and in groups—forge connections with people of other times through the medium of public agency. The agential spiral, derived from my reading of Ricoeur's “threefold mimesis,” aims to pinpoint three moments in the construction of narratives in which human action is represented and reinterpreted within a temporal structure. As a critical framework, the agential spiral helps us to view the creation of public memories at three key moments and to see the process as a coiling whole. Using this tool, we can better understand why certain memories persist in certain societies and how those memories powerfully connect people across time as well as space.<br>

Abstract: What is left unsaid in this article about the relationship between utopia and rhetoric could certainly fill the pages of many books. The range is especially rich when we turn to contemporary rhetorical theorists who specifically address society as a value to be combined with a remembered or imagined better place, as in Nedra Reynolds's
      Geographies of Writingor bell hooks'sBelonging: A Culture of Place.
               Just as constitutive rhetoric (that is, cumulative discourse that contributes to building the structure of human society) has been important in the works of theorists often cited by utopists as crucial to their work, so the utopian impulse continues to be inherent in the way rhetoricians see their subject. To persuade verbally or visually, we must have our own idea of what is socially better, and we must also be able to imagine what our audience believes to be better. The function of utopia, then, may be less philosophical and ideological at its root than it is linguistic in a pragmatic sense. As Kenneth Burke has written of human beings, we are “the symbol-making, symbol-using, symbol-misusing animal … rotten with perfection.”38

Abstract: Milan Kundera has described this kind of comedy as echoing a joyous, life-affirming laughter—“the serious laughter of angels expressing their joy of being.”
      
               But that is not to suggest that there is anything divinely pious in this position: if Joyce is an angel, then he is one, like Stephen Dedalus, who will not blindly or uncritically serve.168
            
               In commenting upon an earlier version of this article, Patrick Parrinder spoke of “the difficult relationship between Utopia and comedy.” This relationship is problematized by the fact that Utopia rarely seems able to laugh at itself or therefore to offer the liberating possibilities of comedy. Joyce's later writing, however, appears to advance the rare chance of a pluralist, ambiguous, and dynamic vision of Utopia: a Utopia that might be sustained into futurity—a Utopia that still has room for dreamers and for democrats. But is it still possible that we can call this realm of radical openness, this flux of possibilities, this resolutely material site, Utopian? And do we really need to? This kind of Utopia is not a category or a frame but a direction, a progress, a confluence of streams of consciousness and of unconsciousness, flowing into the river of life: not just a symbolic river but a real one too, the Liffey, the great Anna Livia Plurabelle herself. Or as Joyce put it, more succinctly (and more joyously), it is simply “Lff!”169

Abstract: It is in this sense that Utopia can be understood as
      lying before us—in both senses of this confounding double phrase. Utopia resides in the past (beforein this instance means “behind us”) inasmuch as any reconsideration of Utopia in the present must inevitably begin with the past. But if the sources of Utopia in the present reside in the past, realization is in the future (beforein this instance means “ahead of us”). It is this double valence that links the articles that make up this special issue. Some deal with historical figures, literature, or places, while others take up analogous considerations that are closer to us now. However, in each case, the future is what is at issue: What shape will it take? How might the circumstances of its emergence be as propitious as possible? These key questions suffuse all of the articles that follow and are of the greatest urgency to all disciplines but in particular for architecture and urbanism, which are burdened with providing the stage upon which we play out the drama of our lives, individually and collectively.<br>
