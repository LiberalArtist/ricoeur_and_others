  Book Title: Regard for the Other: Autothanatography in Rousseau, De Quincey, Baudelaire, and Wilde-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burt E. S.<br>
  Abstract: Although much has been written on autobiography, the same cannot be said of autothanatography, the writing of one's death. This study starts from the deconstructive premise that autobiography is aporetic, not or not only a matter of a subject strategizing with language to produce an exemplary identity but a matter also of its responding to an exorbitant call to write its death. The I-dominated representations of particular others and of the privileged other to whom a work is addressed, must therefore be set against an alterity plaguing the I from within or shadowing it from without. This alterity makes itself known in writing as the potential of the text to carry messages that remain secret to the confessing subject. Anticipation of the potential for the confessional text to say what Augustine calls the secret I do not know,the secret of death, engages the autothanatographical subject in a dynamic, inventive, and open-ended process of identification. The subject presented in these texts is not one that has already evolved an interior life that it seeks to reveal to others, but one that speaks to us as still in process. Through its exorbitant response, it gives intimations of an interiority and an ethical existence to come. Baudelaire emerges as a central figure for this understanding of autobiography as autothanatography through his critique of the narcissism of a certain Rousseau, his translation of De Quincey's confessions, with their vertiginously ungrounded subject-in-construction, his artistic practice of self-conscious, thorough-going doubleness, and his service to Wilde as model for an aporetic secrecy. The author discusses the interruption of narrative that must be central to the writing of one's death and addresses the I's dealings with the aporias of such structuring principles as secrecy, Levinasian hospitality, or interiorization as translation. The book makes a strong intervention in the debate over one of the most-read genres of our time.<br>

  Author(s) Welzer Harald<br>
  Abstract: Early in the
                  Culture of Narcissism, Christopher Lasch calls our attention to the way in which unremitting self-awareness has become the bane of modern society. We long, he suggests, for the “suspension of self-consciousness.” Modern man, “imprisoned in his pseudo-awareness of the self … would gladly take refuge in anidee fixe, a neurotic compulsion, a ‘magnificent obsession’—anything to get his mind off his own mind.”¹ A similar idea can be found in a recent book by Christopher Bollas titledBeing a Character: Psychoanalysis and Self-Experience. Believing that mental health demands a tolerance for a variety of inner states,<br>

  Abstract: Romanticism can and has been criticized, and these criticisms also apply to technoromanticism. I start by enumerating some of them. First, technoromanticism may lead to escape to a different reality, create distance, and constitute a disengaged relation to the (real) environment. Since the new worlds of games, films, and virtual realities are so immersive, this seems to come at the expense of engagement with “this” world. Second, technoromanticism may lead to self-absorption and narcissism: insofar as romantic use of technologies such as the Internet and smartphones enables retreat in our fantastic inner, private world where we find harmony and can<br>

  Levinasian Substitution in the Theater of Transcendence from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1wvwdtb">Rethinking Sincerity and Authenticity</a><br>
  Abstract: What Celan’s line reveals, if paradoxically, is that there is at least one more problem with self-congruence.¹ Specifically, ”Sincerity and the Problem of Individualism” recognizes that the modern obsession with self-congruence may often be less virtue than vice. Despite Polonius’s advice, life (the moral aspect of it, in particular) involves being true not so much to myself as to the others who surround me. An uncompromising commitment to self-congruence, therefore, stands at odds with the moral imperative’s defining commitment to doing for others around me. Self-congruence resembles, instead, self-interest and the narcissism that threatens genuine ethical concern for others.<br>

Abstract: Accordingly, Meyers examines the role of a series of gender‐specific images in women’s agency, addressing pronatalism, mother‐child imagery, the family, narcissism, aging, and sexuality. Each of these topics could occupy a book, and one hopes that Meyers will expand on the ideas developed here. The strength of this approach is the familiarity of the subject matter to a large audience—although not to all women—and Meyers strives to remain conscious of the fact that she cannot make universal claims about women. But many readers will find something in the text that resonates with their own experience. (Meyers’s discussion relies in part on interviews with women.) For example, when she criticizes “matrigyno‐idolatry” (32) or the pressure to become a mother, she does not merely report on tensions that some women face. Nor does she simply analyze the power of social discourse to manipulate women’s choices. Rather, she sticks to her middle path, demonstrating persuasively that there is currently no space in matrigyno‐idolatrous discourse for genuine autonomy for women, and she makes a parallel point for each set of images she examines. Whatever choice one makes—including the choice to remain childless, which, she correctly points out, is seldom considered by feminist theorists—there is a cultural image ready at hand to define and constrict women’s agency.<br>

Article Title: Coleridge’s Philosophy of Prayer: Responsibility, Parergon, and Catachresis<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 603531<br>
Date: 10 2009<br>
Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: Through this notion of being‐for‐God, we can see more clearly how prayer functions in the above notebook entries. In 1810, Coleridge had argued that prayer mediated between conscience and action: this makes sense, as prayer attests and bears witness to one’s sense of responsibility to God. It is the act of recognizing the demand of conscience and answering it, even if the only human answer that is truly faithful and appropriate sometimes seems to be guilt itself, tangled in its very attitude toward the promise of grace: “Mercy! mercy!” (N6244, fol. 74v). In 1827, the terms in question are those of activity and passivity: how can the human will bend itself into accord with the divine will? The answer is that the “I” must wrestle with the narcissism of its own being in order to attest to its being‐for‐God. In prayer, the human subject can be both “agent” and “patient”—that is, one who acts freely as a self but through this very act recognizes and accepts the self as for another, even as a gift from that other. Hence, this is the heart of Coleridge’s philosophy of prayer: being for and before God, “turning your thoughts into acts by connecting them by an act with the idea of the Redeemer God.” In prayer, a phenomenological intentionality directed solely toward our sense of responsibility—“a conscious will‐effected sense of his presence” (N6155)—can at least help orientate our being before and for God. This is why Coleridge can assert that in prayer alone is the life or will united with the idea of God (e.g., N5228, N5383) and why it can be a way out of the gnarled condition of sin. If one at least acknowledges one’s being‐for‐God, even if only in contemplating one’s abandonment of it in all other acts and intentionalities, then the economy of Christian salvation can be initiated: “O for the
         powerto cry out for mercy from the inmost / That would be Redemption!” (N3353).<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 659348<br>
Date: 4 2011<br>
Author(s): Landy Joshua<br>
Abstract: Is this a little narcissistic?
         19Yes, but the beauty of it is that narcissism is the only strategy appropriate to the context. To be sure, Kaufman's movie is really a movie about Kaufman, not Orlean; but then, Orlean's book was really a book about Orlean, not Laroche.The Orchid Thiefis not about flowers, or Laroche, or even orchid hunting more generally; it is, instead, about the ability, so yearned for by Orlean, “to care about something passionately.”20So, too, Charlie projects his own frustrated desire—in his case, for reciprocated attraction, for release from the prison of solipsism—onto the subject matter. (Immediately after an imagined Susan advises him to “find that one thing that you care passionately about and then write about that,” the film cuts to Charlie saying into his voice recorder “we see Susan Orlean, delicate, haunted by loneliness, fragile, beautiful.”)21And so, too,Kaufmanprojects onto ithisown desire, this time for a Hollywood film that would just be about flowers. In short, paradoxically, Kaufman captures the spirit ofThe Orchid Thiefprecisely by being unfaithful to it.<br>

Abstract: Thus, for example, we might propose that the depravity and malevolence that constitute evil be defined along two dimensions. The first would identify its source as internal or external in the sense of originating in the human or the diabolical. Are human actors affected by evil as victim or perpetrator, prey or predator, as the motive of action or the consequence of action by others? This distinction requires presupposing a valence of moral responsibility that problematizes both the claim that “the devil made me do it” and confronts the dilemma of whether it is possible to be or do evil without knowing it. The second would identify its mode as active or passive in the broad sense, in which the behavioral manifestation of the former is the positive malevolence of violence and abuse, with the associated moral emotion of hatred and moral stance of hostility, and in which the behavioral manifestation of the latter is the negative malevolence of disregard and neglect, with the associated moral emotion of self-love and moral stance of narcissism. This distinction requires presupposing a qualitative difference between actions such as assault, dispossession, displacement, debasement, or enslavement on the one hand and lack of care, abandonment, delegitimization, and failure to recognize on the other.

Abstract: When Poor Tom rushes onstage, his wildness and weirdness are utterly astonishing. Lear, however, strives to close the gap between the stranger and himself by asserting an essential similarity. As if to blunt the force of Edgar’s alterity, Lear equates the beggar’s condition with his own.
      
            Though Kent objects that Poor Tom has no daughters, Lear is undeterred in his identification. He will not allow that Edgar’s situation might exceed his own: “Death, traitor! Nothing could have subdued nature / To such a lowness but his unkind daughters” (3.4.65–66). Lear’s approach is all wrong, and not just on points of fact. By comprehending Edgar’s suffering within the circumference of his own, Lear effectively denies Edgar’s difference and makes himself the model for all misfortune. Staged like this, Lear’s empathy looks a lot like narcissism.
               
         Didst thou give all to thy two daughters,
               And art thou come to this?
               · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 
               Has his daughters brought him to this pass?
               Couldst thou save nothing? Wouldst thou give ’em all?
               (3.4.47–48, 59–60)
            
            It is unseemly, and it does nothing to deliver Lear from the solitude of being that manifests itself in this play as madness. When Lear cozies up to Poor Tom as to a known quantity, his mental state precipitously declines. Before long, he is removing all his clothes—a sure sign of madness in Shakespeare’s day.31
         
            As a corrective, then, to the conventional view that32
         Learis all about empathy, we ought to acknowledge that though the king comes to think of others as of himself, this is not enough to heal him. Indeed, it is in a fit of fellow feeling that Lear strips himself naked and provides conclusive proof that he is mad.<br>

Article Title: Generic Studies: Their Renewed Importance in Religious and Literary Interpretation<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263709<br>

Author(s): Wiggins Mary<br>
Abstract: In recent years, the need for a critique of "reader" as rigorous as that which has been developed for "text" and for "author" has become increasingly acute. Whether in the study of religion as story and biography or in interpretative reading in general, a critical notion of reader is essential if the act of reading is to be anything other than mere consumption of texts. Some new way of understanding the hermeneutical circle is required to avert the narcissism latent in the Anselmian model. The notion of "genre" as developed by four recent theorists is helpful in the task of constructing a critique of "reader." E. D. Hirsch, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Tzvetán Todorov, and Paul Ricoeur have each surpassed the idealist notion of genre as a classificatory device and developed in its place the notion of genre as a generative pinciple. Todorov, for example, illustrates how "form" is a theoretical, as distinct from a descriptive or explanatory, issue. According to both Hirsch and Todorov, somewhere between empirical details and metaphysical thematizations lie generic formulations which can assist the reader to organize his/her response to the text and to recognize the probable understanding toward which the conventions of the text are directed. In Gadamer's theory of interpretation, the notion of genre acquires historicity. After Gadamer, genres can no longer be regarded as timeless a priori categories. Rather, because they are constituted by historical reflections, their rise and decline are intrinsic to text-interpretation. Finally, in Ricoeur's theory that generic considerations are correlative principles of production and interpretation, we find a basis for understanding genre as praxis. If we understand reading to be isomorphic to authoring, it becomes clear that the reader can no longer be regarded as the self-evident recipient of text-signification. Genre, in Ricoeur's theory, transforms "speech" into a "work" and points toward a new notion of "reader" as one whose reconst~<br>

Abstract: On démontrera en particulier que le caractère strictement phénoménologique de la psychanalyse existentielle permet non seulement de dépasser la forme traditionnelle de la métapsychologie psychanalytique et le caractère reificateur de ses concepts, mais encore que celle ci a même anticipé la problématique specifiquement narcissique de Kohut. Le fait que cette psychanalyse existentielle puisse formuler les problèmes de manière plus adèquate en raison de son approche phénomenologique n'exclut pas que, inversement, la théorie narcissique puisse à son tour crtiquer la psychanalyse existentielle, là où celle ci tend à poser les états psychopathologiques comme structures d'être. Cet article se termine par une considération critique sur le manque de place que la théorie narcissique accorde à la sexualité et sur l'apolitisme radical de celle ci qui la démarque de la théorie sartrienne et de son évolution philosophique. First it is demonstrated that the strictly phenomenological approach of existential psychoanalysis is able to overcome the traditional form of the Freudian psychoanalytical metapsychology by means of its concretizing terms. Then it is pointed out that existential psychoanalysis has been anticipating problems, especially in the field of Kohut's theory of narcissism. The fact that it can illustrate these problems more adequately because of its phenomenological approach does not mean that the other way round the theory of narcissism cannot criticize the existential psychoanalysis — that is to say in its tendency towards attributing a psychopathological state to patterns of being. Lastly critical remarks are made regarding the diminution of sexuality in the theory of narcissism as well as its apolitical sealing — off — the latter being in contrast to the further development of Sartre's philosophy.<br>

Abstract: Es wird der Begriff der „Lebensgeschichte“ zur Diskussion gestellt. Am Beispiel ausgewählter Therapie-Konzeptionen (Dührssen, Cremerius, Loch, Kohut, Morgenthaler) wird gezeigt, daß in jeder therapeutischen Richtung verschiedene Segmente des lebensgeschichtlichen Problemfeldes isoliert, ausgearbeitet und zum Ansatzpunkt des therapeutischen Handelns gemacht werden. Die entsprechenden Konsequenzen für Diagnostik, Therapie und Forschung werden im Blick auf aktuelle Strömungen der therapeutischen Psychoanalyse (Ich-Psychologie, Narzißmus-Analyse, Repräsentanzenlehre, hermeneutische Psychoanalyse) verdeutlicht. The concept of „life history“ is the theme of this discussion. Working from a selection of therapy models (Dührssen, Cremerius, Loch, Kohut, Morgenthaler) it can be shown that in every therapeutic approach various segments from the problem area of life histories in general can be isolated, developed and made into the central point of therapeutic activity. The relevant consequences for diagnosis, therapy and research will be clarified with respect to present-day movements in therapeutic psychoanalysis (ego-psychology, the analysis of narcissism, hermeneutic psychoanalysis).<br>

Abstract: The five main arguments that Freud employs against the love commandment in "Civilization and Its Discontents" are examined in light of the psychological and ethical doctrines they presuppose. Freud's theory of narcissism is explored for its implications regarding psychological egosim, altruism, mutuality, universal love, and equality. A normative response to Freud's critique of the love commandment is sketched.<br>

Abstract: In this paper a distinction is made between two conceptions of the ego in freudian metapsychology. According to the first conception, a conception which Freud never gave up, the ego is conceived as a specific function on the surface of the living organism ; it is the result of a progressive differentiation of the Id ('Es') under the driving power of internal stimuli and external reality. Fitted with specific neutral, i.e. non-conflictual functions as perception, memory, control of the bodily motions and consciousness, the ego has to defend the individual as a biological living organism against the threats from without and within. In this conception the ego is treated as an instance that doesn't take part in the different psychic conflicts. We analyse the philosophical presuppositions and show the metapsychological disadvantages of this hypothesis that has been worked out especially in the American ego-psychology. According to the second conception, that takes into account important clinical pheno mena as identification, idealisation, narcissism, ideal of the ego, the ego is conceived as a metaphorical effect of a specific psychic act. With Lacan, we try to analyse and to interpret this specific act as an act that causes an infinite splitting in the ego : the ego is constituted as a subject that from its origin is separated from itself. Instead of being a biological function that lives in the immediate metonymical prolongiation of the living organism, it rather has to defend a certain representation of himself. This point of view doesn't exclude a purely functional description of the ego ; but the different functions have now to be interpreted differently because the ego is the effect of conflicts in which it takes part (consciousness is interlaced with unconsciousness, perception with denying...). In the last part of our study we show how Freud makes the philosophically important distinction between the ego as an object of the Id and the ego as a subject that has to~<br>
