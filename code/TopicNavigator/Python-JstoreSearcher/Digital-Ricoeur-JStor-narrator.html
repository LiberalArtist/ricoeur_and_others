  Abstract: I want to begin with an unlikely text, Jonathan Valin’s novel
                  Day of Wrath, a crime novel, in fact a work belonging to that unrefined subgenre known as the “hard-boiled” detective story. The novel’s protagonist and narrator is named Harry Stoner, and the name aptly suggests the qualities of a detective-hero. Stoner, of course, has a hard and tough exterior, but more than that, his name defines a set of psychological traits which set him apart from his environment. He is self-contained, independent, resistant to the corruption that surrounds him, and impervious to social pressure. A rugged individualist and an<br>

  Abstract: The narrator of

The event he cites first is that fateful evening when his “mother abdicated her authority,” in the young Marcel’s bedroom at Combray; the second encompasses the many months during which the narrator observed the slow death of his grandmother.¹ The narrator is anguished: not only did he inflict pain on his mother when he “traced in her soul a first wrinkle and caused a first white hair to appear,” but also he wounded<br>

  Abstract: The
                     Purgatorioopens with a solemn exordium, rich in anticipation and tension, that develops in three stages (1–12). First we are given the graceful but exultant image, dear to the mannerist tradition, of the “waters” and the “little vessel” that will “course” even as it “lifts her sail.” Next, the first-person narrator dramatically (“and what I sing”) offers the firm, clear definition of the theme. Finally, there is an invocation to the Muses recalling, like some mysterious legend, a famous episode in Ovid’sMetamorphoses.<br>

  Abstract: Edmond Dantes, the narrator of Italo Calvino’s short story “The Count of Monte Cristo,” shares the fate of the story’s original protagonist in Dumas’s novel of the same title. Calvino’s story of the Château d’If that imprisons Dantes is a parable of human existence. As Calvino puts it, the “fortress . . . grows around us, and the longer we remain shut in it the more it removes us from the outside.” Paradoxically, by working out the possibilities for escape, Dantes is compelled to mentally construct the perfect fortress from which there would be no departure.

  Abstract: Many of the difficulties modern readers experience with
                     Paradise Lostare reactions to one character, God the Father. The Father, defending himself and combating Satan, often resembles a flawed human being. Consequently, to presume, as the narrator frequently does, that he manifests supreme goodness seems a mockery of truth. Offended, moderns may retort that, far from being supremely good and deserving worship, the Father deserves to be repudiated as evil. Jung's analytical psychology, however, offers a more refined perception, which promotes a more balanced response.<br>

  Abstract: More than any other biblical story or cycle of tales, the book of Ruth belongs to the dramatic genre. Structured as a series of short, eventful scenes animated by spirited, dynamic dialogue, it can be easily adapted for the stage. The conversation in the book of Ruth is either between two protagonists or between a protagonist and “chorus” (in the form of the women of Bethlehem, or the workers in the field, or the elders at the gate), but there are usually no more than two principal interlocutors in any given scene. The story’s narrator possesses only limited omniscience, offering<br>

  Book Title: Reading the Allegorical Intertext: Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: Judith H. Anderson conceives the intertext as a relation between or among texts that encompasses both Kristevan intertextuality and traditional relationships of influence, imitation, allusion, and citation. Like the Internet, the intertext is a state, or place, of potential expressed in ways ranging from deliberate emulation to linguistic free play. Relatedly, the intertext is also a convenient fiction that enables examination of individual agency and sociocultural determinism. Anderson's intertext is allegorical because Spenser's Faerie Queene is pivotal to her study and because allegory, understood as continued or moving metaphor, encapsulates, even as it magnifies, the process of signification. Her title signals the variousness of an intertext extending from Chaucer through Shakespeare to Milton and the breadth of allegory itself. Literary allegory, in Anderson's view, is at once a mimetic form and a psychic one-a process thinking that combines mind with matter, emblem with narrative, abstraction with history. Anderson's first section focuses on relations between Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and Spenser's The Faerie Queene, including the role of the narrator, the nature of the textual source, the dynamics of influence, and the bearing of allegorical narrative on lyric vision. The second centers on agency and cultural influence in a variety of Spenserian and medieval texts. Allegorical form, a recurrent concern throughout, becomes the pressing issue of section three. This section treats plays and poems of Shakespeare and Milton and includes two intertextually relevant essays on Spenser.How Paradise Lost or Shakespeare's plays participate in allegorical form is controversial. Spenser's experiments with allegory revise its form, and this intervention is largely what Shakespeare and Milton find in his poetry and develop. Anderson's book, the result of decades of teaching and writing about allegory, especially Spenserian allegory, will reorient thinking about fundamenta~<br>

He tries to clarify his intentions, which—unlike those of earlier novelists—are no longer concerned with expounding moral norms.

His starting point, he says, is as follows: “I had nourished the ambitious desire of composing a tale of chivalry, which was to be in the style of theCastle of Otranto, with plenty of Border characters and supernatural<br>

  Abstract: Kafka’s last completed story has become something of an allegory of contemporary theoretical approaches in the humanities. In ‘Josefine, the singer, or the mouse people’, the narrator, a mouse, ponders the phenomenon of Josefine, a mouse who sings. The problem with Josefine is that she actually seems to make the same kind of noise as all the other mice, but she makes a performance of it, claiming that what she does is very special. She is able, moreover, to make a career out of being a ‘singer’, despite the doubts voiced by some of her audience. Kafka’s story plays with<br>

  Abstract: Belief, or its absence, haunts Douglas Coupland’s most dispirited protagonists. The wilderness reflections, for example, uttered by the anonymous narrator of ‘In the Desert’ – one of the thematically interconnected narratives in
                  Life After God– pivot around a sensation of spiritual dissatisfaction that is shared by many individuals in Coupland’s fiction. This desert sojourner’s conviction that he was raised in a creedal vacuum, without fixed beliefs – a personal history ‘clean of any ideology’ – is optimistic but, as he suspects, not entirely credible. The blank-slate, zero history contexts that he and many of his contemporaries view as normative are, above all else,<br>

  Book Title: Conrad's Marlow-Narrative and death in 'Youth', Heart of Darkness, Lord Jim and Chance<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wake Paul<br>
  Abstract: Variously described as ‘the average pilgrim’, a ‘wanderer’, and ‘a Buddha preaching in European clothes’, Charlie Marlow is the voice behind Joseph Conrad’s ‘Youth’ (1898), Heart of Darkness (1899), Lord Jim (1900) and Chance (1912). Conrad’s Marlow offers a comprehensive account and critical analysis of one of Conrad’s most celebrated creations, asking both who and what is Marlow: a character or a narrator, a biographer or an autobiographical screen, a messenger or an interpreter, a bearer of truth or a misguided liar? Reading Conrad’s fiction alongside the work of Walter Benjamin, Maurice Blanchot, Jacques Derrida and Martin Heidegger, and offering an investigation into the connection between narrative and death, this book argues that Marlow’s essence is located in his liminality – in his constantly shifting position – and that the emergence of meaning in his stories is at all points bound up with the process of his storytelling.<br>

In its attempts to get to grips with Conrad’s most famous creation, this study has certainly approached Marlow in both senses: asking of him both who and what. Is Marlow a character or a narrator, a biographer or an autobiographical screen, a messenger or an interpreter, a bearer of the truth or a misguided liar?

  Abstract: As with numerous other New Testament writings, Israel’s Scriptures form the foundation on which the narrative of the Gospel of John is written. Ushered in with the opening verses of the prologue, Scripture appears throughout the Gospel and is even identified as one of the “witnesses” for Jesus’s defense (5:31–47), showing up in explicit quotations along with a number of varyingly transparent allusions and references. Indeed, so crucial is Scripture to the Gospel’s plot that the narrator winds the sequence of events tightly to the Jewish festival calendar whose own roots stretch into Israel’s scriptural past.¹ Yet it is<br>

While it is true that, in the narrator’s words, “Hirshl and Mina’s story is over,” the novel itself does not conclude with their dialogue. In fact, instead of granting the reader a sense of closure, the novel ends with the narrator’s statement that Bluma’s story isnotover. The narrator also promises the reader that “everything that happened to Bluma Nakht would fill another book.”¹ This promise, however, was never fulfilled.

  Abstract: In Modiano’s novels of the seventies, eighties and early nineties, the young female characters tended not to be very developed, broadly speaking: they were fairly generic ‘mystery women’ who attracted the young male narrator, often leading him to make undesirable acquaintances, and then disappearing without explanation, breaking his heart and giving him a reason to write about the experience. They were often a little, at times much, older than him, and their lives subordinate to that of the male narrator, both in narrative terms—that is to say, they were never narrators—and in terms of sheer content.

  Abstract: Hardly anything is more familiar to literary scholars than fictional narrative. Yet this simple term contains a slight tension between the

How can you invent what you know or know what you invent? In all standard models of narratology, the answer to this question has been to split the tasks and distinguish between the narrator who knows and the author whoinvents, and this is the case particularly in the framework of Gérard Genette.²<br>

  Book Title: Mirages and Mad Beliefs-Proust the Skeptic<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Prendergast Christopher<br>
  Abstract: Marcel Proust was long the object of a cult in which the main point of reading his great novel
      In Search of Lost Timewas to find, with its narrator, a redemptive epiphany in a pastry and a cup of lime-blossom tea. We now live in less confident times, in ways that place great strain on the assumptions and beliefs that made those earlier readings possible. This has led to a new manner of reading Proust, against the grain. InMirages and Mad Beliefs, Christopher Prendergast argues the case differently, with the grain, on the basis that Proust himself was prey to self-doubt and found numerous, if indirect, ways of letting us know. Prendergast traces in detail the locations and forms of a quietly nondogmatic yet insistently skeptical voice that questions the redemptive aesthetic the novel is so often taken to celebrate, bringing the reader to wonder whether that aesthetic is but another instance of the mirage or the mad belief that, in other guises, figures prominently inIn Search of Lost Time. In tracing the modalities of this self-pressuring voice, Prendergast ranges far and wide, across a multiplicity of ideas, themes, sources, and stylistic registers in Proust's literary thought and writing practice, attentive at every point to inflections of detail, in a sustained account of Proust the skeptic for the contemporary reader.<br>

Unlike Ovid’s poetic invention of a distant mythological past, Hazlitt’s prose version takes place in the quotidian world of London’s lodging houses. However, early nineteenth-century London has no pagan Venus who can effect the metamorphosis required by Hazlitt’s narrator.

And indeed the authority of the narrator, as I have tried to show, may itself be questioned. The poem even encourages us to do so. There is a curious example to which Stanley Fish (unfortunately for his argument) calls attention in the preface to the second edition of
                  Surprised By Sin. He calls it “an apparently small moment in Book II.” Satan has just thrown himself into the “wilde Abyss” (2.910) and begun his journey to our<br>

  Abstract: In this study I have argued that Mavis Gallant and Alice Munro have adapted conventions of elegy within fictional frameworks, a practice refined by modernist fiction-elegists such as Virginia Woolf and James Joyce. A digressive structure, the focus on the self (on the narrator-elegist or character-elegist as survivor), and a tendency towards selfreflexivity are characteristics of both modern and late modern fiction-elegies. But where Woolf and Joyce employ self-reflexivity as a trope of consolation and suggest that the work of art is an immortal and idealized product achieved at the end of the work of mourning, Gallant and Munro use<br>

  Abstract: Unlike any other medium, literature has the ability to employ the reader’s imagination in the construction of bodies. When a narrator communicates information about a text’s characters, the reader completes the act of constructing bodies by imagining their contours, postures, and gestures. A character’s gender is thus dependent upon both the narrator’s speech—his/her use of nouns, pronouns, and adjectives—and the reader’s expectations regarding gender. If the narrator omits information about the character’s gender, the reader finds clues in the text—social cues, behaviors, and actions—to fill in that information and assign one. Such moments activate literature’s potential<br>

Abstract: Drawing in particular on the analogy between the demigod carrying the world on his shoulders and the storyteller holding up her fictional world, Winterson’s self‐mythologizing as Atlas—her retelling of the mythical adventures of the Titan in the first person—extends the relevance of
         Weightbeyond authorial metafiction. The storyteller, indeed, is not just the writer of fictions; she is also the teller of the story of her own life, and in this sense, rewriting retains its existential drive to project human existence narratively. Winterson’s narrative rests upon the simile of the book of nature. “The strata of sedimentary rock are like the pages of a book, each with a record of contemporary life written on it,” she writes, using black and red lettering and varying letter size to highlight the materiality and mediality of writing (Winterson2005, ix; cf. Hayles2002). Proceeding to retell the beginning of the world—“In the beginning there was nothing” (Winterson2005, 3), we read in a reformulation of Genesis 1:1–2, which might be Winterson’s or Atlas’s—the narrator, rejecting the notion that all “the rest is history” (5), explains: “All the stories are here, silt‐packed and fossil‐stored. The book of the world opens anywhere, chronology is one method only and not the best” (6).<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: Jean Santeuil, the protagonist of Proust’s eponymous and second aborted novel, may be considered a predecessor of Marcel in
         À la recherche du temps perdu.48The narrator ofJean Santeuilrefers to Jean’s “contemplation” as the practice, superior to “pleasure, thought, and memory,” which, willfully embraced, and fueled by imagination, gives us back our “soul” as an aggregate of the “relics of our life.”49In this novel already, as he will later do inÀ la recherche du temps perdu, Proust postulates imagination as a faculty that, unable to apply itself directly either to present circumstances or to past memories,50“floats” around those past realities that are “captured” (prise) by present experience via the mediation of memory.51Although it adheres to Bergson’s principle of “harmonization” between present impression and analogous recollection,52Jean’s contemplation contradicts Bergson’s advocacy of a constantly transformative, hands‐on intervention on reality. When one talks of contemplation in Proust, in fact, obligatory reference must be made to Schopenhauer, whose influence on the French writer was certainly not inferior to Bergson’s.53<br>

Abstract: The Victorian geologist is highly important here, writing the narrative of time and thus rescuing both the individual and the human species from apparently inevitable destruction by claiming the authority to interpret deep time. The abyss of time may dwarf the individual, but it is also meaningless without the geologist-narrator, who thus claims the authority to control the past. Zimmerman focuses very much on the work of Lyell here, though she also brings in Gideon Mantell, the connections between the work of those two geologists being well known. The brief encapsulation of early and mid-Victorian geology appears, to the eye of the specialist historian of geology, a little lightweight. Nevertheless, it leads nicely into the discussion of the effects of Victorian geology on Tennyson's poetry. Nature “red in tooth and claw” is the oft-used example of the influence of geological writings on Tennyson, and Zimmerman does look at
      In Memoriam; her main focus, however, is a more unusual case study. She examinesThe Princess, tracing the use of both catastrophist and uniformitarian language throughout the poem and emphasizing that the fairy tale, in this case, does have a happy ending, providing some comfort to those Victorians lost in the great expanse of time.<br>

Abstract: Derrida took up another way to think of the gift without these obligations. Comparing his pure gift with the promise, several matters emerge. Because the pledged token is not the fulfillment of the promise itself, it resembles this pure gift. Derrida took as an example of the impossibility of a pure gift a counterfeit coin circulated in Charles Baudelaire’s “Counterfeit Money.”
         40One dimension of Baudelaire’s brief poem is the ambiguity that attends one character’s gift to a beggar: does he give a real coin and only say it was counterfeit to preserve his dignity in front of his friend, so he might “give in secret” as Jesus demanded?41The two friends encounter the beggar, offer some money to him, and then the friend of the narrator speculates what might happen with the counterfeit coin. A question hangs over the poem: did the man really offer a counterfeit coin? We must distinguish this coin from the promissory token since a promissory token does not forever defer or resist closure, unlike the putative counterfeit coin that is never tested to see if it is real or not. The promise as an actual gift is ambiguous so long as the pledge remains unfulfilled. No amount of scrutiny of the promised token can disclose whether the promise proves true or not. But the expectation of the recipient need not turn into endless dissemination and deferral. Rather, the token bears a relationship to the future and so the donor, by giving her word, in fact hands over sovereignty, hands over honor, transfers her name to the recipient. This sort of gift is “given back” to the donor when the recipient trusts her. The donor receives honor from the one promised in this trust. The countergift of trust is truly free and uncoerced, since the token is not the gift promised but is its double. The one receiving the pledge of promise never has the promise in actual view but only a word, a pledge, or a mere token. This gift has force so far as the one receiving trusts the one making the promi~<br>

Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263716<br>
Date: 6 1, 1930<br>
Author(s): Underhill David R.<br>
Abstract: This essay examines, from the point of view of an existential hermeneutics, five accounts of transpersonal experience: Robert Monroe's Journeys Out of the Body, Paul's experience in the third heaven in II Corinthians 12, a description of rapture by Teresa of Avila, a disembodied vision of guardian spirits by John Lilly from The Center of the Cyclone, and the vision of the assault of the Lords of the Dead from the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Through a consideration of world, embodiment, death, care and other existential categories, the discussion in each case focuses on a central ambiguity about the personal identity of the narrator. The question of authenticity, in a Heideggerian sense, is posed to these materials, and the central ambiguity is shown to strike so deeply as to undercut the assumption of autonomy as the criterion of authenticity. Being-toward-death is relativized in such experiences, but relativized by an even more radical threat to individual existence. In conclusion, some generalized principles are offered as heuristic criteria for interpreting transpersonal experience in general.<br>

Abstract: Caryl Phillips's narrative is painfully concerned with the relationship of Empire, Colony, and the In-between; Europe, Africa, and the Caribbean; slavery, rebellion, and freedom; Men, women and children; absent or useless fathers and damaged, aimless sons. It explores what hold in common while never losing sight of the painful quotidian, the specific. It is a narrative where the picaresque shakes hands with the epic and the linearity is broken, encircled, and put fast forward or in reverse by a mise-en-abîme of sorts: the tale-within-the-tale-within-the-tale even if interrupted by the tapestry of an emergent voice that finally proposes itself as both the identity and the difference of its verbal universe. "Enter your own self and discover the world," Phillips seems to be saying, "but also go out into the world and discover yourself." Once that call is answered, fiction itself becomes another way of questioning truth as we strive for it through the paradox of a lie. That lie can be called the imagination. It can also be seen as a parallel reality. For it may be observed as a critical mirror of what passes for the truth in the world of convention. It certainly sets up a second universe of being, where the narrator, say Cambridge in Cambridge, has a reality greater, though no less important, than the host of hastily met and then forgotten people we deal with on a daily basis. It is in this sense that Phillips brings into light another way of telling in that his narrative gives weight and presence to the virtues and vices—the fugitive personalities—of our daily acquaintance. This is the prerogative of his style, which I try to discuss in this essay. It has the power to render disenchantment and pleasure without resolving the contradiction between them. In fact, what holds them in tension, as equal forces straining in opposite directions, is the artist's mature subjectivity, stripped of hubris, unashamed either of its fallibility or of the modest assurance it has gained ~<br>

Abstract: The paper considers early death as violent death caused by another person in the context of the Nazi concentration camps. With Hannah Arendt death is understood as destruction of personal identity, because writers cannot write a poem about their own physical death. Therefore, the present contribution based on the concept of the narrative identity (Paul Ricœur) will examine by the example of the poem „Der Häftling“ („The Inmate“) by Fritz Löhner-Beda how identity can be destroyed and stabilized by techniques of narrative defiguration and refiguration at level of the first person narrator of the poem and at level of the author's subject.<br>

Abstract: White Noise can be considered, in Leclair's terms, as « a systems novel », like Gravity's Rainbow or The Public Burning; yet, it is also acutely concerned with history in the making and with the fictionalization of the present through its instant recycling by the media. The narrator and protagonist shifts from a total involvement in the present moment to a tragic preoccupation with his individual future after the pollution alert, but he is never able to achieve that « refiguration » which, for Ricœur, constitutes the main strategy to try and beat the aporia of time.<br>

Author(s): KUUKKANEN JOUNI-MATTI<br>
Abstract: The narrativist turn of the 1970s and 1980s transformed the discussion of general history. With the rejection of Rankean historical realism, the focus shifted to the historian as a narrator and on narratives as literary products. Oddly, the historiography of science took a turn in the opposite direction at the same time. The social turn in the historiography of science emphasized studying science as a material and practical activity with traceable and documentable traits. This empirization of the field has led to an understanding that history of science could be directly describable from scientific practice alone without acknowledging the role of the historian as a constructor of narratives about these practices. Contemporary historians of science tend to be critical of science's ability to describe its object—nature, as it is—but they often are not similarly skeptical of their own abilities to describe their object: past science, as it is. I will argue that historiography of science can only gain from a belated narrativist turn.<br>

Abstract: Against the backdrop of the current popularity of the concept of narrative in the social sciences the authors analyse the uses of narrative analysis in empirical social research and provide a unifying frame based on Paul Ricoeur's notion of narrative mimesis. To begin they situate 'narrative' in the context of the social research tradition. Using both a simple and an elaborated definition of narrative they outline the main approaches to narrative analysis relevant to sociology and categorize them as structuralist, hermeneutic, or interactionist. The crux of the article is a discussion of Ricoeur's integrative model of narrative as threefold mimesis and its proposed methodological application in sociological narrative research. The authors argue that Ricoeur's model obviates undesirable analytical simplifications and encourages research that captures all the substantial aspects of narrative, including the producer (the narrator) and the recipient (the listener or reader).<br>

Abstract: This article explores the functions and legacy of Diedrich Knickerbocker, the fictional narrator-historian of Washington Irving's first major work, A History of New York, From the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty (1809). I argue that Irving deploys a number of self-conscious strategies to produce a cultural memory of New York in and through Knickerbocker and his text. Perhaps most important, Knickerbocker generates the first serviceable English-language account of New Amsterdam, an account that haunts the space of New York with its Dutch and Indian pasts. Second, by reflecting on the theories and craft of history, Knickerbocker explores the problems and possibilities of American historical representation. Third, through a range of quixotic strategies, Knickerbocker implicates the reader in the construction of his history. And finally, Knickerbocker actively writes himself into the story he is telling, merging his fictional identities with New York's history. By describing the ways in which Knickerbocker insinuates himself and his New York into the actual New York, I aim to trace the complexities of Irving's historiographic thinking and to show how accounts of the past can become part of a living cultural memory.<br>

Abstract: Faith is characterized by an unsolvable problem of justification. While St. Paul concludes the truth of the faith from the practice (cf. 1. Thess 2,13), the Evangelists quote Jesus Christ as important witness (cf. Mk 1,1–3), who bears witness to himself in a decisive moment (cf. Joh 8,12–20). Who legitimates the omniscient narrator of these christological confessions? By means of Genette's narrative theory and the hermeneutic theories of Bultmann and Fuchs, the specific demand which faith puts onto the human being, becomes apparent: the auctorial narrative form frees the fundamental narrations of faith from any kind of human justification, thus marking the special credibility which is inherent to listening to God's words.<br>

It argues that these texts illustrate and reflect an anthropological condition which can be described as ›eccentric positionality‹, a term coined by Helmuth Plessner, or ›constitutive homelessness‹. Self-narrating is both the expression of and compensation for that condition. According to Paul Ricœur it can be seen as an attempt to understand what is essentially indefinable: the individual self. Narrative configurations place different events, actions and perceptions in a (mostly) coherent order. By doing so, they configure the individual self as a being that changes in time. The novels by Hoppe and Esterházy display and simulate different modes of self-narrating between historicization and fictionalization, namely self-discovery (Selbstfindung), self-invention (Selbsterfindung), and self-determination (Selbstbestimmung). As these modes are confronted with different types of problems, they reflect the complex relationship of a person to herself as both the narrator and the protagonist of her life story.<br>

Abstract: In Colombia, society has come to be organized in terms of a division between those with and those without links to narcotrafficking. This moral boundary recently experienced a symbolic disturbance with the entrance on the country's cultural scene of Andrés López López, a former Colombian drug trafficker, and his El cartel de los sapos (2008). An examination of the discursive and political strategies employed in this book, in which drug trafficking is referred to through the metaphor "bacteria," allows us to understand the construction of a narrator who calls attention to the hypocrisy of the government and society regarding the reincorporation of narcotraffickers into civilian life while provoking a national debate on the difference between history and fiction. En Colombia, la sociedad ha llegado a organizarse en términos de una división entre aquellos que tienen y no vínculos con el narcotráfico. Este límite moral experimentó un reciente disturbio simbólico con la entrada de Andrés López López, un ex-narcotraficante colombiano, y su libro El cartel de los sapos (2008) en la escena cultural del país. Un análisis de las estrategias discursivas y políticas empleadas en este libro, en el que el tráfico de drogas se define a través de la metáfora de la "bacteria," nos permite entender la construcción de un narrador que devela la hipocresía gubernamental y social con respecto a la reincorporación de los narcotraficantes en la vida civil al mismo tiempo que provoca un debate nacional sobre la diferencia entre historia y ficción.<br>

Abstract: In her lecture "The Place of Imagination" (1994) Roberts confesses that her return to her figures of
mother and daughter is meant to evoke part of her childhood in France, a time which she recreates as paradise:
"They stand in, these images of lost bliss, as images of something even more specific than childhood: she who
is paradise itself for the baby, the growing child: the mother" ([1994] 1998, 20). For a thorough review of
this topic in Roberts's fiction, see Laura Lojo's recent article on the notion of the maternal body as paradise in
Robert's short story "Charity" (1994). She claims that this perspective is adopted by a narrator who positions
herself as a child, and whose vision is "dependant on language, memory and mythic reconstructions of her own
past" (Lojo 2012, 33).<br>

Abstract: Some sixty times in the Iliad and Odyssey, the narrator describes a sequence of events with the climactic phrase, "And now X would have happened, had not Y intervened." Though some recent studies have begun to focus on this narrative technique, a fuller accounting of its properties remains desirable, as many of the passages where it is employed are quite significant to the overall construction of the plots. I have termed the phenomenon pivotal contrafactuals. The present study argues that the composer achieves three general narrative benefits by employing this device. First, it is a method for emphatically changing the direction of the plot (hence the adjective "pivotal"). Second, it allows the narrator to confer added emphases of various kinds upon the events he describes. Third, the narrator often uses the construction to make an editorial comment upon the character on whose behalf the intervention occurs. Intriguingly, Homer appears to link some pivotal contrafactuals together through various means. Some occur as equivalent elements in different multiforms of a common type scene. Some occur in different narratives describing the same event. These latter raise the possibility that divine intervention of which he is unaware occurs in Odysseus's narrative of his wanderings. Finally, I suggest that a passage at the beginning of the Catalogue of Ships, which has attracted various interpretations, is a modified pivotal contrafactual.<br>

Abstract: Critics have traditionally treated the narrator's addresses as evidence to assess whether Chrétien promoted the ideal of courtly love in the "Charrete". If we consider the use of appropriation and recoil movements in the total text, the operation of the will emerges as the dominant theme of the text. This theme is considered in the context of the parallel but contrasting pacts formed by Lancelot in the service of Guinevere and Chrétien in the service of Marie de Champagne.<br>

Author(s): Christensen Peter G.<br>
Abstract: Georg Groddeck (1866-1934), one of the marginalized figures in the history of early psychoanalysis, defended homosexuality in his epistolary novel of 1923, Das Buch vom Es, published with the encouragement of Freud by the Psychoanalytischer Verlag in Vienna. Unfortunately, Groddeck's contribution to thinking about homosexuality during the inter-war period has been overlooked. His autobiographical narrator, Troll, claims that homosexuality is more characteristic of humans than heterosexuality. Societal disapproval of homosexuality, he feels, stems from negative feelings about masturbation. Groddeck supports these two ideas better than he does his more famous concept of the Es, which he uses to explain why humans contract diseases they want, despite apparent anger at or resistance to these maladies. Recent interest in Groddeck has somewhat waned due to exposure of his vehement racism, but further study of his views on sexuality in the light of poststructural psychoanalysis should be rewarding.<br>

Abstract: Michel Tournier is the most controversial French writer alive today. His fiction has provided fertile ground for diverse, often conflicting theoretical practices, and sharpened critiques, yet the author himself has remained aloof and is often perplexed at the way in which his work is received. Focusing on one story from Le Médianoche amoureux (1989), this article records a quest for the essential Tournier. Under the auspices of a master narrator, the reader of "Pyrotechnie" embarks on a voyage of discovery, which is ultimately one of self-discovery, for it finishes, delightfully, in the story-telling world of the child.<br>

Abstract: Vico maintained that metaphor is a fundamental process of human mental life which bridges the gap between emotion and cognition. This Vichian perspective is reflected in areas of critical theory treating metaphor and other tropes, particularly their use in narrative. In psychology too, the significance of metaphor is increasingly recognized despite the Cartesian emphasis on literal thought and language in contemporary psychology's central paradigm, cognitive science. The paper compares the Cartesian and Vichian perspectives and suggests that the former limits the integrated treatment of cognition and emotion. This is illustrated with an example of how a child's feelings about a distressing situation are both revealed and changed in storytelling. The Vichian perspective is more appropriate to understanding this therapeutic interaction of cognition and emotion through metaphoric narrative play. This perspective has significant echoes in psychoanalytic and textual studies suggesting how sensitivity to the latent content of narrative metaphors offers both speaker and hearer a unique insight into the experience of the narrator.<br>

Abstract: The attempt to write extreme violence, or to reco[r]d[e] traumatic cultural memory - the representation of horror - tests both the representational capacity of language and the rationality of subjecthood. Much narrative endeavour is spent trying to narrativise or 'structure' horror into story. However, because traumatic memories resist the narrative framework of the novel, questions are posed not only about the reliability of the narrator's memory and his/her ability to narrate a credible story, but also about the suitability of the fictional form of the novel to represent historical events such as extreme violence. How does language in narrative, with its insistence on order and sequence, 'capture' the destructuring nature of violence? Where is the subject or the idea of rational subjectivity in these de-structuring acts of violence? I will attempt to address these issues through a critical 'reading' of Moses Isegawa's novels Abyssinian Chronicles (2000) and Snakepit (2004). In these novels, Isegawa recasts and reenacts a period of recent Ugandan history marked by violence and chaos, emanating from the dictatorship of Idi Amin. However, both novels stretch the limits of 'factual' or historical credulity, reminding the reader that they are in fact works of historical fabrication. I am of the view that the narrative endeavour in these two novels is not only to record the chaotic events experienced during the years before and after the fall of Idi Amin, but to recode, through the tropes of language (symbol, imagery, and metaphor), the devastating effects of those years on the literary landscape of Uganda.<br>

Abstract: Cet article propose d'explorer les enjeux d'une écriture romanesque contemporaine définie comme douleur fantôme de l'histoire et exercice de ses mémoires possibles: deux séries complémentaires d'exemples – liées pour l'une à la réinvention d'une mémoire du bourreau par un narrateur « sosie » de l'historien (Manuel Vázquez Montalbán et Jonathan Littell), et pour l'autre à la saisie de l'historicité des temps présents sous l'angle conjoint de la mélancolie et de l'ironie (David Albahari, Aleksandar Hemon et Dubravka Ugrešić) – permettent d'éclairer l'ambition romanesque de transcription de l'histoire dans l'exercice « à-présent » (ou « au temps-maintenant » , selon l'expression de Walter Benjamin) de ses mémoires possibles. En courant le risque d'une rivalité ou d'une confusion trompeuse entre les statuts du discours historiographique et du récit romanesque, et en s'exposant à la récusation par le lecteur de sa légitimité en la matière, le roman contemporain choisit de s'établir dans les plis du savoir historien et ainsi d'engager ses moyens propres dans l'entreprise d'une écriture en palimpseste du texte virtuel, ou idéal, de l'expérience historique. This article sets out to investigate those aspects of the contemporary novel in which fiction writing delves into the ghost pains of history and experiments with its would-be memories. Two sets of complementary examples will allow us to shed light on this particular novelistic ambition, i.e. transcribing history into a "to-day" (or "now-time", to use a phrase coined by Walter Benjamin) experimentation with its virtual memories. The first set of texts (by Manuel Vázquez Montalbán and Jonathan Littell) illustrates the reinvention of the executioner's memory courtesy of a narrator passing himself for a double of the historian. The second series of novels (by David Albahari, Aleksandar Hemon and Dubravka Ugrešić) features several attempts to grasp the historical quality of present times at the articulation of melancholy and ~<br>

Abstract: This article analyzes the strategies by which the narrator of Caesar's Bellum Civile constructs his authority and promotes his version of the civil war. Despite being generally omnipresent, omniscient and un-intrusive, the narrator can abandon his covert position and all-encompassing knowledge and use multiple devices to guide the readers' perception of salient events. Switches of focalization, inferred motivation, presentation through negation and intratextual echoes color the narrative of key episodes, such as the negotiations of peace with Pompey in Book 1 and the descriptions of the battles at Dyrrachium and Pharsalus.<br>

Abstract: This paper analyzes the presenter in advertisements by means of a theoretical framework drawn from literary criticism. The paper adapts literary theory to explore the advertising "who" -- the presenter of a message. It turns to dramaturgy and narratology theory to formulate a trichotomy of advertising "points of view" -- first-person narrator, third-person narrator, and dramatic character. The formal and functional properties of each are discussed with advertising examples. Advertising consequences are illustrated with examples taken from Advertising Age's "Best Advertising of 1989" compilation. These are discussed in terms of media patterns, message strategy, and overall communication objectives. The discussion also suggests the need for additional research to understand hybrid and parody forms.<br>

Abstract: El artículo propone una lectura de la novela de Antonio Gil, Cosa mentale (1994), como construcción artificiosa del pasado a través de la puesta en juego de los procedimientos pictóricos aplicados a la poesía. El dictum horaciano ut pictura poiesis será revisado a partir del registro delirante y experimental de una novela que indaga en las maneras de configurar el pasado histórico recurriendo a temporalidades alternativas al tiempo de la modernidad histórica. De esta manera, según un criterio analógico, es posible identificar retóricas de la imagen y de la representación a nivel narrativo, en correspondencia con la narratividad pictórica. Finalmente, se entrega una interpretación sobre la perspectiva transhistórica del narrador que permitiría entender las anacronías narrativas como rupturas entre tiempo de la modernidad y tiempo del mito. This article proposes a reading of the Antonio Gil's novel, Cosamentale (1994), as an artificial construction of the past through the pictorial procedures applied to poetry. Horatio's dictum ut pictura poiesis will be revised on the basis of this delirious and experimental novel that explores a ways to configure the historic past resorting to alternatives temporalities in respect of historical modernity time. In this way, according to an analogical criterion, we identified rhetorics of the image and the representation in the narrative level, in correspondence with the pictorial narrative. Finally, we give an interpretation about the transhistoric perspective of the narrator that explains narrative anachronisms between the time of modernity and the time of the myth.<br>

This image is analysed, taking as reference Manet's Déjeuner sur l'herbe as well as Walter Benjamin's essay of 1936 on the subject of the narrator. The main points in this comparative analysis are the role of the narrator both in text and image, oral tradition versus visual space, the concept of the picture and the tradition of story representation. The author proposes the idea that modernity introduced a major change in the art of storytelling and in the narrative function of image.<br>

Abstract: Narratology may be thought of as a complicated system of conceptual filters that enact a severe formalist reduction upon the corpus of what may be thought and said about storytelling. According to Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan, this reductiveness needs to be expanded in order to attend more to language. One way of answering to her reformist prescription is a turn to the study of linguistic surface structure organized as a meditation on the metaphor of the filter. For Seymour Chatman this metaphor designates a character through whom a narrator elects to tell a story. For Max Black, "filter" is a trope for metaphoric process. Examining these senses of the filter in Henry James's short story "The Beast in the Jungle" leads to emphasis upon negations and belief qualifiers. In James's story, both turn out to be invaded by the logic of Freudian negation, itself a type of intrapsychic filtration.<br>

Abstract: This study considers Schumann's Kinderszenen (1838) from the point of view of the branch of literary criticism known as narratology. The author's aim is not to ascribe a specific narrative content to Schumann's cycle of thirteen brief pieces for piano, but rather to shed light on the inner nature of the work by identifying various ways in which Schumann adopts and adapts the techniques and strategies of narrative toward specifically musical ends. As the author observes, this approach is justified on at least two levels: first, by Schumann's passion for literature in general, and for the works of Jean Paul in particular; and second, by a variety of attributes of the work itself, the most obvious being the overall title as well as the specific titles given to its thirteen movements. Drawing on a broad spectrum of narratological writings - both in the areas of literary theory (Genette, Barthes, Ricceur) and musicology (Adorno, Newcomb) - the author proposes analogies between the various elements of literary narrative and their counterparts in Schumann's Kinderszenen. Specifically, the "narrator" of the cycle is identified with the composer himself, the overall structure of the work is construed as an "epic" as opposed to a "dramatic" one (owing to its articulation in thirteen diminutive episodes), and "diatonicism" and "chromaticism" are viewed as the cycle's principal "characters". For the author, the latter analogy is the decisive one. A substantial portion of the article is devoted to showing how the narrative design of the work as a whole arises from the interaction, alternation, and ultimate synthesis of these domains.<br>

Article Title: The Story of Abraham and Models of Human Identity<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd<br>
Issue: i40128072<br>
Date: 5 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Mills Mary<br>
Abstract: This paper explores the profiles of the women characters Sarah and Hagar as models of human identity. The two characters can only be explored through reading the over-arching narrative of the story of Abraham. Their profiles and narrated personalities have to be extracted from that narrative, but there is a two-sided nature of this necessity. If Sarah and Hagar cannot be separated from the biblical narrator's engagement with father Abraham, neither can Abraham function as father of the nations except through his interaction with these two women. The reader is thus led towards an understanding of how the stories of Genesis 12-24 deal with the issue of parenthood. The body of the paper consists in a close reading of the biblical material following a method of reading which is rooted in the use of imagination as an exegetical tool - a style adopted by Paul in his allegorical approach to Sarah and Hagar in Galatians 4. This approach opens into narrative criticism with a focus on characterisation and on the interactions of Sarah, Hagar and Abraham, caught up in a Domestic Comedy. The women's characters are explored through the themes of parenthood as other, the other woman and woman as other. A final section explores some of the points of narrative ethics to be extracted from the close textual readings of the paper, with reference to the writings of Paul Ricoeur and Emmanuel Levinas. It is suggested that female as well as male characters may offer fruitful models for human identity.<br>

Abstract: Чель статьи — показать, что функция перевода перестает быть вспомогательной, когда речь идет о личном опыте и о волнующих воспоминаниях. Набоков, как правило, прибегает к самопереводу для того, чтобы утвердить себя как писателя в языке, на который он переводит. В случае Майетоізеііе О дело обстоит несколько иначе. Этот текст чрезвычайно интересен, потому что, будучи одновременно и воспоминанием и рассказом, он принадлежит одновременно к сфере автобиографии и к сфере художественного вымысла. Поэтому в нем сходятся человек и писатель. Французский текст ближе к ностальгическому воссозданию потерянного мира, чем английский, как будто эмоции, связанные с определенным языком, невозможно передать в другом. В английском варианте самые интимные впечатления сглажены, как будто повествователь и герой — разные лица. В нем более отстраненно повествуется о волнующем мире первой Майетоізеііе 0> опубликованной в Мезигез. Французский вариант более неуклюже- трогательний, а английский более сжатый и музыкально-уравновешенный. Во втором варианте самоутверждается англоязычный писатель, тогда как автор первого варианта явно не ставил перед собой подобной цели. This article aims at demonstrating that the ancillary function of translation cannot be valid with personal experience and moving memories at stake. When Nabokov resorts to selftranslation he aims at ascertaining his identity as a writer in the language into which he translates. The case of Mademoiselle O is slightly different and exceptionally interesting because this text is both a memoir and a story, it pertains both to the world of autobiography and to that of fiction. Hence, the meeting of man and writer. The French text is more of a nostalgic reconstruction of a lost world and life than the English one, as if the emotions linked to one specific tongue could not be delivered in another. The most intimate sensations are erased in the English version as if narrator and actor were two distinct persons. The English is more an imp~<br>

Publisher: Universitätsverlag WINTER GmbH<br>
Issue: i40138215<br>

Author(s): Schäfer Stefanie<br>
Abstract: Theories of recognition provide an understanding of selfhood as based on narrative identity. In striking up and maintaining a relationship with the Other through telling my story, I am acknowledged as a conversation partner and as a self, endowed with a personal history and biographical experience. The driving force of this process is the hope or struggle for recognition, for being seen and acknowledged by the Other. This essay uses Paul Ricoeur's concept of recognition to read fictional first-person narration as a scenario of encounter between narrator and addressee. It draws from narrative psychology, autobiography theory, and narratological concepts of reader positioning to consider how readers encounter a fictional narrator. The relevance of such a reception-based model is illustrated by revisiting two classics of twentieth-century American literature featuring narrators who raise their voices from the margins: J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye and Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man. By reading these novels as narratives of recognition, I argue that the rise to iconic status of the narrators, Holden Caulfield and the Invisible Man, can be related to the intense scenario of address that calls readers to recognize these fictional tellers.<br>

Abstract: The works of Lewis and Girard share several central interests but seem divided by opposite views of myth. Lewis' novelistic retelling of the myth of Cupid and Psyche, however, provides a bridge: it depicts an ancient society organized around sacrifice and myth as understood in Girard's cultural theory and tells a Girardian story of conversion, in which the narrator discovers the imitative and rivalrous nature of her desire. Her rivalry and reconciliation with the story's true god carries the novel beyond Girardian myth to a contrary kind of narrative identified with fairy stories, which can extend Girard's approach to Christian conversion.<br>

Author(s): WiedemannAbstract: Since antiquity, Sallust has been said to have modeled his historiography after Thucydides. Focusing on the voice of the narrator, this article draws attention to an aspect that distinguishes Sallust from Thucydides and reminds us more of Herodotus. While Thucydides's narrative seems to unravel itself, Sallust makes his presence as narrator strongly felt by first-person interventions and expressions of uncertainty (I). Moreover, he integrates other voices at the extradiegetic level (II). These features of Sallust's voice give his account a strong mimetic aspect, underscore his reliability and engage the readers in the "act of reading."<br>

Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219705<br>
Date: 1 1, 1966<br>
Author(s): Lord Walter J.<br>
Abstract: Whereas the spoken word is part of present actuality, the written word normally is not. The writer, in isolation, constructs a role for his "audience" to play, and readers fictionalize themselves to correspond to the author's projection. The way readers fictionalize themselves shifts throughout literary history: Chaucer, Lyly, Nashe, Hemingway, and others furnish cases in point. All writing, from scientific monograph to history, epistolary correspondence, and diary writing, fictionalizes its readers. In oral performance, too, some fictionalizing of audience occurs, but in the live interaction between narrator and audience there is an existential relationship as well: the oral narrator modifies his story in accord with the real-not imagined-fatigue, enthusiasm, or other reactions of his listeners. Fictionalizing of audiences correlates with the use of masks or personae marking human communication generally, even with oneself. Lovers try to strip off all masks, and oral communication in a context of love can reduce masks to a minimum. In written communication and, a fortiori, print the masks are less removable.<br>

Abstract: A detailed narrative performed by a Gros Ventre elder is analyzed for its significance in the construction of cultural identity. In the context of these analyses, it is argued that narrative performance can be central to the active construction of cultural identity for individuals engaged in social interaction. In the present instance, certain performative features of the narrative involve a discursive identification by the narrator with the narrative protagonist that affords a personal resolution of a cultural crisis-in-meaning. Finally, this discursive identification by the narrator results in the re-creation of narrative events that involve the audience as participants in ways that powerfully impact the cultural identities they too will construct.<br>

Abstract: But despite its humor, de la Torre's piece frames a serious response to the complex legacy of Argentina's dirty war and the dispersions of many sorts that it caused. The whole Listserv dialogue is initiated because of Mercedes Correche's search for her mother, Mónica de la Torre, who was most likely “disappeared” by the Argentine dictatorship in 1977 “after being accused of subversive activities.” The Argentine dictatorship specialized in rhetorically camouflaging its actions against citizens with layers of euphemism, such that the regime itself was referred to as a “special process,” and its method of kidnapping, torturing, and killing its enemies was called “disappearing” them. The dictatorship was marked by “censorship of texts and the persecution of people, when even the appearance of thinking was suspicious.”
         
               The national sense of language changed between 1976 and 1983: “Uncertainty, suspicion, oblique broaching of discourse, masking, fracturing, displacement of the great issues to one's own subjectivity, the search for a center located outside the immediate social milieu: such are the recurrent terms that critics use to identify these years of transition which, now, with the mediation of time, serve well to reflect the spirit of Argentine society during the years of dictatorship.”108
            
               Crucially, de la Torre's narrator rewrites herself as a collectivity. The text offers a parable of multiple subjectivity and generic mixing, in which poems are born among layers of misdirection, and translation is always imperfect. A very real need to locate origins in a place where origins have been violently erased come together in the poetics of “Doubles,” which both acknowledges and resists origins. The literal search for origins, or lineage, coexists with the poet's resistance to the concept of authenticity. By retelling this encounter, de la Torre foregrounds the problem that Roberto Schwarz had pointedly articulated in109~<br>

Abstract: Early in chapter 6 we notice the difference, since it is the first time that Nick is not present in the very opening of a chapter. All previous chapters have opened with an emphasis on Nick as a subject; it has always been certain that he is the narrator. Chapter 1 starts with “In
         myyounger” (1; emphasis added); in chapter 3, “There was music frommyneighbor's house” (39; emphasis added). It takes ten lines in chapter 4 until Fitzgerald gets to Nick as the subject: “OnceIwrote down” (61; emphasis added) but in chapter 5 Nick returns to his early prominent position with “WhenIcame home” (81; emphasis added). I have deliberately avoided mentioning chapter 2 since it is an exception. It begins with an introductory description of the ash heap before Nick's presence is revealed after one page with “thatIfirst met” (24; emphasis added). It is not strange, in this case, that Fitzgerald delays Nick's arrival, because, as noted above, chapter 2 is a contrast to the otherwise flowing first half of the novel. As in chapter 2, in the second part ofGatsby, the relative absence of Nick creates uneasiness; the reader has been used to having their cicerone by their side.<br>

Abstract: Carol Blessing rightly observes that Jabbeh Wesley's poetry “shifts between critical, bemused, revelatory, celebratory, and mournful, as she discusses both her American and Liberian lives” (78–79). Her style is generally narrative, predominantly free verse that lives primarily through her deft evocation of powerful images. Adhering closely to formal stanzas often arranged in couplets, tercets, and quatrains, but dispensing with strict meters and rhymes, she delves into conversational rhythms that invoke a familial atmosphere. Her narrative is often folklorist—as if the narrator were among friends, telling stories around the kitchen table. The moment of epiphany, though, comes when mournful tones sneak into the words of the speaker. For example, “Strange Lovers,” from the collection
         Before the Palm Could Bloom, begins:
               
         So it is the moon that sends the Mesurado
               running to visit the Atlantic

Abstract: Beginnings: My first experience of the Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy (SPEP) was at Northwestern University; the business meeting was trying to decide whether its name should be “the Society for Existential Philosophy and Phenomenology” or “the Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy”—it spent nearly three hours with impassioned speeches made by many now departed mighty dead and others still here. I was a graduate student, just starting a dissertation on Paul Ricoeur, and I sat wondering where all this would lead. And we are now half a century later, with SPEP the second-largest philosophy group in America. The task for me is somehow to condense fifty years around a specific theme entailing technologies and their treatment by “Continental” philosophies. I will do this by doing time slices as related to a cast of characters, both individual and social. “SPEP” will be my corporate character for Continental philosophy; it is where its interests are expressed and indicated. Then as a primary individual character, I will refer to “Heidegger's ghost,” always and still a prominent figure and interpreter of Technology; here his death date, 1976, will stand for a watershed between what I will caricature as the Old Technologies and the New Technologies. I, myself, will be the narrator but also an actor, with my own three-decades-plus history in the philosophy of technology.<br>

Abstract: According to Ricoeur, this activity of appropriation occurs in a phenomenological, prepublic realm. To link this realm with the public world, I turn briefly to the vocabulary of constitutive rhetoric. In “Constitutive Rhetoric: The Case of the
         Peuple Québécois,” Maurice Charland explains how certain public texts, in addressing individuals as a group before that group actually exists in the extratextual world, can constitute a collective based on identity and oriented toward action. Charland uses the work of Kenneth Burke in order to shift the focus of rhetorical scholars away from “persuasion” and toward “identification” (1987, 133). Charland argues that public texts constitute subjects that didn't previously exist. In this sense, such texts do notpersuadealready existing individuals; they invite individuals to think of themselves in a manner thatentailscertain actions (1987, 134). This conceptualization extends Ricoeur's insights about appropriation and refiguration into the public world of action. Within this formulation, readers or listeners not only imagine themselves in new ways.
               They14
            actas the world of the text invites them to do and in so doing close the gap between mimesis3and mimesis1, between reading and acting. This is the space that needs to be crossed in order to give the straight line between mimesis1and mimesis3its arc and so enable it to form a spiral. A child reading Patterson's book, for instance, might simply dismiss it as a stuffy story about a famous person long dead. Or, the reader may actively engage the narrator's subtle closing exhortation to “make Dr. King's dream his own” (96). Because of “Dr. King's dream,” the reader may speak up when she hears someone employ racial slurs or stereotypes or intervene when a classmate is unjustly punished or bullied. The reader thus acts her way into Dr. King's proposed world and becomes the kind of agent whose actions may in turn inspire others. Her actions may be so ~<br>

Abstract: To challenge an unexamined critical alignment with Ishmael's limited epistemology in Herman Melville's
         Moby-Dickshows how the placing of confidence in Ishmael as witness to Ahab's monomania leads to a misreading ofMoby-Dick. Ahab lies at the center of a highly developed epistemology that competes with and eludes the narrator's comprehension. The various trophies that appear throughout the text are manifest examples of this other-than-interpretive system of knowing, and Melville uses the act of possessing trophies, particularly the act of eating trophies, to show graphically how such a system works. In other words, Melville has developed a complex epistemological system of ingestion around Ahab to model how language can be materially invested with meaning and how that meaning is performed.<br>

Abstract: In the essay I adopt Tamar Yacobi's “communication model” for settling discrepancies and inconsistencies in fictional texts and use it to demonstrate that the hypothesis of unreliable narration does not necessarily entail only one kind of interpretation. To support this point, I offer the distinction between
         self-deceptiveandother-deceptivenarrating characters, and I argue that some texts constantly cause the reader to hesitate between conflicting interpretations of the narrator as belonging to one of these two types. Such equivocation on the part of the reader is then extended to competing interpretations of the text, in accordance with each type of narrator. The chosen novel for this purpose is Vladimir Nabokov'sLolita.<br>

Abstract: Most scholars dealing with unreliable narration consider the unreliable narrator inferior to the reader in either knowledge or morality. This conception implies that the readers are more reliable than the unreliable narrator and, thanks to this difference, capable of identifying unreliabilty, with no consequences or ramifications for themselves. Although this view is not entirely wrong, the readers' superiority to the narrator may change if the readers either find out new details about the narrator that urge them to reevaluate their classification or discover something new about themselves that encourages them to reconsider their superiority. An interesting combination of these two possibilities is found in Camus's novella
         The Fall(La Chute). My interpretation ofThe Fallfocuses on the triad narrator-narratee-reader and the narrator's rhetorical manipulations, maintaining that the text both undermines the binary opposition between “unreliable narrator” and “reliable reader” and has some general implications on the position of the reader towards fiction.<br>

Abstract: In a parallel fashion, Edward Bellamy's narrator, toward the end of
         Looking Backward, awakens from his dream of a Utopian twentieth century and finds himself again in the suddenly dystopian Boston of the nineteenth century. But a few pages later he wakes from that nightmare to discover that his “return to the nineteenth century had been the dream, and [his] presence in the twentieth was the reality.”
               By enveloping contemporary material reality within the dream, Morris and Bellamy maintain the possibility that their Utopian visions may overcome that reality.149<br>

Abstract: Familial
         memoryis indispensable to individual memory. By recounting memories, the individual gains greater control over them, integrating them within self-identity. These functions are undermined by theRepublicanfamily's fear of reprisals for articulating a counter-discourse in theFrancoist New State, and the personal history of Sunta, the narrator inAlfons Cervera's
               
                  , is bereft of supportive socio-cultural frameworks. Sunta resolves this situation through the medium of narrative memory, which effects a retrospective uncovering of memory traces through images of the past, allowing her to revisit an inadequately assimilated childhood from an empowered position.El color del crepúsculo<br>
