  Author(s) Hariman Robert<br>
  Abstract: The realist is right about one thing: Much of the time, international politics boils down to strategy. The calculation of advantage in the game of nations is the first condition, the final necessity, and—not to be underestimated—the continuing attraction for those who presume to be players. Therefore, it is not enough for post-realists to articulate a broader conception of scientific inquiry; if we are to move beyond realism, we shall have to provide decision makers with better instruments for strategic analysis. It may seem that these two objectives are mutually contradictory. For example, the post-realist perspective exemplifies the<br>

  Abstract: When trying to grasp the complex relationships between dance and moving images, during the emergence of the cinematic medium, one can hardly avoid noticing the necessity of investigate, once again, the films dedicated to the famous number of “serpentine” dance developed and started in 1892 by music-hall performer Loïe Fuller. The phenomenal craze created by this original stage spectacle ended up imposing it as one of the motifs characterizing artistic expression at the turn of the twentieth century. Countless variations have attested to this, at least until the First World War, in areas as diverse as sculpture, painting, architecture, furniture,<br>

  Book Title: Sounding/Silence: Martin Heidegger at the Limits of Poetics-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SMITH DAVID NOWELL<br>
  Abstract: Sounding/Silence charts Heidegger's deep engagement with poetry, situating it within the internal dynamics of his thought and within the domains of poetics and literary criticism. Heidegger viewed poetics and literary criticism with notorious disdain: he claimed that his Erlauterungen ("soundings") of Holderlin's poetry were not "contributions to aesthetics and literary history" but rather stemmed "from a necessity for thought." And yet, the questions he poses--the value of significance of prosody and trope, the concept of "poetic language", the relation between language and body, the "truth" of poetry--reach to the very heart of poetics as a discipline, and indeed situate Heidegger within a wider history of thinking on poetry and poetics. opening up points of contact between Heidegger's discussions of poetry and technical and critical analyses of these poems, Nowell Smith addresses a lacuna within Heidegger scholarship and sets off from Heidegger's thought to sketch a philosophical "poetics of limit".<br>

  Abstract: Twice in recent chapters, I have invoked Richard Lanham’s definition of catachresis as a wrenching of metaphor or an extravagant use of it, in any case, as a violent (mis)use of language. Qualifying Lanham’s definition, I have also observed the appreciation of traditional rhetoric for the necessity, and not merely the extravagance, of catachresis in the absence of any other suitable words. Lanham’s definition is a cogent synthesis abstracted from classical and Renaissance sources, and I have annotated it as such, along with reference to Patricia Parker’s provocative analysis of definitions of metaphor and catachresis from classical times to the<br>

  Book Title: Technologies of Life and Death: From Cloning to Capital Punishment-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Oliver Kelly<br>
  Abstract: The central aim of this book is to approach contemporary problems raised by technologies of life and death as ethical issues that call for a more nuanced approach than mainstream philosophy can provide. To do so, it draws on the recently published seminars of Jacques Derrida to analyze the extremes of birth and dying insofar as they are mediated by technologies of life and death. With an eye to reproductive technologies, it shows how a deconstructive approach can change the very terms of contemporary debates over technologies of life and death, from cloning to surrogate motherhood to capital punishment, particularly insofar as most current discussions assume some notion of a liberal individual. The ethical stakes in these debates are never far from political concerns such as enfranchisement, citizenship, oppression, racism, sexism, and the public policies that normalize them. Technologies of Life and Death thus provides pointers for rethinking dominant philosophical and popular assumptions about nature and nurture, chance and necessity, masculine and feminine, human and animal, and what it means to be a mother or a father. In part, the book seeks to disarticulate a tension between ethics and politics that runs through these issues in order to suggest a more ethical politics by turning the force of sovereign violence back against itself. In the end, it proposes that deconstructive ethics with a psychoanalytic supplement can provide a corrective for moral codes and political cliches that turn us into mere answering machines.<br>

  Book Title: Value and Values-Economics and Justice in an Age of Global Interdependence<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Hershock Peter D.<br>
  Abstract: The most pressing issues of the twenty-first century-climate change and persistent hunger in a world of food surpluses, to name only two-are not problems that can be solved from within individual disciplines, nation-states, or cultural perspectives. They are predicaments that can only be resolved by generating sustained and globally robust coordination across value systems. The scale of the problems and necessity for coordinated global solutions signal a world historical transit as momentous as the Industrial Revolution: a transition from the predominance of technical knowledge to that of ethical deliberation. This volume brings together leading thinkers from around the world to deliberate on how best to correlate worth (value) with what is worthwhile (values), pairing human prosperity with personal, environmental, and spiritual flourishing in a world of differing visions of what constitutes a moral life.<br>

  Abstract: In the classical Marxist tradition, socialism was often understood as a historical necessity. Both the Frankfurt School and the Althusserian reformulation of classical Marxism made the very idea of historical necessity problematic, as have the failed attempts to construct socialism in the twentieth century. I argue in this essay that socialism, while not a historical necessity, is, perhaps more than ever, a

Refugee games belong to this so-called genre of “serious games”: these games frame refugee issues by letting the player taste life as a refugee. Refugee games have the potential to convince players of the veracity of a certain point of view or the necessity of a behavioral change. But they also help non-profit organizations (such as the United Nations and Free Press Unlimited) and commercial enterprises (such as Reebok, the music channel MTV, Microsoft, and Konami)<br>

  Abstract: Maurice Merleau-Ponty described the objective body as the “impoverished image” of the phenomenal body.¹ In an earlier work, Jean-Paul Sartre drew a similar distinction when he described the body being-for-itself and the body-for-others as existing “on different and incommunicable levels” with one another.² Many existential philosophers have gone on to extol these critical determinations and to incorporate the distinction in their work as a fundamental verity of human existence. Thus, Calvin Schrag, for example, has insisted on the necessity of consistently contrasting “the body as

If the Bible is the Magna Carta for the Christian community (2 Tim 3:16–17), it is important that the community and individuals within it understand and apply the Scriptures correctly.

  Book Title: Thou Shalt Not Kill: A Political and Theological Dialogue-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Sitze Adam<br>
  Abstract: In this fascinating and rare little book, a leading Italian feminist philosopher and the Archbishop of Milan face off over the contemporary meaning of the biblical commandment not to kill. The result is a series of erudite and wide-ranging arguments that move from murder and suicide to just war and drone strikes, from bioethics and biopolitics to hermeneutics and philology, from Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer to Hannah Arendt and Michel Foucault, from Torah and Scripture to art and literature, from the essence of human dignity and the paradoxes of fratricide to engagements with Levinasian ethics. Less a direct debate than a disputation in the classical sense, Thou Shalt Not Kill proves to be a searching meditation on one of the unstated moral premises shared by otherwise bitterly opposed political factions. It will stimulate the mind of the novice while also reminding more advanced readers of the necessity and desirability of thinking in the present.<br>

At stake is hence a fine balance between necessity and freedom, between personal guilt and delivery to destructive structures. Accordingly, acknowledging sin takes a personal sense of the I, confessing or revealing itself as the originator of deeds and speech, while acknowledging that this I is indebted—for better and for worse—to the inheritance of and continuous participation in a form of life that bestows coherence to those deeds and utterances.<br>

Whether this aspiration is itself justifiable, however, is another question. Can religious faith be grasped and grounded, so that its content is justified by the necessity of the philosophical concept? Does religious faith have its telos in philosophical consummation? Or does there remain some residual opacity that philosophy cannot penetrate, some otherness that philosophy cannot reconcile within its own conceptual scheme?

Almost one hundred years before Bakhtin coined the term, Alexander Veselovsky, the founder of Historical Poetics as a paradigm within literary scholarship, wondered whether “each new poetic epoch [does] not work on images bequeathed from antiquity, being of necessity constrained by their boundaries.”¹ Veselovsky would go on to refine and<br>

  Abstract: Kant undertook the transcendental turn in philosophy to counter the scepticism of Hume; that is, he sought to provide an explanation of how it is possible to have knowledge that is both necessary and objective. Since knowledge derived from experience can never claim necessity, Kant concludes that such knowledge must be transcendental in origin. His account of how such knowledge is possible focusses on transcendental apperception and the order that it imposes upon the experience. We have seen, however, that his account fails to show that the categories can be derived entirely a priori, and that his final account of<br>

  Abstract: All scientific work starts with some simplification of basic concepts. Once these have been defined and established, we begin to pile up empirical variations. During this process, the simplifying notions are modified and, eventually, they may disappear. For example, economics assumes scarcity, and hence the need to rationalize and economize; politics presupposes the existence of struggles to maximize power; and sociology insists upon the necessity of social solidarity. Taking our cue from the etymology of socius , sociology is the science of companionship or friendship. For social science as a whole, civil society is the space in which these somewhat<br>

  Book Title: Fueling Culture-101 Words for Energy and Environment<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Yaeger Patricia<br>
  Abstract: How has our relation to energy changed over time? What differences do particular energy sources make to human values, politics, and imagination? How have transitions from one energy source to another—from wood to coal, or from oil to solar to whatever comes next—transformed culture and society? What are the implications of uneven access to energy in the past, present, and future? Which concepts and theories clarify our relation to energy, and which just get in the way? Fueling Culture offers a compendium of keywords written by scholars and practitioners from around the world and across the humanities and social sciences. These keywords offer new ways of thinking about energy as both the source and the limit of how we inhabit culture, with the aim of opening up new ways of understanding the seemingly irresolvable contradictions of dependence upon unsustainable energy forms. Fueling Culture brings together writing that is risk-taking and interdisciplinary, drawing on insights from literary and cultural studies, environmental history and ecocriticism, political economy and political ecology, postcolonial and globalization studies, and materialisms old and new. Keywords in this volume include: Aboriginal, Accumulation, Addiction, Affect, America, Animal, Anthropocene, Architecture, Arctic, Automobile, Boom, Canada, Catastrophe, Change, Charcoal, China, Coal, Community, Corporation, Crisis, Dams, Demand, Detritus, Disaster, Ecology, Electricity, Embodiment, Ethics, Evolution, Exhaust, Fallout, Fiction, Fracking, Future, Gender, Green, Grids, Guilt, Identity, Image, Infrastructure, Innervation, Kerosene, Lebenskraft, Limits, Media, Metabolism, Middle East, Nature, Necessity, Networks, Nigeria, Nuclear, Petroviolence, Photography, Pipelines, Plastics, Renewable, Resilience, Risk, Roads, Rubber, Rural, Russia, Servers, Shame, Solar, Spill, Spiritual, Statistics, Surveillance, Sustainability, Tallow, Texas, Textiles, Utopia, Venezuela, Whaling, Wood, Work For a full list of ~<br>

In modern feminism debates pitting cultural against biological causation have played an important role. Such debates have also arisen in relation to research in biotechnology, neurobiology, sociobiology, and ethnomethodology. I think it could be shown that Freud thinks of the body in terms that undermine the opposition between natural causation and cultural meanings that have been with us since Kant first distinguished between the realms of necessity and freedom. If this is right, then Freud does have a philosophically original contribution to make to contemporary debates about<br>

A fine-grained phenomenological analysis of this manner of living describes the required amount of reflective activity in combination with a loss of certain common-sensical habitualities, the often missing option to communicate one‘s experiences and the necessity to reframe the metaphysical insights as world-view (Weltanschauung), besides the psychotic experiences themselves, as major pitfalls and challenges of ongoing psychotic experiences.

The only assumption we need is the following: that representationality can itself be represented as a modality, and it is thus amenable to the methods of modal logic.

As John P. Pittman points out in

  Abstract: This book explores the historical insights of Alexander Pushkin (1799-1837), Russia's most celebrated poet and arguably its greatest thinker. Svetlana Evdokimova examines for the first time the full range of Pushkin's fictional and nonfictional writings on the subject of history-writings that have strongly influenced Russians' views of themselves and their past. Through new readings of his drama,
      Boris Godunov; such narrative poems asPoltava, The Bronze Horseman,andCount Nulin; prose fiction, includingThe Captain's DaughterandBlackamoor of Peter the Great; lyrical poems; and a variety of nonfictional texts, the author presents Pushkin not only as a progenitor of Russian national mythology but also as an original historical and political thinker.Evdokimova considers Pushkin within the context of Romantic historiography and addresses the tension between Pushkin the historian and Pushkin the fiction writer . She also discusses Pushkin's ideas on the complex relations between chance and necessity in historical processes, on the particular significance of great individuals in Russian history, and on historical truth.<br>

  Abstract: The idea of place--topos--runs through Martin Heidegger's thinking almost from the very start. It can be seen not only in his attachment to the famous hut in Todtnauberg but in his constant deployment of topological terms and images and in the situated, "placed" character of his thought and of its major themes and motifs. Heidegger's work, argues Jeff Malpas, exemplifies the practice of "philosophical topology." In Heidegger and the Thinking of Place, Malpas examines the topological aspects of Heidegger's thought and offers a broader elaboration of the philosophical significance of place. Doing so, he provides a distinct and productive approach to Heidegger as well as a new reading of other key figures--notably Kant, Aristotle, Gadamer, and Davidson, but also Benjamin, Arendt, and Camus. Malpas, expanding arguments he made in his earlier book Heidegger's Topology (MIT Press, 2007), discusses such topics as the role of place in philosophical thinking, the topological character of the transcendental, the convergence of Heideggerian topology with Davidsonian triangulation, the necessity of mortality in the possibility of human life, the role of materiality in the working of art, the significance of nostalgia, and the nature of philosophy as beginning in wonder. Philosophy, Malpas argues, begins in wonder and begins in place and the experience of place. The place of wonder, of philosophy, of questioning, he writes, is the very topos of thinking.<br>

  Abstract: In a paper that emanated from a colloquium involving contributors from the universities of Lausanne, Neuchâtel, Sheffield, and Manchester, I offered some thoughts on the apparent allusions to historical events contained in the Hebrew book of Psalms.¹ This short paper will look at the thirteen or so psalm titles in the Hebrew Bible that appear to contain allusions to episodes in the story of David. The necessity for an approximation in the second sentence of this discussion highlights that there is not even complete agreement about their number, let alone their purpose and implication. There is widespread agreement on the<br>

  Book Title: Genre Fusion-A New Approach to History, Fiction, and Memory in Contemporary Spain<br>
  Publisher: Purdue University Press<br>
  Author(s): Brenneis Sara J.<br>
  Abstract: Genre Fusion opens with a straightforward overview of the relationships among history, fiction, and memory in contemporary culture. While providing an up-to-date context for scholarly debates about Spain’s historical memory, Genre Fusion also expands the contours of the discussion beyond the specialized territory of Hispanic studies. To demonstrate the theoretical necessity of genre fusion, Brenneis analyzes pairs of interconnected texts (one a work of literature, the other a work of historiography) written by a single author. She explores how fictional and nonfictional works by Montserrat Roig, Carmen Martín Gaite, Carlos Blanco Aguinaga, and Javier Marías unearth the collective memories of Spain’s past.<br>

  Abstract: In the case of an event as extreme as the Holocaust, one could be forgiven for presupposing that the boundary between factual and fictional modes of representation is sacred in its rigidity. However, it is often the case with survivor narratives that this expectation is far too proscriptive in its division of the realms of fact and fiction; as James E. Young comments, "If there is a line between fact and fiction, it may by necessity be a winding border that tends to bind these two categories as much as it separates them, allowing each side to dissolve occasionally into<br>

  Abstract: Niccolò Machiavelli writes: “[O]ne can say this generally of men: that they are ungrateful, fickle, pretenders and dissemblers, evaders of danger, eager for gain.”¹ To deal with this kind of human nature, he argues that a political ruler needs to know how to use force as well as laws, all according to necessity. He also advises that it is important for the ruler to appear merciful to win the hearts and minds of people, while the ruler should remain feared by people.² Such a seemingly dark assessment of human nature finds echoes in the political thought of many thinkers in<br>

But curiously, their insistence on narrative is out of tune with the views of a number of poststructuralist theorists such as Roland Barthes, Julia Kristeva, and Hélène Cixous as well as those whom they have influenced.

Yet, that necessity did not exist because, by thinking of events under the aspect of turning wheels—the Wheel of Fortune or Ezekiel’s concentric wheels of prophecy and fulfillment, advancing as they spun—authors negated time. Instead, the necessity existed because those metaphors, and similar ones, expressed assumptions about time and<br>

  Abstract: With an original combination of close reading and political theory, Joy Connolly argues that Cicero, Sallust, and Horace inspire fresh thinking about central concerns of contemporary political thought and action. These include the role of conflict in the political community, especially as it emerges from class differences; the necessity of recognition for an equal and just society; the corporeal and passionate aspects of civic experience; citizens' interdependence on one another for senses of selfhood; and the uses and dangers of self-sovereignty and fantasy. Putting classicists and political theorists in dialogue, the book also addresses a range of modern thinkers, including Kant, Hannah Arendt, Stanley Cavell, and Philip Pettit. Together, Connolly's readings construct a new civic ethos of advocacy, self-criticism, embodied awareness, imagination, and irony.<br>

Both knowability and explicability imply an anthropological dimension in cosmology, for both these requirements have human origin: to speculate about the universe one must experience its presence through the instantaneous synthesis associated with conscious life. It is argued that the cosmological principle acts as reduction of this synthesis to a mental spatial uniformity of the universe.

  Author(s) Anderson Stanford<br>
  Abstract: Architects frequently take great pride in pointing to architecture as the most interdisciplinary of professional pursuits. Indeed, for many, one of the great attractions of the field is its inherently interdisciplinary quality, the necessity of integrating widely divergent concerns—aesthetic choices, social implications, the highly technical issues of structural and mechanical calculations, as well as matters treated in other professional fields such as interior design and landscape architecture. In this respect, architecture might be characterized as “inherently interdisciplinary,” in the way that others have characterized academic fields such as geography, or professional fields such as public health (J. Klein 1990).<br>

  Abstract: The few aspects of the verbal message discussed in chapters 2 and 3 were dependent on the structure of utterances and thus related to sign structure. Without indulging in the absurd wager of trying to isolate this structure from the many systems in which it happens to be produced, recognized, transformed, and exchanged as such, we have treated the sign thus far as if it were self-contained: we had not posited the possibility, let alone the necessity of an external space, a world without sign systems at large.

  Book Title: War and Literature-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Patterson Ian<br>
  Abstract: War was the first subject of literature; at times, war has been its only subject. In this volume, the contributors reflect on the uneasy yet symbiotic relations of war and writing, from medieval to modern literature. War writing emerges in multiple forms, celebratory and critical, awed and disgusted; the rhetoric of inexpressibility fights its own battle with the urgent necessity of representation, record and recognition. This is shown to be true even to the present day: whether mimetic or metaphorical, literature that concerns itself overtly or covertly with the real pressures of war continues to speak to issues of pressing significance. Particular topics addressed include writings of and about the Crusades and battles during the Hundred Years War; Shakespeare's "Casus Belly"; Auden's "Journal of an Airman"; and War and Peace.

Abstract: The necessity of both solidarity and proceduralism thus holds for both distributive and criminal justice. In the end, Ricoeur remains committed to notions that ground the just polity in community and mutual sharing without thinking that these notions require us to dispense with the formalism of procedures of justice. While the latter are not sufficient on their own to create or sustain a just society, while, indeed, formal procedures always presuppose some conception of the good, procedural conceptions allow us to recognize each other as subjects of rights. Although it is not always clear that Ricoeur succeeds in reconciling Rawls and Walzer or Habermas and Gadamer, he does provide a fresh perspective on current debates within his own interesting account of the structure of moral action.<br>

Abstract: The fact that Watts, Hartley, and Bonnet were praised by the English chemist and religious controversialist Joseph Priestley for their germ theory of resurrection highlights how broad the margins for maneuvering in the physico‐theological field were. Priestley asserted the materiality of the soul, denied its immortality, and (in analogies that explicitly concerned personal identity) affirmed that we are as entirely composed of matter as a river of water or a forest of trees. For all intents and purposes, he said, we shall at resurrection be the same we were on earth if “we shall all know one another again, and converse together as before” (Joseph Priestley,

Abstract: Philosophy must know, and thus also not cease to will to know, the one who knows, at the risk of degrading the one who knows (himself) to the status of what he knows. Theology in the strict sense recognizes its object—in fact, a formal nonobject—as revelation. It thus accepts, or rather claims as its highest epistemological necessity, to treat of the incomprehensibility of God, such as it results directly from his infinity and, above all, from his holiness.<br>

It is a time to lament our state, to agonize, to ponder, a time in which we must of necessity call everything into question. Besides, why should the fragile art of writing history escape from the general crisis of our age? We are quitting a world of which we have not always had the time to understand or appreciate the benefits, the errors, the certainties, and the dreams—the world, shall we say, of the early twentieth century? We are leaving it, or rather, it is slipping inexorably away from us.”<br>

Abstract: Whatever the starting point for investigation of agency, and whatever correctives are proposed, there must be both individual and social uptake of those changes in order for them to have any impact on women’s lives. Meyers faces this necessity more squarely in her final chapter on sexuality, where she points out that female sexual agency cannot change without concurrent changes in masculine sexual identity, although the problem of how to effect such changes remains. Similarly, McNay writes hopefully about creative connection and interdependence with others, but in her work—perhaps because of her reliance on a fractious group of theorists—these “others” remain largely abstractions. The discomforts in social roles of which she writes are not just between the self and a set of institutions or expectations; they are between the self and other people, people with their own specificity and their own discomforts. Despite—or perhaps because of—her emphasis on collective action, McNay seems to defer genuine selfhood to some future possible world. Nevertheless, McNay’s emphasis on collective action is a helpful complement to Meyers’s focus on imagery.<br>

Date: 10 2005<br>
Author(s): Lee Hyo‐Dong<br>
Abstract: Given the absence of comprehensively universal standards of evaluation for recognition of worth, then, religious communities seem to be caught between the horns of a dilemma: the need for their mutual recognition of worth for the sake of greater solidarity within the present postcolonial‐neocolonial context, on the one hand, and the necessity of evaluation from their parochial yet inescapably universalized points of view, on the other. Yet this dilemma may not be an irresolvable contradiction. First of all, the notion of recognition on demand is incompatible with the practice of mutual recognition as such insofar as there are cultural practices that do not honor mutuality and reciprocity. In other words, mutual recognition of free participatory agency itself provides a minimum universal standard for mutual recognition of worth in the sense that the former by definition precludes recognizing the worth of a community’s particular practices that seek to dominate, marginalize, and exclude from participation other communities as well as some of its own members. Nancy Fraser’s thesis that the standard of recognition must be the norm of participatory parity is helpful in explicating this point: a community claiming recognition of worth for its religious or cultural practices must show that these practices neither impede the free and equal participation of other communities and their members in the common space of living nor bar some of its own members from being free participants in its internal life with the power to define and represent it.
         29Any communal practice that upholds the master‐slave relation as a key value and organizing principle around which the community attempts to structure its internal life and external relations must be denied recognition of worth by virtue of its own rejection of the values of reciprocity and participatory freedom intrinsic to the practice of mutual recognition.<br>

Abstract: Such is especially if not most profoundly of all the case when one considers children. Children perhaps more than any other group are prone to having their “saying” capabilities overshadowed by what is “said” by others about them. They are the most easily marginalized segment of society. The fact is that the study of children is of necessity originated and conducted not by children themselves but by nonchildren, that is, adults. Such is the case even in the laudable efforts of social scientists to include children’s participation in research, since this participation is still initiated, guided, and interpreted ultimately by grown‐ups. The underlying problem is not how to make children equal research participants. It is how to interpret the meaning and status of children in their “otherness,” when children more than any other group cannot fully interpret their own otherness for themselves.<br>

Abstract: Why do we tend to assume today that, while virtually all other areas of human endeavor involve some kind of dynamic and open‐ended creation of the given into the new—from the arts to science, technology, and culture—moral life somehow stands apart as either applying or retrieving some order of fixed and unchanging good? The answer to this question has to do in part with the slippery nature of moral relations themselves, involving by necessity multiple and even incommensurable interests, perspectives, and goods. But it also contains deep theoretical roots in an ancient Greek quarrel of the philosophers and the poets, which in turn left its mark very early in Christianity and was incorporated in different ways into premodernity, modernity, and even postmodernity.<br>

Abstract: Derrida’s reference to heritage, and the responsibility to the latter, does not necessarily imply that he would dismiss the notion of tradition. Let us only emphasize that, in contrast to Gadamer, Derrida does not hold tradition to be homogeneous. Indeed, within the tradition one finds “dominant structures, discourses which silence others, by covering over or destroying the archive” (Derrida,
            Politics of Friendship,trans. George Collins [London, 1997], p. 233). Even though repeatedly he notes that “it is no longer possible touseseriously the words of tradition” (Derrida, “Some Statements and Truisms about Neologisms, Newisms, Postisms, Parasitisms, and Other Small Seismisms,” trans. Anne Tomiche, inThe States of Theory, ed. David Caroll [New York, 1990], p. 74), and that in the end all concepts of the tradition have to be put aside, he also “reaffirms the necessity of making recourse to them, at least, in a crossed‐out fashion” (Derrida,Psyché: Inventions de l’autre[Paris, 2003], p. 390; my trans.). Responsibility to the tradition and its deconstruction go hand in hand.<br>

Author(s): Harootunian Harry<br>
Abstract: The current return to a historical present teeming with competing temporalities from the past recalls both repetitions from other times and places and what perceiving them meant for social theory. Specifically, this recognition refers to those attempts envisaged by people like Tosaka and Maurice Halbwachs before World War II who sought to account for the spectacle of mixed temporalities in the present. Both, it is important to acknowledge, discounted the veracity of history’s claims to a true time and proposed conceptions of temporality they believed to be emanating from the historical process itself (as they conceived it). The consequence of Halbwachs’s and Tosaka’s interventions was to deprivilege state archives and thus shifted the order of the Hegelian allegory symbolizing the conflict between Chronos, the god of Time, and Zeus, the god of politics who created state and hearth. In this struggle, Chronos, who inevitably devours his own, engulfing all in his passage, is ultimately dominated by Zeus, who creates the state, which in turn conquers time. Just as important is the state’s capacity to transform in history all that Mnemosyne—the goddess of memory—had been able to collect after the rampaging passage of time.
         25It is also worth mentioning that while Halbwachs codified the separation of history from memory and upheld the claims of the latter over the former (that is to say, the claims of time over space) the effort to rematerialize time—yet retain its qualitative character—by freeing it from an interiorized, psychological consciousness was not attempted in Europe or America, but Japan. Tosaka’s critique of what he called “borrowed time,”26referring to history’s reliance on conceptions of time from other disciplines—the physical sciences, but especially the inner time consciousness of phenomenology and even mythology—and his identification of the everyday (especially as lived by the worker) revealed the real source of historical time, the “mystery of~<br>

Abstract: “I chose this story above all others because it’s a story I’m struggling to end. … That’s why I write fiction—so that I can keep telling the story. … Always a new beginning, a different end,” Winterson writes toward the close of her narrative (
         2005, 137). Linking the desire for retelling with the inability to formulate a conclusion and the necessity for an open ending, Winterson has Atlas walk away, yet presents this “very particular end not found elsewhere” (xiv) as but one possibility among several, the choice of which is ultimately left to the individual reader’s personal preference: “no one knows its composition,” Winterson observes. “Dark matter could be conventional matter, … or it could even be black holes. Or it could be Atlas holding up the universe. But I think it is Atlas and Laïka walking away” (2005, 151).Weight’s multiperspectival ending underscores its status as inaugural retelling of myth for a twenty‐first century that can only assimilate more pasts into its ever broadening present. In this sense, the Myths seems typical for the contemporary take on re‐vision. Whereas the names of the authors hold the promise of retellings with a critical edge—Achebe having given usThings Fall Apartas a reply to and a thorough undermining of Joseph Conrad’sHeart of Darkness(see Moyers1989; Achebe1990), and neither Atwood nor Winterson is a stranger to rewriting as cultural critique—Winterson’s phrase and its appropriation by the series’ editor make us suspect differently. “We want to tell the story again,” as the series’ editor Jamie Byng puts it on Canongate’s Web site, speaks of the storyteller’s desire for and delight in language; of the pleasure of telling stories, of keeping the stories alive by retelling them. Inevitably also meaning “we want tosellthe story again,” retelling becomes a retailing strategy, promising ever new and improved reading experiences that are as ephemeral as any other consumer experience. Speaking neither of learning from the p~<br>

Abstract: Schopenhauer’s rejection of individual will’s self‐serving egoism bespeaks a greater concordance than he is willing to acknowledge between his views and Augustine’s avocation of the perfectibility of
         voluntas. As discussed, to Augustine the harder one’s individual intention strives to coincide with love, the better one gets to know oneself; and the better one gets to know oneself, the more diaphanous becomes the diaphragm separating one’s real self from its ideal reflection in the mirror of introspection. Self‐knowledge is self‐making in Augustine, and this self‐making consists of the transformative self‐denial whereby one purposefully modifies one’s own will until a coincidence is reached between desire and love. Schopenhauer accuses Augustine of “expressing in a naïve way” the role played by will in one’s self‐determination. According to Schopenhauer, when Augustine draws an analogy inDe civitate Deibetween “gravity [as] the motion of the body” and “love [as] the motion of the soul,” he is confusing the “real necessity” bestowed on both motions by the same cause, that is, by the self‐deployment of will in time and space, with the soul’sliberum arbitrium indifferentiae, that is, the undifferentiated free will whereby the soul, contrary to the body’s deterministic fate, chooses its own destiny.56There is no “undifferentiated free will,” hence no perfectible self in Schopenhauer; one either succumbs to the necessity of will’s self‐deployment or affirms one’s freedom by obstructing it, by boycotting it. Schopenhauer is an Augustinian reductionistmalgré soi—a revisionist of Augustine’s avocation of the perfectibility of the self. Schopenhauer’s reductionism is reflected in the lack of direction intrinsic to his project of self‐emancipation from the dominion of will. In Augustine the obstruction of the instinctive drive of self‐interest is a figuratively upward movement (momentum), deriving its direction from the self‐abnegation, the weightlessness of love;57in~<br>

Abstract: Augustine never articulates his justification of war in these terms. In the letter to Boniface to which O’Donovan refers, Augustine makes no connection between love and the duty to perform military service. He makes the more modest admonition that Boniface “not think that no one who serves as a soldier, using arms for warfare, can be acceptable to God.”
         36The proper aim of soldiering is not to carry out a duty to the helpless neighbor but to secure peace through war, which must be waged only as a necessity. Indeed, Augustine speaks as if love as an exercise of will lies outside the bounds of war. He writes, “It ought to be necessity, and not your will, that destroys an enemy who is fighting you.”37Claiming that proper recourse to military action arises as an expression of neighbor love goes beyond the plain meaning of Augustine’s text.<br>

Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: We can now see the force of Mark 9:24. Coleridge’s religious beliefs have crossed the Kantian analysis and yet ended up affirming faith nonetheless, bringing what is supposedly improper and parergonal right back to the heart of the work, or ergon, of the human subject.
         40The praying subject, like every aspect of the religious subject, faces paradoxes that are nevertheless apparently necessary to its being, which is why the paradoxical Mark 9:24 is exemplary. How do we possibly understand praying to a hidden God who lies outside the bounds of our reason? Being‐for‐God is not something that can be justifiably affirmed by a finite “I” that can only understand itself as a self‐determined individual in the world: hence Coleridge’s comment in 1808 that “thehabitof psychological Analysis makes additionally difficult the act of true Prayer” (N3355). Yet we also feel the necessity of the claim on our being to be for‐God, a claim Coleridge believes to be irreducible. As such, prayer sets the being of the “I” against itself, trying to attest to something “deeper than our Consciousness can reach. … What we cannotimagine, we cannot, in the proper sense of the word, conceive.”41<br>

Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: D'Holbach, in his infamous treatise,
         Système de la nature(1770), echoed and amplified many of Spinoza's monist sentiments. Since the totality of nature is “but an immense chain of causes and effects that ceaselessly follow from one to the other,” it stood to reason that the self does not possess “independent energy, an isolated cause,” or “detached action” from its fellow beings. An empirical investigation of the natural world suffices to prove that “man is in each instance of his life a passive instrument in the hands of necessity.”51Nor is the divine afforded any greater latitude of thought or movement. While it is ironic that d'Holbach chose to present nature as a speaking and seeing goddess in the final pages of his treatise, he repeatedly stressed that nature should not be regarded as a subject, divine or otherwise, despite apparent indications to the contrary: “When I say that nature produces an effect, I do not at all claim to personalize it. … We cannot call nature intelligent in the manner of some of the beings it encompasses.”52<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 660269<br>
Date: 08 2011<br>
Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: But even if Faustus performs the affects of repentance, he cannot repent and be saved in the strict theological sense because until the very end he exhibits the inward disposition of the faithless magician who must choose to be duped by Satan. But why does he have such an inward disposition in the first place? Is it indeed that God has predestined Faustus to hell, subjected him to the most miserable necessity? For Paul Ricoeur, the question of “the scandalous theology of predestination to evil” is the tragic question par excellence, which is why the tragic is always, in Ricoeur's formulation, “a temptation to despair” in its display of the “hostile transcendence to which the hero is prey.”
      36But Marlowe's play, as much as it also invites the audience to despair, stages something more subtle and finally more wrenching than blank divine vengeance, for in fact it employs the more charitable theology represented by Holland rather than that of Perkins: Faustus may indeed repent, and God may indeed change his mind. The possibility of repentance provides the suspense that makes the play dramatic rather than merely iconographical, and that gives force and fear to those apparently trivial spectacles that repeatedly persuade Faustus not to perform his inward penance. Yet at the same time, there does seem to be something fated in the way that Faustus is introduced to the audience with a habit of mind that makes it impossible for him to take his given opportunities to repent.Doctor Faustusthus brings the audience right up against the nondialectical, and therefore tragic, contradiction of the theology of grace: the fact an omnipotent and supposedly loving God permits creaturely suffering, or, in terms more specific to the play, that God rejects a man who cries out to him simply because that man thinks like a dramatist rather than an allegorist.37Milton, on his part, tries to solve this problem at the heart of Christianity with a theodicy of human insufficiency—the archange~<br>

Author(s): Csordas Thomas<br>
Abstract: With the preceding concerns in mind, I take up an issue that I am convinced must be addressed as the current moral agenda unfolds, that is, the necessity to confront the problem of evil as an anthropological problem. Here I mean the concrete possibility of evil, conceived not only as an emic/indigenous/local category or as an etic/analytic/cross-cultural category, but in an immediate existential sense. The emerging models we have just sketched presume actors who recognize moral challenges and want to make the morally best choice. They tend neither to theorize nor to address evil as such. Yet to elide the issue of evil is to dodge the question of morality, for in a sense
         if it wasn’t for evil morality would be moot. Whether one understands evil as undermining morality from below and outside or as intrinsic to morality in a foundational sense, and whether the very concept of evil originated as a product of class antagonism as Nietzsche (1967) argued, it must be interrogated. Does evil exist, and if so in what sense? Does it make a difference to distinguish ontological, cultural, discursive, or personal understandings of evil in relation to morality? Is it possible to be/do evil and not know it? Under what conditions can evil be perpetrated in the name of good or god?<br>

Abstract: After all, this is exactly what the play calls for at the close. As Edgar (or is it Albany?) speaks the last lines of the play, he affirms the necessity of an exhaustively personal response that goes far beyond our sense of what “should” be said in such a situation.
      
            Platitudes are too paltry for what we have witnessed. If we are to do justice to the suffering and exposedness of those before us, we must offer more than our conventional expressions of consolation. We must bravely enter that unscripted, self-delivering realm of discourse that Levinas calls “conversation” and that Shakespeare calls “speaking what we feel.”
               
         The weight of this sad time we must obey,
               Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.
               The oldest hath borne most. We that are young

Abstract: For Aristotle, chance is a cause, similar to nature as a cause. Natural motions operate both for a purpose and in accordance with necessity. They are purposive since the sequences of natural processes are not at random. Having set forth the principles, causes, and kinds of motions, Aristotle proceeds in the third and fourth books of his
      Physicsto determine the nature of motion and to examine fundamental concepts, such as infinity, place, void, and time, associated with motion. It is at the end of the fourth book of thePhysics, Mooij maintains, that Aristotle posits the principle, “there can be no time without the rational mind, that mind is only required to measure something that in other respects has full existence independently of the mind” (p. 77).<br>

Abstract: Au cours d'une période qui voit Husserl livrer son testament philosophique, la Krisis, l'étudiante Simone Weil ouvre son Diplôme d'études supérieures, en 1930, par le constat du désarroi dans lequel se trouve l'époque et de l'incertitude dans laquelle nous laisse la science. Il faut opérer un retour à Descartes, dans une automéditation proche de celle que recommandait Husserl. Cependant Simone Weil ne s'oriente pas vers une phénoménologie. Loin d'explorer la sphère d'être du cogito, elle cherche à en sortir, plus rapidement encore que Descartes, pour rencontrer la réalité du monde, et inventer une sagesse pour notre condition d'être percevant, ce qui signifie, avant tout, d'être qui travaille. Seul le travail permet d'éprouver la nécessité réelle, et de retrouver « l'union de l'âme et du monde », dans les conditions créées par l'industrie. C'est dans la ligne de la vocation mondaine de la philosophie de Descartes, que Simone Weil amorce sa réflexion sur le rôle du travail comme fondement d'une sagesse, dans ces nouvelles conditions d'existence déterminées par la forme collective de la production. À partir de 1935, elle verra dans la crise un signe de la « faillite de Descartes ». During the period that Husserl was declaring his philosophical testament, Die Krisis, Simone Weil was a student starting her Diplôme d'études supérieures in 1930, mindful of the utter confusion of the times and of the atmosphere of uncertainty generated by science. One must return to Descartes, in a self-meditation similar to the one recommended by Husserl. But Simone Weil did not move toward a phenomenology. Far from exploring the sphere of being through the cogito principle, she sought to escape from that sphere, even more rapidly than did Descartes, in order to confront the reality of the world and to invent a wisdom for the condition of a conscious being, which means, above all, a being who works. Only work makes it possible to experience real necessity and to reestablish « the union of~<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in con~<br>

Abstract: Religious tolerance is a sociopolitical necessity. Social and political pressures alone cannot be expected to nurture a genuine attitude of religious tolerance; in the West, secular and religious documents rely on the concept of conscience for this nurture. In this essay I ask what claims people make on each other as they attempt to live in accordance with what they believe to be true and good. To answer this question, I examine the Pauline concept of conscience and argue that Paul interpreted conscience through an ethic and theology of accommodation.<br>

Abstract: The exegetical stories of Genesis Rabbah 8 portray God as engaged in an ethical debate over the implications of humanity's creation. These stories narrativize the necessity of favoring mercy over justice. The Deity must mobilize the attribute of mercy to overcome the justice problem of human fallibility. These stories rehearse the conflict of values in an "organic" fashion as opposed to discursive argumentation over abstract principles, and suggest a virtue theory grounded in mercy and kindness without being inflexible or absolutist. As such, mercy and kindness should be inculcated not over and above Jewish law but prior to the law.<br>

Author(s): LeBlanc John Randolph<br>
Abstract: Albert Camus's interrogation of the ethical and spiritual vacuity of the twentieth century convinced him that authentic political existence requires a vision that embraces while transcending the human condition. He found his ethical model in art. The work of the artist can be analogous to that of the just political actor. The principal components of ethical political being are all present in Camus's aesthetics: a vision of life in human community (lucidity), a grounded sense of justice subject to the limitations of human existence (beauty), a need to redress the defects of political reality (the urge to create), and an understanding that any structural solution is of necessity temporary (the need to rearticulate the initial vision). Camus's vision requires him to reject our positive political categories in the name of creative, grounded human being.<br>

Abstract: Religious echoes are resonant with race and gender in Beloved, raising questions best posed in a psychoanalytic register. Freud's sceptical questioning of religion is important for a consideration of the gendered, raced, and specifically religious subjectivities explored in the novel, as is Lacan's paradigm of entry into the symbolic order. Reading the religious in Beloved in light of both Freud and Lacan, and reading the poetically evocative Word in all three, I locate within the novel a profound ambivalence, an awareness of the limitations of language under the Name of the Father and the necessity—even potential good—of imagining within its system.<br>

Issue: i24354104<br>
Date: 1 1, 2000<br>
Author(s): ATKINS KIM<br>
Abstract: In his famous paper, What Is It Like To Be A Bat?, Thomas Nagel argues against a reductive physicalist account of consciousness by highlighting what he calls "the subjective character of experience". In this paper I will argue that Nagel's insight is important for understanding the value placed on patient autonomy in medical ethics. Appreciation of the subjective character of experience brings with it the necessity for an epistemological humility with respect to the lives of others and what can be said to be "right" for them. Appreciation of the subjective character of experience lies at the heart of empathy and our capacity to make decisions that genuinely reflect respect for the patient's autonomy. Through the example of a case involving extreme medical intervention, I identify some impediments to the proper recognition of autonomy. These kind of cases highlight the significance of affective responses with respect to the subjective character of experience, and, by extension, to our capacity to imagine and act in accordance with another's perspective. I argue that affective responses are appropriate and needed considerations in the case where one must attempt to assume another's perspective in order to respect autonomy. I conclude that understanding that experience has an irreducibly subjective character is essential to respecting patient autonomy.<br>

Author(s): Knight Christopher J.<br>
Abstract: In this essay, I argue that Penelope Fitzgerald's The Gate of Angels attempts to work out the difficulties that any intelligent, religiously inclined person must come to terms with in the twentieth, now twentieth-first, century. Fitzgerald sought not to shelter her religious belief behind a cloister wall, thinking like her uncle the Reverend Wilfred Knox, "that no cloister walls can be high enough to exclude the cares of the world." Among these cares is the desire to give a faithful report of the world to each other, to know this world as it exists in truth, and not to misrepresent it. Early twentieth-century investigations into the makeup of the physical world as well as the theoretical and intellectual advances possible with quantum physics were very much part of this desire; and in The Gate of Angels, set in and around Cambridge University's pre-war physics laboratories, Fitzgerald offers a beautiful rendering of the excitement engendered by these investigations. At the same time, Fitzgerald offers a picture, true to her own experience, wherein things that in the popular mind are often conceived of as opposite and irreconcilable—for instance, chance and necessity—are found to stand in a relation of sympathy, casting over The Gate of Angels "that sympathetic glow which," Henry James wrote, "forms half the substance of our genial impressions."<br>

Abstract: Having a voice, either at the level of the individual or the community, has been one of the atavistic ways of defining or asserting humanity. This allows for the inscription of the twin-capped hegemony of successes or victories and frustrations at both the private locus and the public sphere. The disruptions of this possibility by rifts between natives in pre-colonial South Africa were aggravated in the heat of the colonial suppression it suffered, and was compounded by the operation of apartheid rule. By reason of this misrule, voices were suppressed, with a few cacophonies of dissention breaking forth. The culmination of these disenchantments into the demise of apartheid significantly presaged the need for reconstruction and redefinition of citizenship and cohabitation, and hence the necessity for establishing a public sphere, or put alternatively, a public domain in the form of the Archbishop Desmond Tutu's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. This paper, therefore, seeks to interrogate the dramatic world(s) created using the material properties of the TRC in John Kani's Nothing but the Truth and Zakes Mda's The Bells of Amersfoort. The paper argues that the domination and manipulation of this public realm by the state at the expense of the individual is not only counterproductive, but constitutes a denial of the relevance of such spheres. The paper, going by indices in the plays, therefore, concludes that every individual should not only be: given a voice, and be heard, but be allowed equal unbiased participation. Otherwise, the public sphere would not just be impotent, but the idea of nation-building and desirable citizenship would be a mere ruse. Avoir une voix, que ce soit au niveau individuel ou communautaire, a été l'un des moyens ataviques de définition et d'affirmation de l'humanité. Cela tient compte de l'inscription de l'hégémonie à double face des succés ou victoires et des frustrations tant au niveau de l'espace privé que de la sphère publique. Les pa~<br>

Abstract: While Robert Frost's emphasis on ordinary themes has often been noted, his use of ordinary time bears further attention: his poems show how the repetitive pattern of daily living can be a creative possibility rather than an enervating necessity. His everyday verse suggests revised definitions of lyric temporality as well as new reconciliations of the dualistic oppositions structuring accounts of modernist and Americanist literature. In Frost, human repetition allows a willful independence endorsed by the natural world. The generally neglected poem "In the Home Stretch" demonstrates his most beneficent version of ordinary living, showing how retrospection and conversation are crucial elements of its practice and how marriage can promote these habits. Frost provides a contrasting, failed version of everyday practice in "Home Burial" and a comparable sense of repetitive possibility in "Never Again Would Birds' Song Be the Same."<br>

Abstract: This essay reconceptualizes President Theodore Roosevelt's "anti-trust" image within a "pro-business" framework. Critics who have measured Roosevelt's success by the number of anti-trust suits he brought or won miss the essentially rhetorical purposes of his involvement with corporate America. Specifically, this essay contends that his primary emphasis involved the promotion of the proper attitude in corporate leaders and the general public regarding the role of big business in American society. This Roosevelt did in two ways. First, he argued metaphorically for the necessity of corporations and the restraint of muckraking journalists. Second, along with employing metaphors to chastise big business, Roosevelt assumed the role of moral guardian and preached to corporate leaders to adhere to an ethical standard in business.

Abstract: El surgimiento de una identidad aymara entre la población indígena del norte grande de Chile es un fenómeno reciente, como lo han demostrado algunos investigadores en los últimos años. En este artículo se aborda el vínculo problemático que se establece entre indentidad y memoria como parte de este fenómeno nuevo en el que los sujetos involucrados, principalmente aymaras urbanos, sienten la necesidad de articular una memoria representativa de ese colectivo amplio que es el pueblo aymara, planteándose, al mismo tiempo, el desafío de construirla, o como sus promotores sostienen, de "conocerla" y "descubrirla". El análisis tiene como punto de partida las tensiones que cruzan este proyecto y cómo éstas se reflejan en los documentos producidos por distintas organizaciones aymaras a partir de los años noventa. Nuestro interés se concentra en aquello que los sujetos dicen acerca de la memoria aymara (nivel de metamemoria), los esfuerzos desplegados en su construcción y los recursos utilizados en este intento. The emergence of an Aymara identity among the indigenous population in the northern part of Chile is a recent phenomenon, as some researchers have shown in the last few years. This paper discusses the difficult link between identity and memory as a part of a new phenomenon, where the concerned individuals, mainly urban Aymara, feel the necessity of articulating a memory that would represent this broad collective group, the Aymara people. At the same time, they assume the challenge to build this memory, or, in their own words, to "know" and "discover" it. The analysis focuses on the tensions that exist in this effort and on the way in which these tensions appear in the writings of different ethnic organizations since the nineties. Our interest centers on what the subjects say about Aymara memory (the level of metamemory), as well as on the efforts they put on its construction, and the resources they use.<br>

Abstract: Quels rapports peuvent se nouer entre travail et liberté, dès lors que le travail n'est plus essentiellement vécu comme la marque sociale de l'aliénation de la liberté dans l'économie? C'est Marx qui élabore pour la première fois et avec beaucoup de rigueur cette question, en formulant la théorie des deux règnes, celui de la nécessité et celui de la liberté dans le cadre de l'utopie communiste. Pour autant, sa position du problème n'est pas sans maintenir toute une série d'ambiguïtés. En nous appuyant sur les analyses contrastées de Simone Weil et d'André Gorz, nous montrons la dépendance de toute pensée de l'émancipation vis-à-vis d'une philosophie de la liberté qui assume (Gorz) ou qui n'assume pas (Weil) une certaine épaisseur irréductible de tout collectif humain, c'est-à-dire une indépassable hétéronomie de la condition humaine. What sort of connections can be formed between work and freedom, since the work is not essentially lived any more as the social mark of the alienation of the freedom in the economy? It is Marx who elaborates for the first time this problem by formulating the theory of both reigns, the reign of the necessity and the reign of the freedom, within the framework of the communist utopia. For all that, his position of the problem is not without maintaining a whole series of ambiguities. By pressing us on the analyses of Simone Weil and André Gorz, we show the dependence of any thought of emancipation towards a philosophy of the freedom which assumes (Gorz) or which does not assume (Weil) a certain inflexible thickness of any human collective.<br>

Abstract: After some initial remarks on the ongoing historiographic debates regarding experience as an analytical category, the article first tries to show, through a concise survey of J. G. Herder's essays on Ossian and Shakespeare, that Herder cannot be claimed as a source for the notion of historical experience in the sense of an immediate access to the past, as the theorist of history F. R. Ankersmit has stated. Instead, this article argues, experience can be understood as one of the key terms of Herder's historical view of modernity, whose development he describes as involving a paradigmatic change in the character of human experience itself. For Herder, the shift from primary to secondary experience in the modern historical process results in the necessity of an aestheticization of historiography. In this respect, the article briefly concludes, Herder inspired 19thcentury historians such as G. G. Gervinus.<br>

Publisher: American Educational Research Association<br>
Issue: i368708<br>
Date: 4 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Yaroshevsky Peter<br>
Abstract: This essay explores the notion of meaning, particularly as applied to acts of producing and reading texts. The analysis is grounded in principles of activity theory and cultural semiotics and focuses on the ways in which reading takes place among readers and texts in a culturally mediated, codified experience characterized here as the "transactional zone." The author builds on Vygotsky's work to argue that meaning comes through a reader's generation of new texts in response to the text being read. As a means of accounting for this phenomenon, examples are provided from studies illustrating, for instance, Vygotsky's zones of meaning, the dialogic role of composing during a reading transaction, and the necessity of culturally constructed subjectivity in meaning construction. The author concludes by locating meaning in the transactional zone in which signs become tools for extending or developing concepts and the richness of meaning coming from the potential of a reading transaction to generate new texts. "When I use a word," Humpty Dumpty said in a rather scornful tone, "it means just what I choose it to mean-neither more nor less." (Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking Glass)<br>

Abstract: Political and legal debates over the value of official silence in the aftermath of civil wars are inconclusive. On the one hand, official silence is considered disrespectful to the memory of the victims and an impediment to establishing a culture of accountability and respect for human rights. On the other, silence is regarded as instrumental to achieving peace. Yet, longitudinal analysis of the dynamics of official silence in Mozambique demonstrates that, in this post-conflict country, as in others, silence has not in fact been achieved. Official silence in politically pluralistic environs can also offer opportunities for political elites to use memories as weapons to settle accounts with former wartime foes. In post-civil war Mozambique, Frelimo and Renamo over time have moved away from the initial strategy of official quiescence. Both parties appropriated the official silence to wage fierce political battles where memories of the violent past are used as the principal weapon. The interruption of silence through manipulative appropriations of the grisly past take place in dispersed political activities; however, the most confrontational and violent eruptions of memory occur in the Mozambican national parliament. These political confrontations signal the necessity in this politically pluralistic society for complex readings of memory against the prevailing monolithic official history.<br>

Abstract: O sentido da intersubjectividade em Marcel liga-se à intenção de "restituir à experiência humana o seu peso ontológico", o que obriga à recusa do racionalismo contemporaneo, caracterizado pelos principios de inerencia e de objectividade, adoptando uma epistemologia pluralista e relativista em que o universal se degrada em colectivo e o necessário em repetível. O conhecimento válido para todos reduz-se ao verificável, tudo o mais é apenas objecto de crença, da ordem do subjectivo. Esta concepção situa-se no ambito do problemático, isto é, do objectivo, do posto completamente em face de mim. O mundo actual situa-se a esse nivel, corresponde à esfera do ter e a análise desse mundo mostra que ha na experiéncia humana como tal aspectos que transcendem o problemático, pertencendo ao dominio do mistério, que diz respeito à esfera do ser. Para, alcançar o que Marcel designa por mistério ontólogico analisamse, fora do registo lógico, certos dados propriamente espirituais, como a fidelidade, o amor, a esperança, que nos conduzem a um eu, subjectividade livre, que é experimentado com referencia a um tu. O compromisso entre eu e tu traduz-se em disponibilidade e apelo e estabelece uma relagao que é o nós, um co-esse, uma intimidade espiritual. Dentro da economia do pensamento marceliano ever é conceder crédito a um tu. No limite, se o tu for absolute, o credito deverá ser também absoluto. O tu absoluto, Deus, é existente suprapessoal e nunca pode ser tratado como objecto e, portanto, demonstrado, mas está presente à invocação. Afim da crença temos a esperanga que, no significado auténtico, se situa num contexto de provação. Distingue-se do optimismo e do desejo, transcende toda a técnica, não se desenvolve sobre um saber. É própria dos seres desarmados e nisso reside, misteriosamente, a sua eficácia. Consiste num esperar em, experiéncia absoluta no piano do mistério e certeza de transcender o que se encontra em perigo na provação, e participação numa realidade absoluta que me e~<br>

Author(s): Lin Zhang<br>
Abstract: Judging Gadamer's theoretical stance is a complicated matter, and his ontological hermeneutics is usually regarded as a text-centered theory of understanding. Through an analysis of the phenomenological premises from which his theories take off, however, we can clearly see his reader-centric stance. On the basis of this stance some cease to seek for the original intention of the author or the original meaning of the text, which ineluctably leads to the ignorance of an understanding methodology. As far as people's intentional understanding is concerned, however, the important as well as essential task is still that of striving for a certain kind of understanding that is relatively correct, with universally effective methodology as its necessary prerequisite. What is more, herein lies the significance of the epistemology of hermeneutics. This article aims to re-insert a sense of methodology after hermeneutics went through a period of ontological reflection, and hence clarify that it is of necessity that hermeneutics resumes its text-centric methodological stance. /// 判定加达默尔的理论立场是一个复杂的问题。他的本体论诠释学一般被视为 一种文本中心论的理解理论，然而通过对他所从出发的现象学前提之分析，可以清 楚地看出他的读者中心论的立场.正是基于这一立场，放弃了对作者原意或文本原 义之诉求，必然导致对理解方法论的漠视。但是，就人们有意识的理解活动而言， 首要的以及根本的任务仍然是努力获得某种相对正确的理解，而普遍有效的方法论 就是其必要的前提，诠释学的认识论意义便在于此.在诠释学经历了本体论的反思 后，应重新注入一种方法论的意识，回到以文本为中心的方法论立场.<br>

Abstract: Although anthropologists have discredited use of the liberal and secular concept of "agency" for explaining Muslim women's behavior, their evidence comes from women who still appear rather agentive to Western readers, hence, muting the necessity and consequences of discovering and applying the women's own ethical and religious terms in their analysis. In Guinea's rural Fouta Djallon, women are not prone to mobilize and make self-interested decisions with immediately observable outcomes. Therefore, understanding them on their own terms requires greater attention to their religious frameworks, namely, to their use of visions of creation and afterlife to define themselves and strategize for redemption.<br>

Abstract: No centro do presente artigo está a problemática kierkegaardiana do possível e do impossível, ou seja, a coexistência dos opostos como explicitação do paradoxo, uma das figuras matriciais do Absurdo. Para Kierkegaard, o homem singular vê-se confrontado com o Paradoxo precisamente na medida em que a sua existência não cai sob o domínio da metafísica e do estético. Por outras palavras, o paradoxo invade a existência humana no momento em que se trata do paradoxo absoluto, escândalo para o Judeu, loucura para o Grego, absurdo para a Razão. O artigo mostra, contudo, que antes de se confrontar com o Paradoxo, o existente precisa de aprender a esperar, malgrado o absurdo, na certeza de que tudo é possível a Deus. Porém, a experiência do Paradoxo implica percorrer um caminho prévio. Por outras palavras, é necessário aprender a experimentar a "condensação do possível", seja sob a forma de melancolia seja sob a forma do escrúpulo, de modo a poder desesperar da ideia do possível. Mostra-se assim a capacidade inovadora de Kierkegaard, mesmo sabendo nós que o desespero constitui um tema filosófico clássico já deste a Antiguidade. O que Kierkegaard faz, porém, é colocar em movimento uma dialéctica em que o jogo dos opostos se organiza em diversas figuras precárias, sempre incertas e fluentes e que se escalonam segundo degraus múltiplos de intensidade. Ora é precisamente graças a este jogo de oposições que no pensamento do Solitário de Copenhaga se articulam, ainda que de forma frágil, o finito e o infinito, o temporal e o eterno, a possibilidade e a necessidade. /// At the center of the present article is the kierhegaardian approach to the dialectic of the possible and the impossible, whose co-existence gives evidence to the Paradox, one of the figures of the Absurd.

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Abstract: "Always historicize": Frederic Jameson's imperative today exerts a powerful influence on the study of religion. It informs a wide range of methods and, perhaps more important, it shapes influential definitions of religion and religious subjectivity and agency. This article examines this influence and argues for the necessity of thinking the limits of historicism. Building on Robert Orsi's efforts to identify a space for academic exploration in-between religious testimony/narrative and social-scientific diagnosis/ explanation, I turn to recent efforts by Eric Santner and Slavoj Zizek to articulate a concept of subjectivity-tied closely to Franz Rosenzweig's concept of "revelation"-in "excess" of history and ideology. Santner and Zizek do not argue for a new, extra-historical foundation for agency and for religious claims but rather theorize and intervene in the "syntax" by which we are bound to history and society. This approach to historicism allows the scholar of religion to enrich accounts of creative religious agency at the same time that it forces them to rethink their relation to religious phenomena and religious subjects in terms of what the anthropologist Michael Jackson calls "encounter."<br>

Author(s): MISZTAL BARBARA A.<br>
Abstract: The article asserts that a search for truth ought to be carrying out in such a way as to preserve or enhance solidarity. It demonstrates the necessity and the difficulties of making atrocious and traumatic historical events legally accountable. The necessity and difficulties have been recently fuelled by the trends towards the openness of modern identity and the growing importance of human rights, both of them demanding settling conflicts in the context of the multiplication of particularistic memories, yet without undermining social solidarity constructed on liberal foundations. The article argue that because of the hybrid nature of the task, unresolved tensions between memory and history, the erosion of the state's ability to impose unitary and unifying framework of memory, there is no simple and quick solution to tensions between memory, solidarity, and therefore to manage these strains we need to rely a plurality of contending narratives and civility of rules.<br>

Abstract: La tentative autobiographique de Jacques Derrida, portée par plusieurs de ses livres, paraît contredire toute une part de son élaboration philosophique qui, quant à elle, s'efforce de démontrer l'impossibilité de tenir un discours sur la vie et sur l'identité. D'où la nécessité, pour Derrida, de déplacer les coordonnées traditionnelles de la forme autobiographique. Nous proposons dans cet article de désigner comme hétérofiction la modification derridienne de la pratique du récit de soi. L'hétérofiction suppose une multiplicité de versions (il y a plusieurs récits de vie), une multiplicité de dictions (dans ces récits, le dire précède toujours le dit), une multiplicité d'énonciations (plusieurs voix sont requises pour porter ces récits), et enfin une multiplicité de confessions (chaque récit réserve la ressource d'un secret supplémentaire). Jacques Derrida's ventures into autobiography, as seen in a number of his books, seem to contradict a large body of his philosophical work, which, for its part, tries to demonstrate the impossibility of holding a discourse on life and identity. Thus the necessity for Derrida of displacing the usual parameters of the autobiographical genre. We will here use the term hétérofiction to designate Derrida's modification of the practice of self-narrative. Hétérofiction supposes a multiplicity of versions (there are a number of lifenarratives), a multiplicity of dictions (in the narratives, speech supplants content), a multiplicity of modes of enunciation (several voices are necessary to carry the narratives), and finally a multiplicity of confessions (each narrative keeps a supplementary secret back from the telling, as a resource).<br>

Abstract: Attempting a Christ-oriented reading of the Old Testament is a challenge which invites objections and obstacles. What is the degree of legitimacy or of necessity which the New Testament (the Gospels and Acts) provides for such a reading? We are concerned with those texts which set forth the principle itself rather than with individual citations; such a reading appears as inseparable from the foundations of the faith. Other texts are illuminating for us with regard to the way of carrying this out. This article presents the first lines of a response, by means of a hermeneutical conversion. It presupposes that one cannot distance oneself from the literal meaning and from its spiritual and theological content.<br>

Abstract: This article explores the nature of historical forgetting in the Philippines through the lens of Pierre Bourdieu's notion of forgetting as misrecognition, which is invested with power and struggle. The notion is concretized in the context of Reynaldo Ileto's discussion of the Schurman Commission, which was tasked to gather information about the Philippines as part of the United States' pacification campaign. Because historical forgetting is rooted in the structure of society itself, policies concerning language and education are imbued with power and class dimensions. The necessity of change in consciousness is enmeshed in the broader politics of social change, which is thus the context of the debate on the critical role of English in the Philippines. The political imperative to forget is inherent in—and partly sustains—the fundamental structure of social relations in the Philippines.<br>

Abstract: In the twentieth century the phenomenon of the subjective body was integrated into ontology in philosophy, moving from Phenomenology to Existentialism. The rediscovery of the body and affect as a way of thinking also led contemporary cognitive science to the topic of the relationship between emotion and cognition, to the necessity of expanding the model of the mind and of experiencing emotions and physical sensation. The extension of the explanatory possibilities of a scholarly metalanguage into the area of the emotions and physical sensation is also important for the analysis of the acoustic aspect of lyric verse. In the acoustic flow of verse, the sounds of language have, apart from a phonemic function, their own sensuous (emotional) effect of the articulating body. In literary studies so far the acoustic flow has been interpreted only at the segmental level as a sequence of phonemes or sounds (for example in constructs of acoustic succession, phonetic instrumentation, or phonetic composition). At the suprasegmental level the acoustic flow must be conceived of as a sequence of syllables, a sequence of articulated phonations, the semantic movement of the phonemic flow. A syllable has no semantic value, but does have an experiential form, which influences motivation, behaviour, and experience. In addition to sonic and tonal modulation at the suprasegmental level, qualitative modulation, modulation of timbre, and the sequences of tones and of noise are also employed. In modelling the semantic movement of syllables in a phonemic flow the methodological approaches of experimental psychosemantics have been used. Connotational objectivization took place in three dimensions that were polarized on the basis of domestic and alien, light and darkness, activity and passivity, and research was conducted with a sample of 2,800 respondents. The analysis of the acoustic side of lyric verse would be incomplete if in addition to accentual rhythm and melody we did not also consider ~<br>

Publisher: Beauchesne<br>
Issue: i40117536<br>
Date: 9 1, 1982<br>
Author(s): VUILLEMIN Jules<br>
Abstract: Épictète, rapportant l'argument dominateur, dit que Cléanthe en a contesté la seconde prémisse, à savoir que le passé est nécessaire. On expose pour les rejeter deux conjectures qui donnent une interprétation « logique » de cette solution. La première voit en Cléanthe l'ancêtre d'Ockham : il aurait contesté la nécessité non du passé, mais des propositions ayant la forme du passé sans porter sur le passé. Solution insuffisante si le dominateur n'est pas ambigu. Pour la rendre acceptable, il faudrait avec Jean Duns Scot, contester le principe de nécessité conditionnelle. Mais on quitte alors Cléanthe. La seconde conjecture, due à Leibniz, ne prête au passé qu'une nécessité conditionnelle de même type que celle du présent et du futur. Mais comment décrire alors la modalité propre au passé ? La conjecture qu'on proposera est d'ordre « physique ». Elle tire, pour la modalité du passé, les conséquences de l'éternel retour et du caractère cyclique du temps. Cleanthes solved the Master Argument by denying that the past if true is necessary. According to a first interpretation sentences, though in past tense, may be about future events. This solution, in the style of Ockham, supposes the Master Argument to be ambiguous. It is shown, however, that once the ambiguity is dispelled, the argument loses its validity only if the principle of conditional necessity is questioned, as it has been by Duns Scot ; but this has nothing to do with the « necessity » of the past. A second interpretation, given by Leibniz, identifies the necessity of the past with conditional necessity, but ignores the specific role of past in the argument. A third interpretation will be proposed which falls within the province of physics rather than of logic : past has no distinguished status because time is cyclic.<br>

Abstract: Comment le discours philosophique est-il possible ? Cette question met en difficulté, pour des raisons symétriques et inverses, la phénoménologie de conscience et la conception herméneutique du langage. Elle révèle la nécessité où se trouve le philosophe méditant d'assigner conjointement la possibilité de la signification et celle de sa propre réflexion sur celle-ci. Cette conjonction évoque formellement la doctrine flchtéenne de la Liberté. Mais elle ne peut être matériellement déterminée que dans les termes d'une Impression intérieurement et impérativement ouverte sur son autre. What makes the philosophical discourse possible ? This query calls into question, for symmetrical and inverse reasons, both the phenomenology of consciousness and the hermeneutic conception of speech. It reveals the necessity, for the meditating philosopher, to assign conjunctively the possibility of signification and that of his own reflection on it. This conjoncture formally calls to mind the Fichtean doctrine of Liberty. But it can be materially determined only in terms of an Impression inwardly and imperatively geared to its contrary.<br>

Author(s): GREISCH JEAN<br>
Abstract: L'article dessine une ellipse à deux foyers que toute tentative dépenser la religion avec les moyens de la philosophie devra parcourir. Le premier pôle est occupé par le concept de « religion », le second par la pluralité irréductible des religions historiques. Selon qu'on se place dans l'optique de la « religion naturelle », ou dans celle de la « philosophie de la religion », cette ellipse revêtira une allure différente. Publiés il y a deux siècles, les Discours sur la religion de Friedrich Schleiermacher sont une des premières tentatives d'aborder cette ellipse dans l'optique d'une philosophie de la religion. L'originalité de cette approche prend encore plus de relief si on la compare avec la tentative kantienne de déployer les représentations, les croyances et les institutions religieuses sous l'égide de la question : « Que m'est-il permis d'espérer ? ». Autant les thèses que Schleiermacher défend dans le deuxième et le cinquième Discours gardent une grande actualité, autant son analyse du judaïsme atteste la difficulté de conjuguer un éloge de la pluralité avec une pensée de l'altérité. The article sketches a bifocal model which any attempt to give a philosophical meaning to the difference of religions must keep in mind. The first focus expresses the necessity of a concept of religion as such, the second deals with the irreducible difference and plurality of positive religions. This tension has a different shape if it is analysed through the pattern of « natural religion » or the pattern of philosophy of religion. Two centuries ago, Friedrich Schleiermacher's Reden über die Religion give us an excellent example of the second approach. Its originality can be higlightened, if we compare Schleiermacher's thesis in the second and the fith discourse, with Kant's attempt to develop a philosophical understanding of religious representations, beliefs and institutions in the light of the question : « What may hope ? ». Even if Schleiermacher's « breviary of romantic reli~<br>

Abstract: Le discours philosophique, même lorsqu'il se propose comme chez Hegel de « sauver » intégralement les phénomènes, ne parvient pas vraiment à saisir (et en même temps dédaigne) le ceci en son individualité la plus contingente. La parole poétique est plus apte à le recueillir, comme on tente de le montrer à partir de l'exemple de l'incipit d'un roman de Claude Simon. Elle fait ainsi affleurer la vérité d'une obscure dimension de l'être que Heidegger désigne sous le nom de Terre. Seule une ontologie de la différence est susceptible de fournir une structure d'accueil adéquate à cette valorisation poétique de l'infra-conceptuel. Au niveau de l'herméneutique littéraire, il en résulte l'exigence d'une démarche particulièrement attentive aux détails les plus factuels à travers lesquels se configure cette dimension voilée de l'être. Even when it proposes, as in the works of Hegel, to « save » the phenomena in full, the philosophical discourse does not really succeed in seizing (and at once disdains) the this in its most contingent individuality. The poetic speech is more capable of catching it, as this article will attempt to show it from an incipit of a novel by Claude Simon. The poetic speech makes thus the truth of an unknown dimension of the being which Heidegger calls Earth emerge. Alone an ontology of the difference is liable to provide this poetic valorisation of the infra-conceptual with an adequate « home ». Asfar as literary hermeneutics are concerned, it results in the necessity of a method which must be particularly heedful of the most factual details through which this veiled dimension of the being forms itself.<br>

Abstract: The problem being dealt with in this paper is whether a text has only one legitimate meaning, or no meaning at all. The question becomes even more acute when the contexts of sender and receiver are different. Polysemy and ambiguity are well-known obstacles to communication on the level of the word. The necessity of a general semiotic theory is stressed, and explains the difference between denotation and connotation. The functionality of metaphor in biblical language points to the interpretive value of polyvalency. The impression of unlimited indeterminacy created by the recent emphasis on the active role of the reader, is in a sense misleading since author and reader function as a textual strategy. On the other hand, the actualization of the textual expression as the content of the text by applying the various codes and subcodes, implies a continuous interaction between intensional and extensional approaches. In this respect topics, thematics, ideological and world structures are operative. Since interpretation and application are not to be separated in a pragmatic context, as is the case with the text of the Bible, there inevitably remains the possibility of multiple interpretations due to the interpreting and applying of the text of the Bible in a concrete situation. Yet this interpretation and appropriation should always be done as comprehension of the text and in continuity with the tradition.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo trata da clássica relação entre as ordens moral e jurídica, no contexto problemático do direito contemporâneo, acentuado pela crise nos países ocidentais do Estado constitucional. O autor defende a necessidade da relação entre o conhecer e o agir no direito, ou seja, de afirmar a relevância de uma unidade autêntica e coesa entre a teoria e a prática jurídicas. Por um lado, a coerência jurídica deve estar baseada no rigor lógico, por outro, essa coerência exige o compromisso e a responsabilidade dos agentes jurídicos. Portanto, neste artigo é sugerida a necessidade de um compromisso verdadeiro com os fins próprios do Direito e, ainda, que a responsabilidade se converta em condição ineludível para, juridicamente, saber distribuir com justiça. This article deals with the classical relations between moral and juridical orders, in the problematic frame of contemporary Law, marked by the current crises, in western countries, of constitutional State. The author argues for the necessity of a relationship, in Law, between knowing and acting, that is, the necessity of affirming the relevance of an authentic and cohesive unity between theory and juridical practice. On the one hand, the juridical coherence must be based on logical rigor, on the other, that coherence requires the commitment and responsibility of legal agents. So, in this article it is suggested the need for a genuine commitment to the purposes of Law and, also, that the responsibility becomes the unavoidable condition to know, legally, how to distribute with justice.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd<br>
Issue: i40128072<br>
Date: 5 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Mills Mary<br>
Abstract: This paper explores the profiles of the women characters Sarah and Hagar as models of human identity. The two characters can only be explored through reading the over-arching narrative of the story of Abraham. Their profiles and narrated personalities have to be extracted from that narrative, but there is a two-sided nature of this necessity. If Sarah and Hagar cannot be separated from the biblical narrator's engagement with father Abraham, neither can Abraham function as father of the nations except through his interaction with these two women. The reader is thus led towards an understanding of how the stories of Genesis 12-24 deal with the issue of parenthood. The body of the paper consists in a close reading of the biblical material following a method of reading which is rooted in the use of imagination as an exegetical tool - a style adopted by Paul in his allegorical approach to Sarah and Hagar in Galatians 4. This approach opens into narrative criticism with a focus on characterisation and on the interactions of Sarah, Hagar and Abraham, caught up in a Domestic Comedy. The women's characters are explored through the themes of parenthood as other, the other woman and woman as other. A final section explores some of the points of narrative ethics to be extracted from the close textual readings of the paper, with reference to the writings of Paul Ricoeur and Emmanuel Levinas. It is suggested that female as well as male characters may offer fruitful models for human identity.<br>

Abstract: According to German criminal law, a person who violates a criminal law rule will be excused under the conditions of § 35 German Criminal Code (necessity as an excuse). What are the reasons for not holding an offender responsible in these cases although he may have even caused the death of his victim? In section II of this essay, the usual answers to this question are analysed. The result is that none of them is utterly convincing. They all have in common that they underestimate the importance of the victim's interest in his personal freedom. In section III, the author puts forward his own interpretation of § 35 German Criminal Code. This interpretation is based on the distinction between two meanings of legal freedom. In the first place the members of a legal community are obliged to respect the „negative freedom“ of each other. On the basis of this understanding of „freedom“ the defence of necessity appears as an alien element within the system of criminal law. However, the status of the members of a legal community is not confined to their „negative freedom.“ To some extent, the criminal law also recognizes their „positive freedom“: the interest of each individual to preserve his personal integrity. The defence of necessity in § 35 German Criminal Code can be interpreted as acknowledging the offender's „positive freedom.“ In the final section of this essay (section IV) this model of explanation is applied to a range of detailed problems raised by § 35 German Criminal Code.<br>

Publisher: Duncker & Humblot<br>

Date: 1 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): Maschke Günter<br>
Abstract: The author uses the term "banalité supérieure" to describe Schmitt's somewhat shocking thesis that the true political distinction is the one between "friend" (Freund) and "enemy" (Feind). To be sure, this perception does not free one from the necessity of continually determining a new the concrete friend-enemy relationship. Using the more recent literature from Italy, France, Spain and Germany, the discussion centers around the question whether Schmitt had several political terms which he himself often used and combined in different ways. The author demonstrates the fruitfulness of the etymological and philosophical study of the words "friend" and "enemy". At the same time, he presents the thesis that "friend" is also a political term and, as such, remains connected to "enemy". Hence, it is not important whether a political theory accentuates the "friend" or the "enemy". The criticism that Schmitt's anthropology is incomplete is rejected. As the classic authors have shown, it is sufficient that a political theory appreciates the value of experience. Experience confirms, however, the existence of danger and evil in human nature. Nevertheless, danger and evil may not be regarded as identical; political theory and' theology must remain separate. In conclusion, the author rebuffs the allegation that Schmitt was interested in the destruction of the Weimar Republic.<br>

Abstract: This article is a critique of the demonstration by refutation of the principle of non-contradiction in Aristotle's Metaphysics, book IV. My method will consist in focusing on the dialectical nature of the proof, that means on the situation of dialogue presented by Aristotle as a constitutive element of the proof. Among the eight classical aristotelian proofs of the impossibility of contradiction developed in book IV, I have selected the three following: by the necessity of non-contradiction in action, by the necessity of a debate and finally by the necessity of a meaning of words, which is the demonstration by refutation as such. I try to figure out the presupositions that lie behind those proofs, and simultaneously to show that none of them is absolutely compelling, even if Aristotle suceeds in convincing us of the utility of non-contradiction.<br>

Abstract: Les analyses de Hannah Arendt et de Alain Finkielkraut démontrent clairement la nécessité et l'urgence d'une réflexion sur la signification politique de la pensée. L'humanité cesse d'être humaine dès lors qu'il n'y a plus de place pour la figure de l'ennemi : elle est multiple et pluriellement pensante. Ainsi la discorde est-elle le bien politique le plus précieux. Alors que la fraternité sentimentale et manichéenne masque le totalitarisme et la violence, la solidarité, elle, fait signe vers l'unité à travers le multiple : elle constitue un espace à plusieurs voix. Le Christ n'a-t-il pas demandé l'amour des ennemis? The analyses made by Hannah Arendt and Alain Finkielkraut show clearly the necessity, and indeed the urgency, of reflecting on the political significance of one's personal morality. Humanity ceases to be human when it decrees that there is no longer any room in the world for whomever may be its enemy; a body of persons tends to think collectively in this way. Thus it turns out that of all political stock-in-trade, discord becomes the most precious item. Good-versus-evil brainwashing, and calls for brotherhood on one's own side of a conflict, are used to mask totalitarianism and violence, but universal solidarity includes everyone and implies universal concord. Did Christ not entreat us to love our enemies?<br>

Abstract: This paper explores the
         sugyain the Babylonian Talmud that includes the story of the Oven of Akhnai, in BTBaba metzi‘‘a58b––59b, expanding earlier studies by Jeffrey Rubenstein and Charlotte Fonrobert. It shows that two scriptural quotations involving, respectively, David and Tamar, situated in the first part of thesugya, anticipate the subsequent story and clarify how it functions as a ““foundation myth”” of the Beit Midrash (Fonrobert), and, therefore, of male identity (Boyarin). I suggest that the entiresugyaconstructs male identity by way of contrast with two ““others,”” the divine and the female realms, which are excluded from the Law-making process. The danger of verbal wrong, however, reveals the necessity of reintroducing the excluded ““others.”” The text achieves this by recognizing the existence of a transcendent justice, and by making Tamar, a foreign and female character with no access to the Law, a model of delicacy in verbal communication.<br>

Abstract: The last stanza, “Let no man stand between us / and the river again” hints at the necessity for all to confront the devastating evidence that raised overwhelming questions. No one should stand between people and what is remembered; if people lose sight of what is remembered, they will no longer grieve for the dead, and the failure to grieve, as can be implied in Primo Levi's testimonies, derides the living and makes the recurrence of war atrocities possible. Little surprise therefore that Jabbeh Wesley declared in her interview that poetry was an outlet for her grief.<br>

Article Title: What Is Africa to Me?<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jafrireli.1.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 1 1, 2013<br>
Abstract: The continent of Africa has been an important meaning for several cultures over at least three millennia; it is, however, only in the modern period that an Africana discourse became a practical and theoretical necessity. Mudimbe, as a part of his initial discussion of an African gnosis, poses this urgent question, “Would it then be possible to renew the notion of tradition from, let us say, a radical
         dispersionof African cultures?”
               Similar sentiment is echoed in the caution expressed by David L. Schoenbrun in an article devoted to the history of public health in East Africa. In this article he worries that the possibility for a distinctive novelty which might be forthcoming from these traditions is always in danger of becoming dominated by the discursive narrative of Protestantism or capitalism. He holds out the possibility of alternative narratives arising out of African history that would be in tension with the dominating Western discourses and would speak more directly to the traditions and rhythms of African temporalities.23
            
               Schoenbrun alludes to a comment made by his historian colleague Steve Feierman, one of the contributors to the24
            Africa and the Disciplinesvolume. Feierman's essay shows how African history contributes to the dissolution of the notion of a “world” or “universal” history so admired in the academy. In the midst of his discussion of historians and historiography in several parts of the globe, he has this to say about the American Civil Rights Movement: “The slaves and the barbarians were not coincidental to civilization, aberrant at the margins; they were constitutive of civilization, the way civilization defined itself. With the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, similar perceptions began to emerge.”
               Had Feierman been as attentive to African American history in the United States as he has been to East African history, he would have realized that African Ame~<br>

Article Title: The Plight of Ethics<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Whatever the problems with Kant's moral justifications for republican federalism, it is instructive that with the third article of perpetual peace,
      universal hospitality, he literally grounds the connection between morality and politics on the limited surface of the earth.
            It is the finite surface of the earth that gives rise to the universal, if not infinite, demand for welcoming hospitality, which already moves us beyond the calculus of equality raised by Kant's articulations of the first two articles. We can follow Kant's notion of universal hospitality toward Derrida's articulation of it as the necessary but tense relationship between the ethical demand for unconditional, infinite, or impossible hospitality, on the one hand, and the finite conditions of limited, everyday hospitality, on the other. To continue on this path, we might say that while the ethical pole is the infinite responsibility of universal hospitality, the political pole is the finite necessity of living together, and if this is the double bind of hyperbolic ethics, then sociality is the rebound between the two.6<br>

Abstract: Thus “I” is essentially a nonascriptive form of (self-)reference. And its target is precisely what is itself nonsortal, nonpropertied. (Husserl's descriptions of the “pure I” and I-pole find symmetry here.)
            
                  I suggest that the referent of “I” is the haecceity or unique essence of “myself” that is individuated29
               per se. I propose that the evidence for this is what founds Robert Spaemann's thesis thatpersonis a nonsortal term. Some considerations may help evoke the basis for this claim. Again, of course, persons as identifiable beings in the world with others are of necessity laced with properties. Think of our public personae; our status before our municipal, county, or state governments; and our identity for the federal government as well as our colleagues and acquaintances.<br>

Article Title: Is a Hermeneutic Phenomenology Wide Enough? A Ricoeurian Reply to Janicaud's<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.28.3.issue-3<br>
Date: 7 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Davidson Scott<br>
Abstract: Hermeneutics, moreover, challenges the central role that Husserl ascribes to intuition, especially in his early works. The call to return to the things themselves is heeded by a return to what is given in intuition. But, as Ricoeur puts it, “the Husserlian demand for the return to intuition is countered by the necessity for all understanding to be mediated by an interpretation.”
         
               In support of this claim, Ricoeur draws inspiration from Heidegger's conception of the as-structure of being, which maintains that being is always revealed in a partial manner, as this or as that.13
            
               This as-structure suggests that nothing is ever directly or fully given, and for this reason, what is given always calls for a process of interpretation enabling it to be seen as this or that. If it is the case that all givenness is perspectival and partial, Ricoeur contends that phenomenology “cannot constitute itself without a14
            hermeneutical presupposition. The hermeneutical condition of phenomenology is linked to the role ofAuslegungin the fulfillment of its philosophical project.”

Article Title: Recovering Hyperbole:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.45.4.issue-4<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Derrida states that hyperbole is “the uneconomic expenditure,” which both can and cannot exceed economy. His statement has the structure of error without being an error. He speaks the language of extremity and of exceeding economy in order to emphasize the repetitive necessity of making the attempt to “throw beyond.” Through hyperbolic errancy, the repetition of the attempt-to-say-the-demonic-hyperbole, the signifier exceeds the signified that is already in excess. The attempt will never be completed but is always necessary. Thus, Derrida engages in a hyperbolic mode of thought regarding hyperbole itself in order to reveal that the radical attempt to throw beyond the economy of writing is an impossible possibility that must always be attempted but will never arrive.<br>

Issue: shaw.34.1.issue-1<br>

Author(s): Einsohn Howard Ira<br>
Abstract: This is very different from St. Paul's conception of original sin, which holds that through the disobedience of one man eons ago we come into life hereditarily stained—requiring a Christ to die on the cross sacrificially so that every person who ever was, is, or will be can be washed clean vicariously. For Ricoeur, contrary to Christian orthodoxy, the stain is not in us
         ab initio: we soil ourselves. Evil may be everywhere, Ricoeur stipulates, but not because sin is a fixed constituent of human being. Evil shadows us because the will is inscrutably errant, but nothing demonstrates to him decisively that this must always be the case. For Ricoeur, until proven otherwise, evil remains a contingent fact of existence, not a necessary one, which carries with it the possibility that what is ruptured can be mended. It is precisely the cleft between necessity and contingency, exactly this metaphysical fissure between what immutably is and what is mutable, that opens up enough fertile soil for faith and hope to take root. Simply stated, the posited anterior goodness of creation (the immutable) anchors Ricoeur's faith in the fecundity of life, and the correlative notion of evil's putative transience (the mutable) solidifies Ricoeur's hope that the indentured will can be set free. Together, faith and hope sustain Ricoeur in the struggle to retrieve a lapsed but not lost human species. And they do the same for Shaw, in the identical way.<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Problematic of Architecture and Utopia<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: But the emphasis on failure as a product of design, or as a consequence of somehow having arrived at the wrong style, arguably forecloses on utopian possibility in architecture. As K. G. Bristol observes, adoption of the demolition of Pruitt-Igoe as representative of the failings of modern architecture, and as a marker of its demise, has at its core “the idea that architectural design was responsible for the demise of Pruitt-Igoe.”
         
               Hiding in this insight is a contribution to sharpening an understanding of just how Utopia might be alternatively construed in architecture, shedding light on how any understanding of Utopia that begins and ends with form (with design), with representation or spatial closure alone, really must be abandoned before Utopia can make a meaningful contribution to imagining architecture and the city in all their depth. As noted earlier, Harvey has conceptualized a first step in this direction in his development of “dialectical utopianism,” which turns on the necessity for “spatial closure” to be adjoined with the equal necessity of “social process” in the proposition of any Utopia that might take a concrete form.23<br>
