  Abstract: Both modernity and its artistic offshoot, modernism, famously involve skepticism and confusion, widespread unintelligibility and the negation of meaning. A few iconic names make the point nicely: Schoenberg. Joyce. Eliot. Picasso. Time may long since have blunted their radical edge, but the memory remains sharp. How, then, does either modernism or modernity fit, except as a tragic or celebratory passage away from bygone clarities and promises, in a historically sensitive theory of interpretation? Is a hermeneutics of the modern and the modernist possible?<br>

  Abstract: In his abandonment of painting there is no romantic self-pity, nor the pride of a titan; it is wisdom,
                  mad wisdom. It is not a knowledge of this thing or that, it is neither affirmation nor negation; it is the void, the knowledge of indifference. Wisdom and freedom, void and indifference resolve themselves into a key word: purity.

  Abstract: “What happens now?” in modern parlance often means “What happens next?” This is not so much an error as it is a recognition of the centrality of a conception of the future, even an apocalyptic one, for any notion of the present.¹ We are accustomed to the notion that the present is always fleeting into the past or yearning for a better tomorrow, a nodal point defined via negation and ungraspable as such. This intuitive, geometric model of temporality is precisely what Milton and Marvell seek to unseat with their lyric presentations of an immanent apocalypse. To treat an eschatological<br>

  Abstract: At first glance, it might appear that the title of this chapter brings together two mutually exclusive themes. Asceticism, conventionally understood, implies rigorous discipline of body and mind, the adoption of an austere lifestyle, which can lead to the abrogation of desire, expressed as denial and mortification. Eroticism, by contrast, entails the sense of ecstatic rapture that ensues from inspirited indulgence in bodily matters and the full embrace of the sensual. In the case of both, there is a confluence of life and death, albeit from opposite ends of the spectrum: Asceticism promotes the negation of life in the simulation<br>

  Author(s) Dumm Thomas L.<br>
  Abstract: There are many ideological and epistemological obstacles to understanding the politics of Judaism. Its foundational text, the Torah, both in regard to its biblical-Talmudic meaning and in regard to the historical condition of the Jews, has long been prone to misunderstanding. In order to approach the question of politics in Judaism, one must abandon the perception that this politics is theocratic. Since Flavius Josephus positively defined Israel’s political specificity in comparison with monarchic and oligarchic regimes in his book
                  Against Apion, theocracy has become equivalent to the very negation of the political. Spinoza’sTheological-Political Treatisehas established this negative understanding<br>

  Book Title: Crossover Queries: Dwelling with Negatives, Embodying Philosophy's Others-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): WYSCHOGROD EDITH<br>
  Abstract: Exploring the risks, ambiguities, and unstable conceptual worlds of contemporary thought, Crossover Queries brings together the wide-ranging writings, across twenty years, of one of our most important philosophers.Ranging from twentieth-century European philosophy-the thought of Heidegger, Foucault, Derrida, Levinas, Janicaud, and others-to novels and artworks, music and dance, from traditional Jewish thought to Jain andBuddhist metaphysics, Wyschogrod's work opens radically new vistas while remaining mindful that the philosopher stands within and is responsible to a philosophical legacy conditioned by the negative.Rather than point to a Hegelian dialectic of overcoming negation or to a postmetaphysical exhaustion, Wyschogrod treats negative moments as opening novel spaces for thought. She probes both the desire for God and an ethics grounded in the interests of the other person, seeing these as moments both of crossing over and of negation. Alert to the catastrophes that have marked our times, she exposes the underlying logical structures of nihilatory forces that have been exerted to exterminate whole peoples. Analyzing the negationsof biological research and cultural images of mechanized and robotic bodies, she shows how they contest the body as lived in ordinary experience.Crossover Queries brings together important essays on a remarkable range of topics by one of our most insightful cultural critics. Commenting on philosophical and theological issues that have shaped the recent past as well as scientific and technological questions that will preoccupy us in the near future, Wyschogrod consistently alerts us to the urgency of problems whose importance few recognize. To avoid the challenge these essays pose is to avoid responsibility for a future that appears to be increasingly fragile.-Mark C. Taylor, Columbia University<br>

  Abstract: The ruined churches of
                  Blood Meridianare symbols for a world where institutionalized religion is in decline and the belief in metaphysical experiences is difficult to combine with the findings of empirical sciences. The death of personhood is closely connected to evil: wherever Being stops and Non-Being starts, there is space for negation and fear. The collapse of the house of religion in the West and the absence of a personal God contribute to a metaphysical void that is claimed by Satan who is the denier of any existence.

  Abstract: As I stated at the beginning of the study, my purpose in writing this book was to examine John hick’s theology of religious pluralism with special regard to his rejection of the traditional Christian understanding that Jesus of Nazareth is “God incarnate, who came to die for the sins of the world and who formed the church to proclaim this.”¹ Hick’s negation of such a central tenet of orthodox Christianity is essential to his project of establishing religious equality among major religions, because, in hick’s own words, “if he [Jesus] was indeed god incarnate, Christianity is the only religion founded<br>

  Abstract: The organization of this chapter on

The first of its panels—Part I—shows the origin of evil, hence sin, in Satan’s envy when the Son is exalted, an envy that underlies Satan’s self-authoring pride.¹ This panel focuses primarily on negation and death. Part II, the second panel, which examines God’s terms of exaltation in greater detail, focuses on the inseparable questions of individuality, allness, and pride, each of which, even pride, has a more positive potential.² My argument in both panels grows out of two crucial speeches in Book V, examining them<br>

  Author(s) Wood Robert E.<br>
  Abstract: There is something beguiling about Anselm’s argument for the existence of God. By combining a negation with a comparison, it creates a definition that is both subtle and ambiguous. By telling us more about what God is not than about what he is, it bears a whiff of Eastern negative theology. And the delicate relationship between thought and existence, between concept and reality, carries within it the ongoing puzzle about how our (very human) reflections and theoretical constructions could possibly lead us to conclusions about what the world is really like, beyond all appearances.<br>

  Book Title: Metaphysics in Ordinary Language-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Rosen Stanley<br>
  Abstract: In this rich collection of philosophical writings, Stanley Rosen addresses a wide range of topics-from eros, poetry, and freedom to problems like negation and the epistemological status of sense perception. Though diverse in subject, Rosen's essays share two unifying principles: there can be no legitimate separation of textual hermeneutics from philosophical analysis, and philosophical investigation must be oriented in terms of everyday language and experience, although it cannot simply remain within these confines. Ordinary experience provides a minimal criterion for the assessment of extraordinary discourses, Rosen argues, and without such a criterion we would have no basis for evaluating conflicting discourses: philosophy would give way to poetry.Philosophical problems are not so deeply embedded in a specific historical context that they cannot be restated in terms as valid for us today as they were for those who formulated them, the author maintains. Rosen shows that the history of philosophy-a story of conflicting interpretations of human life and the structure of intelligibility-is a story that comes to life only when it is rethought in terms of the philosophical problems of our own personal and historical situation.<br>

  Abstract: Al-Nakba, or “the Catastrophe,” is what the Palestinians call the expulsion from their ancestral land in 1948, which created the problem of refugees and its corollary issue, al-‘Awda, the “battle for the return to Palestine.” As the moment of origin of the conflict, al-Nakba remains the most complex and the most emotionally charged of all the issues now being addressed by the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. The right of return is demanded as a fundamental right of displaced persons, but the Israelis see it as a negation of their future legitimacy and existence.

  Abstract: MY ACCOUNT of
                  A Fable, seeking the Jew and finding him in the potentially Semitic semen of the old general, risks simplifying the complex politics of the supreme commander’s sexuality. In 1918, aged sixty-two, the “old” general apparently approaches what Faulkner elsewhere spoke of as ungendered peace, but the biography of his missing years (1877–circa 1914), fabricated over two meetings by his contemporaries (graduates of the St Cyr military academy) in Paris (1877) and Zermatt (1887–88), suggests a life founded on a systematic negation of sexuality.

  Book Title: Contesting Spirit-Nietzsche, Affirmation, Religion<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROBERTS TYLER T.<br>
  Abstract: Nietzsche criticizes the ascetic hatred of the body and this-worldly life, yet engages in rigorous practices of self-denial--he sees philosophy as such a practice--and affirms the need of imposing suffering on oneself in order to enhance the spirit. He dismisses the "intoxication" of mysticism, yet links mysticism, power, and creativity, and describes his own self-transcending experiences. The tensions in his relation to religion are closely related to that between negation and affirmation in his thinking in general. In Roberts's view, Nietzsche's transfigurations of religion offer resources for a postmodern religious imagination. Though as a "master of suspicion," Nietzsche, with Freud and Marx, is an integral part of modern antireligion, he has the power to take us beyond the flat, modern distinction between the secular and the religious--a distinction that, at the end of modernity, begs to be reexamined.<br>

  Abstract: The sentence, “I am you,” had a positive content, made up of what was understood: propositions drawn from sacramental theology, metaphysics, and epistemology. These propositions converged into two broad paradigms, corresponding with flesh and spirit, that provided ways to explain how many became one, but they were by no means self-evident. The grounds of their validity went beyond logical, and even empirical, proof. They extended to yet more general doctrines that defied the law of contradictions and, indeed, that prescribed negation and the coincidence of opposites.<br>

Laruelle’s text itself bridges the diff erence both methodologically and thematically between these two kinds of thought; it is at once philosophicalandnon-philosophical.

  Abstract: Over the years, the perceived impropriety of Freud’s emphasis on the sexual dimension of the unconscious has, in the United States at least, sometimes led to a complete negation of the value of his thought. The controversy in 1995–96 over plans for a national exhibit devoted to Freud’s work and influence is a telling instance of this suppression in the public sphere both within and beyond academia.

  Abstract: Traditional utopian literature relates to the novel’s contemporary historical circumstances through a process of negation—contemporary society is present only as a repressed subtext, and visible only in the conceptual “antinomies” that the utopian text attempts to neutralize or resolve. In the previous chapter, I explored the effects that occur when, instead of repressing the connection between contemporary society and imaginary society (a repression that is designed to preserve the absolute “elsewhere” of utopia), a text actively foregrounds and thematizes the interaction between utopia and contemporary society. This increased interaction funds an “ideologeme of activism” within the text, while the<br>

Author(s): Marion Jean‐Luc<br>
Abstract: A frightening consequence thus imposes itself: to claim to define what a man is leads to or at least opens the possibility of leading to the elimination of that which does not correspond to this definition. Every political proscription, every racial extermination, every ethnic cleansing, every determination of that which does not merit life—all of these rest upon a claim to define (scientifically or ideologically) the humanity of man; without this claimed guarantee, no one could put such political programs into motion. Even the worst of modern tyrants needs reasons and concepts. Here we find a new
         experientia crucis: in order to kill a human being, it is necessary to have the permission to kill. But in order to have that, it is first necessary to be able to deny to such and such a human being (the well‐named “So and So”) his or her face and thus his or her humanity; and one gets there by defining and comprehending humanity through concepts, by fixing its limits and, in this way, discovering the one who cannot claim humanity, and thus can or ought to die. Here a metaphysical proposition in appearance perfectly neutral takes on the aspect of a silent threat: every determination is a negation, or more exactly (because in the event the issue is extension alone), “figura non aliud quam determinatio, et determinatio negatio est” (“figure is nothing but limitation, and limitation is negation”).23Determining amounts to denying (and not the inverse, for if determination is sufficient for denial, a negation does not always suffice to determine). Determining the humanity of man thus amounts to making an end of him.<br>

Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: I would like to conclude this essay by suggesting a model for understanding the relationship between apologetics and comparative theology that builds on Clooney’s general idea that comparative theology replaces apologetics while retaining an apologetic dimension. And yet, while adhering to the basic guidelines set by Clooney’s position, the model I propose differs in that it places greater emphasis on the aspect of discontinuity between comparative theology and traditional apologetics. I shall argue that comparative theology’s relationship to apologetics is better understood, not as a relation of subsumption, but rather as one of sublation, implying an element of negation. Comparative theology presupposes the negation of apologetics as apologetics is traditionally understood. An apologetic element is indeed preserved in comparative theology but only in a radically altered form.<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: For Kant, a “boundary” always presupposes a positive conception of the enclosing region (e.g., the field of noumena) beyond the enclosed space (e.g., the “field of experience”), defining a shared border where the two spaces “touch” (sec. 57). In contrast, a “limit” defines a border as merely a negation of an incomplete quantitative series. Theoretical reason (mathematics and natural science) has no boundary; new cognition extends to infinity. Bourgeois’s main point is that the very enterprise of critique founders without its boundary relation to the positive content provided by the Ideas of Reason (ideas of the completion of the series of conditions)—in particular, as “postulates of pure reason” practically indispensable for obedience to the objectively binding moral law. Bourgeois cites Kant: “[The end of reason] is ‘to point out to us actually not only the bounds of the pure use of reason, but also the way to determine them’” (p. 43). What grounds critique and critical metaphysics is not reason in its conditioned use, the understanding (

Abstract: On the other side of the barricade, the supporters of the destruction also had a variety of motivations. Some were unabashedly anti‐Communist, considering the mausoleum an arrogant symbol of totalitarianism. Prime Minister Kostov said the mausoleum created a false impression of Bulgarian identity; it was a negation of parliamentary democracy and therefore had to go.
         68The most ardent activist of the destruction campaign, Bakîrdzhiev, regretted that he had not pushed the button for the explosion himself: “Then it would surely have worked the first time.”69The other vice premier, Alexander Bozhkov, clearly identified the blowing up with democracy, and he commented: “In Bulgaria nothing happens the first time. Everything is tortured, difficult: democracy, the transformations, the destruction of the mausoleum. Everything we do we have to do twice.”70The journalist Georgi Daskalov hailed the blowing up as a spiritual liberation for all Bulgarians, who were previously “forced to pay homage to fabricated, mythical [izmisleni] deities” (apparently implying that there are unfabricated ones).71<br>

Abstract: Regarding Śaṅkara’s Advaitic perspective as internally constituted by the realistic discourse that it spins makes unnecessary many of the speculative hypotheses proposed to account for the presence of realistic elements in Śaṅkara’s thought. I am thinking in particular of the attempts on the part of scholars such as Paul Hacker and Tilmann Vetter to correlate the realist and illusionist tendencies in Śaṅkara’s thought to different stages in his philosophical development.
         71Along the lines of John Taber’s hypothesis that such developmental theories are often proposed in default of an adequate philosophical understanding of Śaṅkara’s texts,72I suspect that such theories partly reflect a failure to acknowledge the double‐voiced character of Śaṅkara’s thought.73They effectively pull apart the dialectical unity of Śaṅkara’s double‐voiced, commentarial discourse by assigning the voices to different phases in his career. According to Hacker’s well‐known conversion theory, for example, the realist elements of Śaṅkara’s oeuvre stem from a pre‐Advaita phase of his career when he wrote as an adherent of Yoga.74Yet realist elements stubbornly persist in Śaṅkara’s postconversion, Advaita works. Hacker’s explanation of these as mere survivals from Śaṅkara’s yogic past, as lapses into old habits of thought,75might appear as a makeshift intended to rescue a dubious theory from the evidence. That these realist elements cannot be so easily dismissed is indicated by the fact that at least one other scholar, Srinivasa Rao, makes them the basis for a realist interpretation of Śaṅkara.76In what appears to be an attempt to rescue the great name of Śaṅkara from orientalist and Christian apologetic critiques of “Hindu” quietism and world negation, Rao argues—somewhat unconvincingly in my view—that Śaṅkara never taught that the world was unreal.77Such a view appears only later among Śaṅkara’s followers.78Although the interpretations of Hacker and Rao differ radically with respect to~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Abstract: We can do likewise with the sociopolitical logic of a burst of comic rather than lyric prose to follow at the wedding, where the ingenuity of lexical form again takes upon itself the role of softening its own content. The one character, Pancks by name, whose fate is not yet logged in or predictably tabled, must be commandeered by the wedding ritual. For this loose end is a true loose cannon, and his powder needs dampening. The pattern is not unfamiliar. The repeated self-division and self-doubling of characterization has already pictured for us the riven and nearly effaced hero, who was once to have shared honors with a satirized bureaucracy in the broad application of the novel's working title,
         Nobody's Fault. Clennam is a man haunted by his idiomatic doppelganger in the pronominal “nobody,” a self-cancelling ghost sprung from the vernacular substrate of the hero's own equivocated desire. The phantasmal negation first sneaks up on him in an unobtrusive fold of indirect discourse. Whose weakness could it possibly be to cloak a hopeless infatuation for a pretty younger woman like Pet Meagles? As Clennam protests too much in an extruded internal monologue, it is “nobody's, nobody's within his knowledge”—and this in the capping paragraph of the namesake chapter “Nobody's Weakness” (LD,p. 200). In nonentity's name, rather than his own, is he often identified from this point on. The novel also literalizes, materializes, elsewhere such psychic splits in, for instance, the “mermaid” bifurcation of Arthur's former heartthrob, Flora Finching, half sympathetic disappointed widow, half blithering romantic virgin. Most Dickensian of all, given its linguistic register, is the character constellation of the two Flintwinches, with thetwinat the punned-upon core of their shared surname offering a model for the way stylistics (here in the form of onomastics) can be angled toward a narratographic clue to the plot-long mystery involving their congenital rather than just uncan~<br>

Author(s): Balsamo Gian<br>
Abstract: The coordination of the work of involuntary memory with the work of dreams is the vehicle for Marcel’s recuperation of his amorous self. He renounces his current, self‐centered self for the altruistic self that embodies “the diminished life” of his resurrected grandmother.
         63I have used elsewhere the predicate of “altruism” to designate a project of self‐expression that incorporates alterity as its very raison d’être, arguing that genuine altruism is found in the expressions of human love.64In this perspective, one could say that Marcel’s strategy of amorous self‐discovery promotes at once the affirmation and the negation of personal will. Just as Schopenhauer’s rejection of the self‐serving egoism of individual will may be seen as revisionistic, and narrower in existential options, with respect to Augustine’s avocation of the perfectibility ofvoluntasin the amorous individual, so may Marcel’s commitment to the recuperation of his amorous self be seen as revisionistic with respect to Schopenhauer’s obstruction of will’s self‐affirmation. Marcel’s willful annihilation of his self‐centeredmoiis the diametrical opposite to will’s nihilistic destruction of the self; by renouncing his self‐centeredmoi, in fact, Marcel manages to salvage his altruistic self from the oblivion of unconscious memory, and thereby affirm it.<br>

Article Title: Critique and Promise in Paul Tillich’s Political Theology: Engaging Giorgio Agamben on Sovereignty and Possibility<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 651999<br>
Date: 10 2010<br>
Author(s): Walter Gregory<br>
Abstract: In the course of this essay Tillich proposes two kinds of critique: the rational and the prophetic. He had already developed and foregrounded the importance of the prophetic for political theology and continued to do so long after this essay was written. Here, rational criticism is wholly immanent and depends upon the transformation of reason as developed throughout history. Rational criticism does not aspire to an eternal and unchanging set of norms but relies instead upon its immanent and contingent judgments.
         29Prophetic critique, on the other hand, is unconditioned.30It relies on no norm or immanent measure whatsoever; instead, it offers an absolute affirmation and negation to the finite. Since Tillich had worried that the prophetic power of religious socialism and the early dialectical theology would remain abstract and silent before the world, it became decisive for him to articulate the interrelationship of these two kinds of critique in order to uphold the political significance of prophetic critique. He wrote that prophetic criticism is concrete only in a rational form and that it gives depth and boundaries through its limitless source, unbounded grace.31The prophetic is the site of the gift. We can note a convergence of aims here between Tillich’s aim to bring together the immanent and transcendent productively with Paul Ricoeur’s similar discussion of the economies of equivalence and superabundance in various places.32Considering the prophetic through the phenomenon of gift exchange will offer us a chance to further articulate the relationship of the prophetic to the immanent through the phenomenon of promise.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>

Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: This notion of literature develops from Blanchot's reading of Mallarmé as well as his encounter with the Hegelian description of comprehension. Drawing from Kojève's seminars, Blanchot begins with the notion that language involves the absence (the annihilation or death) of the object, such that for one to possess the idea of cat, one must annihilate the uniquely real cat in its existence.
         35“Common language,” Blanchot writes, recognizes this operation as unproblematic or at least productive. For in killing the real cat, I have gained something much more secure, the idea of cat, which cannot die. Literary language differs from common language not in the act itself, for by the very fact that it is language it must also enact a negation of the object. “But literary language,” Blanchot suggests, “is made of uneasiness” (“L,” p. 315; “LRD,” p. 325). Literary language draws attention back to the negativity of the operation, focusing on the fact that the word expresses the nonexistence of the cat and that what it has given us as a replacement is a word. Literature dramatizes the operation of replacement by offering “an endless sliding of ‘turns of phrase' which do not lead anywhere. Thus is born,” Blanchot writes, “the image that does not designate the thing but, rather, what the thing is not” (“L,” p. 315; “LRD,” p. 326). The mark of the literary is the mark of the trope, a turn. A figure of speech is a turn that multiplies the absence between the object and the word, for now what we have is a word that refers not to the object but to another word.<br>

Abstract: Suffused as it is with gentle tones and soft music, the scene is unlike any other in the play.
      
            Some of its elements, however, are familiar. When Lear rouses from sleep, Cordelia offers herself to him as she previously did in the love contest, inviting his gaze and subjecting herself to it. “Sir, do you know me?” (4.6.41), and “O look upon me, sir” (4.6.50). Lear shrinks back, confessing that Cordelia has ample cause to hate him. Her gentle reply is no more than a murmur: “No cause, no cause” (4.6.68). Like the “nothing” of act 1 that it echoes, Cordelia’s “no cause” performs the literal operation of negation or denial. Yet the meaning of her words surpasses their linguistic function.36
         
            Analysis always feels inadequate to Cordelia’s utterance because its meaning, as Levinas would say, lies not in the said (37
         le dit) but in the saying (le dire). What gives “no cause” its significance is not only the content it communicates but also the approach it enacts. Her words will always be in excess of interpretation because Cordelia is not using signs so much as she is making herself a sign, delivering herself to her father in that discursive attitude of sustained exposure and incessant offer that Levinas calls “the very signifyingness of signification.”

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in con~<br>

Publisher: Wiley Periodicals, Inc.<br>
Issue: i24542986<br>
Date: 10 1, 2013<br>
Author(s): Grethlein Jonas<br>
Abstract: This book examines Greek engagements with the past as articulations of memory formulated against the contingency of chance associated with temporality. Based on a phenomenological understanding of temporality, it identifies four memorializing strategies: continuity (tradition), regularity (exemplarity), development, and acceptance of chance. This framework serves in pursuing a twofold aim: to reconstruct the literary field of memory in fifth-century BCE Greece; and to interpret Greek historiography as a memorializing mode. The key contention advanced by this approach is that acts of memory entailed an "idea of history" that was articulated not only in historiography, but also in epinician poetry, elegy, tragedy, and oratory. The book offers a rich account of poetic conventions and contexts through which each of these genres counterbalanced contingency through the use of exemplary and traditional modes of memory. This fine analysis highlights the grip of the present on the past as a significant feature of both historiographical and nonhistoriographical genres. The essay argues that this work fills a disciplinary gap by extending the reflection on memory to a new period, Greek antiquity. The retrospective positioning of this period at the outset of Western historical thought brings Grethlein's investigation to the center of debates about memory, temporality, and the meaning history. In engaging with the book's argument, the essay suggests that historiographical memory emerged in Greece not as a first-order encounter with time, but as a second-order encounter with forgetting. This confrontation marked a certain separation of historiography from other memorializing genres. Whereas poetic and rhetorical memories were posited against contingency, historiography sought to retrieve those aspects of the past that may otherwise have been irretrievably lost and forgotten. In doing so, it formulated the historiographical imperative as a negation of forgetting that problematized~<br>

Abstract: This article argues that Jürgen Habermas's view of religion as anathema to rational critical discourse reflects his misunderstanding that religion comprises a monolithic and immutable body of dogma that is closed to reason. Illustrative data from Catholic history and theology and empirical data gathered from contemporary American Catholics are used to show the weaknesses in Habermas's negation of the possibility of a self-critical religious discourse. Specifically, I highlight the doctrinal differentiation within Catholicism, its longstanding theological emphasis on the coupling of faith and reason, institutional reflexivity, and the doctrinally reflexive reasoning that contemporary Catholics use in negotiating what might appear as "contradictory" identities (e.g., being gay or lesbian and Catholic). Although the data presented take issue with Habermas's disavowal of religion, the article shows that the practical relevance of doctrinal reasoning at both the institutional and the individual level vindicate Habermas's faith in the emancipatory potential of reasoned argumentation to advance participative equality.<br>

Author(s): Telban Borut<br>
Abstract: By focusing on children involved in the ritual practices in Ambonwari village, East Sepik Province, Papua New Guinea, this essay compares two types of ritual: that of healing and that of male initiation. Like other life crisis rituals both deal with two dimensions of the Ambonwari life-world, that is with the living and the dead and, in a broader sense, with people and spirits. Though both are based upon the same cosmology there are fundamental differences between them. First, healers in healing ceremonies treat uninitiated children as 'non-beings'. From the perspective of Ambonwari 'selves' or 'beings', children belong to this domain. They exist as extensions of their parents or carers, from whom they cannot be separated conceptually. Second, by examining the Ambonwari concepts of negation I show that healers do not approach the domain of cosmological non-existence: they are not concerned with the cosmogony of the Ambonwari life-world. The male initiation rituals do just the opposite, however. It is only in the male initiation ritual, seen as a cosmogonic event, that young boys are cut off from their parents and 'thrown' abruptly into a state of becoming. Unlike the healing rites, these rituals treat young boys as both Ambonwari beginnings and Ambonwari beings. I argue that Ambonwari initiation rituals are not concerned with symbolic death followed by rebirth, but with states of being. Initiation means that death becomes possible for a child. The initiated boy will now be able to die as an Ambonwari being.<br>

Article Title: Towards the Elimination of the Concept of Truth in Analytical Construction<br>
Publisher: Faculdade de Filosofia<br>
Issue: i40014441<br>
Date: 3 1, 1982<br>
Author(s): Lourenço Menuel<br>
Abstract: It is here proposed the elimination of the concept of truth in analytical construction by substituting for it the concept of terminal evidence of an assertion. Terminal evidence is in turn explained in terms of anschauliche non-deterministic sequences and portions of finitist logic generated by these sequences are sketched both for statements without quantifiers and statements with first order quantifiers. Emphasis is given to the nature of negation and existence in the proposed elimination. /// Es wird vorgeschlagen, die Eliminierung des Wahrheitsbegriffes in der analytischen Konstruktion durch die Einsetzung des Begriffes der endgultigen Evidenz einer Aussage durchzufuhren. Bei der Einfuhrung von anschaulichen akausalen Folgen lasst sich der Begriff der endgultigen Evidenz erklaren und Teile der finiten Logik, die solche Folgen erzeugen, werden skizziert sowohl fur Aussagen ohne Quantoren als auch fur solche, bei denen nur Quantoren der ersten Stufe vorkommen. Die Natur der Negation und des Existenz-Begriffes ist insbesondere hervorgehoben. /// É proposto efectuar-se a eliminação do conceito de verdade na construção analitica pela introdução do conceito da evidência terminal de uma asserção. Com a introdução de sucessões não-deterministas é elucidado o conceito de evidência terminal e os fragmentos de lógica finitista que estas sucessões originam são esboçados quer para o caso de asserçães sem quantores quer para aquelas asserções em que só ocorrem quantores de 1.a ordem. A natureza da negação e do conceito da existência são especialmente destacados.<br>

Article Title: Identité et conscience de soi dans l'Essai de Locke<br>
Publisher: Armand Colin<br>
Issue: i40040330<br>
Date: 12 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): Balibar Étienne<br>
Abstract: Le rapport entre « conscience » et « identité » forme l'un des deux versants de la conception lockienne du sujet (l'autre étant constitué par la « propriété de soi-même »). La théorie lockienne repose sur la distinction du « mental » et du « verbal », et l'isolement du premier comme élément de la vérité. Elle suppose une reformulation du principe d'identité sous la forme d'une double négation inhérente à l'esprit (Mind) : il est impossible que l'homme ne sache pas qu'il pense, ou pense sans penser. Enfin elle caractérise comme « intériorité » la différentielle de perception et de réflexion qui opère tout au long de l'expérience. Dès lors le temps intérieur peut être intellectuellement et moralement ressaisi dans l'unité de la « conscience de soi ». Consciousness and Personal Identity form together one half of Locke's theory of the Subject (the other half being « self-ownership »). First of all, « mental » and « verbal » propositions (viz. truths) must be clearly distinguished. The principle of identity has to be reformulated in logico-psychological terms, as a double negation: it is impossible for the Mind to think, without knowing that it thinks. Finally the difference of perception and reflexion, which operates throughout « experience », is called an « internal sense » or interiority. As a consequence, Locke was able to call « self-consciousness » the typical unity of morality and understanding which forms the internal « duration » of the Mind.<br>

Article Title: La théorie phénoménologique de la négation, entre acte et sens<br>
Publisher: Presses Universitaires de France<br>
Issue: i40040351<br>
Date: 6 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Benoist Jocelyn<br>
Abstract: L'auteur met en évidence l'ambiguïté de la théorie phénoménologique de la négation telle qu'elle est soutenue par Husserl. Husserl hésite entre une conception de la négation comme acte et l'incorporation de la négation au sens lui-même : entre une conception illocutionnaire et une conception propositionnelle de la négation. En définitive, il choisit la seconde conception, mais en l'étendant au niveau infrapropositionnel (à la perception). L'auteur traite ce problème comme révélateur de l'ambiguïté de la philosophie phénoménologique, suspendue entre acte et sens, langage et perception. The author shows the ambiguity of the phenomenological theory of negation, such as it is held by Husserl. Husserl hesitates between a conception of negation as an act and of negation belonging to the meaning itself : that is, between an illocutionary and a propositional view of negation. Eventually, he chooses the later, but by extending it to the subpropositional level (i.e. to perception). The author takes this problem to be revealing of the ambiguity of phenomenological philosophy, standing between act and meaning, and between language and perception.<br>

Publisher: Johns Hopkins University Press<br>
Issue: i40055853<br>
Date: 7 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Grillo Luca<br>
Abstract: This article analyzes the strategies by which the narrator of Caesar's Bellum Civile constructs his authority and promotes his version of the civil war. Despite being generally omnipresent, omniscient and un-intrusive, the narrator can abandon his covert position and all-encompassing knowledge and use multiple devices to guide the readers' perception of salient events. Switches of focalization, inferred motivation, presentation through negation and intratextual echoes color the narrative of key episodes, such as the negotiations of peace with Pompey in Book 1 and the descriptions of the battles at Dyrrachium and Pharsalus.<br>

Article Title: Filtering Rimmon-Kenan, Chatman, Black, Freud, and James: Focalization and the Divided Self in "The Beast in the Jungle"<br>
Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113412<br>
Date: 10 1, 1992<br>
Author(s): Stampfl Barry<br>
Abstract: Narratology may be thought of as a complicated system of conceptual filters that enact a severe formalist reduction upon the corpus of what may be thought and said about storytelling. According to Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan, this reductiveness needs to be expanded in order to attend more to language. One way of answering to her reformist prescription is a turn to the study of linguistic surface structure organized as a meditation on the metaphor of the filter. For Seymour Chatman this metaphor designates a character through whom a narrator elects to tell a story. For Max Black, "filter" is a trope for metaphoric process. Examining these senses of the filter in Henry James's short story "The Beast in the Jungle" leads to emphasis upon negations and belief qualifiers. In James's story, both turn out to be invaded by the logic of Freudian negation, itself a type of intrapsychic filtration.<br>

Abstract: Die Relation der Theologie zu den Naturwissenschaften ist ein besonderer Fall der Relation der Theologie zur Wissenschaft und ist durch die dynamischen Begriffe der Theologie, der Wissenschaft und der Naturwissenschaften bedingt und kann daher nicht ein fnr allemal bestimmt werden. Ich beschäftige mich hier mit der Situation der Begegnung der Theologie mit den Naturwissenschaften vom Standpunkt ihrer gegenseitigen Wahrheitsansprnche. Das große Fragenkomplex wird in mehreren Schritten analysiert.Nach einfahrenden und geschichtlichen Bemerkungen und Begriffsbestimmungen wird systematisch die Relation der Theologie zu den Naturwissenschaften und die diesbezügliche heutige Situation untersucht, wie auch die offizielle Stellung der Kirche (eine radikale Trennung von Theologie [Religion] und Wissenschaft hat immer Protest der katholischen Kirche hervorgerufen), die Motive fur den Dialog und die Integration und ihre Bedingungen dargestellt. Das Problem des Verhältnisses zwischen der Theologie (Religion) und den Wissenschaften ist typisch fur das Christentum und anderen Religionen eigentlich unbekannt. Die Kirchengeschichte liefert viele Beispiele direkten Konfliktes, in dem beide Seiten viele schwerwiegende Fehler begangen haben. So wie das Christentum auf bestimmten geschichtlichen Ereignissen (der Geburt, dem Tod und der Auferstehung Christi) aufbaut, so ist auch die Theologie an der Wahrheit ihrer Thesen interessiert. Schon im christlichen Altertum sind die klassischen und grundsatzlichen Positionen unter den Theologen entstanden: 1) einer radikalen Opposition und Verwerfung der Wissenschaft, 2) des Dialogs, der Versöhnung und gegenseitigen Ergänzung oder 3) der Gleichgültigkeit.Seitdem nimmt der Konflikt oft eine doppelte Gestalt an: eine institutionelle und eine doktrinäre (oder weltanschauliche). In Hinsicht auf den Charakter der doktrinären Konflikte und der Methode ihrer Losung muß man deutlich zwei Arten unterscheiden: den Konflikt zwischen den Glaubensartikeln (D~<br>
