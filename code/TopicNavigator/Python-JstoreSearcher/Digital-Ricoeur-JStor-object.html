  Corrections and Paradoxes from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1ws7x0t">Intellectual Sacrifice and Other Mimetic Paradoxes</a><br>
  Author(s) Ell Theodore<br>
  Abstract: In the previous chapter, we saw that for Girard the Gospels are not mythical texts, but the greatest form of demystification of mimetic victimage. In the Gospels there is no kind of confrontation with philosophy, understood as a discipline based on rational investigation. That confrontation rather takes place in the Pauline texts, where “knowledge of God” (σοφίᾳ τοῦ Θεοῦ) is contrasted with “worldly knowledge” (σοφία τοῦ κόσμου) (1 Corinthians 1:20). The former is the knowledge of God that was revealed first in the Old Testament and then by means of Christ; this must be the object of
                  faith, as Paul<br>

  Book Title: Intimate Domain-Desire, Trauma, and Mimetic Theory<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Reineke Martha J.<br>
  Abstract: For René Girard, human life revolves around mimetic desire, which regularly manifests itself in acquisitive rivalry when we find ourselves wanting an object because another wants it also. Noting that mimetic desire is driven by our sense of inadequacy or insufficiency, Girard arrives at a profound insight: our desire is not fundamentally directed toward the other's object but toward the other's being. We perceive the other to possess a fullness of being we lack. Mimetic desire devolves into violence when our quest after the being of the other remains unfulfilled. So pervasive is mimetic desire that Girard describes it as an ontological illness. In
      Intimate Domain,Reineke argues that it is necessary to augment Girard's mimetic theory if we are to give a full account of the sickness he describes. Attending to familial dynamics Girard has overlooked and reclaiming aspects of his early theorizing on sensory experience, Reineke utilizes psychoanalytic theory to place Girard's mimetic theory on firmer ground. Drawing on three exemplary narratives-Proust'sIn Search of Lost Time,Sophocles'sAntigone,and Julia Kristeva'sThe Old Man and the Wolves-the author explores familial relationships. Together, these narratives demonstrate that a corporeal hermeneutics founded in psychoanalytic theory can usefully augment Girard's insights, thereby ensuring that mimetic theory remains a definitive resource for all who seek to understand humanity's ontological illness and identify a potential cure.<br>

  Book Title: Memory Work-Anne Truitt and Sculpture<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): de Baca Miguel<br>
  Abstract: Memory Workdemonstrates the evolution of the pioneering minimalist sculptor Anne Truitt. An artist determined to make her way through a new aesthetic in the 1960s, Truitt was tireless in her pursuit of a strong cultural voice. At the heart of her practice was the key theme of memory, which enabled her not only to express personal experience but also to address how perception was changing for a contemporary viewership. She gravitated toward the idea that an object in one's focus could unleash a powerful return to the past through memory, which in turn brings a fresh, even critical, attention to the present moment. In addition to the artist's own popular published writings, which detail the unique challenges facing female artists,Memory Workdraws on unpublished manuscripts, private recordings, and never-before-seen working drawings to validate Truitt's original ideas about the link between perception and mnemonic reference in contemporary art. De Baca offers an insider's view of the artist's unstinting efforts to realize her artistic vision, as well as the cultural, political, and historical resonances her oeuvre has for us today.<br>

  Abstract: AT THE HEART OF THIS book is a basic question that has heretofore largely eluded serious attention: How does history make its subject? Clearly, not all subjects are deemed historical at all times—that much has been clear from the beginnings of the discipline. What is required, then, for a particular object to become a proper subject of history? And what are the implications of such constraints for the history that is being written? In other words, what this book explores is the

  Abstract: One particular mode of theorizing and explaining culture implicitly rejects, or is entirely indifferent to, both culture’s evolutionary development and its purely instrumental contribution to power. Instead, culture is viewed as something just there, and as ever self-identical. It is considered outside the flux of time, whether natural or political, or else endowed with so deep a history as to appear forever beyond time. And its stance in relationship to power is presumed to be almost one of consanguinity, certainly not that of an object to be deployed at the will of power.<br>

And it is lyric that allows one to locate and praise this present force, instead of reducing it to a wishful future or an inert past narrative. That, at least, is the lesson of Marvell’s Cromwell poems, as well as of his early royalist elegies.

Any time allegory is subjected to the critical palate of philosophical taste, it will seem a bitter alternative to beauty.

  Abstract: Phenomenology has been broadly characterized as the study of phenomena as they give themselves to consciousness, but clearly there are many interpretations of what such a study might entail. For Husserl, it seems phenomenology aims to observe what is given in presence to consciousness; for Heidegger, phenomenology has as its object the uncovering of what gives itself in “presencing”; for Levinas, phenomenology, in its failure, alerts us to what gives by exceeding conscious thematization. Paying heed to each of these three styles as well as others, Marion develops his phenomenological approach. In doing so, he maintains that what he achieves<br>

Even if something like nature in fact existed, the argument goes, we would have little to say about it, locked as we are into a self-referential meaning system,<br>

Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object.”¹ The effort to clarify this maxim might be said to constitute the subsequent history of pragmatism. Whereas there was a tendency in pragmatism to interpret consequentialism in a positivistic sense, it was systematically avoided by its main developers, Peirce, James, Mead, and Dewey, because they<br>

  Book Title: Malicious Objects, Anger Management, and the Question of Modern Literature-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kreienbrock Jörg<br>
  Abstract: Why do humans get angry with objects? Why is it that a malfunctioning computer, a broken tool, or a fallen glass causes an outbreak of fury? How is it possible to speak of an inanimate object's recalcitrance, obstinacy, or even malice? When things assume a will of their own and seem to act out against human desires and wishes rather than disappear into automatic, unconscious functionality, the breakdown is experienced not as something neutral but affectively--as rage or as outbursts of laughter. Such emotions are always psychosocial: public, rhetorically performed, and therefore irreducible to a "private" feeling. By investigating the minutest details of life among dysfunctional household items through the discourses of philosophy and science, as well as in literary works by Laurence Sterne, Jean Paul, Friedrich Theodor Vischer, and Heimito von Doderer, Kreienbrock reconsiders the modern bourgeois poetics that render things the way we know and suffer them.<br>

  Abstract: In his essay “Strange Music: Notes toward a Dialogic Sociology,” Michael Bell (this volume) echoes a concern about the epistemological foundation of sociology that has been developing over the past few years. Along the lines of Andrew Abbott’s (2007) call for a “lyrical sociology,” Bell proposes a sociology with two attributes: (1) an appreciation of the dimension of social life that is unpredictable and (in his view) therefore unexplainable and (2) an eradication of the detachment between researcher and object of study. Critical of the discipline’s penchant for “total explanation,” Bell suggests a sociology that views its task less as<br>

  Abstract: One of the great issues which divides thinkers in modernity is the status of ‘nature’. If nature can no longer be said to have a theological basis, what determines how we are to understand what nature is? Kant’s ambivalence with regard to ‘nature’ suggest why this issue creates so much controversy. On the one hand, nature ‘in the formal sense’ is simply that which functions in terms of necessary laws, and is therefore the object of natural science; on the other, in the form of organisms and as an object of beauty, nature appears to have purposes which cannot be<br>

  Abstract: IN
                  The Critique of Pure Reason, Kant argued that our grasp of the world is inescapably structured through space and time. In other words, whether we like it or not, our experience of any object is always located in a spatial field and temporal duration, conceived in Newtonian terms. The novelty of Kant’s argument was that he effectively bracketed the question of the ontological status of space and time, thus evading long-standing philosophical problems, such as those inherent in Zeno’s paradox of the arrow.¹ Instead Kant focused on demonstrating that they (space and time) are transcendental conditions of sensible experience<br>

  Book Title: Horror and Its Aftermath-Reconsidering Theology and Human Experience<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Stamper Sally<br>
  Abstract: Theological anthropology often brings psychology to bear on the contingent nature of human existence in relationship to God. In this volume, Sally Stamper articulates one modern trajectory of theological recourse to psychology (comprising Schleiermacher, Nietzsche, and Tillich) as the ground on which she brings clinical psychoanalytic theory and early childhood studies into conversation with fundamental questions about the relationship of God to human suffering and its remediation. She develops her argument from the assertions that human experience evolves within an awareness of human vulnerability to profound suffering and that insight into consequent human anxiety is a powerful resource for soteriology, eschatology, and theological anthropology. Stamper narrates this “normative anxiety" by integrating object relations theories of early childhood development and critical readings of literary texts for young children. She gestures toward a new eschatological vision that poses the radical otherness of a transcendent God as key to divine remediation of human suffering, in the process building on Marilyn McCord Adams’s soteriological response to human horror-participation and on Jonathan Lear’s assertion of radical hope in response to catastrophic collapse of cultural resources for making meaning.<br>

  Abstract: Since the 1980s, France has experienced a vigorous revival of interest in its past and cultural heritage. This has been expressed as part of a movement of remembering through museums and festivals as well as via elaborate commemorations, most notably those held to celebrate the bi-centenary of the Revolution in 1989 and can be interpreted as part of a re-examinaton of what it means to be French in the context of ongoing Europeanization. This study brings together scholars from multidisciplinary backgrounds and engages them in debate with professionals from France, who are working in the fields of museology, heritage and cultural production. Addressing subjects such as war and memory, gastronomy and regional identity, maritime culture and urban societies, they throw fresh light on the process by which France has been conceptualized and packaged as a cultural object.<br>

This notion itself is based on a concept of objectivity which introduces a categorical separation between reality and its description or analysis, and thus gets into the problem of the adequacy of representation and its correspondence to the object depicted.

Given this, it is hardly surprising that minorities have often sought to “pass” as white—i.e., present themselves as white persons.

  Book Title: Irony on Occasion: From Schlegel and Kierkegaard to Derrida and de Man-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Newmark Kevin<br>
  Abstract: What is it about irony--as an object of serious philosophical reflection and a literary technique of considerable elasticity--that makes it an occasion for endless critical debate? This book responds to this question by focusing on several key moments in German Romanticism and its afterlife in twentieth-century French thought and writing. It includes chapters on Friedrich Schlegel, Soren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, Thomas Mann, Jean Paulhan, Maurice Blanchot, Jacques Derrida, and Paul de Man. A coda traces the way unresolved tensions inherited from Romanticism resurface in a novelist like J. M. Coetzee. But this book is neither a historical nor a thematic study of irony. To the degree that irony initiates a deflection of meaning, it also entails a divergence from historical and thematic models of understanding. The book therefore aims to respect irony's digressive force by allowing it to emerge from questions that sometimes have little or nothing to do with the ostensible topic of irony. For if irony is the possibility that whatever is being said does not coincide fully with whatever is being meant, then there is no guarantee that the most legitimate approach to the problem would proceed directly to those places where "irony" is named, described, or presumed to reside. Rather than providing a history of irony, then, this book examines particular occasions of ironic disruption. It thus offers an alternative model for conceiving of historical occurrences and their potential for acquiring meaning.<br>

  Book Title: On the Anarchy of Poetry and Philosophy-A Guide for the Unruly<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRUNS GERALD L.<br>
  Abstract: Marcel Duchamp once asked whether it is possible to make something that is not a work of art. This question returns over and over in modernist culture, where there are no longer any authoritative criteria for what can be identified (or excluded) as a work of art. As William Carlos Williams says, A poem can be made of anything,even newspaper clippings.At this point, art turns into philosophy, all art is now conceptual art, and the manifesto becomes the distinctive genre of modernism. This book takes seriously this transformation of art into philosophy, focusing upon the systematic interest that so many European philosophers take in modernism. Among the philosophers Gerald Bruns discusses are Theodor W. Adorno, Maurice Blanchot, Arthur Danto, Stanley Cavell, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Franois Lyotard, Jean-Luc Nancy, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, and Emmanuel Levinas.As Bruns demonstrates, the difficulty of much modern and contemporary poetry can be summarized in the idea that a poem is made of words, not of any of the things that we use words to produce: meanings, concepts, propositions, narratives, or expressions of feeling. Many modernist poets have argued that in poetry language is no longer a form of mediation but a reality to be explored and experienced in its own right. But what sort of experience, philosophically, might this be? The problem of the materiality or hermetic character of poetic language inevitably leads to questions of how philosophy itself is to be written and what sort of communitydefines the work of art-or, for that matter, the work of philosophy.In this provocative study, Bruns answers that the culture of modernism is a kind of anarchist community, where the work of art is apt to be as much an event or experience-or, indeed, an alternative form of life-as a formal object. In modern writing, philosophy and poetry fold into one another. In this book, Bruns helps us to see how.<br>

  Abstract: There has been an increasing interest in exploring the social aspects of late prehistoric warriors in Eurasia. While some scholars have focused more on the ranking and prestige connected with political authority (
                  e.g. Earle 1987; Kristiansen 1998; Kristiansen and Larsson 2005; Shennan 1986) others have emphasised the fluid nature of identity and ethnicity and the wide range of variability in their material expressions. Such approaches have shifted towards theoretical archaeologies, which explore the nuances of the socially constructed body, object materiality, and the significance of funerary rites and monuments as loci for the construction and negotiation of individual and community<br>

  Abstract: The work of Emmanuel Levinas and Jacques Derrida has been of major significance in its critique of the modern Western understanding of selfhood and identity. For both Levinas and Derrida, Western conceptions of human identity and personhood post-Descartes are deeply disturbing. In placing the
                  cogitoat the centre of his philosophy, Descartes and his successors give primacy to consciousness and conceive of the human person as a self-constituted entity. Philosophy which gives primacy to consciousness has, argue Levinas and Derrida, always given priority to the “I” and turned the Other into an object.

In the discourses of Christian theology the endeavors to clarify, to confirm, to compel attention and to persuade, may all be said to involve the pursuit of such capacities. Because theologies of the Christian faith inherently look towards a public horizon—comprising

Economic phenomena are seen in their inner connection as an integrated totality which is structured by a basic mode of production.

  Abstract: Ever since the rise of the modern exact sciences, it has become more and more clear that the scientific mind is not bound by an exhaustive understanding of its own doings. The fact is that, while discovering the inner structure or the nexus of relations pertaining to an object, science ignores the paths that led to this structure or these relations; but these paths lie precisely at the basis of the ontological ground of the object. Husserl reflected on this legacy of the scientific revolution when he argued that “it is not always natural science that speaks when natural scientists<br>

Her approach, rooted in a broad understanding of the role and circulation of narrative art in culture, rehabilitates interpretation, both as a tool and as an object of investigation in narrative studies.<br>

Once the novel had lost its traditional vocation, any choice by a writer must be evaluated against its rhetorical effectiveness. Novels can use media for a variety of storytelling purposes, and contemporary writers can appeal to other media to reveal the potential and limits of writing. We have seen how many of these novels thematize the circulation of the media object within the story world to explain the cultural meaning of the medium of writing.

The co-authors proceeded to quote from Karl Marx and Max Weber to suggest that there was an epistemological principle articulated in the Saussurean statement that unified social science practice in spite of ideological differences, one that involves seeing science as ‘an instrument for breaking with naive realism’ ([1968], 1991, 33).

Most art historians study pictures or sculptures, concrete instances of cultural production, items that index the agency of some person, group, or force that created—or even simply chose to frame or set apart—some object. yet over the last hundred years or so, art history has developed into an increasingly promiscuous field of inquiry that<br>

  Abstract: To speak, in contemporary society, of art and beauty in the same sentence, much less as realities integrally involved with one another, is to risk becoming the object of smiling condescension. The great philosophers of beauty in the eighteenth century, including Burke, Hume, and Kant, treated beauty as a matter of sensation or taste, as either a physiological experience or a spiritual one, but always a subjective one. The arts of the beautiful were thought “to gentrify” the soul, softening it, making it more sympathetic in itself and sociable as part of a culture.¹ They succeeded in providing to the<br>

As Kaufman argues, the object of theology, according to Kant and most epistemology after him, is off limits to direct human observation. There is no way to directly prove the veracity of theological claims through observation in the same way as scientific ones, and for that matter, neither can one prove the very existence of the object of study itself.

  Abstract: The great power of words consists in their ability to represent thought as language, enabling the speaker to communicate complicated intellectual processes and extensive discursive descriptions. No other sign system achieves this. The image, although more effective than the word in presenting in a solitary, contained way what it represents, cannot comment on its object or analyze its own method of representation as language can. Similarly, gesture, or enactment, while performing what it represents and, in this sense, closer to its object, cannot reflect upon itself or the nature of its own operation.

  Book Title: Mirages and Mad Beliefs-Proust the Skeptic<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Prendergast Christopher<br>
  Abstract: Marcel Proust was long the object of a cult in which the main point of reading his great novel
      In Search of Lost Timewas to find, with its narrator, a redemptive epiphany in a pastry and a cup of lime-blossom tea. We now live in less confident times, in ways that place great strain on the assumptions and beliefs that made those earlier readings possible. This has led to a new manner of reading Proust, against the grain. InMirages and Mad Beliefs, Christopher Prendergast argues the case differently, with the grain, on the basis that Proust himself was prey to self-doubt and found numerous, if indirect, ways of letting us know. Prendergast traces in detail the locations and forms of a quietly nondogmatic yet insistently skeptical voice that questions the redemptive aesthetic the novel is so often taken to celebrate, bringing the reader to wonder whether that aesthetic is but another instance of the mirage or the mad belief that, in other guises, figures prominently inIn Search of Lost Time. In tracing the modalities of this self-pressuring voice, Prendergast ranges far and wide, across a multiplicity of ideas, themes, sources, and stylistic registers in Proust's literary thought and writing practice, attentive at every point to inflections of detail, in a sustained account of Proust the skeptic for the contemporary reader.<br>

  Abstract: We have had many fine artists who have been able to arrive at Abstraction through Cubism: Marin, Stuart Davis, Demuth, among others. They have been the pioneers in a revolt from the American tradition of Nationalism and of subservience to the object. Theirs has, in the main, been an objective act as differentiated from the new painters’ inwardness.<br>

  Book Title: Passage to Modernity-An Essay on the Hermeneutics of Nature and Culture<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Dupré Louis<br>
  Abstract: Did modernity begin with the Renaissance and end with post-modernity? In this book a distinguished scholar challenges both these assumptions. Louis Dupré discusses the roots, development, and impact of modern thought, tracing the fundamental principles of modernity to the late fourteenth century and affirming that modernity is still an influential force in contemporary culture.The combination of late medieval theology and early Italian humanism shattered the traditional synthesis that had united cosmic, human, and transcendent components in a comprehensive idea of nature. Early Italian humanism transformed the traditional worldview by its unprecedented emphasis on human creativity. The person emerged as the sole source of meaning while nature was reduced to an object and transcendence withdrew into a "supernatural" realm. Dupré analyzes this fragmentation as well as the writings of those who reacted against it-philosophers like Cusanus and Bruno, humanists like Ficino and Erasmus, theologians like Baius and Jansenius, mystics like Ignatius Loyola and Francis de Sales, and theosophists like Weigel and Boehme.Baroque culture briefly reunited the human, cosmic, and transcendent components, but since that time the disintegrating forces have increased in strength. Despite post-modern criticism, the principles of early modernity continue to dominate the climate of our time.
      Passage to Modernityis not so much a critique as a search for the philosophical meaning of the epochal change achieved by those principles.<br>

  Abstract: It is clear from even a cursory glance at the literature on Paul’s use of Scripture that studies tend to fall into one of two camps: some regard him as a great exegete, laying bare the meaning of Scripture in the light of the Christ-event,¹ while others view him as an expert in rhetoric, using Scripture to support positions that may have been reached on other grounds. Both sides recognize the importance of the Christ-event for Paul’s interpretations, but they differ as to its role. The former sees Scripture as a genuine object of study, able to “speak” to the<br>

  Author(s) Lamb Matthew L.<br>
  Abstract: The theme “Aquinas the Augustinian” provides an occasion to overcome some contemporary stereotypes that pit a Platonic St. Augustine against an Aristotelian St. Thomas Aquinas. Augustine, in this scenario, is a world-despising rigorist wrapped up in a subject-centered, self-communicative approach to questions, whereas Aquinas is identified with a world-affirming, object-centered metaphysical approach.¹ There are differences between the two theological giants. But the differences are far more complementary than contradictory. The erection of contradictory contrasts has occasioned misreadings by contemporary writers unaware of the Cartesian or Kantian lenses through which they project onto the ancient texts typically modern and postmodern dualisms<br>

And if one situates its origin just after World War I, when the political interests of the two communities found themselves facing off in a mimetic rivalry, whose object of dispute was the same land, it is, so to speak, a hundred-year war. Israeli collective psychology forged a representation of the enemy that was consistent with the collective mobilization of society the state required. Over the course of the conflict,<br>

  Abstract: Among the many changes we credit globalization with—including the increasing interconnection of nations, cultures, and economies, the rapid and widespread flows of persons, goods, information, and capital across national borders, and the production of new forms of identity and community—we may add the reconfiguration of academic disciplines from national to global frameworks. As a practice of critical thought, intellectual globalization is marked, as Anthony D.

  Abstract: Scholarly analyses of violence, including this study, also constitute a type of mediation and a genre with its own rules, expectations, and pitfalls. Many scholars who have taken violence as their subject of study have been keenly aware that violence is an especially challenging, perhaps even distinctive subject matter (see Nordstrom and Robben 1995; Donham 2006; Lubkemann 2008). Thus Donald Donham argues in his essay “Staring at Suffering”: “violence is a different kind of representational object than market systems or kinship. . . . Violence is red.

  Abstract: Hundreds of songs pay tribute to the radio. But only a few songwriters have produced such intimate and melancholic sound souvenirs of their personal memories of the radio as the Irish bard Van Morrison. Already in his 1960s hits “Caravan” and “Brown Eyed Girl,” the transistor radio was celebrated as a catalyst and mediator of strong personal feelings and emotions, mainly through its function of putting revolutionary sounds into the air. In several of his later songs, the radio became an object of technostalgic contemplation.²<br>

  Abstract: It was Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten’s
                  Aesthetica(1750), which gave the new discipline of aesthetics its name. Aesthetics was concerned with a special faculty of perception that Baumgarten titled “sensuous knowledge” (cognitio sensitiva). In contrast to clear and distinct conceptual knowledge, sensuous knowledge is acognitio confusa, a confused knowledge form. “It is not aimed at distinctions; it pursues an animated intertwinement of aspects even when it is a matter of a stationary object. It lingers at a process of appearing,” Martin Seel remarks.¹ These processes of aesthetic appearing involve compounds of sensation or what I will call figures of sensation.<br>

Such statements require further explanations of the aesthetic and, more particularly, the aesthetic in dance, which involves the ever-present subjective dimension of embodiment – the body-subject, which is impossible to know as the body-object is known.

As an emotional reaction to the denial of the loss of a loved object, be it a person, a place, or an ideal, melancholia gives shape to a “constellation of affect” or a “structure of feeling” encompassing the individual and the collective, the psychic and the social (Eng and Kazanjian, 2003: 3).

It is no longer possible to define Jewish identity simply in terms of the object of persecution and oppression.¹ Such descriptions deny the possibility of that conception of identity that Jews would attribute to themselves. The politics of identity has to take the divide between attribution and affirmation as central to any understanding and evaluation of claims concerning identity.

Literary multiplicity is widespread and, according to the Russian narrative theorist Mikhail Bakhtin, it derives from the multiplicity endemic to all language, which describes a world that is “overlain with qualifications, open to dispute, charged with value, already enveloped in an obscuring mist—or, on the contrary, by the ‘light’ of alien<br>

  Abstract: A theory of genre that will produce certainty about the real nature of literary works must await an answer to the question, “How is language possible?” Current theories that treat language “scientifically” in the narrow sense, as an object among other objects, must fail to deal adequately with the consciousness of meaning in the speaking and understanding subject. Precisely where the structuralist enterprise attempts to usurp the task of hermeneutics, as Paul Ricoeur points out, it oversteps its limits as a science.¹ On the other hand, philosophies of language that begin from the thinking subject and postulate a prelinguistic consciousness<br>

  Book Title: Merleau-Ponty and the Foundation of Existential Politics-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Whiteside Kerry H.<br>
  Abstract: Drawing on previously unexplored sources, Kerry H. Whiteside presents the political theory of Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1908-1961), one of France's best-known twentieth-century philosophers. Whiteside argues that Merleau-Ponty's objective in his political writings was to make existentialism into the foundation for a philosophically consistent mode of political thinking. This study discusses the inadequacies Merleau-Ponty found in the traditional philosophies of empiricism and idealism, and then examines the subject-object dualism that he believed deprived previous forms of existentialism of political significance.<br>

Extremes bring natural reactions, and the two polarities, called at the time the Intentional and the Affective Fallacies, seem to have compromised on a safe buffer state called The Text as Object, an apparently autonomous unit that encodes both its author (implied), or addresser, and its reader (implied),<br>

  Abstract: The contemplative tradition in Western art was an erotic tradition. Violent and exalted, eroticism took many forms, but it was always present in that moment when the contemplator took to his heart the object of his desire. When this kind of absorption occurred in the asymmetry of viewer and painting, it generally hinged on invention, that is, on the subject portrayed. When it occurred in the asymmetry of artist and painting, it hinged on the manifold experience of previsualization, that is, on the instant of choosing the subject. The pathetic and affective fallacies played a role in both asymmetries.<br>

No matter how careful we are to treat the object of our study scientifically, it will at some point want to “speak” to us; such is its specificity.

And of course, esthetic discourses of all kinds (paintings, books, plays) have always been prey to censorship. Tintoretto, Molière, Voltaire, Rousseau, etc., all had dealings with the thought police of their day.¹ In the last ten years or so, the age-old practice of policing opinions has acquired a new name: political correctness, offspring of the American liberal left of the 1980s.

In this sense we are not dealing with a traditional teleology, which would imply the assertion in the purposiveness of the universe’s evolution.

  Book Title: Protest Beyond Borders-Contentious Politics in Europe since 1945<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Romanos Eduardo<br>
  Abstract: The protest movements that followed the Second World War have recently become the object of study for various disciplines; however, the exchange of ideas between research fields, and comparative research in general, is lacking. An international and interdisciplinary dialogue is vital to not only describe the similarities and differences between the single national movements but also to evaluate how they contributed to the formation and evolution of a transnational civil society in Europe. This volume undertakes this challenge as well as questions some major assumptions of post-1945 protest and social mobilization both in Western and Eastern Europe. Historians, political scientists, sociologists and media studies scholars come together and offer insights into social movement research beyond conventional repertoires of protest and strictly defined periods, borders and paradigms, offering new perspectives on past and present processes of social change of the contemporary world.<br>

  Author(s) Lim Jie-Hyun<br>
  Abstract: Modern historiography has often been a tool to legitimate the nation-state ‘objectively and scientifically’. Despite its proclamation of objectivity and scientific inquiry, modern historiography has promoted the political project of constructing national history. Its underlying logic was to find the course of historical development that led to the nation-state. Thus, national history has made the nation-state both the subject and the object of its own discipline. The ‘Prussian school’ provides a typical example. Not only was Ranke the official historiographer of the Prussian state, Droysen’s distinction between ‘History’ (

  Book Title: Conflicted Memories-Europeanizing Contemporary Histories<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Ramsbrock Annelie<br>
  Abstract: Despite the growing interest in general European history, the European dimension is surprisingly absent from the writing of contemporary history. In most countries, the historiography on the 20th century continues to be dominated by national perspectives. Although there is cross-national work on specific topics such as occupation or resistance, transnational conceptions and narratives of contemporary European history have yet to be worked out. This volume focuses on the development of a shared conception of recent European history that will be required as an underpinning for further economic and political integration so as to make lasting cooperation on the old continent possible. It tries to overcome the traditional national framing that ironically persists just at a time when organized efforts to transform Europe from an object of debate to an actual subject have some chance of succeeding in making it into a polity in its own right.<br>

  Abstract: It is commonplace to state that the various object-relations theories are more easily reconciled with attachment theory than Freudian psychoanalysis. Freud invariably
                  derivesboth the libidinal directedness towards an object and the attachment tendency from the need for love or food. He fails to posit attachment as a primary tendency which needs no further ontogenetic elucidation. In this way, he inevitably comes into conflict with attachment theory which emphasizes the originality and non-deducibility of this tendency (Geyskens & Van Haute 2003). Object-relations theories, on the other hand, teach us that the libido is first and foremost directed towards finding adequate objects.<br>

The latter reason will lead us to consider the toolbox concept we deploy here in order to enrich our understanding of Belgian constitutional case law relating to federalism.<br>

  Abstract: Visual images have been the object of study for a variety of disciplines for as long as those disciplines have existed. They include art history in the humanities, most obviously, but also, within the social sciences, the sub-disciplines of visual anthropology and visual sociology. Geography has long understood maps and photographs as central to its project (Harley 1992; Matless 1996; Cosgrove 1998), and clearly many natural sciences use various kinds of images as evidence for their claims. More recently, however, certain kinds of images, and some discipline-specific modes of approaching them, have started to cross those disciplinary boundaries, with interesting<br>

  Abstract: ‘Ages of life’ are the primary objects that an individuated life comprehends, itself comprehended in classes and in genders. Today, among these ages, one in particular captivates, since it seems to be at the centre of ages, the heart of life, the object in the very middle of becoming: adolescence.<br>

  Abstract: Emma Simone argues that at the heart of what it means to be an individual making his or her way in the world, the perspectives of Woolf and Heidegger are founded upon certain shared concerns, including the sustained critique of Cartesian dualism, particularly the resultant binary oppositions of subject and object, and self and Other; the understanding that the individual is a temporal being; an emphasis upon intersubjective relations insofar as Being-in-the-world is defined by Being-with-Others; and a consistent emphasis upon average everydayness as both determinative and representative of the individual's relationship to and with the world.<br>

And this piece, this work, is performed by someone—an actor, a man, a woman, an herbalist, a hermaphrodite, a queen, a slave. Relating subject to object, to perform is also to facilitate transition.

  Book Title: Cannibal Metaphysics-  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Skafish Peter<br>
  Abstract: The iconoclastic Brazilian anthropologist and theoretician Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, well known in his discipline for helping initiate its "ontological turn," offers a vision of anthropology as "the practice of the permanent decolonization of thought." After showing that Amazonian and other Amerindian groups inhabit a radically different conceptual universe than ours-in which nature and culture, human and nonhuman, subject and object are conceived in terms that reverse our own-he presents the case for anthropology as the study of such "other" metaphysical schemes, and as the corresponding critique of the concepts imposed on them by the human sciences. Along the way, he spells out the consequences of this anthropology for thinking in general via a major reassessment of the work of Claude Lévi-Strauss, arguments for the continued relevance of Deleuze and Guattari, dialogues with the work of Philippe Descola, Bruno Latour, and Marilyn Strathern, and inventive treatments of problems of ontology, translation, and transformation. Bold, unexpected, and profound,
      Cannibal Metaphysicsis one of the chief works marking anthropology's current return to the theoretical center stage.<br>

  Abstract: Jean Epstein (Warsaw 1897 to Paris 1953) was a cinephile, poet, writer, filmmaker, and philosopher of the cinema. Not only was he among the few in the silent era to consider cinema as an object for thought—a daring position in those days—but he espoused the more radical view that it altered experience, thinking and philosophy, generating an original, nonhuman mode of thinking about the universe: an antiphilosophy. It is fair to say the questions of whether and how radically cinema might change our thought were first posed in earnest and depth by Epstein.<br>

In short, objects exist at many different levels of complexity, and they are always a hidden surplus deeper than any of the relations into which they might enter. The rest of object-oriented<br>

  Abstract: The final chapter of

In the first place, Derrida argues that expression not only (as Husserl sees) does not require fulfillment in order to exercise its meaning function, but essentially involves a lack of fulfillment.¹ The very structure of Husserl’s pure grammar shows that meaning excludes intuition, the presence of the object meant. This would be true even for words such as “I,” which means that the meaningfulness of my own utterances requires my own absence or death. Since writing is defined as those signs that function even in the absence of the<br>

  Abstract: Sigmund Freud, still the most cited person in psychology, began as a scientist looking intensely at the nervous system. The need to earn a living to support his family, and perhaps Viennese anti-Semitism, drove him out of the research university and into private medical practice. There, treating neurotic patients, he developed the discipline that was to become psychoanalysis. In doing so, Freud moved from the study of a natural object, the nervous system organized like all natural objects into hierarchies, to the study of the brain and the mind, the latter a natural object and a cultural object.

Now built in to the very fabric of discourse on South Asia, the central thrust of “post-Orientalist” critique is directed at the static understanding of “area” as an object of scholarly inquiry, and more specifically at the versions of Orientalism spawned by the intimate relationship between Indology and British colonialism. In hindsight, though, Said’s influence on South Asian studies may seem surprising, given that he has not specifically engaged the major source of Orientalism in the case of India, namely<br>

Let’s first of all recall that, from 1810 to 1850, Hegel and his disciples were the main figures on the philosophical scene.

  Book Title: Love and Death in Goethe-`One and Double'<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Dye Ellis<br>
  Abstract: Goethe, in association with his younger Romantic compatriots the Schlegels, Novalis, Fichte, and Schelling, struggled with the subject-object dichotomy, and tried to bridge the gap between self and other, consciousness and nature. His theory and practice prefigured the Romantics' determination to display and interrogate the linguistic and cultural structures informing their own thinking and modes of representation--what Goethe calls one's "Vorstellungsart." His work exploits, subverts, and supplants inherited conventions and signs, demonstrating with virtuosic irony that literature is a system of texts, pre-texts, and pre-established but dynamic conceptual models. 'Love and Death in Goethe:"One and Double"' explores Goethe's use, in a wide range of his poetry and prose, of the theme of 'Liebestod' (love and death) and related embodiments of the paradox of unity in duality. Ellis Dye also examines Goethe's use of other themes related to love and death--the 'femme fatale', the 'vagina dentata, Frau Welt', the Lorelei, venereal disease, the 'Lustmord' --and considers issues of selfhood and individuation as well as the possibility that the love-death theme contains an implicit gender bias toward the existential fact of personal separateness. Poems, plays, and novels are dealt with, nevertheless, as works of art, not only as illustrations of an idea or as points of intersection in a system of rhetorical conventions, and are examined for intellectual cohesiveness, elegance, and integrity of design as well as special meanings and effects. ' Love and Death in Goethe:"One and Double" ' explores the meaning of the central theme of Romantic poetry in the works of the most important Romantic poet of all. Students of literary culture, both the lay reader and the Goethe specialist, will be enlightened by its approach and find pleasure and instruction in its revelations. Robert Ellis Dye is professor of German at Macalester College.<br>

  Abstract: Museums and biographies both tell the stories of lives. This innovative collection examines for the first time biography - of individuals, objects and institutions - in relationship to the museum, casting new light on the many facets of museum history and theory, from the lives of prominent curators, to the context of museums of biography and autobiography. Separate sections cover individual biography and museum history, problematising individual biographies, institutional biographies, object biographies, and museums as biographies/autobiographies. These articles offer new ways of thinking about museums and museum history, exploring how biography in and of the museum enriches museum stories by stressing the inter-related nature of lives of people, objects and institutions as part of a dense web of relationships. Through their widely ranging research, the contributors demonstrate the value of thinking about the stories told in and by museums, and the relationships which make up museums; and suggest new ways of undertaking and understanding museum biographies.

Issue: ci.2002.28.issue-4<br>
Date: 06 2002<br>
Author(s): Vidal Fernando<br>
Abstract: The constructionist Foucauldian orientation poses a challenge opposite to that of the philosophical. Philosophers’ narratives focus on the concept of self or on discourses from which the concept can supposedly be inferred. Historians, in contrast, tend to overlook the concept, as if its history qua concept played no role in instituting the regimes of the self. Although I do not assume an underlying perennial self, what I have done here is obviously closer to the history of ideas than to genealogy. Nevertheless, I want to suggest that concepts have their own efficacy and should be incorporated into genealogy as active agents. In the same way that, say, child‐rearing techniques are not
         aboutthe self nor applied to it as a preexisting object, debates about the resurrection of the body were notaboutidentity, nor were the issues discussed in connection with them contemplated as puzzle cases in the philosophy of mind. Rather, they were among the materials with which notions of identity were elaborated and through which, historically, such notions came into existence. This became apparent in the wake of Locke’sEssay Concerning Human Understanding,when the resurrection of the body was explicitly linked to personal identity. The “modern” regimes of self, and the corresponding ways of experiencing oneself, were thus connected to the development of new concepts of the self. The redefinition of the resurrected identity belonged in the construction of new models of being based less on the hierarchical subordination of the body to the soul than on a generative subordination of selfhood to the brain and to an objectified self‐consciousness. The glorious body was no longer necessary as ideal for the discipline of terrestrial bodies.134The story sketched here thus suggests the need for bringing the history of ideas and the genealogy of subjectification together into an approach that will ultimately do for personal identity what historical epistemology is doing for the histo~<br>

Abstract: They did not worry that their group somehow represented something beyond the immediate interaction, or that one person’s behavior could reflect badly on other group members.

Behind the scenes, Jody talked to another member about her black son‐in‐law, saying, “It’s a shame he can’t come. … It’s too bad it’s like that. It shouldn’t be like that.” But it was like that, and since her son‐in‐law was not very eager to attend anyway, she did not think of it as a good thing to object to the jokes
               in the group. In a group of the sort Alexander and Smith imagine, members feel mutually responsible for upholding institutional decorum, objecting to objectionable jokes, for instance.

Abstract: 1. Is paradigm the right choice, and have I used it correctly?There is always a risk in adopting a concept that comes from a different tradition. It is even riskier when we fiddle with it and stretch it to fit a set of data for which it was not designed as I have done. But I believe that the risk is warranted for two reasons. The first is that there is considerable confusion within and outside of anthropology regarding the nature of the anthropological study of language. The oscillation mentioned in the article among a number of labels, including linguistic anthropology, anthropological linguistics, sociolinguistics, and ethnolinguistics, is only the most superficial and yet telling example of the widespread lack of clarity as to what constitutes linguistic research from an anthropological perspective. Further evidence of confusion can be inferred from the typically partial and often clumsy attempts to represent the linguistic subfield (or the study of language) in sociocultural anthropology textbooks. I felt that it was time to come to terms with the fact that perhaps those of us inside the subfield had not been communicating to those outside as effectively as we thought we were. I then realized that to address this issue I needed a notion that by its very nature would force us to think in terms of broad trends rather than particular notions or hypotheses. The popular notions of paradigm and paradigm shift seemed to me the perfect candidates; they could force us to think in terms of the major features of our research projects. CookGumperz and Gumperz are right when they write that Kuhns approach gives a sense of structural containment to the flow of ideas that to those living with them appear much more fluid and overlapping. (Their proposal to adopt Holtons themata is a bit cryptic given that his model is not considered an improvement on Kuhns by most historians of science.) But my whole point was to find a way to go beyond our own experiential closeness to intelle~<br>

Abstract: We have thus followed a strange movement, a sort of coming and going between perceiving subjects and perceived objects, a zoom effect like that of a camera trying to set the right distance with its object in order to achieve a maximum degree of clarity—total transparency. On the one hand, we have seen how the tricky adjustment between the multiplicity of stabilized representations of Hawking and my face‐to‐face interaction with him has fragmented his identity. Like an impressionist painting, distance allows us to see what proximity causes us to lose. The layering of the multiplicity of narratives about Hawking reveals the stable identity of an individual that face‐to‐face contact does not allow. The closer we get to the object‐subject, the further we move from it. We no longer know who or where he is. All the categories we normally use in thinking about a person, a body, a machine, a mind, an interaction, a conversation, a text, and speech are blurred. In his presence, Hawking seems even more difficult to seize than we had imagined. The reason is, first, because, as we have shown, the depth of the social body (the one that talks of the other as much as of itself and allows the accumulation of self‐definitions), normally visible but unnoticed in any interaction, is absent in his case. Second, the internal functioning of the flesh‐and‐blood body, normally invisible, becomes visible and distributed here (the
      Iandlegsare mixed in the same discourse and are detached from the body; they are before him while his voice is next to him, and the flesh‐and‐blood body is collectively taken care of) and omnipresent (it appears at different moments during the interaction). Third, the machine, by the coordination of the actions it allows, disturbs the interaction as much as it creates it. This is where the confusion and fragmentation of identity is pursued by recomposition. Here we follow, step by step, how the machine to which this silent body is attached makes the component~<br>

Abstract: Juillerat has an extended view of the Oedipus complex, one that includes the tales/complexes of Laius and Jocasta. His understanding of the complex incorporates at least two not altogether compatible approaches. On the one hand, following Paul Ricoeur, the complex is a
      seuilor threshold, a structured moment that opens up a set of possibilities. Methodologically one decomposes the range of possibilities that are given expression in the cultural products of the unconscious (p. 72)myths, rituals, and dreamsin order to discover the minimal structure from which they can be derived. That which is universal is not such and such a particular form of the Oedipus [complex], but rather that which is common in all the possible figures of the Oedipus combinatory, the varied cultural expressions of which must be able to be reduced to a model that contains them all (p. 69). Like all quest arguments, Juillerats is circular: that for which he searches is predetermined by the object of his questthe Oedipus complexand by the range and definition of material that quest presupposes. What is more interesting, as Juillerat acknowledges at times, is the transformational capacity of the minimal structurethe thresholdas it is given varied cultural expression.<br>

Abstract: Hanoverian Dissent was not a coherent and autonomous entity, moving through time like an object through space. Dissenting identity, like any group identity, was always insecure, haunted by its own fragility, threatened by historical and generational change, endlessly remaking boundaries and reaffirming continuities. The vast majority of its scattered and temporary congregations were formed in the 1660s and 1670s in the brutal aftermath of the Stuart restoration. Dissent remained in the early eighteenth century a complex and disconnected set of groups and congregations with histories as diverse as their theological tenets—Presbyterians, Independents, Baptists, Quakers, as well as very many congregations who rejected a denominational title of any kind. It was the policies of Charles II’s government in the 1660s that initiated, out of a confusing collection of religious groups, some common identity—nonconformist or Dissenter. It was, of course, a negative identity. A Dissenter, by his or her refusal to conform to the church of England under the rigorous terms of the Act of Uniformity, was, by definition, an enemy of church and state. This was a political device, Rapin the early eighteenth‐century historian argued, whereby the large and powerful body of Presbyterians could be excluded from the Restoration state and penalized by associating them with smaller, plebian, and sometimes disorderly sects. “This name of nonconformists, is therefore to be considered as a very ambiguous term, which indeed signifies men who conform not to the church of England, but not in the sense which was given it, namely of a body of men inseparably united, composed of all the dissenters, and acting with the same views, and for the same interest.”

Abstract: Philosophy must know, and thus also not cease to will to know, the one who knows, at the risk of degrading the one who knows (himself) to the status of what he knows. Theology in the strict sense recognizes its object—in fact, a formal nonobject—as revelation. It thus accepts, or rather claims as its highest epistemological necessity, to treat of the incomprehensibility of God, such as it results directly from his infinity and, above all, from his holiness.<br>

Abstract: Paule Braudel, “Un témoignage,” p. 244: “Comme je critiquais un jour ce gaspillage de temps et de force, il m’a réprondu en riant qu’il ne pouvait fair autrement. ‘Mais, a‐t‐il dit, c’est toi qui m’as parlé, chaque jour le même portrait du même modèle. Tu m’as dit que chaque jour il jetait régulièrement son dessin à la corbeille, jusqu’au moment où il avait trouvé enfin la ligne qui lui plaisait. Eh bien, après tout, c’est un peu ce que je fais!’” Braudel as painter, however, had a special relationship between the “object” and the “background,” as he states in Braudel, “The Situation of History in 1950” (n. 73 above), p. 9, “The problem of history is not to be found in the relationship between painter and painting, nor even, though some have thought such a suggestion excessively daring, in the relationship between the painting and the landscape. The problem is right in the landscape, in the heart of life itself.”<br>

Abstract: If I must pause here, at the threshold of a subject that would appear to be of less than universal current interest—composition pedagogy—it is in the recognition that the subject of composition, how to compose one’s thoughts and words, was the greater part of education from antiquity to the nineteenth century. What we call expository writing, the one‐ or two‐course sequence that our university students are everywhere compelled to take, is only an echo of this immemorial “method of tradition.” The failure to reduce writing to method in our modern post‐Ramistic sense, to a quasi‐science of transmission, is related to the larger failure, perhaps the necessary failure, of modern educational theory to bring communication within the system of the disciplines, as both object of knowledge and means of transmitting knowledge. In this postrhetorical condition, information technologies proliferate with familiar paradoxical effects, such as the degradation in the communicative efficacy of writing lamented by Tufte and Lanham. Without falling back upon a narrative of decline, which would in any case concede a failure of historical understanding, I conclude on the threshold of a second question, much larger than that of composition pedagogy in the contemporary university. On this threshold, I envision, or call for (in the spirit of my epigraph from Bacon) an inquiry into the question of why writing has remained the indispensable “art of transmission” in the era of technologically mediated information.

Abstract: We saw above how Ricoeur argues that meaning is an achievement of the interpretive process; he also argues that a text is an achievement of the narrative operations described above [
         14]. In describing a text as an achievement, certain characteristics of the text become clearer, characteristics that are not so apparent when we are confined to a narrow definition that a text is a written document standing alone as a product (or object) that is cut off both from the relationship to its production and from the mode of its use. Rather than treat a text entirely as an object, Ricoeur emphasizes that what is present is a dialectic of objectification and understanding that is first understood at the level of the text.<br>

Abstract: The seeming equivalence of the analogy and the horizontal seriality suggested by the commas often used by gender theorists to include concerns of race and class in routinely used phrases such as “race, class, and gender” belie a hierarchy of ontologies that privilege whiteness. When the (universalist) theorist of gender or sexuality argues that modalities of race function similarly, the theorist’s primary object of analysis is not simply gender or sexuality but white gender and white sexuality, particularly when gender and sexuality are not marked as such. For, as Langston Hughes long ago recognized, and as theorists of whiteness have more recently explained, whiteness has the privilege of being unmarked and simply understood as the norm (
         1926, 692) or, as Betsy Nies suggests, as “the absent signifier” (2002, xv).5The theorist studying gender or sexuality and, after a comma, race, simply repeats white privilege by assuming that whiteness need not be named and usesraceto refer to people of color. At this point I wish to make the following assertion based on an analysis of Rubin but by no means limited to her text alone: racial analogy in white feminist/gender/sexuality studies functions as a colonial fetish that enables the (white) theorist to displace the potentially disruptive contradictions of racial difference onto a safer and more palatable notion of similarity, thus offering theory that can be easily assimilated within the politics of liberal multiculturalism.6<br>

Article Title: Interreligious Dialogue as a Politics of Recognition: A Postcolonial Rereading of Hegel for Interreligious Solidarity<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: jr.2005.85.issue-4<br>
Date: 10 2005<br>
Author(s): Lee Hyo‐Dong<br>
Abstract: It appears, then, that, in addition to mutual recognition of free participatory agency as its necessary precondition, a solidary interreligious relationship within the postcolonial‐neocolonial context also requires mutual recognition of identity or worth. The damage to self‐esteem inflicted upon a community and its members and the consequent festering of resentment in the wake of a recognition of worth withheld could be destructive to any efforts made to establish the conditions of coexistence and solidary action necessary for creating a peaceable polity—however loosely it may be meant—in opposition to the violence of today’s global order. Nevertheless, in spite of its historical‐contextual justification and exigency, there is something self‐contradictory about the notion of recognition on demand, that is, recognition given to certain values and practices solely on account of their uniqueness and difference. Recognition, as re‐cognition, implies the seeing, remembering, and rediscovering of oneself in another and therefore involves by definition some assessment and evaluation of another from one’s existing perspective and criteria, for both individuals and communities. Charles Taylor’s pioneering essay on the politics of recognition shows how a suppression of this fact actually results in nonrecognition. If one's recognition of another is produced purely by the force of will following a sense of moral imperative to respect difference as such, it is patronizing if not downright condescending: I do not know why or on what grounds I should recognize you, but I will grant you recognition anyway because you need it.
         28Furthermore, as long as one cannot do away with one’s perspective and criteria of evaluation, such a patronizing recognition degenerates into hypocrisy in case the object of recognition does not meet the criteria: “I know deep down in my heart that you do not really deserve it, but …” Indeed the specter of recognition in bad faith returns here with~<br>

Abstract: But how does the shroud‐relics reflection operate? What does it mean to participate in a divine mirroring? Tesauro again offers an intrinsically rhetorical interpretation of some tenets of Renaissance hermetic thought.
      110He reminds us that the inner qualities of a given “agent” (agente) become apparent when it is connected to its “symbol” (simbolo).111As agent, the relics speak forth the beneficial qualities of the shroud. The shroud, we could say, is here a noun, whereas St. Maurice’s body is its actualization. In other words, the name “shroud” means the relics of the martyr Maurice, and conversely the martyr’s relics are symbolized in the shroud. “Shroud” is the proper name of the relics. The link between an “agent” or object and its name or “symbol” can be in fact seen as a movement from potentiality (in potenza) to actuality (in atto).112To explain this crucial point, Tesauro reminds us that Paul, “already destined to martyrdom,” believed that he carried the “stigmata” of the Lord in his body.113<br>

Abstract: To follow up on Koselleck, the centerpiece of the memory process is not the material object. The structure of King Mausolus at Halicarnassus has perished but its name has not, and many of us carry memories of its imagined reconstructed appearance from art and history textbooks. Examples can be added ad infinitum, but the objection rests not only on analogies. In contemporary work on memory, significant attention is also paid to the role of imagery. Until about a century ago, the dogma was that “memory is a present image within which one must discern pastness and valid indications of the past.” Philosophers like Wittgenstein, Ryle, and J. L. Austin demonstrated, however, that remembering has little to do with imagery: “The recall may leave us with images; images of the past need not have provided the recall.”

Abstract: The Ricoeurian hermeneutical circle requires further modification, however, if it is to answer to the full challenge of childism. This modification reflects my own and others’ sympathetic revisions of Ricoeurian hermeneutics in a more postmodern direction. Childhood raises to an especially sharp degree the problem of what Emmanuel Levinas, Jacques Derrida, John Caputo, Sallie McFague, and Richard Kearney have called the interpretation of “otherness” or “difference.” In my view it is possible, indeed necessary, to recognize otherness without (as some have claimed) abandoning the notion of a hermeneutical circle. “Otherness” does not mean “othering”: the marginalization of those who are different. Rather, it refers to the sense in which each singular human being is ultimately irreducible to any understanding, narration, or construction of them whatsoever. Levinas claims that no other is fully reducible to anything “said” about them but is always also its own transcending or infinite “saying” beyond language and meaning (indeed, as a “face” of the Wholly Other).
         34Or as others have argued, a little differently, each “other” person continually escapes interpretation as a linguistic object by virtue of their utter and mysteriousdifférance(their difference as endlessly deferred).<br>

Abstract: Other recognition theories, in particular those of Hegel and his followers, have explored important insights regarding the integration of recognition into knowledge. If these insights are right, grasping an object with a concept would engage one’s thoughts in a self‐recognition project that is arguably in line with the “lived experiences” referred to by Ricoeur. The section dealing with the “ruins of representation” misses the opportunity to show how to reconstruct knowledge claims on these ruins. On the one hand, one could argue that a theory of knowledge would simply be sided with a compatible theory of recognition. On the other hand, neo‐Hegelians, such as Robert B. Brandom, would press for profound changes in the way that theories of knowledge are to be understood. It is left to the reader to locate the hermeneutical analysis of Ricoeur in this debate.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: ci.2007.33.issue-2<br>
Date: 01 2007<br>
Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: The Christian version of the care of the soul plumbs into the soul deeper than Platonism because this responsibility—which originates in the gaze of an unfathomable other—precedes the subject/object relation that informs the classical version of the responsible self. Derrida writes: “The dissymmetry of the gaze, this disproportion that relates me, and whatever concerns me, to a gaze that I don’t see and that remains secret from me although it commands me, is, according to Patočka, what promises itself [
      s’annonce] in Christian mystery as the frightening, terrifying mystery, themysterium tremendum. Such a terror has no place in the transcendent experience that relates Platonic responsibility to theagathon. Nor does it have any place in the politics that is so instituted. But the terror of this secret exceeds and precedes the complacent relation of a subject to an object” (GD,pp. 27–28; trans. mod.). Yet such a radical way of conceiving responsibility is only announced or is only promised by Christianity. Christianity as a whole cannot be identified with this understanding of responsibility because its persistent Platonism has prevented it from thinking through this deepened conception. What is thus announced by Christianity is perhaps no longer anything Christian unless it is Christian in a hyperbolic sense.15In any case, Christianity remains the privileged locus in which the depths of responsibility can best be plumbed.<br>

Abstract: Joseph Smith, as quoted by Lorenzo Brown in “Sayings of Joseph, by Those Who Heard Him at Different Times,” Joseph Smith Jr. Papers, Church Archives, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter‐day Saints, Salt Lake City, UT. Brown’s statement is based on his recollection in 1880 of a conversation that occurred in 1832. For questions concerning the reliability of this account, see Matthews,
            Plainer Translation, 25–26, n. 12. Referred to in Exod. 28:30 and Lev. 8:8 as an object placed in “the breastplate of judgment,”urimandthummimare the transliterations of the Hebrew words for “light” and “perfection.” For the only major study of the subject since 1824, see Cornelis Van Dam,The Urim and Thummim: A Means of Revelation in Ancient Israel(Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 1997). Van Dam (Urim and Thummim, 232) rejects the traditional view that the urim and thummim was a type of lot oracle and argues that it was a single gem, “a miraculous authenticating light,” that shone to verify divine revelation to the high priest. Joseph Smith described his apparatus as “two transparent stones set in the rim of a [silver] bow fastened to a breast plate” that came into his possession with the golden plates for the purpose of translating the Book of Mormon; seeTimes and Seasons3, no. 9 (1842): 707. See alsoEncyclopedia of Mormonism, s.v. “Urim and Thummim” (by Paul Y. Hoskisson). For a discussion of the role of divining instruments in Smith’s production of the Book of Mormon, see D. Michael Quinn,Mormonism and the Magic World View(Salt Lake City, UT: Signature Books, 1998), 169–75. Later, Smith would say that, as he became more experienced at the process of translating, he no longer needed mechanical aids; see Matthews,Plainer Translation, 25, 40.<br>

         Adaptation and Appropriation(2006), in the Routledge Critical Idiom series. Opening her final paragraph with the claim that “We need then to restore to the subgenres or practices of adaptation and appropriation a genuinely celebratory comprehension of their capacity for creativity, and for comment and critique,” she concludes: “Adaptation and appropriation … are all about multiple interactions and a matrix of possibilities. They are, endlessly and wonderfully, about seeing things come back to us in as many forms as possible” (Sanders2006, 160). This is the rhetoric of hedonistic liberalism, celebrating multiplicity and pluralism for its own sake, for the choices it allows; it is Fredric Jameson’s postmodernity whose “relationship to the past is that of a consumer adding another rare object to the collection, or another flavour to the international banquet” (1998, 129). Typically, there is no word about the future re‐vision might help to envision, no sense of “memory as a means to liberation” (Greene1991b, 291), of the interlocking of memory and the feminist project, of looking back in order to move forward. On the left, concerns about the disappearance of the future and capitalism’s increasing monopoly on it are growing, as are laments about the loss of a sense of historical time as a teleology moving away from a past from which we could learn and into a future that would be different (see Gumbrecht2004, 120; see also Jameson2005). There are those who are bitter about it, complaining, as does Terry Eagleton inAfter Theory(2003), that “Over the dreary decades of post‐1970s conservatism, the historical sense had grown increasingly blunted, as it suited those in power that we should be able to imagine no alternative to the present” (Eagleton2003, 6–7). Yet few of us have been willing to acknowledge that if today, “the past is selling better than th~<br>

Abstract: Similarly, Chaim Zins [
            31] sets forth a multistage philosophical exploration of the epistemological foundations of knowledge organization and their implications for classification schemes and knowledge maps. The focus of his paper is to differentiate between the definition of knowledge as a thought and the definition of knowledge as an object and to explore their relationship within classifications of knowledge in practice. Within this analysis, ideas of truth are considered only as they relate to the understanding of objective knowledge and as one of the concepts, along with such things as “content,” “validity,” and “verification,” that bring meaning to knowledge. In this work, as well as in others that investigate knowledge organization and classification schemes, concepts of truth are only mentioned in passing and do not rest at the center of overall discussions of classification systems as theory‐in‐practice [32].<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: This is no bypass of typical Dickensian characterization but a recognizable path through it. What we have entered upon here—a much-frequented terrain in Victorian criticism—is the Dickensian prehistory of psychoanalysis. In her study of melancholia, Julia Kristeva deliberately casts the assumptions of “classic psychoanalytic theory (Abraham, Freud, and Melanie Klein)” into the voice of the aggrieved subject who must incorporate rather than relinquish a lost object that is ultimately resented for its absence. The headlong associational logic runs like this: “Because I love it, and in order not to lose it, I imbed it in myself; but because I hate it, that other within myself is a bad self, I am bad, I am non-existent, I shall kill myself.”
         24The specter of male nonexistence in the case of Dickens's “Nobody” derives in part from the fact that the other within cannot ever be mourned. This is because, like the all-but-explicit suicidal drift of Clennam's consciousness itself, it is only partially recognized and then mostly in metaphors and slips of phrase. Arthur doesn't really think of drowning himself, even as he yearns for the river's oblivion. Nor can he let go of another life either, let alone his own, if it has never really been his to surrender. The absent mother cannot possibly be mourned, that is, because such a loss is already imbedded: incorporatedas an absence. Even if Amy relents and he is finally wised up in years to come (after Mrs. Clennam's death, as the exposed woman herself proposes to Amy), still Arthur's self-predication might well remain entrammeled in the reversible snares of melancholia: even without killing myself, I am nonexistent, I am in essence a maternal descendent of nobody rather than a chosen lover of anyone, I am the mother I never (knew I) had.<br>

Abstract: The mourning strategies adopted respectively by Augustine and Marcel suggest that the death of the beloved may teach us how to disrupt the foundation of self‐reflexivity upon which, as we saw with regard to the split selves of Augustine and Marcel, we tend to erect our own identity. In
         Memory, History, Forgetting, Ricoeur advocates a mourning strategy equivalent with a similar goal. At first, he says, the death of the beloved brings about “a genuine amputation of oneself.” But then the experience of mourning entails “internalization,” a new level of personal identification for both the love object, lost to death, and our own self as a subject predicated on affections that now manifest themselves in absentia. This new self‐identification, in turn, trains us in the “anticipation” of our own futural self as predicated on the “plurality” that death will one day bestow on us in the memory of our dear ones.67This is the equivalent of the compassionate reciprocity with the subject of one’s grief that, as mentioned in my opening remarks, justifies the state of mourning, or, in Nussbaum’s words, makes compassion “comprehensible.”68<br>

Fearing loss, it seeks to secure against loss by removing or dominating others so as to eliminate the threat they represent. … It sets one person against another; and the only answer to it is another love, or rather love for another object that is not vulnerable to loss.” See Babcock, “Cupiditas and Caritas,” 47.<br>

Abstract: However, a revision is needed for our global times. It is not life qua life that is the norm, the good, for responsible existence. That conception would merely replace one centrism for another: biocentrism for anthropocentrism or theocentrism. It is, rather, the integration of many dimensions of life, the integrity of life, which must orient individuals and social action in our global times. This idea—the integrity of life—is a complex one. Within the work of theological ethics it enables critical reflection across an array of domains of existence and the goods proposed or entailed. It also provides orientation for responsible action. That is to say, the idea of the “integrity of life” articulates a multidimensional conception of the good but also a norm or measure for responsible actions and relations.
         39Responsible existence is a life of integrity formed, personally and socially, through an enduring dedication to the integrity of life. The integrity of life provides the norms for humanizing religion in the full sense of the idea. It moves beyond a merely humanistic or theistic conceptuality or even the deconstruction of that dyad in order to articulate a good that resonates with religious and moral depths in the remembrance of death and the love of life. Keeping our attention on humanizing religion is thus meant to save us from a reduction in a conception of the moral good, to insist on the complexity of goodness. From diverse strands of our cultural legacy—Hellenistic, biblical, modern—there arise the resources to render productive, rather than destructive, the tension between the limit of death and the love of life, a sense of responsibility and the proper object of responsible action, the integrity of life.<br>

Author(s): Zimmerman Virginia<br>
Abstract: This interesting work presents fragments and traces from geological and archaeological practices in nineteenth-century Britain and considers their connections with and influence on Victorian literature.
      Excavating Victoriansis not exactly history of science but, rather, a work of literary criticism that draws very heavily on the history of science. Virginia Zimmerman underscores the disjunction between scientific and literary writing as an artifact of our view from the twenty-first century, drawing on Gillian Beer'sDarwin's Plots(Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1983) for useful context and analysis. She identifies the writings of Charles Lyell and Charles Dickens, along with those of their contemporaries, as part of a single body of literature, written in response to the newly discovered vastness of time and to emphasize the authority of the individual to interpret (and thus reclaim) the past. Zimmerman uses the notion of the “trace,” as defined by Paul Ricoeur, to indicate “an object's origin in the past but also its duration into the present” (p. 8); the strategies the Victorians used to cope with this confused temporality is the major resonating theme, along with the continual conjunction of construction and destruction. This juxtaposition of preservation and decay is emphasized throughout: in geology, with the fossil remains of long-extinct species; in archaeology, with the action of Vesuvius that at once destroyed Pompeii and forever preserved its remains (which would otherwise have been lost); and in Victorian London, with the continual building projects that uncovered the traces of Roman occupation.<br>

Abstract: The film object exists differently, or not at all, when kidnapped by consumers and sequestered on their computer desktops. Not only do individuals watch films on PCs at their leisure (stopping and starting at will, sampling chapters, and so on), they watch them on one window among several that may be running simultaneously (including those that hold email messages, the IMDb entry on the film, notes, a blog, and the current weather). Cinema constitutes just one kind of software content available to the powerful Windows operating system and the all‐encompassing PC hardware. Called up on demand or via YouTube, a movie appears on a flat panel, where many windows are displayed—as many as the user chooses, then shuffles, moving them around like cards in a game of solitaire.
         Monitoranddisplayseem more apt terms thanscreento designate the visual experience that computers deliver. The computer monitor of the twenty‐first century, just like thecinématographeof the nineteenth, presents the viewer with the present, with immediate attractions, no matter what is on display.

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>

Date: 10 2009<br>
Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: Coleridge was deeply influenced by Kant’s approach to Christianity as a fundamentally moral rather than theoretical entity. Yet, equally, Coleridge reacted against much in Kant’s theology.
         31Chief among his objections in this context is the way that Kant makes God little more than a reflex of the moral law. InReligion within the Limits of Reason Alone, Kant had argued that “the doctrine of virtue … subsists of itself (even without the concept of God)” and that “when reverence for God is put first, with virtue therefore subordinated to it, this object … becomes anidol.”32In his desire to assert this priority and to disassociate religion from cultic observance and ceremony, Kant hollowed out much of religious practice. Included in his purification of religious concepts is prayer, which figures a valid moral intention (the so‐called pure spirit of prayer) but is improper in purporting to address God: “In the heart‐felt wish which is the spirit of prayer, man seeks but to work upon himself. … A prayer can be offered with perfect sincerity even though the man praying does not presume to be able to affirm that the existence of God is wholly certain. … Asan address, he supposes this Supreme Being to be present in person … hence such complete sincerity cannot be found in the latter.”33At best, prayer can function as a propaedeutic, quickening our desire to fulfill the moral law, with the aim that “the letter of it … [will] finally fall away.”34At worst, it appears as the solitary indulgence in a fiction, as when Kant imagines a praying man “whom some one else takes unawares. … Everyone will … without my saying so, expect a man thus surprised to fall into confusion or embarrassment … because a man caught talking aloud to himself is suspected of having a slight attack of madness.”35Prayer is thus relegated to an improper margin, both philosophically and indeed textually, existing within a supplementary “General Observation” covering prayer, churchgoing, baptism, and ~<br>

Date: 6 2010<br>
Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: Despite these oppositions, secularization and resacralization should be regarded as complementary phenomena that arose in response to the problem of a radically transcendent, hidden God. The studies under review, then, are of crucial importance, but their full significance requires a supplementary analysis. Novel conceptions of society, the nation, Scripture, and personhood followed from an intensification of divine transcendence, and, at the same time, necessitated a reworking of the immanent relations between worldly persons, institutions, and things. It was not merely that secularization, now understood by Bell and others as the translation of divine authority into a worldly register, entailed that the latter incorporate the properties and prerogatives once reserved for God alone. Enlightenment-era efforts to resacralize the self as an object of a totalizing force—situated either in the mystic divine or in a purely immanent, materialist conception of nature—suggest another dynamic at work: the closing of the chasm between the divine and terrestrial spheres and the identification of one with the other. Even if human effort was increasingly regarded as the source of one's understanding of the world, the humans undertaking this work had become newly alien to themselves, and in a manner that recalled the radical distance of the divine.<br>

Abstract: Catherine Bell, Valerio Valeri, James Fernandez, Roy Rappaport, and Stanley Tambiah are just a handful of established theorists who have promoted the idea that the performances we call “rituals” have as their final effect a form of communication. For Stanley Tambiah, ritual performances communicate certain paradigms of behavior that are recognized by an audience at an iconic level. As Tambiah sees it, pattern recognition is the very foundation of ritual communication, and the patterns that rituals communicate may be understood as “iconic analogues” of primordial acts. By “iconic analogue,” Tambiah appears to rely on American philosopher Charles Peirce: an icon is a sign bearing a relationship to an object in the way that a map bears a relationship to a territory. The territory is fuller than the map, but one can understand the map as lifted, as it were, from the territory but referring back to it and indeed invoking it
         pars pro toto. Some ritual performances, then, lift a kind of iconic analogue from actions conceived as occurring primordially, invoking thempars pro toto.2<br>

Abstract: Literature for Blanchot is defined by its being a nonplace, a site of erring. It acts by mimicking activity and in this doubling it creates a space of instability where valences are multiplied; nothing is as it seems. For even in its gesture back toward the original object, in its turning, which is effected through the multiplication of images and the animation of language's materiality, what is achieved is not greater clarity or another form of possession—the rendering of presence—but rather an instability that creates ambiguity at every level such that one does not know when language is expressing or representing. “If it is a thing or means that thing . . . obscure because it says too much, opaque because it says nothing” (“L,” p. 329; “LRD,” pp. 341–42).<br>

Issue: 653501<br>
Date: 08 2010<br>
Author(s): Schildgen Brenda Deen<br>
Abstract: Here, once again we find a collection of verbs in the present, some both reflexives and neologisms, which simultaneously render eternal action and linguistic impossibility (because of the neologisms) while eliding the difference between the actor and action: “s'infiora” (enflower themselves), a neologism; “si ritorna” (return themselves); “s'insapora” (ensavors itself), a second neologism; “s'addorna” (adorns itself); “risaliva” (re-ascends), and “soggiorna” (abides). With the reflexives and the present tense, Dante emphasizes the perpetual movement of angels as they sing God's praises; with the linguistic play of the neologisms he conveys the impossibility of actually describing them; and by likening them to their analogy in the created world, bees, he also heightens our awareness that in the actions of bees we can see something of the divine realm in our world of nature. This focus on the detail of creaturely action, through the verbs and this observable natural environment, once more overcomes the separation between the transcendent and the immanent, sign and signified, vehicle and referent, with the analogy hinting that alterity can become sameness or, as Badiou puts it, poetry's melding with philosophy allows it to bond object and subject and to overcome the rupture between what would otherwise be two modes of discourse.

Abstract: If it proves to be the case that all human linguistic action has to pass through this narrow gate of the enduring attention of the present of the present, it seems hardly possible to render this vertical process in terms of narrative or, for that matter, extensive thought. Unsurprisingly, efforts have been made to soften Augustine's stance, for instance, by disentangling the
      distentio animifrom the narrowness of the presence of the present and lending it an independent status. Thus Roland Teske believes he has solved the paradox of an extensionless present by introducing an extension beyond the present attention: “Augustine, it seems to me, implies that our present awareness must be extended or distended beyond the instantaneous present as a condition of our perceiving a temporal whole.”
            It is hard to see, however, how this statement can be reconciled with Augustine's view that the present attention or awareness “passes in a point.” Things look even more dramatic if one inquires into the possibility of telling a story under the aegis of this lasting attention that represents an eternal presence that does not let go. What, for instance, is left of desire if it is no longer allowed to stretch and reach out to—or turn away from—its object but is reduced to givenness throughout?9<br>

Article Title: Why Devils Came When Faustus Called Them<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 660269<br>
Date: 08 2011<br>
Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: Faustus depends on fantasies of embodiment because he imagines no being, no self, grounded in the soul at all, neither in the future of salvation nor even in the present, where the identity of the man “Faustus” might seem to emerge from some invisible core within. For Faustus, there is simply nothing there: when Faustus refers to himself in the third person, for example (“I charge thee wait upon me whilst I live, / To do what ever Faustus shall command” [1.3.37–38]), or when he addresses himself with his name (“why Faustus, hast thou not attained that end?” [1.1.18]), it often seems as if he were swerving away from speaking from the phantasmic inward plenitude of an “I,” or as if he needed to imagine himself as a bounded object, seen from the outside in his mind's eye, in order to articulate himself (and thus could make himself present only by naming himself “Faustus”).
      29Faustus must name himself, conceive of himself from the outside, as it were, because he never identifies with his soul.30Faustus finds his soul to be alien to him, so much so that he feels it to be a burden he would be happy to be rid of (“why wert thou not a creature wanting soul?” he cries out desperately at one point [5.2.105]). There is some theological justification for Faustus's dissociation. Perkins, for instance, argues that “God is the life of the soul” just as “the soul is the life of the body.”31With God residing inwardly as his immortal, animating essence, Faustus views his soul only as an absent, impalpable other to which he knows he is responsible but about which he feels that it is “not Faustus.” Subject to this vertiginous alienation from his soul, Faustus takes salvation to be a fate that entails the very annihilation of his identity, an annihilation more complete and terrifying to him than that imposed by earthly death itself.<br>

Abstract: Although this account is promising, I see three problems or issues needing clarification in it. First, while insisting that their function is not cognitive, Larmore describes such avowals as “an exercise of practical reflection” (128). This suggests that it is by a kind of thought that someone deliberately commits herself or takes “responsibility for what she is doing” (63). It would be clearer to say that this is a process of will that sets new final ends or shores up motivation to follow intentions already formed. Luther may have performed an act of practical reflection in “expressing his resolution to pursue the path on which he had set out” (63), but the resolution in which he took his stand and set his personal policies was not itself constituted by the reflective expression of them. Larmore’s account misses what I have called the “projective motivation” function of willing that Ricoeur at least implicitly recognizes. He does such a good job of arguing that the constitutive self-relation is not a “cognitive” or knowledge-aimed relationship (131) that he does not draw key distinctions between different practical or “performative” operations of mind (134). However, perhaps the problem is simply that Larmore’s terminology reflects his aversion to any “acts of will” distinct from beliefs and desires, as we saw above. For, in arguing that the object of practical reflecting is “in no way cognitive,” he briefly distinguishes it from
      practical reasoningin which we “conclude that certain actions are obligatory, permissible, or prudent” (70). While practical reasoning is cognitive and aims at objective correctness in judgment, practical reflection instead aims at “an explicit intention to do this or that” (71)—which sounds like Aristotle’s concept ofprohairesis(usually translated as rational “choice”). Why not then recognize that such an intention-forming process normally mediates between belief-desire sets and the intentions that express them?<br>

Abstract: As is often the case, when a scholar who is trained as a descriptivist (in disciplines such as history, sociology, and ethnography) attempts to take on theoretical issues they become theoretically parochial. They understand what works for their predefined area of expertise. However, theory takes place in constituting the domains for research, prior to the act of description, not in the applying individual concepts to preexistent object-domains. As Paul Ricoeur put it, “to delimit a domain of application is a hermeneutical act,” an act “that calls for reflection in terms of a general theory of interpretation” (
      Figuring the Sacred[Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress Press, 1995] 304). This kind of reflection, in my view as a scholar trained in theory, is completely lacking in Vásquez’s choice of criterion, despite his long sections of exegesis of theoretical texts. Rigorous exegesis is not the same thing as rigorous theoretical thinking. Rather, in Vásquez’s choices we find a predetermined view in search of a theory. The book becomes a justification of his choices, not a critical, reflexive, hermeneutical act. Theory happens before the explication of theory begins, and awareness of this fact is absent from this text.<br>

Abstract: Forms of
         ṭumʾahwhich fit the broad characterization of being “unclean” are the least severe, requiring only that the person or object be distanced from the sacred realm. The governing factor here is the need to be pure when approaching God.
               This basic attitude towards approaching the divine realm is probably universal and finds vivid expression in the Mesopotamian concern not to approach the gods with even bad breath.93

Abstract: Peter van der Veer engages the issue of how to approach morality and whether there is a distinctively new anthropological approach. Noting that there are moral universals but that they are applied in distinctively different ways across cultures, he offers India as an instance of moral relativism related to a hierarchical social system. Although I am uncertain that the hierarchical values of obligation, status, innate constitution, and disposition are not themselves moral, I agree with his argument for connecting political economy and moral economy, for this is the surest way to highlight the omnipresence of moral ambiguity, ambivalence, argument, and appraisal, as well as the situatedness of moral action in social life. However, when van der Veer asserts that there is not a new field of study emerging around morality, it is unclear whether he means that the cluster of approaches I outline do not constitute a coherent set of interests or that they should not. Certainly the approach I refer to as “local moral worlds” somewhat predates the others, but in general these authors appear to
         thinkthey are establishing a field rather than just addressing a topic. Personally, I am not a proponent of any of them but am pointing out something I think is necessary if there were to be a coherent approach. I also agree that we should not take recourse to evil as a metaphysical object, which is precisely why I elaborate it as an existential category instead. Recognizing this would allow van der Veer to remove the scare quotes from “evil” in his final sentences. When the neighbors next to whom one must live after the violence are part of the evil, the need to hold one’s tongue is not a problem of silenceinsteadof evil. An alternative to the proverb cited by van der Veer might be the statement of Martin Luther King: “I was not afraid of the words of the violent, but of the silence of the honest.”<br>

Article Title: Historicizing Religion: Varro’s<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 674410<br>
Date: 02 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Rüpke Jörg<br>
Abstract: Varro was even more radical.
         Religiois defined not as a tradition, but as an institution, aninstitutum, something “set up” by humans. Surely, Romans had known about earlier religious traditions before, had had memories of temples being set up, games being dedicated and continued. Thus, Roman religion could accommodate a lot of Roman history. Varro, now, goes one step further. The whole differentiation of the divine into endless lists of names, he claims, has been contingent, historical—it was not simply an artificial instantiation of cultic practice. Contingency distances: one could reflect about such decisions, one might even criticize them. But in a contingent world, decisions are necessary, including negative ones, for example, the driving out of cults. Before the age of historicism, such decisions, invested with proper, legitimate authority, would be binding despite a possible critical perspective onto them. This is the basis for Varro, the systematizing thinker. Within the historical framework a recipe book on religion is offered. In hisDe natura deorum, written in the year following the publication of Varro’s work, Cicero would accept Varro’s concept of religion as the contingent human reaction to a conviction that the divine existed. What is more, in Cicero’s formulation, it is only this latter transcendent truth that is legitimately the object of philosophical inquiry; religious practice, the contingent reaction of humans to that truth, merely needs control.
               This is not exactly what Varro wrote, but leads back to a rather narrow, “civic” definition of religion.70<br>

Article Title: From Religionless Christianity to Immanent Grace: Bonhoeffer’s Legacy in Badiou<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 677726<br>
Date: 10 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Urbaniak Jakub<br>
Abstract: This article seeks to answer the question, In what sense can Alain Badiou’s idea of evental grace, conceived of as radically immanent, be understood as the continuation of the legacy of Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s nonreligious interpretation? The thematic scope of my analysis is determined by two factors: first, the notions of “religionless Christianity” and “immanent grace,” which, as I will argue, despite the evident discrepancy between Bonhoeffer’s and Badiou’s ontological backgrounds, allow for grasping some analogies between both their general insights and particular views and, second, the willingness to preserve the integrity of each approach. In order to meet the latter requirement I will, first, examine the contexts of Bonhoeffer’s concept of worldly faith and Badiou’s concept of immanently actual infinity one by one, through the lens of their respective agendas. Only then several analogies among them will be suggested by pointing to the essential continuity of Bonhoeffer’s legacy in Badiou with concurrent discontinuity regarding both the ontological basis and the theological implications of their views. Finally, I will suggest a possible message that the trajectory of thought indicated by Bonhoeffer and Badiou might convey to Christianity today. It ought to be mentioned that while Bonhoeffer’s theology constitutes the proper and direct object of this study, my treatment of Badiou’s philosophy assumes an effort of appropriating his thought theologically, which in itself constitutes an unobvious and often audacious task.<br>

Abstract: The Ionian cosmogonies of the sixth century b.c.e. explained how an ordered world evolved out of an undifferentiated initial state of “things.” In the fifth century, science became more particularly an inquiry into the ultimate constitution of material substance: the uniform and permanent “nature of things.” The notion of substance derives from tactile sensation. The belief in substantial things outside us reverts to the original detachment of self from the object. With Heraclitus of Ephesus, philosophy focused on knowing the thing, not on that which is known. Thought controls the phenomena as it constitutes the thinker. The problem of understanding nature was taken to a new level. The Milesian school of philosophers had moved it to the realm of the intellect in that they claimed the universe to be an intelligible whole. The manifold was to be understood as deriving from a sustaining principle or first cause, but was to be perceived in the phenomena.<br>

Abstract: This article seeks to understand erasures, instability, and queerness in the
         I am Bradley Manningcampaign. As social media increasingly provides digital places for people to create, convene, and participate in social movements and protest, there is a corresponding need to understand how these movements work, what they mean for individuals as an exercise of citizenship, and what they mean as movements in communities, cultures, and states. This article explores theI am Bradley Manningcampaign on Tumblr as an important object of study in understanding new forms of public protest and social movements. Many of these movements are not disruptive in the same sense of traditional forms of protest as we have understood them: protests in physical spaces and places that disrupt everyday life and living. Instead, these are protests that take place in virtual digital places, which at times provide little physical or material disruption of the everyday. This article is an attempt to begin understanding new ways we might frame or understand disruption and protest in light of digital movements.<br>

Abstract: The first chapter, “Spatiality,” addresses an age-old problem in the study of Chinese tombs. What factors caused the shift from the pre-Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE) practice of burying the dead in wooden caskets set within deep vertical pits to the Han and post-Han preference for constructing chambered tombs positioned along a horizontal axis? Because in casket tombs the objects, not the architectonic space, give the tomb meaning, Wu reconceptualizes this transition as moving from an “object-oriented” to a “space-oriented” design, during which time tombs underwent a process of “architecturalization” (32). He attributes the shift to major changes in ancestral worship, conceptions of the soul and the afterlife, and the establishment of an underworld bureaucracy that occurred in or just before the Han. To this point, Wu informs us that whereas in pre-Han times immortality was equated with deathlessness, in the Han period immortality after death was believed possible. As a consequence, tombs were decorated with images of the home, the heavens, and the world of the immortals, thereby embodying “polycentric” spaces that offered the dead a rich variety of realms to inhabit (221).<br>

Abstract: In nearly thirty densely argued pages, Gottfried Weber (1832) analyzed four measures from Mozart's"Dissonance" Quartet; the "ear" subjects each note and chord to multiple possible interpretations. This paper examines Weber's interpretive practice in light of his theory of harmony, considering his cognitive teasing of potential meanings from the perspective of philosophical notions of consciousness (Kant and Fichte) and the poetics of self-reflective subjectivity proposed by the Early Romantics (F.Schlegel and Novalis) in their critiques of linguistic representation, temporality,and subject-object relations.The Early Romantic conception of irony and allegory brings the subject fully within the fold of linguistic representation, as does Weber,marking a key moment in the history of the representation of listening by music theory.<br>

Abstract: Every text aims to seduce its reader. If the text at the same time lays claim to having scientific value, we readers must ask whether seduction stands in the way of truth. As a concept, seduction lies halfway between an assault and conversation. As opposed to assault, seduction conveys a dimension of voluntarily being swept off one's feet. As opposed to conversation, seduction implies that one loses one's senses for a moment. Who, then, is really subject and who is object in seduction? The thesis I will argue here is that the readership's or audience's only chance of taking on the role of subjects, in a textual seduction, is to lose their senses first. Rather than being an assault against scientific ethics, seduction is a necessary premise for a sensible conversation to take place.<br>

ward' movement from the objective expression to the immanent subjective experiences of the
expresser, but also a 'forward movement' from the sign to its intentional object" (Wilhelm Dilthey:

Abstract: How do we know when we are dealing with security issue? This is a cardinal question in Security Studies, and securitisation theory provides and authoritative yet incomplete answer, mainly because it rules out that the meaning of security can vary contextually. To overcome this limitation, we need a hermeneutical perspective centred on the liminality of security as a category in-between theory and policy, which produces a more precise algorithm for empirical research. A contextual hermeneutics of security signals that normative awareness is necessary even in the absence of a unifying normative manifesto, also confronts the spectre of the "death of security" invoked by those who object to the potentially endless broadening of its meaning.<br>

Abstract: In "The Magic Mountain," the only literary text by Thomas Mann in which German anti-Semitism is an object of satire, it remains uncertain whether a number of individuals are to be considered Jewish, or not. These uncertainties are symptomatic of the novel's protracted genesis, and especially of Thomas Mann's lifelong, historically and biographically conditioned efforts to distance himself from the anti-Semitic typologies evident in his early work. The most prominent of the relevant individuals in "The Magic Mountain," Dr. Krokowski, exemplifies this phenomenon. The various characteristics attributed to Krokowski evoke the continuing memory of a literary figure through whom Thomas Mann had previously only intended to relieve his anti-Semitic resentments. Thus Krokowski has a dual significance, representing Thomas Mann's early anti-Semitism and his later and vigorous, but nevertheless not entirely successful, attempts to overcome it.<br>

Author(s): KUUKKANEN JOUNI-MATTI<br>
Abstract: The narrativist turn of the 1970s and 1980s transformed the discussion of general history. With the rejection of Rankean historical realism, the focus shifted to the historian as a narrator and on narratives as literary products. Oddly, the historiography of science took a turn in the opposite direction at the same time. The social turn in the historiography of science emphasized studying science as a material and practical activity with traceable and documentable traits. This empirization of the field has led to an understanding that history of science could be directly describable from scientific practice alone without acknowledging the role of the historian as a constructor of narratives about these practices. Contemporary historians of science tend to be critical of science's ability to describe its object—nature, as it is—but they often are not similarly skeptical of their own abilities to describe their object: past science, as it is. I will argue that historiography of science can only gain from a belated narrativist turn.<br>

Abstract: Jaspers' thesis (while rejecting the claim of philosophers of the Western tradition to universal validity and Truth, yet conceding that their metaphysical systems express an awareness of Being) is as follows: "Reality is neither the object nor the subject, but that which encompasses both, the Encompassing which is illuminated in the division between subject and object"; He — the One God — is Encompassing and the greatest closeness which has its place within the inwardness of man". The whole inquiry leads Jaspers to claim that the existential self is rooted in Transcendence and the ground of all things lies in the real ization of the existential self in freedom in which eternity and time coalesce. In this freedom time — far from being the "moving image of eternity" — becomes the actual scene of the existential self's moral striving with the forces of this world, and by seizing the cipher (= the language of Transcendence) as the symbol of Transcendence, the existential self achieves authentic existence, thus endowing the historical process of time with unique and ultimate meaning. 1) Reason: It is because of reason with which God has endowed man that any content of a pretended revelation possesses any self-evidencing power: "In diesem Menschwerden durch Vernunft wird das Eine der Transzendenz fühlbar dem Einen der jeweils geschichtlichen Existenz". Yet by abandoning belief in universal Truth we become open for Truth, realised and determined in its concrete historic form for each individual by means of communication. Communication therefore becomes "the universal condition of man's being". It follows that Truth cannot be separated from communicability. It only appears in time as a realitythrough-communication so much so "that I can not even become myself alone without emerging out of my being with others". Now the element in which existential communication lives and moves and has its spiritual being is — reason ("reason is what penetrates everything"). 2) Unity of Mank~<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in con~<br>

Abstract: Les géographes français ont jusqu'à présent peu questionné leur rapport intellectuel et disciplinaire au terrain. En reprenant l'image de l'Arlésienne, cliché langagier de la présence/absence, l'auteur développe l'hypothèse d'une « fiction » collective, simultanément convoquée mais fort peu explicitée. L'article aborde successivement plusieurs registres d'analyse pour cerner les enjeux disciplinaires soulevés par une démarche réflexive sur le « terrain », objet de recherche. Trois approches sont privilégiées : la place et le statut du « terrain » dans les usages académiques et les analyses épistémologiques de la discipline, les relations complexes entre écritures scientifiques et factures littéraires (le géographe comme auteur), enfin les conséquences de la suprématie du visuel dans le rapport du géographe au terrain. L'article invite enfin à s'approprier collectivement une réflexion sur le « terrain » alors que les technologies numériques modifient en profondeur les codes de la représentation, en particulier visuelle. Until now, French geographers have rarely questioned their intellectual and disciplinary relationship with fieldwork. Using the image of the "Arlesian woman", a French cliché of simultaneous presence and absence, the author develops the hypothesis of a collective "fiction", always evoked but almost never clarified. The paper presents successive analytical levels to assess the disciplinary issues stemming from a reflexive approach of the "field" as research object. Three specific approaches have been chosen: first, the place and status of "fieldwork" in the academic usage and in the epistemological analyses of the discipline, then the complex relationships between scientific and literary ways of writing (the geographer as an author), and last the consequences of the dominance of visualization in the relationship between geographers and their fields. To conclude, the paper invites us to collectively appropriate a reflexion on "fieldwork", when digital t~<br>

Abstract: This essay reflects on the politics and poetics of citation, and offers a constructive reading of Jonathan Z. Smith's work. This is accomplished by a careful, critical reading of Hugh Urban's trenchant critiques of Smith. I argue that the referential techniques through which Urban constructs his argument are highly selective and often manipulate the relevant texts. The final pages of the essay consider how, based on the techniques of citation employed, one can always produce a different reading. The essay thus serves as an "e.g." of how our methods and theories drive our use of data and create our object of study; or, as Smith puts it, scholars have no privileged "place on which to stand."<br>

Abstract: "Teaching" and "science" are notions that cannot be applied univocally to theology. Teaching implies that the mind masters its object scientifically through human methods; but who can master the knowledge which God alone possesses? There is need for God's Word himself to become Teacher (John 1,18). Thus, in the schools the sacra pagina will open itself up to become sacra doctrina. The method of theology is therefore always subordinate to a transcendent knowledge which finally remains inaccessible to any merely human science. Is science thereby degraded or on the contrary enhanced? Thomas Aquinas developed the idea of «subalternation». Blondel spoke of a science based on Christ «verified and realised in us». Today hermeneutics discovers that only the Glory of ultimate reality is capable of giving meaning to all the figures that announce it in human history and knowledge. On the other hand, the avatars of nominalism show that reducing theology and science to univocity results in perverting science as such.<br>

Abstract: The article explores the object and the methodology of conceptual history, by elaborating on Reinhart Koselleck's idea of key concepts, and proposes to study them according to two different aspects of meaning: The representational aspect, which touches upon the relations between words and concepts and studies words and concepts within semantic fields, and the referential aspect, which brings in both the social history reflected in semantic changes and the contexts in which the concepts serve as factors, and which make the use of the concepts possible. The article concludes with a methodological suggestion for the use of digitized textual databases for diachronic as well as synchronic histories of concepts.<br>

Date: 1 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Kwon Soo-Young<br>
Abstract: The current methods in psychoanalytic studies of God images and representations have focused almost exclusively on individual, internal processes. This article examines how psychological anthropologists go about formulating symbolic representations of deity in their research, in comparison with the object relations method of God-representations. Drawing on Melford Spiro's integrative proposal for interpreting the mental and collective representations in religious symbol systems, this paper proposes that there is a need for a comprehensive model of the representational process in the Eastern world in order to suit its cultural traditions. The author uses both theoretical and historical materials as well as personal narrative throughout its entirety to balance the two in a mutual and coherent flow of understanding. Noting the culturally patterned interactions with culturally postulated God-symbols, the object relations method of God-representations will be utilized to probe how God is both created and found on a collective (cultural) level as well as individual level.<br>

Author(s): Britt Brian<br>
Abstract: In spite of limited resources, intellectual diversity, and arguments that texts are overrated as a method and object of study, this essay argues that religion and literature maintains a vital and even subversive identity by its commitment to the text. After challenging Lawrence Sullivan's argument against the 'tyranny of the text' in religious studies, I sketch three dimensions of texts that concern religion and literature as I see it: the aesthetic, the critical, and the transcendental. With an emphasis on the subversive function of religion and literature, I apply a hermeneutic of suspicion to these dimensions of text through two metaphors: the wig (la perruque) and the veil.<br>

Article Title: DOSTOEVSKY AND THE HERMENEUTICS OF SUSPICION<br>
Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23917895<br>
Date: 9 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Ward Bruce K.<br>
Abstract: The contemporary philosopher, Paul Ricoeur, has characterized the dominant trend in modern interpretative thought as the 'school of suspicion', whose most significant 'masters' are Freud and Nietzsche. For them, to seek meaning—whether in a text, dream, discourse, or institution—is, first and foremost, to suspect 'truth as lying'. It is my contention that Ricoeur could well have named Dostoevsky as a third master of this modern school of interpretation, for he, too, was preoccupied with exploring the possibility of 'truth as lying', whether to others or to oneself. The general concern of my essay is to clarify Dostoevsky's relation to the modern 'hermeneutics of suspicion' in a manner which is mutually illuminating. The particular focus is on Dostoevsky's hermeneutics of suspicion as employed in The Brothers Karamazov, especially with the object of deciphering the avowed 'love of humanity' which motivates Ivan Karamazov's famous 'rebellion' against God. Ivan's humanism is highly ambiguous, as his words and actions (of omission and commission) throughout the novel demonstrate. I attempt to show that the ambiguity of Ivan Karamazov can be illumined as an exercise of suspicion on Dostoevsky's part which distinguishes between the manifest sources of Ivan's moral stance and what is in reality its hidden basis. And, in order to situate Dostoevsky in relation to the modern 'school of suspicion', his interpretation of the ambiguous text of modern humanism is compared with that of Nietzsche. The dialogue which the essay sets up between Nietzsche and Dostoevsky on the problem embodied by Ivan Karamazov reveals areas of convergence and divergence: the former apparent in a shared suspicion of a secular humanism which affirms the love of humanity apart from religious faith; and the latter apparent in their different understandings of love—whether of humanity or of God. The comparison between Dostoevsky and Nietzsche, then, highlights the distinction between a hermeneutics of sus~<br>

Abstract: Es wird eine Theorie des Gedächtnisses für autobiographisches Material dargestellt. Diese Theorie beinhaltet als zentrale Annahmen: Einen Symbolbildungsprozeß, der einerseits affektiv erlebte Objektbeziehungen innerlich in Form von Propositionen (Repräsentanzen) abbildet und andererseits diese Repräsentanzen wiederum in mitteilbare Symbole transformiert; Verdrängung, die solche Repräsentanzen erfassen kann und somit ein Unbewußtes schafft, das in Objektbeziehungen gründet; Abwehrprozesse, die Teil der Symbolisierungsfunktion sind und die unbewußte Repräsentanzen in bewußte, aber verzerrte Symbole transformieren. Erklärt werden sollen durch diese Theorie Gedächtnisphänomene wie Erinnern, verzerrtes Erinnern und Wiederholen vom Charakter des Wiederholungszwanges. A theory of memory for biographical material is proposed. This theory consists in the following central assumptions: a symbol formation process, which on the one hand maps affectively experienced object relations into inner propositions (representations) and on the other hand transforms representations into communicable symbols; repression which may affect representations and which thus establishes an unconsciousness which is rooted in object relations; defense mechanisms, which are part of the symbol formation process and which transform unsonscious representations into conscious but distorted symbols. This theory is supposed to explain remembering, distorted remembering, and phenomena of compulsive repetition.<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>

Author(s): Bell Allan<br>
Abstract: This article questions the aptness of 'discourse analysis' as a label for our field, and prefers the less reductionist concept of 'Discourse Interpretation'. It does this through drawing on ideas from the field of philosophical hermeneutics – the theory and practice of interpreting texts. It operationalizes and adapts the construct of the Interpretive Arc from the philosophy of Paul Ricoeur in order to address issues that are central to discourse work, including that of how we warrant the validity of our textual interpretations. The Interpretive Arc consists of six interlinked phases, which the article presents and exemplifies through discussion of a single text – the story of Babel. Phase I of the arc defines readers as being in a state of Estrangement before the text because of the distancing created by its written or technological form. Phase 2 is that of Pre-view, the state of opinion or knowledge that readers bring to a text. At phase 3, a first reading forms readers' Proto-understanding, their initial 'guess' at what the text means. Then processes of Analysis (phase 4) test and evidence the validity of alternative readings, limiting the interpretations which can plausibly be taken from a text. Three byways of interpretive analysis are challenged and discarded: the dominance of author intention, structuralist analysis and limitless polysemy. Analysis then leads into 5, the phase of informed Understanding of the matter or injunction of the text, of what is disclosed or unfolded before the text. The Interpretive Arc is completed in phase 6, Ownership. Here, through processes of critique of their own and the text's ideologies and of fresh listening, readers are led to a new self formed by the matter of the text. There is a dialectic amongst Analysis, Understanding and Ownership, with each informing and modifying the other. The approach emphasizes interpretation as the heart of discourse work. The 3000-year-old narrative of Babel is a subject as well as an object h~<br>

Abstract: I offer some comments from the perspective of someone familiar with the work of Paul Ricoeur on Allan Bell's proposal that discourse studies take a hermeneutic turn drawing on Ricoeur's idea of an arc of interpretation. I suggest that such a hermeneutic turn would need to be more radical than Bell proposes in that he limits it largely to questions of method, without really addressing how it might affect our understanding of either the object of discourse studies or the goal of such studies. This does raise the question, however, whether discourse studies should be considered a subdiscipline of hermeneutical philosophy.<br>

Abstract: Der Politischen Theologie kann man sich auf drei Arten nähern, wobei sich diese hermeneutischen Zugänge nach ihrem jeweiligen Verhältnis von Politikwissenschaft und Theologie unterscheiden lassen: ein erster Zugang betont die substantielle Beziehung zwischen den beiden Disziplinen und ihrem jeweiligen Gehalt; ein zweiter Zugang unterstreicht die begriffsgeschichtliche Abkunft der Politikwissenschaft von der Theologie; und ein dritter Zugang legt Wert auf das rhetorische Moment innerhalb der Politischen Theologie. Während die ersten beiden Ansätze in der Vergangenheit in großem Maße Aufmerksamkeit auf sich gezogen haben, wurde das rhetorische Moment nur selten Gegenstand eingehender Untersuchungen. Der vorliegende Aufsatz betont dagegen die rhetorische Dimension der Politischen Theologie und verweist auf deren häufige Versuche, mittels metaphorischer Bezüge auf »Theologie« im politischen und wissenschaftlichen Streit zu obsiegen. There are three hermeneutical approaches to Political Theology, each of which points towards a distinct relationship between Political Science and Theology: the first approach stresses the substantial links between the two disciplines and their respective contents; the second approach emphasises the dimension of conceptual history, claiming that concepts of Political Science have their roots within Theology; the third approach points towards the rhetorical moment within Political Theology. While the first two approaches have been the object of considerable research in the past, the third has been rather neglected. This article highlights the rhetorical dimension of Political Theology. It points to numerous attempts in which »Theology« has been used metaphorically in order to bolster arguments within political and scholarly debates.<br>

Abstract: Son ya varias las décodas transcurridas desde que los estudios de folklore en general y la etnomusicología en particular se han visto dominados por la analitica deconstructiva y el pensamiento culturalista, configurando un bloque paradigmático sumamente influyente en el multidisciplinar territorio de las ciencias sociales. Las aportaciones provenientes de estas corrientes han resultado en líneas generates de gran valor e interés para la comunidad científica, ensanchando y dinamizando el hasta entonces relativamente reducido campo de acción e interpretación de disciplinas como la musicología comparada. Sin embargo el proceso de renovación académica –que encabezarían obras como las de Benedict Anderson y Eric Hobsbawm– ha implicado asimismo un desigual desplazamiento del foco de atención desde el objeto de estudio mismo hacia la esfera de su contexto, relevancia social e implicaciones ideológicas. La deconstrucción se ha ejercido particularmente en contra del aserto diferencial, subrayando sus debilidades argumentales, excesos etnocéntricos y –con frecuencia– obvios intereses espurios, una tarea históricamente necesaria pero que a la par ha sustraído del folklore todo valor ontológico en aras de su significado, y del trabajo científico el vital soporte empírico, que ahora se ve arrinconado por una elaboración altamente abstracta al amparo de un lenguaje en el límite de la saturación semántica. Este artículo explora la vía crítica descrita para concluir planteando determinadas alternativas en defensa de una tradición sostenible –a pesar del vigor innegable y sinergético de las fuerzas del progreso, los procesos de hibridación y globalización y las alteraciones provenientes del constructo folklorista–, así como del hecho diferencial implícito y su asunción y gestión no indefectiblemente en el marco de un proyecto político o comercial. Studies of folklore in general and ethnomusicology in particular have been dominated by deconstructive analysis and culturalist theory fo~<br>

Abstract: The notion of text acquires a fundamental epistemological role in the disciplines of language in the second half of the XXth century. The analysis of some linguistic objects we have called semiological tools could highlight some epistemological issues in the use of the term text. From the Sixties we can observe that text has progressively acquired the general status of an object of analysis. Nevertheless, if linguistic text proves to be a common object of analysis for semiotics and hermeneutics, then it is necessary to reconsider their epistemological relations, to understand something new about what text is. Considering the interpretative problem in the hjelmslevian epistemology, a new perspective emerges between these complementary approaches to text. Comparing semiotics and hermeneutics we can also question the epistemological role that the notion of text embodies among contemporary disciplines of language.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo contém uma leitura em contraponto: a noção de situação em Simone de Beauvoir e a de intersecções em Donna Haraway expressariam supostos relacionais; mulher estaria para Beauvoir como ciborgue está para Haraway; Beauvoir distingue a situação das mulheres, dos judeus e dos negros, considerando a relação entre situações e consciências históricas e|ou biológicas. A biologia aparece em situação como construção mítica de uma identidade a ser ultrapassada para a constituição do sujeito; em Haraway, o ciborgue seria uma narrativa sobre como o biológico e a realidade social de raça e gênero situam-se em uma rede de interações, informação e semiologia. Relação e constituição do "objeto", temas caros à teoria social, seriam instituídos em (e pela) alteridade sem a dicotomia dura entre realidade e ficção, natureza e cultura, literatura e ciência. In this article I will present a counterpoint between notions of 'situation' by Simone de Beauvoir and 'intersections' by Donna Haraway, which express ideas of relation. I will argue that woman for Beauvoir is like cyborg for Haraway. Beauvoir distinguishes the situation of women, Jews and blacks by considering the relationship between situations and historical consciousness and | or biological weapons. For Beauvoir, the biology in situation appears as construction of a mythical identity to be overcome for the formation of the subject. Alternatively, Haraway uses the cyborg as a narrative of how the biological and social reality of race and gender are into a network of interactions, information and semiology. With this claiming for alterity inside the relation and constitution of the "object", both authors bring important challenges to two of the most important issues of social theory. Moreover, they do it without the hard dichotomy between reality and fiction, nature and culture, literature and science.<br>

Abstract: Vgl. Anm. 47 u. 49, Erdmann, a. a. O., S. 8; Helmholtz: Die Thatsachen in der Wahrneh-
mung (1878). In: Vorträge und Reden. Bd. 2, S. 238; vgl. dazu Helmholtz' Distanzierung von
Berkeley im Handbuch der physiologischen Optik. 2. Aufl., S. 612. Helmholtz hält Berkeleys
Standpunkt für falsch, demzufolge „nicht bloß die Qualitäten der Empfindung, sondern auch die
Wahrnehmungen überhaupt nur innere Prozesse seien, denen nichts äußeres entspräche". Berke-
ley wird „zu dieser Schlußfolgerung verleitet durch den falschen Satz, die Ursache (das wahrge-
nommene Objekt) müsse ihrer Wirkung (Vorstellung) gleichartig, also auch ein geistiges Wesen,
nicht ein reales Object sein". Gerade einen solchen Ubergang von einer Vorstellung zu einer rea-
len Ursache hatte Schopenhauer als mit dem Satz vom Grunde unvereinbar erklärt (s. o.
Anm. 36). Im übrigen kann Helmholtz so nur um den Preis einer systematischen Ambiguität
von einer Ursache sprechen. Einerseits ist ein reales, physiologisch faßbares Agens gemeint, das
Sinnesempfindungen verursacht und somit einer Welt I angehören muß; andererseits ist ein Ob-
jekt der Wahrnehmung (Welt III) gemeint, das aufgrund der Sinnesempfindung erschlossen wird.
Daß die äußere Realität (Welt I) und die innere Welt der Wahrnehmung (Welt III) sich aufgrund
eines unbewußten Inferenzprozesses „decken" können, ist eine selbst metaphysische Vorausset-
zung, die den physiologisch gewendeten Idealismus Helmholtz' realistisch einfärbt. Tatsächlich
verlaufen „die mit dem Character der Wahrnehmung auftretenden Bewußtseinsacte... so, als ob
die von der realistischen Hypothese angenommene Welt der stofflichen Dinge wirklich bestände.
Aber über dieses,als ob' kommen wir nicht hinweg, für mehr als eine ausgezeichnet brauchbare
und präcise Hypothese können wir die realistische Hypothese nicht anerkennen..." (Vorträge u.
Reden. Bd. 2, S. 239) - „da neben ihr noch andere unwiderlegbare idealistische Hypothesen mög-
lich sind", die das Leben als Traum erscheinen lass~<br>

Abstract: Este artículo tiene por objetivo presentar una estrategia metodológica para el estudio de las urbanizaciones cerradas que se centre en la mirada de los actores sociales involucrados, teniendo en cuenta las representaciones sociales y las percepciones que sustentan. Dicha estrategia se enmarca en una investigación cualitativa que permite reconstruir teóricamente un objeto en permanente dinamismo y obtener una comprensión holística de las situaciones sociales; propone para su desarrollo la utilización de un enfoque etnográfico, en tanto la etnografía es una modalidad de investigación que favorece la comprensión de los procesos sociales. This article seeks to present a methodological approach to the study of gated communities in order to focus on the perspective of the actors involved, taking into account the social representations and perceptions those supports. This strategy is part of a qualitative research project that enables one to theoretically reconstruct an object in constant dynamism and obtain a holistic understanding of social situations. To this end, it proposes using an ethnographic approach, since ethnography is a form of research that promotes the understanding of social processes.<br>

Abstract: Le 21 août 2004, dans la Békaa (Liban), un jeune touriste musulman sunnite est le témoin d'un miracle : une statue de la Vierge s'anime devant lui et lui adresse un message. L'événement transforme en quelques jours Béchouate, un village isolé, en vaste centre de pèlerinage interreligieux réunissant des dévots de différentes confessions, chrétiens et musulmans. Cet article portera sur le basculement qui voit une statue, « Notre-Dame de Béchouate », brusquement passer du régime de l'objet à celui d'une personne qui s'anime, sourit, bouge et parle. Elle sera donc l'héroïne de l'ethnographie ici proposée, une héroïne au centre de pressantes attentions humaines. Partant de l'observation des liens complexes qui se créent et se recréent entre cet « objet-personne » et des dévots de différentes religions, il s'agira de s'interroger sur les économies locatives du divin et de faire « heuristiquement crédit » aux acteurs rencontrés sur le terrain lorsque pour de « bonnes raisons », ils affirment être en présence d'êtres divins et/ou surnaturels. On 21 August 2004, in the Bekaa Valley (Lebanon), a young Sunni Muslim tourist witnessed a miracle : a statue of the Virgin Mary came to life and gave him a message. Within a few days, Beshuat, once a quiet and remote village, became a major interdenominational pilgrimage center drawing thousands of Christian and Muslim worshippers. The statue of Our Lady of Beshuat is the main « actor » of the following ethnographic essay that details its/her sudden transformation from « object » into « persona » capable of moving, smiling and speaking. Based on observation of the complex ties between this object-person and worshippers of different religions, the aim of this essay is to highlight how the divine is made present and, by so doing, to give « heuristic credit » to the people encountered in the field who declare, for « good reasons », that they are in the presence of divine or supernatural beings.<br>

Abstract: I take distance here from the language used by K.-O. Apel. Apel speaks of a 'transcenden-
tal-hermeneutical synthesis' which would be proper to the pre-theoretical constitution of
the Lebenstaeli (Heidegger, Wittgenstein) and which would found the kantian synthesis of
apperception. See Apel, Transformation der Philosophie, vol. 1, pp. 246, 308.1 reject however
the notion of pre-theoretical 'synthesis' and prefer the notion of 'systasis', i.e., the oneness
(één-zijri) of man and world, subject and object, in pre-scientific experience. Transcendental
hermeneutical reflection can for the rest not be called pre-scientific, because and insofar as
it is explicitly engaged in tracing man's transcendental openness.<br>

Abstract: The phrase 'objectly taking place' means 'that which is the object of the history-
keeping subject's attention'. The events which the history-keeper notes, like the art object
which an art critic examines, make the subject dépendent upon them, although it is surely
possible for the inquiring subject as would-be history-keeper or art critic, in the name of
co-dependence, to make the object over into its own subjective image. We might call such
a mistake the Narcissistic fallacy.<br>

Abstract: The transcendental critique of theoretical thought as it was developed by Herman
Dooyeweerd can be seen as a particularization of a général reflective critique of experience.
This perspective implies that theoretical thought and everyday experience do not stand
opposite each other as 'Gegenstand-relation' versus 'subject-object relation', as in
Dooyeweerd. I hope to show elsewhere the structural affinity of these two.<br>

Author(s): Blosser Philip<br>
Abstract: H. Dooyeweerd, "Calvinistische Wijsbegeerte," Scientia 1 (1956), 144; quoted in G.C.
Berkouwer, Man: The Image of God, Studies in Dogmatics, trans. Dirk W. Jellema (Grand
Rapids: Eerdmans, 1962), p. 258; henceforth cited as "Man." See Dooyeweerd's comparable
statement in NC, I, 21, where he uses "philosophical" instead of "theoretical" thought; and cf.
TM, VI, on the presuppositional nature of the soul in human theorizing.
The parallels with Scheler's view of the "person" are remarkable here. Much as in
Dooyeweerd's view the "soul" or "heart" can never be objectified, so for Scheler the "person"
can never become an object of analysis; much as in Dooyeweerd's view "acts" come forth out
of the soul but only function within the temporal structure of the human body, so for Scheler
the person acts into time without himself being in time. For Scheler's distinction between
"acts" and "functions," and significant differences in his view of the act-structure, see Max
Scheler, Der Formalismus in der Ethik und die Materiale Wertethik, Gesammelte Werke, Vol;. II, ed.
Maria Scheler (Bern: Francke Verlag, 1954), pp. 395ff.; translated as Formalism in Ethics and
No7t-Formal Ethics of Values (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1973), pp. 385ff. For
the comparable views of Dooyeweerd, see TM XIV and XX, for example. It is possible that
both Dooyeweerd's and Scheler's view of the non-objectifiability of the essential selfhood of
the person is the result of a residual Kantianism.<br>

Abstract: The subject in these subject-object relationships is not the ego or I, 01 the mind, or any
Cartesian cogito. 'Subject' refers here to the 'active' side in the process of opening-up (activity
in itself not implying any consciousness of it), like the biotic 'object-side' of a bird's nest — as
such a physical structure — is opened-up by the biotic subject function of the bird.<br>

Abstract: An example may help to illustrate this point. The scientist who investigates the neuro-
hormonal regulation of mood should ask whether this inquiry concerns mostly the area of the
biotic substructure, for example in the case of molecular-biological study of receptor changes;
or whether the inquiry is in the area of the psychical substructure, for example in the case of
various types of mood changes due to (pharmacological) manipulation at receptor level. In the
first case the mood regulation comes into (anticipatory) view as psychical object function
within the biotic substructure. In the second case we are dealing with a biotic subject function
within the psychical substructure (or as biotic object in the psychical modal function). The
problem in this sort of research is that the two perspectives alternate, and so easily lead to a
short-circuit. Mood changes are then causally attributed to neuronal processes. In terms of
Dooyeweerd's system this attribution implies a double short-circuit: modal and in terms of
entities. The principle of (modal) sphere sovereignty does not allow causality between functio-
nal modes (it does allow coherence). The idea of foundational enkapsis allows no causality
between substructures. It does allow coherence and integration within a structural whole. Com-
pare Glas (1991, Chapter 6) and Glas (2001, Chapter 4).<br>

Abstract: L'œuvre de François Laplanche prend délibérément pour objet la longue durée : l'exégèse biblique entretient un rapport constant au Texte originel et l'historien ne peut s'exonérer de connaître les interprétations patristiques et médiévales de la Bible. L'histoire d'une pratique de lecture savante est ici réintégrée à l'intérieur de l'ensemble de la culture, de la société et des événements d'une période donnée. Prenant pour centre d'analyse les théologiens calvinistes de Saumur vers 1620-1670, François Laplanche montre que, tandis que leur système demeure arrimé à l'orthodoxie réformée, ils la minent et conduisent à une désacralisation de l'Écriture par un double éloignement : éloignement de l'origine puisque la disqualification de l'Ancien Testament le transforme en objet d'histoire; éloignement de la fin des temps par la récusation catégorique du prophétisme et du millénarisme. The work of François Laplanche deliberately deals with long duration: biblical exegesis maintains a constant relationship to the original Text and the historian cannot exempt himself from knowing the patristic and medieval interpretations of the Bible. The history of scholarly reading is here reinstated within the culture, society and events of a given period. Taking as the center of his analysis the Calvinist theologians of Saumur around 1620-1670, François Laplanche shows that, while their system remains linked to reformed orthodoxy, they are undermining it and go towards a desecration of Scripture via a double remoteness: remoteness from the origin since the disqualification of the Old Testament transforms it into an historical object; remoteness from the end of time via the adamant disqualification of prophecy and millenarianism. La obra de François Laplanche toma deliberadamente como objeto la larga duración: la exégesis bíblica establece una relación constante con el Texto original y el historiador no puede eximirse de conocer las interpretaciones patrísticas y medievales de la Biblia.~<br>

Abstract: The Secret Staircase is the title given to an installation presented by Caroline Isgar and Michèle Roberts at the Foundling Museum of London in 2008, and also to the accompanying book, a collection of Isgar's drawings and Roberts's eighteen narrative pieces, meant as a souvenir of the exhibition. Roberts tells the story of a daughter's recollection of her childhood and her life with her mother on the occasion of the latter's approaching death. Each piece is inspired by an object belonging either to the past or to the experience of the mother's confinement in a hospice. Roberts's contribution to the installation constitutes a memory text in its own right, and suggests that writing is the actual trace that can bring the past to life and the means by which the daughter comes to terms with the mother figure. The Secret Staircase es el título de la exposición presentada por Caroline Isgar y Michèle Roberts en el Foundling Museum de Londres en 2008, y también el del libro que la ilustraba, una colección de los dibujos de Isgar y dieciocho narraciones breves, proyectados como souvenir de la exposición. Roberts cuenta los recuerdos de infancia de una hija junto a su madre con ocasión de la inminente muerte de ésta. Cada texto se inspira en un objeto que pertenece al pasado o a la experiencia de confinamiento en el hospital. La contribución de Roberts constituye en sí misma un texto de la memoria y sugiere que la escritura es la verdadera huella que devuelve el pasado a la vida y el medio por el cual la hija se reconcilia con la figura materna.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i342990<br>
Date: 10 1, 1976<br>
Author(s): Nipperdey Lucian<br>
Abstract: This article argues for the establishment of a new, "annalistic" model of history and historical investigation. This implies a new concept of historical event: instead of being seen as an element within a historical narrative, the historical event is defined as the common reference point of many narratives that can be told about it. The annalistic model also implies a new concept of historical change: instead of being defined as the change of an "object" within a set of given historical parameters, historical change has to be perceived as the change of parameters related to a given historical object. A new concept of history follows from the annalistic model: instead of history being a metaphysical unity of space and time (the destiny of mankind, the positivist's world of facts), in which everything is linked to everything, it is instead the product of historical judgment carried out by those who design stories about their own past, present, and future. To the "annalist" a world is imaginable in which no history has existed, exists, or will exist. The article analyzes three aspects of the concept of historical time: it demonstrates the huge variety of temporal structures in history; it argues for the foundation of the representation of historical time in linguistic concepts; and it discusses the relationship of fictionality and reality in historical discourse. Finally, the annalistic model is compared to the traditional concept of history established by historicism in the nineteenth century.<br>

Abstract: La réflexion offerte dans cet essai s'inscrit dans une entreprise d'approfondissement de la compréhension générale que nous avons de l'activité politique (parler, écrire, revendiquer, mettre en scène), et particulièrement de la relation que cette activité entretient avec l'idée de l'émancipation. Plus précisément, il s'agit de prendre pour objet d'exploration théorique le fait de parole, défini en termes d'articulation performative des espaces-temps humains, et d'en faire le paradigme de toute action politique. L'analyse de ce paradigme, au terme, permettra de pointer vers une matière utopique qui se qualifie à la fois comme événement et comme permanence du commun. /// In this article, the author seeks a better understanding of the modalities of political action (speaking, writing, claming, staging), and more specifically of the relation between political action and the idea of emancipation. To do so, the author proposes that the speech act, comprehended as the performed articulation of lived space/time, is to be taken as the paradigm of political action. Further analysis of this paradigm, as developed in the article, compels the manifestation of a philosophical object which qualifies both as event and as the manifestation of the perennially of the common.<br>

Abstract: Hermeneutic and anti-hermeneutic sides in the debate about psychoanalysis are entangled in an epistemological and methodological antinomy, here exemplified by Grünbaum's and Spence's paradigmatic views. Both contain a partial element of truth, which they assert dialectically one against the other (§§ 1 and 2). This antinomy disappers only by reconciling an operationalist approach with man's ability to suspend the effectiveness of the 'laws' applied to him (§ 3). The hermeneutic way in which the technical-operational criterion of truth works in psychoanalysis demands that clinical and extra-clinical testing methods work synergically, through a fruitful self-correcting strategy, grounded on the very psychoanalytic object: the unconscious (§ 4).<br>

Author(s): Radford Luis<br>
Abstract: Meaning is one of the recent terms which have gained great currency in mathematics education. It is generally used as a correlate of individuals' intentions and considered a central element in contemporary accounts of knowledge formation. One important question that arises in this context is the following: if, in one way or another, knowledge rests on the intrinsically subjective intentions and deeds of the individual, how can the objectivity of conceptual mathematical entities be guaranteed? In the first part of this paper, both Peirce's and Husserl's theories of meaning are discussed in light of the aforementioned question. I examine their attempts to reconcile the subjective dimension of knowing with the alleged transcendental nature of mathematical objects. I argue that transcendentalism, either in Peirce's or Husserl's theory of meaning, leads to an irresolvable tension between subject and object. In the final part of the article, I sketch a notion of meaning and conceptual objects based on a semiotic-cultural approach to cognition and knowledge which gives up transcendentalism and instead conveys the notion of contextual objectivity.<br>

Abstract: La place de la musique dans À la recherche du temps perdu a suscité nombre de commentaires. Le présent propos connecte ces points à un débat interne aux musicologues français. Si certains l'envisage contre toute interpretation subjective, d'autres entendent la recentrer sur deux axes majeurs: 1) le statut d'écrit littéraire 2) révélant l'expérience musicale d'autre part. Or, de récents articles insèrent Proust à ce débat. Il s'agit de comprendre en quoi réactualiser écrivain ayant fait d'un roman un projet esthétique où la question du langage est centrale peut relancer la discussion du lien musique-langage, ici en un rapport où s'adjoint la musicologie, elle-même objet d'une dissension. /// The work À la recherche du temps perdu by Marcel Proust has provoked numerous commentaries which referred to the importance conferred upon music in this novel. In this, interest was pointed either at the music sources, the listening, or the connections between the architecture of the novel and the musical structure of the composer Vinteuil, the character in the novel. This article offers the articulation of those debates which occur within the French musicology which question its objects in the way that some consider it as a science or discipline at intersection of others, which has to return necessarily within sciences called exact and/or humane, opposed to all subjective interpretations; the other try to center again musicologist's activities in two main axes: the status of a writing with a literary aspiration on one side, and a report about musical experience on the other. In this, recent articles were putting Marcel Proust in the focus of a contemporary debate, trying to understand in which way the reactualisation of a writer - who out of one work had made an aesthetical project in which the question of language became central - can renew the discussion about connections between music and language, but this time within a triangular connection in which musicology is added, whi~<br>

Abstract: Regido por la subjetividad, el universo contemporáneo del creer es en todas sus partes de circulación fluida, inmediatamente refractario a cualquier referencia estructurante a estabilidad alguna, excepto cuando postula esta estabilidad como puramente operatoria. El objetivo del creer contemporáneo no consiste en alcanzar una "identidad religiosa" (que se concibe como "estable"), sino demostrar que puede ser un creer dentro del movimiento. En realidad, el concepto de "religión", como también los de "secularización" y de "laicidad" que se le asocian, pasan a ser, en situación de plena legitimidad social de la individualización radical de la construcción de una relación con el sentido, conceptos cada vez más indeterminados y en consecuencia de sobra inutilizables, al menos mientras se persista en reconocerles una pertinencia que les sería propia. La "religión", por ello, no es sino el indicador de recomposiciones más amplias, en las cuales participa, por otra parte, como instrumento de gestión. Así, sólo tiene sentido como objeto de intermediación, un analizador que, contextualizado, puede por lo demás resultar muy precioso. /// Ruled by subjectivity, the contemporary universe of belief is in all its parts of fluid circulation, immediately impervious to any structuring reference to any stability, unless this stability is posited as a purely operating principle. The aim of contemporary belief is not to achieve a "religious identity" (which would be conceived as "stable"), but to show that it can be a belief within movement. In fact, the concept of "religion", as well as the related concepts of "secularization" and "laicism" that are associated to it, happen to become, in a situation of total social legitimacy of radical individualization in constructing a relation with meaning, increasingly indeterminate and consequently utterly useless concepts, at least as far as there persists the will to grant them a pertinence of their own. "Religion", for that reason, is nothing m~<br>

Publisher: Society for Historical Archaeology<br>
Issue: i25616488<br>
Date: 1 1, 1996<br>
Author(s): McCarthy John P.<br>
Abstract: Much archaeological scholarship on consumption has approached its subject matter as the means to an end—e.g., as a way of studying socioeconomic status—rather than as a proper object of study in its own right. The "consumer choice" school, and, more recently, advocates of consumer behavior studies, have supported approaches that emphasize quantitative methods, at the same time downplaying the "qualitative" or symbolic aspects of consumption. A considerable body of literature on the symbolic aspects of consumption exists both in historical archaeology and other fields. The intention of this essay is to draw together this recent literature on consumption and combine it into a single approach that emphasizes shopping as the meaningful action at the very heart of consumption. With the emphasis on agency, this approach presents shopping as that crucial moment of transformation where identity, intention, and symbol combine in the decision to purchase, to own, an object.<br>

Abstract: Beckett's "Three Dialogues with Georges Duthuit" poses two distinct difficulties for the reader: the revelation of artistic process or creative energy and the resistance to representation with its implication of objectification. The first may be defined in terms of a three-stage operation resulting in a depiction of sublimation or creative force. Without recourse to psychohistory, one may explore the second in terms of the paradoxical obsession with evocative memory evident throughout Beckett's work. Of this, a disturbance in object representation, understood in the psychoanalytic sense, may be the source.<br>

Article Title: Die Entwicklung zum Postmodernismus in der Sozialwissenschaft<br>
Publisher: Dietrich Reimer Verlag<br>
Issue: i25842884<br>
Date: 1 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Scheuch Erwin K.<br>
Abstract: First of all an overview is presented of the development in the social sciences that led to postmodernism. The starting point for this is the modernity that was under the influence of Parsons after the second World War. It extended to the Third World mainly in the context of development research. Since the end of the 1970s the contributions of two German scientists, Niklas Luhmann and Jürgen Habermas, have received international recognition. During this time the first critical voices concerning the modernist theories were heard. Among ideas opposing these theories the approaches should be named first, which the author calls "post industrial". To these he counts primarily the analysis of the modern socio-economic system by Daniel Bell and the studies of the "post-material personality" by Ronald Inglehart. Research on the change of values in modern societies should be named in the same context. However, "post-industrial" should not be confused with "post-modern". The origin of the latter term from the "culture scene" is explained. The language of the post-modernists can be viewed as their characteristic, as well as the attempts of deconstruction imprinted by Derrida. Ever since Lyotard the strong bond between the name and the named object within the language has been questioned. Therefore, Jean Baudrillard is correct in noting a loss in the sense of orientation of the modern human being. For example, the works of two post-modernists, Anthony Giddens and Ulrich Beck, are discussed in detail, after which the author concludes: "That is the most important meaning of postmodernity: as a symbol for the weakened autonomy of the sciences and arts, as a lack for the support of sciences in culture and politics". Nevertheless one can observe a return to rationality in recent years.<br>

Author(s): Ponsard Nathalie<br>
Abstract: L'auteur porte un regard critique sur la construction d'un objet historique qui, pour retracer l'histoire des pratiques de lecture sur le long terme (des années trente à nos jours) et cerner les processus d'appropriation des textes lus en milieu ouvrier, a nécessité le recours à une démarche d'investigation en histoire orale. Il aborde donc les grandes questions méthodologiques puis précise quelques résultats de l'analyse des discours en insistant sur leur apport fructueux pour l'histoire socioculturelle. The author takes a critical look at the construction of an historical object which, in order to relate the history of reading practices over the long term (from the 1930s to today) and bring to the fore the appropriation process of texts read in a working class milieu, meant undertaking an investigation involving oral history. It discusses the main methodological questions and then indicates some results of the analysis of the discourse, while insisting on their fruitful contribution to socio-cultural history.<br>

Author(s): Chowers Eyal<br>
Abstract: In 'The Uncanny', Freud does not distinguish between psychotic pathologies and
narcissistic ones, seeming to regard them as one category. As Olsen and Koppe explain,
Freud 'found that most of the traits [of psychoses], that is, self-centeredness, lack of
libidinous object cathexis, the loss of the sense of reality, and domination of primary pro-
cesses, were related to their narcissistic mode'. They add that 'what in particular distin-
guishes the neuroses from the psychoses is their reliance on the defense mechanisms of
projection and denial in contrast to repression'. See O. Olsen and S. Koppe, Freud's
Theory of Psychoanalysis, trans. J.C. Delay and C. Pedersen (New York, 1988),
pp. 244-5. However, Freud's classification of psychic illnesses changed with the intro-
duction of the super-ego. In 'Neurosis and Psychosis' (1923), Freud argues that 'Trans-
ference neuroses correspond to a conflict between the ego and the id; narcissistic neuro-
ses [such as melancholia], to a conflict between the ego and the super-ego; and psycho-
ses, to one between the ego and the external world' (XIX, p. 152). This distinction is
problematic, since Freud claims that part of the demands of the external world is repre-
sented by the super-ego. In any event, in my discussion below I will continue to refer to
projection as a psychotic defence with narcissistic motivations.<br>

Abstract: The task of anthropology consists in describing and explaining cultures and ultimately reaching an understanding of them through interpretation. The practical difficulties of this are obvious to all those who have dealth with members of another culture. As Malinowski observed, the anthropologist's task is to be "the interpreter of the native." It is suggested that some of the principles elucidated in the philosophical discipline of hermeneutics, such as understanding in context as opposed to preunderstanding and the dialectical relationship between the interpreter and the object of interpretation, may be helpful in defining the essential problems that anthropologists may encounter in their attempts to interpret cultures.<br>

Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies<br>
Issue: i27652935<br>
Date: 10 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Kliger Ilya<br>
Abstract: Ilya Kliger addresses the question of Mikhail Bakhtin's intervention in modernist discourse by taking a step back from Bakhtin's views on modernist literature and outlining instead a more general Bakhtinian conception of the modernist condition as characterized by what Kliger calls "a crisis of authorship." The article focuses on Bakhtin's early work in narratological aesthetics and situates it within the longue durée context of debates about the status of the subject of aesthetic experience and, more generally, of knowledge, debates that can provisionally be seen as originating at the end of the eighteenth century and coming to a head within the intellectual and creative milieu of twentieth-century modernism. Early Bakhtin helps us formulate a specifically modernist—by contrast with what will be called "transcendental" and "realist"—critique, a critique not limited to the field of literary analysis alone but applying to all forms of thinking that either presuppose abstract subject-object division or rely on modes of synthetic reconciliation.<br>

Publisher: American Academy of Religion, Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i27919226<br>
Date: 9 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Clairmont David A.<br>
Abstract: This paper examines the effect of scholars' religious commitments on how they specify their object of study and select a method appropriate to its investigation. Using recent work on the notion of "bridge concepts" and "the analogical imagination" in the comparative study of religious ethics as a case study, this paper proposes persons in the process of intellectual and moral struggle with their own traditions as important and potentially fruitful objects for comparative studies of religion. Such a refocusing on the perennial appearance of persons navigating the troublesome yet profound histories of their religious communities offers important opportunities for cultivating openness, humility, and respect between the academic study of religion and those working critically from within traditions.<br>

Abstract: This paper addresses several problems in experimental ethnographies: the integration of first- and third-person texts, ethnographic authority, and incorporation of dialogue in ethnographies. These problems can be traced to a relationship between discourse and text that hinges on splitting subject/object and process/product. Both splits are antithetical to dialogue in defining relationships between self and social life. A dialogic approach is developed through use of indexing in social distance, and discussed in Japanese usage of register. Implications for intersubjective, reflexive, and pluralistic approaches to social life are traced out.<br>

Publisher: University of Alberta<br>
Issue: i275803<br>
Date: 4 1, 1969<br>
Author(s): WittgensteinAbstract: This paper criticizes post-modern and interpretive challenges to positivism by incorporating pragmatism into sociological theory. As an interpretive method, pragmatism is based on the notion that the meaning of ideas is to be found in their consequences for action in definite situations. In contrast to the post-modern "linguistic turn" in which language replaces activity, the pragmatist linkage of meaning to action points to the centrality of experience in realizing the mode of being projected by discourse. By stressing the interrelation of subject and object in definite situations, pragmatism avoids both the subjectivity inherent in the interpretive reliance on actors' perceptions and the false search for universal, abstract theory. The pragmatic emphasis on the consequences of ideas resolves the tension between relativism and objectivism in interpretation by its focus on theory and discourse as guides to action. /// Cet article critique les défis post-moderniste et interprétif au positivisme en incorporant le pragmatisme à la théorie sociologique. Comme méthode interprétative, le pragmatisme est fondé sur le principe que le sens des idées se retrouve dans leurs conséquences pour l'action dans les situations déterminées. Par contraste à la 'tournure linguistique' post-moderniste dans laquelle la langue remplace l'activité, la relation entre le sens et l'action suggérée par le pragmatisme indique la centralité de l'expérience dans la prise de conscience de soi projetée par le discours. En soulignant la relation réciproque entre le sujet et l'objet en situations déterminées, le pragmatisme évite la subjectivité inhérente dans la dépendance de la méthode interprétative sur les perceptions de l'acteur, ainsi que la recherche futile d'une théorie abstraite et universelle. L'importance que le pragmatisme porte sur la conséquence des idées résout la tension entre le relativisme et l'objectivisme de l'interprétation par sa concentration sur la théorie et le discours comme ~<br>

Author(s): Marcus Fred<br>
Abstract: This essay serves to introduce Jasper Johns' most recent series of paintings and, in particular, "Catenary (Manet-Degas)" of 1999 (Private collection). It does this with reference to the use that Johns made of a note from Marcel Duchamp's "Green Box" when, in 1959, he had to provide a statement about his art for inclusion in the catalogue that accompanied the 'Sixteen Americans' exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. Johns' use of this note is considered with regard to seeing and understanding "Flag" of 1954-55 (Museum of Modern Art, New York), "Souvenir" of 1964 (Collection of the artist on loan to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art), and "Catenary" (Manet-Degas). The essay insists on the distinction that can be made between the 'art object' and the 'work of art' and between the 'ordinary' or 'everyday self' of the artist who makes the former and the 'extraordinary self' of the artist that comes in place by way of the latter. In the work of art the human being tries 'to reach the Impossibility of a different way of being-in-the world and of being-at-one-with-itself'.<br>

Author(s): Felman François<br>
Abstract: Dans ce plaidoyer argumenté en faveur de l'histoire du temps présent, François Bédarida lève une à une les objections faites à ce champ historiographique regardé, quelquefois encore, avec suspicion. Cette notion de temps présent est définie dans une mise en perspective avec le passé et l'avenir. En définitive, l'historien, confronté à la mémoire immédiate des témoins, trouve dans le temps proche un terrain à la fois fragile et fécond. Depuis une vingtaine d'années, l'histoire du temps présent contribue au renouvellement du champ historiographique, tant par le regard qu'elle permet d'offrir sur la notion d'historicité que par la mise en œuvre de pratiques particulières. Les objections formulées à son égard sont cependant nombreuses: absence de recul, manque ou, au contraire, surabondance des sources, incomplétude de l'objet, flou sur la définition même du champ d'études. Or l'intérêt de l'étude du très contemporain réside justement dans la complexité des liens que le présent entretient avec le passé et l'avenir: un temps présent qui fait figure de trait d'union entre ces différentes temporalités à l'image d'un passeur ou d'un traducteur. Mais bâtir une histoire du temps récent ne consiste pas à faire œuvre de mémoire: si l'historien se nourrit des témoignages de ses contemporains, il exerce son regard critique sur eux et, tâche tout à fait inconfortable, fait œuvre d'explication en fonction d'un présent dont il est à la fois l'acteur et l'interprète. /// Over the last twenty years, the history of the present has renewed historiography through the vision it provides on the notion of historicity as well as by the implementation of particular practices. But there are many objections to it: a lack of distance; either a lack of or too many sources; the lack of completion of the object, blurriness about the very definition of the field of study. Nevertheless, the author suggests that the interest in the study of the contemporary dwells in the complexity of the links the pr~<br>

Issue: i371629<br>
Date: 1 1, 2000<br>
Author(s): Vindhya Srila<br>
Abstract: Marriage practices, the dynamics of interpersonal relationships and the politics of sexuality are relatively under-researched themes in the study of Bengali communism. Historical scholarship on the revolutionary politics of the extreme left Naxalbari andoian of the late 1960s-1970s, the object of this piece of study, is no exception. The article engages with women and men's narratives on the practice of 'revolutionary' marriage in the movement through the prism of contemporary popular memory studies and narrative analysis. Drawing on field interviews with middle-class male and female activists, the article draws attention to the contestatory nature of marriage in the collective memory of the movement. Narrative contestations over marriage in the Naxalite movement underscore, I argue, a tension between a Utopian ideal of transgressive interpersonal relations and dominant middle-class codes of sexual morality. At the same time, individual attempts to 'compose' (in storytelling) socially recognizable and acceptable subject positions are grounded upon the silencing and abjection of more risky memories. Given the discrepancies and contradictions within the narrative repertoire from which individuals construct their identities, these 'marriage stories' are a tremendous resource for investigating the politics of love, sexuality and subject-formation in middle-class Bengali society.<br>

Abstract: This introduction to the special issue of Human Studies on postphenomenology outlines specific developments which have led to this style of phenomenology. Postphenomenology adapts aspects of pragmatism, including its anti-Cartesian program against early modern subject/object epistemology. Postphenomenology retains and emphasizes the use of phenomenological variations as an analytic tool, and in practice postphenomenology takes what is commonly now called "an empirical turn," which deeply analyzes case studies or concrete issues under its purview.<br>

Publisher: Martinus Nijhoff Publishers<br>
Issue: i40010631<br>
Date: 3 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Svenaeus Fredrik<br>
Abstract: In this paper I develop a phenomenology of falling ill by presenting, interpreting and developing the basic model we find in Jean-Paul Sartre's Being and Nothingness (1956). The three steps identified by Sartre in this process are analysed, developed further and brought to a five- step model: (1) pre-reflective experience of discomfort, (2) lived, bodily discomfort, (3) suffered illness, (4) disease pondering, and (5) disease state. To fall ill is to fall victim to a gradual process of alienation, and with each step this alienating process is taken to a new qualitative level. Consequently, the five steps of falling ill have not only a contingent chronological order but also a kind of logical order, in that they typically presuppose each other. I adopt Sartre's focus on embodiment as the core ground of the alienation process, but point out that the alienation of the body in illness is not only the experience of a psychic object, but an experience of the independent life of one's own body. This facticity of the body is the result neither of the gaze of the other person, nor of a reflection adopting the outer perspective of the other in an indirect way, but is a result of the very otherness of one's own body, which addresses and plagues us when we fall ill. I use examples of falling ill and being a patient to show how a phenomenology of falling ill can be helpful in educating health-care personnel (and perhaps also patients) about the ways of the lived body.<br>

Abstract: This article aims to explore aspects of the construction by scientific practice of historical-cultural differences. It aims as well to suggest ways to approach ethnic phenomena considering the need to place them historically, and to focus the cultural and political dimensions in new terms; in the challenge that ethnicity represents to today's world. The confrontation with humanity as 'the others' that is talked about, is partial. It is not with all 'humanity' but only with a part of it—substantial indeed—, a 'humanity' with specifities placed in a world divided in ethnocentric and unequal modes. This is the world that Geertz embraces what is 'not properly ours.' We can ask ourselves what is exactly 'properly ours' for those who say it. I add some obvious but forgotten dimensions: the place of the observer, the characteristics of the society where the perceptions and construction of otherness originate and are reproduced. Nowadays the idea of the importance of the 'racial factor', is newly again reinforced. Like in the United States and now in Europe. These differences, more than having a physical or cultural referent, have to do with the dimension of power and with social differences. Ethnicity has never been translated in only one discourse. Therefore, ethnicity should be seen as a process whose meanings can only be understood in context, evolving in the course of history in the specific social circumstances of a given people. Even more, the development of ethnic and class processes in the same social formation adds to the complexity of ethnic processual nature. The articulation of these two processes—ethnicity and class— and their contradictions can only be aprehended by observing the historical dimension in which these take place. By underlining the temporal depth of social processes, the 'ethnographic present' is displaced from this centre of analysis to be come 'a moment' in this processual flow. From this perspective ethnic phenomena are not anymore mere 'acci~<br>

Abstract: Este estudo dedica-se à teoria da verdade tal como se apresenta nas obras de Ricoeur entre 1947 e 1960. Procura-se sublinhar o vaivém entre uma compreensão ontológica da verdade, marcada antes de mais pelo pensamento de Karl Jaspers (1947), e uma compreensão fenomenológica da verdade centrada na teoria do juízo (1960). Contudo a análise da tensão entre a unidade do verdadeiro e a multiplicidade das filosofias permite elaborar o conceito de verdade como comunicação e de verdade como objecto de esperança. Procura-se então mostrar o fundamento desta esperança bem como a dimensão pela qual ela ultrapassa o universo da filsosofia. A conclusão sublinha que os desenvolvimentos ulteriores de Ricoeur (1960-1989) sobre a hermenêutica do símbolo, da metáfora e da narrativa ganham em serem relidos no horizonte das tensões do problema da verdade. /// Cette étude est consacrée à la théorie de la vérité telle qu'elle se présente dans l'oeuvre de Ricoeur entre 1947 et 1960. On cherche à souligner le va-et-vient entre une compréhension ontologique de la vérité initielement influencée par la pensée de Karl Jaspers 1947, et une compréhension phénoménologique de la vérité centrée sur la théorie du jugement (1960). L'analyse de la tension entre l'unité du vrai et la multiplicité des philosophies débouche cependant sur le concept de vérité comme communication et comme object d'espérence. On cherche alors à montrer le fondement de cette espérance ainsi que la dimension par laquelle elle dépasse l'univers de la philosophie. La conclusion souligne que les développements ultérieurs de Ricoeur (1960-1989) sur l'herméneutique du symbole, de la métaphore et du récit ont tout à gagner à être replacés et relus à l'horizon des tensions du problème de la vérité. /// This study pays special attention to the theory of truth elaborated in Ricoeur's work from 1947 to 1960.

A teoria do conhecimento histórico ou epistemologia da História nao pode ser vista de modo linear ou unívoco porque tem sofrido mutações nos seus quadros conceptuais compáraveis às revoluções cientificas concebidas pelo filosofo e historiador das ciências Thomas Kuhn, destacando-se quatro paradigmas (continuando a usar a terminologia deste autor) do conhecimento histórico: o paradigma "omnicompreensivo", que visa compreender o sentido global da História e tem como representante máximo Hegel, retomado no contexto actual por Francis Fukuyama com a sua tese sobre o tlm da Historia: o paradigma positivista guiado por uma ideia de objectividade do conhecimento histórico hoje considerada redutora: o relativismo emergente com o "fim das grandes narrativas de legitimação do saber" e a fragmentação do sentido no pensamento pós-modemo; e a "História aberta" ao misterio do tempo, problematizadora, que constrói o seu objecto na complexidade da relação interdisciplinar com outros saberes, limitada aos instrumentos conceptuais ou técnicos do historiador e excedendo qualquer sistema conceptual fechado mas mantendo uma inquietacao metodologica orientada pela busca interminável de sentido. É este último paradigma -epistemológico, hermenêutico e histórico - que é defendido neste estudo. /// This essay deals with the relation between the philosophy of history and the epistemological problem of complexity.

Abstract: Although philosophers often focus on the essays of Leopold's Sand County Almanac, especially "The Land Ethic," there is also a normative argument present in the stories that comprise most of the book. In fact the shack stories may be more persuasive, with a subtlety and complexity not available in his prose piece. This paper develops a narrative ethics methodology gleaned from rhetoric theory, and current interest in narrative ethics among literary theorists, in order to discern the normative underpinnings of the stories in Part 1. The narrative ethics approach sidesteps the need to ground the land ethic in ethical theory—which has been a reconstructive and problematic task for the philosophical interpreters of Leopold—and suggests, instead, that it emerges in Leopold's very effort to narrate his, professional, personal, and practical experience with nature. The involves examining the stories in terms of their emotional, logical and performative aspects. The result is an analysis that shows not only how these stories express normative claims, but also justify them. One conclusion of the analyses is that, in the narratives, there is less emphasis on the problematic notion of an over-arching "community" than in the prose pieces, and more emphasis on the metaphor of other living things as "fellow travelers" in the "odyssey of evolution." Second, the narratives take on an ironic attitude toward the ecological order, less discernable in the prose essays. The order itself may not be ethically admirable, but should be preserved since it makes possible any ethical relations within it. Thus, the narrative reading suggests some temperance to the usual holistic interpretation of his land ethic and its concomitant criticisms especially the charge of ecofacism. We should not take the land ethic imperative at its face value, in the sense that the good of the order itself is an intrinsic good. In the narratives, individuals are shown not merely to be means to the ecological whole,~<br>

Abstract: À partir de la scène de mise en patrimoine d'une machine sidérurgique, un haut fourneau de « l'ancienne » Lorraine industrielle, cet article propose une analyse des conditions d'émergence et de stabilisation d'une catégorie patrimoniale récente, le patrimoine industriel, autrement dit du traitement en monument des restes de la seconde industrialisation. La patrimonialisation de tels restes est tout entière déterminée par l'évaluation de leur « comportement » aux différentes étapes de la « chaîne patrimoniale » -connaissance/conservation/valorisation -qui instruit le monument historique.Pour autant ce processus contribue en retour à la mise en question de ce mode de traitement et à l'invention de nouvelles stratégies culturelles. A blast furnace in « formerly » industrialized Lorraine is being presented as a monument belonging to France's national heritage. The conditions are analyzed for the emergence and stabilization of a recent category for classifying what remains from the second wave of industrialization as part of this heritage. This process is fully determined by assessing the object's « behavior » during various stages (knowledge, conservation, treasuring) in the « patrimonial chain » leading to its classification as a historical monument. In feedback, this process leads us to raise questions about handling such sites in this way and inventing cultural strategies.<br>

Abstract: Sowohl Ethnologie wie Soziologie werden durch die Globalisierung herausgefordert. Die vermeintlich abgeschlossenen fremden „Völker“ verschwinden; „Gesellschaft“ nationalstaatlich zu konzipieren, wird immer unplausibler. Eine (Wieder) Annäherung der beiden im neunzehnten Jahrhundert ausdifferenzierten Fächer tut Not. Taugt „Kultur“ dafür als Brückenbegriff? Soziologen wie Andreas Reckwitz werben für eine praxis-oder diskurstheoretische Reformulierung des Kulturkonzepts, tragen dabei aber auch zu einer problematischen, weil zu umfassenden „Kulturalisierung“ des Sozialen bei. Dagegen halten Ethnologen wie Adam Kuper oder Chris Hann den Kulturbegriff für so unrettbar reifiziert, diffus und machtblind, dass sie ihn lieber abschaffen oder doch umfassend „soziologisieren“ und durch eine präzisere Benennung der jeweils gemeinten symbolischen Codes oder sozialen Praktiken ersetzen wollen. Der vorliegende Artikel schließt sich eher den Skeptikern an und zeichnet aus dieser Perspektive die wichtigsten Stationen der „Entsoziologisierung“ des klassischen ethnologischen Kulturbegriffs und die neuere Kritik in der Ethnologie sowie Ansätze nach, Kultur als Arena von machtförmigen Aushandlungsprozessen zu begreifen. Anthropology and sociology are both challenged by globalisation. Supposedly self-sustaining peoples are rapidly disappearing, and attempts to conceptualize "society" within the parameters of the nation-state have proven themselves unfeasible. It is time to (re) consider the two disciplines that both took shape in the nineteenth century. Can 'culture' still serve as a bridge concept? Sociologists like Andreas Reckwitz have argued in favour of a discourse-and practise-oriented conception of culture, one, however, that entails difficulties of its own, as it leads to the complete culturalization of the social. Anthropologists such as Adam Kuper or Chris Hann, on the other hand, believe the concept of culture to be so reified, diffuse and blind to power relations that they wo~<br>

Abstract: It would seem to the purpose here to consider the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga in his relation to his fellow-historians, Robert Fruin and Jan Romein. For in this trio Huizinga contrasted with Fruin, and in his turn Romein contrasted with Huizinga, whereas, on the other hand, in spite of their different view-points, they are at the same time connected by the plainly unbroken line of liberal adogmatism. Fruin the father of Dutch historiography, was original in his liberal adogmatism. Not a single thesis, according to him, is to be carried into safety beforehand and exempted from investigation. Nothing is to be held up for acceptance without permission for examination. In demanding such blind acceptance one would be guilty of moral constraint and mental repression, a fault according to him especially committed by the Roman Catholic Church. In the long run this liberal and adogmatic inspiration of Fruin's came to run dry. With him the devices and the technique of research became ends in themselves. Fruin rationalized this development in the thesis that the disinterestedness with which we ought to strive after the truth would be tarnished if we were to expect from scholarly historical research any contribution whatsoever to the existential unfolding of the investigating subject. Huizinga's views on the theory of history constitute a violent reaction to this view. He argues that owing to the historian's selection of his material, as well as by the ideas through which the historian comprehends the historical process, subjectivity is unavoidable. Moreover, it is desirable. It is unscholariy, Huizinga says, to assume without evidence that the purification the subject desires to undergo by his adogmatic stand, should presuppose complete elimination—impossible in itself—of any subjective element whatsoever. The idea of objectivity, he says, should be broadened from a non-subjective objectivity, without evidence too narrowly conceived, per se unattainable, into an objectivity~<br>

Abstract: 1. La problématique née en philosophie par le structuralisme, se cristallise dans une confrontation de la linguistique et de la philosophie du langage. Toutes les sciences humaines modernes s'inscrivent en effet dans le programme d'une sémiologie, science globale de la signification des signes et construite sur le modèle de la sémantique, discipline traitant la signification du signe linguistique. C'est à propos du récit, et en particulier du récit littéraire, que nous opposons l'analyse structurale, mouvement destructif qui réduit la plénitude du sens, à l'herméneutique, „interprétation comme récollection du sens” (P. Ricoeur). La critique littéraire connaissait déjà l'étude immanente du récit littéraire. C'est à l'intérieur de la critique immanente qu'il faut opposer un courant où l'œuvre est considérée comme sujet (p.e. G. Poulet) à la tendance formalisante (nous pensons particulièrement à L. Spitzer et au New Criticism). Mais ce n'est que l'analyse structurale qui pousse au bout cette objectivation puisque elle n'est pas seulement classificatoire mais aussi réductioniste. 2. Nous supposons l'homologie totale de la littérature et du langage : le récit est un discours linguistique. La possibilité d'une étude structurale du récit dépend donc de la possibilité de la sémantique. On connaît les difficultés que cette science linguistique de la signification rencontre dans l'élaboration de sa méthode : ni l'analyse distributionnelle (Z. Harris), ni l'analyse sémique (A. Greimas) ne se déroulent complètement à l'intérieur de la linguistique. Ce n'est que la grammaire generative de N. Chomsky, cette syntaxe créatrice qui décrit les structures qui rendent possible toute signification sémantique, qui fait entrevoir une solution au problème. Cette étude de l'activité dynamique du langage ou des conditions de possibilité de la signification affirme la primauté de la syntaxe sur la sémantique. Le récit, comme chaque discours, est, quant à sa structure, analogique et homologiqu~<br>

Abstract: To see, to speak, to think : these are the three main topics of Merleau-Ponty's philosophy, tragically interrupted in 1961. He intended to write two works on The Origin of Truth. To understand the relationship between Merleau-Ponty I and Merleau-Ponty II it is a good lead to pay attention to the relationship between seeing, speaking and thinking. In a central passage of Phenomenology of Perception (p. 451) this relationship is called Fundierung. Merleau-Ponty conceives it as a two way relationship, which excludes every possibility of reducing one term (thinking, reason) to another (perception, language). Yet, at that time he is not able to point out clearly the originality of thinking. L'Oeil et l'Esprit and Le Visible et l'Invisible provide a first outline of l'Origine de la Vérité. The 'second' Merleau-Ponty wants to 'reassume' his whole philosophy in what he calls : fundamental thinking. Painting opens the way to the mystery of seeing : something visible begins to see. Subject and object are no longer opposed to one another ; not even related by intentionality. The new key-word is Ineinander (interrelatedness, to be in one another, chiasm). 'La chair' (the flesh) is a new notion, broader and more fundamental than the body. The sensible reflects upon itself. This 're-flection' (reflexivity or reversibility) is a work of Being. The visible can be seen in principle. Philosophy should accompany the coming-to-see of the visible. In this perspective the transition to thinking (or ideality) must be seen as a new case of 'reversibilité'. The generality of the visible opens up to the 'invisible', that which in principle cannot be seen, but is 'the other side' of the visible. The basic phenomenon of expression is central here. Language is not an absolute starting point. Language is rather a new and more subtile form of coporeity, a new instance of the same basic reversibility, which already contains the seeds of ideality (logos endiathetor). The idea is of the word (logos ~<br>

Abstract: In this paper a distinction is made between two conceptions of the ego in freudian metapsychology. According to the first conception, a conception which Freud never gave up, the ego is conceived as a specific function on the surface of the living organism ; it is the result of a progressive differentiation of the Id ('Es') under the driving power of internal stimuli and external reality. Fitted with specific neutral, i.e. non-conflictual functions as perception, memory, control of the bodily motions and consciousness, the ego has to defend the individual as a biological living organism against the threats from without and within. In this conception the ego is treated as an instance that doesn't take part in the different psychic conflicts. We analyse the philosophical presuppositions and show the metapsychological disadvantages of this hypothesis that has been worked out especially in the American ego-psychology. According to the second conception, that takes into account important clinical pheno mena as identification, idealisation, narcissism, ideal of the ego, the ego is conceived as a metaphorical effect of a specific psychic act. With Lacan, we try to analyse and to interpret this specific act as an act that causes an infinite splitting in the ego : the ego is constituted as a subject that from its origin is separated from itself. Instead of being a biological function that lives in the immediate metonymical prolongiation of the living organism, it rather has to defend a certain representation of himself. This point of view doesn't exclude a purely functional description of the ego ; but the different functions have now to be interpreted differently because the ego is the effect of conflicts in which it takes part (consciousness is interlaced with unconsciousness, perception with denying...). In the last part of our study we show how Freud makes the philosophically important distinction between the ego as an object of the Id and the ego as a subject that has to~<br>

Abstract: At the heart of this article is a structural approach to narrative, based on the work of Propp, Labov, van Dijk, Halliday, and others. The article highlights the structural features of narrative—basically, the organization of the genre around the semantic template actor-action-actor (syntactically rendered as subject-verb-object but where, in narrative, the subject is typically a social actor and the verb a social action) and the modifiers of each element of this triplet, such as time and space of action—and shows how to implement this structure in a computer environment and how to use this methodological tool in socio-historical research (namely, the rise of Italian fascism, 1919-22). But, taking a cue from Halliday's cover jacket of his An Introduction to Functional Grammar, with its representation of a color circle, the paper takes the reader on an intellectual journey from Newton to Goethe—and the quality versus quantity debate—to Goethe and Propp, to end, back home, with Simmel and Weber.<br>

Abstract: Entrepris depuis un quart de siècle, le démantèlement de l'industrie lourde lorraine (mines et sidérurgie) touche à sa fin. À partir de la comparaison entre le dernier événement en date, la fermeture spectaculaire de la dernière mine de charbon, et la mise en scène, une décennie plus tôt, de la dernière coulée d'une usine de la Lorraine sidérurgique, l'auteur s'interroge sur les finalités patrimoniales de telles célébrations. Présentant quelques moments du traitement culturel — patrimonial, mémoriel... — de la crise industrielle lorraine, depuis les symptômes photographiques d'une mémoire empêchée jusqu'au musée très « contrôlé » en passant par la monumentalisation controversée de restes industriels, il met l'accent sur la lutte des représentations qui se noue autour de la construction de la « Lorraine industrielle » en objet-frontière patrimonial. Cet article souhaite ainsi contribuer à une anthropologie politique de l'institution de la mémoire. The dismantling of the heavy industry in Lorraine that is under way since a quarter of century (mines and iron and steel industry) is nearing its end. When comparing the latest event — the spectacular closure of the last coalmine — with the staging of the last casting in an iron and steel factory of Lorraine ten years earlier the author questions about the patrimonial aims of such celebrations. He shows some sequences of the cultural treatment (patrimonial, memorial) of the industrial crisis in Lorraine, from the photographic « symptoms » of a hindered memory to the highly « controlled » museum and to the industrial remains turned into historic buildings, a largely controversial fact. In this context he stresses the conflicting representations of « industrial Lorraine » as a patrimonial Boundary Object (abstract or concrete, that several actors can appropriate as they like). This article is meant to contribute to a political anthropology of memory institution. Die Zerschlagung der lothringischen Schwerindustrie (Bergwerken ~<br>

Abstract: Pour perpétuer des éléments fondateurs de la culture, les communautés des diasporas utilisent leur espace privé comme territoire privilégié de la conservation et de l'expression d'une identité exilée. L'exemple des Arméniens du Québec est, à cet égard, particuliérement révélateur tant dans la composition de sa culture matérielle et immatérielle que dans les pratiques qui la mettent en scène par l'entremise de petits musées domestiques. À partir d'un recueil de récits de vie et de biographies d'objets, l'article propose d'établir le portrait de ces structures muséales et de leurs collections à l'échelle familiale pour ensuite saisir leur oeuvre dans le projet de transmission culturelle. Living in a Diaspora commands an increased vigilance for the perpetuation of the founding elements of a culture. In this perspective, in a host country, the private sphere and its heritage constitute a privileged space for the preservation and expression of the exiled identity. This can be seen in domestic museums, such as those of Quebec's Armenian community, where the composition of material and immaterial culture and the presentation of its contents are particularly revealing. From a collection of life narratives and object biographies, this article proposes to draw a portrait of these family-scale museum structures and their collections to understand how they function in the project of cultural transmission. Um elementare Bestandteile ihrer Kultur zu erhalten, nutzen kulturelle Gemeinschaften in der Diaspora gerne den privaten Raum als Statte des Ausdrucks ihrer Exilidentität. Die Gemeinschaft der in Quebec lebenden Armenier ist hierfür ein sehr gutes Beispiel, sowohl was ihre materielle und immaterielle Kultur angeht als auch im Hinblick auf die Art und Weise wie sie ihre Kultur in kleinen hauslichen Museen inszenieren.

Abstract: Au Brésil, le récit officiel concernant la mémoire de l'esclavage différe nettement de la vision des leaders du mouvement noir contemporain, notamment à propos de la situation et des conditions de vie des Afro-Brésiliens à Rio de Janeiro. Ce mouvement demande à l'État et à la société brésilienne de reconnaître les conditions misérables dans lesquelles les esclaves ont été laissés après l'abolition de l'esclavage, mais aussi la contribution des esclaves à la construction de la société, de l'économie et de la culture brésiliennes et enfin le racisme dont les Afro-Brésiliens sont encore l'objet. Aujourd'hui, des décisions juridiques tendent à favoriser une égalité effective, permettant ainsi l'émergence d'une image positive de la culture afro-brésilienne. This article discusses the difference between the official account on the memory of slavery in Brazil and how contemporary black movement's leaders, notably in Rio de Janeiro, see the Afro-Brazilians' situation and living conditions. This movement, which seeks to reveal in public space the memory of slavery and its consequences, claims Brazilian State and society to recognize not only the miserable conditions under which former slaves were left after the abolition of slavery, but the contribution of the slaves to the construction of Brazilian society, economy and culture and also that Afro-Brazilians are still the object of racism. If in today's Brazil, the public debate on reparations comprises a legal aspect of rectification, by creating measures aiming to provide effective equality, this discussion also takes the form of symbolic fight, in which one of the objectives is to build a positive image of the Afro-Brazilian culture. In Brasilien weicht die offizielle Berichterstattung über die Wahrnehmung der Sklaverei vor allem in Bezug auf die Situation und Lebensbedingungen der Afro-Brasilianer in Rio de Janeiro stark ab von der Sichtweise der Führer der zeitgenössischen « Schwarzen-Bewegung ».

Abstract: In 1758, Mary Jemison was captured by a party of Indians and adopted by two Seneca sisters. She progressively accommodated herself to Indian life, married two Indian warriors and bore them several children. Sixty-five years after her abduction, the woman agreed to tell James E. Seaver the story of her life. My goal is to use Lorrayne Carroll's rhetorical drag as a hermeneutic to analyze authorial impersonation in A Narrative of the Life of Mrs Mary Jemison, to underline the failure of the white male impersonator to marginalize the speaking voice of the narrative and to highlight the capacity of the I object/subject to destabilize canonical readings of the text and to offer a revisionist history of cross-cultural encounters. Thus, it is my intention to present this account as an instrument of defiance of hegemonic cultural models and as an example of how intercultural manifestations negotiate and hybridise fixed paradigms. En 1758, Mary Jemison fue capturada por un grupo de indios y adoptada por dos hermanas Seneca. Poco a poco, Mary se fue adaptando a la vida india y acabó casándose con dos guerreros indios con los que tuvo varios hijos. Sesenta y cinco años después de su secuestro, la mujer accedió a contarle a James E. Seaver la historia de su vida. Mis objetivos son: analizar El relato de la vida de la señora Mary Jemison mediante el concepto de máscara retórica acuñado por Lorrayne Carroll; destacar el fracaso del imitador hombre y blanco para marginalizar la voz narrativa; y subrayar la capacidad del yo objeto/sujeto para desestabilizar lecturas canónicas del texto y ofrecer una historia revisionista de los encuentros interculturales. Es mi intención presentar este relato como un desafío a los modelos culturales hegemónicos y como ejemplo de cómo las manifestaciones interculturales negocian y combinan paradigmas establecidos.<br>

Abstract: Dans cet article, nous évoquerons la question des témoignages de la Shoah et des circonstances de leur énonciation. A cet effet, nous décrirons cet objet sociodiscursif particulier qu'est le témoignage, en détaillant ses composantes définitoires (certification autobiographique, pacte de référentialité, portée collective, etc.), en réfléchissant sur les conditions de son accréditation et en le comparant aux autres modalités et stratégies discursives (discours de l'historien, récit littéraire, etc.) utilisées pour transmettre cette réalité extrême et non partagée de la déportation et de l'expérience concentrationnaire. In this paper, I focus on the question of the testimonies of the Shoah and the circumstances of their creation. The testimony, a specific sociodiscursive object, is described by detailling its defining elements (autobiographical certification, referentiality pact, collective thrust, etc.), by reflecting on the conditions of its accreditation and by comparing it to the other discursive modalities and strategies (the discourse of the historian, literary accounts, etc.) used to convey the extreme and unshared reality of deportation and the experience of concentration camps.<br>

Publisher: University of Wisconsin Press<br>
Issue: i40055887<br>

Author(s): Ruf Oliver<br>
Abstract: The essay discusses the different facets of liminality and mnemonic in Ralf Rothmann's novels Stier (1991), Wäldernacht (1994), Milch und Kohle (2000), and Junges Licht (2004). From this perspective, Rothmann's narrative prose belongs to a number of contemporary German novels which break with traditional concepts of cultural thresholds: above and beyond this performance, the retrospective coupling of individual 'Ruhr' biographies and shared German history is the object of literary reflection. Rothmann's novels raise the issue of the special mnemotic gestures and historical semantics which are associated with the 'Ruhr-Gebiet' as a catalyst of liminality. Besides, the literary historical connections to metaphors of mining are central for Rothmann's prose. They can be given profile by discussing the ethnological and anthropological theories of Arnold van Gennep and Victor Turner. In the end the fiction of liminality and the mnemonic techniques emerge as a highly ambivalent code for the expression of social transformation.<br>

Publisher: Philosophy Documentation Center<br>
Issue: i40063571<br>
Date: 1 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Casler Kenneth<br>
Abstract: By deliberately placing ethics under the category of communication, Kierkegaard intended to show that it is like no other science. He distinguished between direct communication and indirect communication. Direct communication concerns objectivity and knowledge; indirect communication, on the other hand, has to do with subjectivity ("becoming-subject"). In this paper, the author presents Kierkegaard's philosophy of communication and ethics with special emphasis on his irony and pseudonymous authorship. He also examines the possibility of a discourse in business ethics, focusing on the educational perspective. He discusses Kierkegaard's aspects of communication—the communicator, the receiver, and the object—with particular reference to applied ethics. He argues that the Kierkegaardian notion of indirect communication can contribute to renewing business ethics teaching—which in his view is more art than science—in two important ways: (1) when the ethics teacher changes his position in the teacher/learner relationship; and (2) when the relationship between communicator/receiver is strengthened at the expense of the object.<br>

Publisher: University of Colorado<br>
Issue: i40067568<br>
Date: 5 1, 1992<br>
Author(s): Schmölders Claudia<br>
Abstract: Das Mārchen als Psychologe— Eine Hommage an Max Lüthi This essay was wtitten in honor of Max Lūthi, the renowned Swiss folklorist, who died in 1991. The starting point is an article by Lüthi in which he coined the term "the fairy tale as psychologist." In contrast to the psychoanalytic approach of Freudians and Jungians, Schmölders demonstrates how Lüthi drew a line between literature and psychology in his works. First, Lüthi studied the hero in the fairy tale from an anthropomorphological viewpoint. Second, Lūthi analyzed the style of fairy tales by examining the moral, aesthetic, and economic aspects of the action. Third, Lūthi also dealt with "the legend as psychologist." Using Lüthi's notions, Schmōlders stresses the dialogic strategies and anthropomorphological concerns of the tales within the domain of psychological object-relations theory, and it is in this regard that Lūthi's term "the fairy tale as psychologist" assumes its importance.<br>

Abstract: O artigo é uma leitura do debate epistemológico sobre as condições de conhecimento na antropologia. Partindo das críticas que o próprío C. Geertz faz a seus seguidores, a autora se propõe a avaliar o potencial crítico da hermenêutica. Recupera seu questionamento acerca da oposiçâo sujeito/objeto e propõe a busca de uma objetividade negociada interpares e situada historicamente. A partir desse debate questiona-se uma ciência pura e sem implicações práticas e morais. O percurso que faz avaliando vários autores lhe permite concluir que o excesso de relativismo ou de subjetivismo transforma toda possibilidade de ciência em ficção. Para dar conta em sua etnografia dos sistemas simbólicos não lingüísticos, a autora busca um diálogo entre a teoría antropológica e as teorias nativas e afirma que é na experiência vivida em campo que está a fertilidade das perguntas e reformulações de conceitos da antropologia. This article is an attempt to interpret the epistemological debate concerning conditions of knoledge in antropology. Discussing the criticism which C. Geertz has made in regard to the work of his followers, the autor proposes to evaluate the critical potential of hermeneutics. A critique of the subject-object split opens the way for proposing a form of objectivity wich is historically located and negotiated among equals. This debate constitutes a point os departure for questioning the notion of a pure science devoid of moral and practical implications. In the course of discussing a number of authors, the conclusion may well be that excessive relativism and subjectivism transform all possibilities of science into fiction. In order to deal with nonlinguistic symbolic systems in etnography, the author sees the importance of dialogue between anthropological theory and native theory. Fertile grounds for raising questions and reformulating anthropological concepts are found in fieldword experience.<br>

Abstract: O objetivo deste artigo é apresentar os significados atribuídos pelos muçulmanos à matança do carneiro, que acontece todos os anos na Festa do Sacrifício (Eid Al-Adha), a segunda maior da religião islâmica. Para dar conta desses significados, lanço mão da teoria winnicottiana do não-eu, expressão esta também cunhada na forma de não não-eu por Richard Schechner para tratar da atuação do ator. O artigo explora a idéia de que o carneiro ocupa o lugar do fiel que se entrega a Deus, estabelecendo uma analogia entre o sacrifício do carneiro e o sacrifício daquele que é muçulmano. In this article I would like to explore the multiples senses that muslins attributes to the sacrificial goat at the Feast of Sacrifice, Eid Adhha, one of the most important celebrations of the Islamic calendar, second only to Ramadan. This sacrifice is here analyzed from the perspective of D.W. Winnicott's psychoanalytical theory, as a sort of transitional object, "not me" and "not not me", the latest also supported by Richard Schechner when focuses the actor's experience. The idea developed here is to demonstrate that the goat occupies the devotee's place and establish an analogy between the goat sacrifice and the sacrifice of the one that is a muslin.<br>

Date: 12 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Longhi Julien<br>
Abstract: We analyse the French noun livre « book » according to an argumentative conception of language. A summary is presented of the theories of Anscombre (Theory of stereotypes) and of Carel and Ducrot (Theory of semantic blocks), which are used to reveal the argumentative dimensions of livre. Argumentation is argued to derive from a common sense system (Sarfati) leading to the ascription of doxa in language governed by a topohbased device, which corresponds to discursive object. Semiotisation is supported by phenomenological processes: the Indexicality of meaning (Lebas 1999, Cadiot and Visetti 2001) is concerned at the Linguistic level with the construction of semantic forms along three dimensions of meaning, known in the Theory of semantic forms as motifs, profiles, and themes. The contributions of the discursive levels to the constitution of a semantic form are raised in view of the phenomenon of lexical anticipation. What we call "inserted motifs" reveals the genericity of Discursive Formations. In the course of "profiling", these motifs constitute a pre-syntactic zone of stabilisation. The "doxic profiles" allows the construction of topoï by thematisation.<br>

Abstract: Butor's book corresponds to a transitory phase in the history of books, in which appear both a reflection on the nature of the book as object and a desire to introduce "fracture" and "mobility" within narrative. Three aspects are of principle interest: the relationship between the "mobile" text and its medium, the "book" as deconstructed by its writing; the importance of the text's visual aspect in a Mallarmean tradition which also resonates with the work of Calder and Pollock; the displacement of narrative towards litany and spatial forms which undo the usual métonymie links of the text. In toto, the book qua book appears as the locus for a conflict between destruction and re-creation, spatialisation and linearity, order and disorder, which prefigures computer hypertextuality.<br>

Abstract: À La Réunion, l'école de la Troisième République s'est investie dans un processus d'acculturation nationale où les valeurs patriotiques et civiques ont été mises à l'honneur. L'affermissement du sentiment d'appartenance nationale s'est donc inscrit progressivement dans un patrio-bellicisme et dans une reconnaissance des bienfaits de la Nation pour les jeunes élèves de la colonie. Le lycée de Saint-Denis, établissement modèle accueillant les élites réunionnaises, a été l'objet à cet égard d'une attention particulière de la part des autorités coloniales. Durant la remise des prix effectuée chaque année avant les vacances scolaires, les élèves recevaient ainsi une dernière leçon édifiante d'instruction civique rappelant les fondements de la Nation et les devoirs inhérents au patriotisme. In Reunion Island, the School system of the Third Republic initiated a process of national cultural integration in which patriotic and civic values were promoted. As a result, the strengthened feeling of national belonging gradually developed into a patriotic/warmongering spirit and the recognition of the benefits brought by the nation in the minds of the young students of the colony. The Saint-Denis upper secondary school, a model school in which the colony elite studied, was therefore the object of particular attention from colonial authorities. Thus, during the prize ceremony held each year before the holiday break, pupils were taught a final lesson of civic responsibility with a reminder of the foundations of the nation and the duties inherent to patriotism. Auf der Insel Réunion, hat die Schule der Dritten Republik ein nationaler Akkulturationsprozess entwickelt, der die staatlich-patriotischen Werte in den Vordergrund brach. Die Befestigung des nationalen Zugehörigkeitsgefühls fällt dadurch schrittweise in einen kriegerischen Patriotismus und in die Erkennung der Wohltaten der Nation zugunsten der jungen Schüler der Kolonie.

Abstract: The study deals with the problem of Stephen Greenblatt's approaches to an analysis of literary work. The author analyzes Greenblatt's concepts of interpretation of literary work and notices the dangerous results of such interpretations in which literary work as a specifical esthetical object is dissolved in the wide frame of cultural history. On the other hand, he tries to represent how Greenblatt's looking for historical context via permanent negotiation with the texts and reading of textual traces can enriches the work of literary historian.<br>

Author(s): Levy Lior<br>
Abstract: The article advances an interpretation of the self as an imaginary object. Focusing on the relationship between selfhood and memory in Sartre's The Transcendence of the Ego, I argue that Sartre offers useful resources for thinking about the self in terms of narratives. Against interpretations that hold that the ego misrepresents consciousness or distorts it, I argue that the constitution of the ego marks a radical transformation of the conscious field. To prove this point, I turn to the role of reflection and memory in the creation of the self. Reflection and memory weave past, present and future into a consistent and meaningful life story. This story is no other than the self. I propose to understand the self as a fictional or imaginary entity, albeit one that has real presence in human life.<br>

Abstract: This article is concerned with the ways in which people who work in and use a cancer genetics clinic in the UK talk about the 'gene for cancer'. By conceptualizing such a gene as a boundary object, and using empirical data derived from clinic consultations, observations in a genetics laboratory and interviews with patients, the author seeks to illustrate how the various parties involved adopt different discursive strategies to appropriate, describe and understand what is apparently the 'same' thing. The consequent focus on the ways in which the rhetorical and syntactical features of lay and professional talk interlink and diverge illustrates not merely how our contemporary knowledge of genes and genetics is structured, but also how different publics position themselves with respect to the biochemistry of life.<br>

Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113399<br>
Date: 4 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Haney David P.<br>
Abstract: In the apostrophe to "Imagination" in The Prelude, Book 6, a multileveled usurpation occurs which challenges the rhetorical foundation of Wordsworth's poem. The force of will exhibited in this passage is a paradoxical combination of actively exerted power and effortlessness, forced interruption and passively suffered usurpation, in which both the agent and the object of usurpation are put into question. The essential trope in this gesture is the anomalous figure of catachresis, whose uneasy place in eighteenth-century rhetorical classifications resulted from its combination of absolute propriety and absolute impropriety. For Wordsworth, this trope reveals the paradoxical connection between the powerful ground of the imagination's proper being and the abyss of loss and impropriety which threatens the imaginative will.<br>

Author(s): Ryan Marie-Laure<br>
Abstract: Narratology has explored in depth the modes of narration, but it has left largely untouched the question of the modes of narrativity. This term designates the various ways in which narrative structures are realized in texts. To call a novel or short story narrative is an entirely different matter from that of applying the same term to a lyric poem or a drama. The study of the modes of narrativity attempts to answer the question: what does it mean to say "this text is narrative"? As a cognitive category necessary to the proper understanding of a work, the narrative structure of a text may be compared to the identifiable shape of an object in a visual artwork. Thus, various modes of narrative may be compared to a type of picture or visual phenomenon.<br>

Abstract: Applied to Chaucer's Miller's Tale, A. J. Greimas's various analytic systems—the structure of roles or acteurs, the plots of struggle and exchange of objects, and the semiotic square—reveal Alison as an unchanging, passive object who is passed from her husband John to her lover Nicholas (and potentially to another lover, Absolon). But the application of Claude Bremond's more dynamic functional model reveals not only the story's symmetrical paradigms of seduction, retribution, and dissimulation but also the importance of the last of these isotopies and, above all, the central activity of Alison as seducer, dissimulator, and degrader.<br>

Author(s): Christoff Daniel<br>
Abstract: La signe comme expression (Husserl) consiste selon F. de Saussure dans le rapport immotivé signifíant-signifíé, sa valeur signifiante étant déterminée par la place du signifiant dans le système réel de la langue tandis que le signifié-concept (de Saussure) est noème, irréel (Husserl). Inerte tant qu'aucun acte d'expression ou de compréhension ne l'anime (ré-anime), il porte, exprime et induit l'intentionnalité de ces actes; il est conscience hors de soi, intentionnalité sans sujet, visée du signifié différenciée par son signifiant (objet d'une science de faits, la linguistique). Aussi les problèmes du «sujet», de l' «origine», de la «suffisance» du signe adéquat, de l'«insuffisance» du signe qui, en son ouverture, exprime au-delà de lui-même, exigent-ils l'élucidation du champ de signification, notamment des figures métonymiques ou métaphoriques qui y apparaissent. According to F. de Saussure a sign or an expression (Husserl) is constituted by the unmotivated relation between the signifier and the signified, the value of the signifier is determined by the position it occupies in the real system of language, while the signified concept (de Saussure) is a noema, i.e. unreal (Husserl). Inactive, as long as there is no act of expression or understanding to (re) activate it, the concept carries the intentionality of these acts, conveys it and leads us to it. It constitutes a consciousness outside of the self, an intentionality without a subject, a target of the signified, as differentiated by the signifier (the object of a science, the linguistics). In this sense the solution to the problems concerning the «subject», the «origin», the «sufficiency» of an adequate sign, the «insufficiency» of a sign, when it signifies things other than itself, requires the clarification of the idea of a field of meaning, especially the meaning of occurring metonymies and metaphors. Das Zeichen als Ausdruck (Husserl) besteht nach F. de Saussure in der unmotivierten Beziehung Bezeichnendes-~<br>

Abstract: Afin de justifier l'élaboration et l'usage d'une phénoménologie de l'imagination poétique, on montrera comment le langage poétique permet selon le mot de P. Ricoeur « d'articuler une expérience fictive » en dégageant l'« illusion » qui s'attache à la lecture de l'objet poétique. Avec Bachelard on verra comment l'image poétique apparaît comme une aurore de parole et un être nouveau. On verra comment le phénoménologue n'oublie jamais que l'expérience poétique situe le poème dans « le pays de la vérité » et s'efforce de le saisir comme essence, Wesenschau. Mais comme d'autre part une illusion fondamentale s'attache à la lecture de l'œuvre poétique, on évoquera la pensée de Nietzsche qui se déploie dans le jeu de l'illusion et de la vérité. L'artiste est cet illusionniste sublime qui nous fait sentir comme réel le monde des phénomènes. On terminera par une définition du poète comme celui qui nomme et par sa nomination fait être, fait l'Être apparaissant et transparent. To justify a phenomenology of poetic imagination we show how through poetical language a fictitious experience can be articulated, as says P. Ricoeur, by sifting out the « illusion » which pertains to the reading of the poetical object. According to Bachelard poetical image appears as a dawn of words and a new being. The phenomenologist never forgets that according to poetical experience a poem dwells in the « land of truth » and should be grasped as an essence, « Wesenschau ». But, as a fundamental illusion clings to the reading of a poetical work, we shall remember Nietzsche whose thought dwells in the play of illusion and truth. Thanks to the artist as a sublime conjurer we feel real the world of phenomena. To end, a poet is someone who names and, by doing so, makes being appearing and transparent.<br>

Abstract: Voulant résoudre l'énigme de la connaissance, Husserl est aux prises, dans Expérience et Jugement, avec la genèse transcendantale des formes predicatives. Celles-ci renvoient à la structure de l'expérience sensible dans sa double dimension : passive et active. C'est activement que le sujet percevant saisit et « détaille » un objet perçu en ses moments déterminants (ex.« une boule sphérique et rouge »). Au cours de l'expérience sensible se constituent des « types » qui rendent possible la reconnaissance d'un objet sous telle ou telle catégorie. Sur ce trajet, non exempt de seuils à franchir, qui va du « sens » perçu à la signification langagière, nous essayons de montrer quelle place pourrait être assignée à la nomination dans une perspective husserlienne. In his attempt to resolve the enigma of knowledge, in Experience and Judgement Husserl undertakes the task of describing the transcendantal genesis of the predicative forms. These forms refer back to the structures of receptivity with its two dimensions, passive and active. The perceiver actively grasps and « details » the perceived object in its determining moments (parts or qualities : « spherical », « red » ...). Throughout sensible experience « types » and « typical structures » are constituted, which make possible the recognition of an objet under this or that category. On the way, not without crossing certain thresholds, going from the perceived « sense » to the linguistically expressed meaning, we try to show which place may be assigned to naming within the framework of an Husserlian phenomenology.<br>

Abstract: Cet article prend appui sur une enquête ethnographique de longue durée au sein d'un syndicat local de cheminots CFDT. Il s'inscrit dans une problématique constructiviste, envisageant la réalité sociale comme une construction historique et quotidienne des acteurs sociaux. Il tente plus précisément, dans ce cadre et à partir de matériaux empiriques, de réévaluer, à propos de l'univers syndical, les rapports entre connaissance savante et connaissance ordinaire ; d'où la notion d'epistemologie ordinaire du syndicalisme qui prend pour objet tout à la fois les sociologies des chercheurs professionnels et les sociologies mises en œuvre quotidiennement par les acteurs syndicaux. Il se démarque alors tant de la tradition de la rupture épistémologique entre travail scientifique et savoirs ordinaires que de la tendance à l'indifférenciation des pratiques savantes et ordinaires propre à l'ethnométhodologie. This article is based on a long range ethnographie survey within a CFDT local railway workers' union. It follows a constructivist problematics line, considering social reality as a daily and historical construction by social actors. More precisely, it attempts, within this framework and starting from empirical material, to reassess, in the trade union universe, the relation between scholarly and ordinary knowledge, which leads to the concept of an ordinary epistemology of trade unionism. The object of this is both the sociology of professional researchers and the sociology used daily by trade unionists. It is different both from the tradition of the epistemological break between scientific and ordinary knowledge and from the tendency to the indifferentiation of scholarly and ordinary practices proper to ethnomethodology.<br>

Abstract: Depuis une vingtaine d'années, la notion d'identité a été de plus en plus fréquemment utilisée dans des travaux portant sur la musique, sans que le sens qui lui est donné et les fonctions qui lui sont attribuées soient toujours précisément définis. Cet article voudrait contribuer à clarifier les rapports qu'entretiennent musique et configuration identitaire. Sur la base de travaux portant tant sur la théorie des identités que sur les identités en musique, il suggère que les significations sociales, donc identitaires, de la musique doivent être appréhendées dans les relations entre production, réception et matière musicale elle-même. La musique n'étant pas un langage mais un système symbolique aux interprétants infinis, elle est susceptible d'un grand nombre d'interprétations variables selon les situations et les enjeux; son utilisation en politique suppose par conséquent des opérations de façonnage spécifiques. For the past twenty years, studies of music have used more and more frequently the notion of identity. Yet the meanings given to "identity" in these studies, and the functions ascribed to it, have not always been precisely defined. This paper tries to clarify the relationship between music and identity configurations. Based on studies dealing with the theory of identity and with musical identities, it suggests that the social significations of music -identitarian significations included - must be understood as resulting from the intertwining of production, reception and the musical object itself. Music is not a language, but a symbolical system whose interprétants are infinite, it can consequently generate many diverse interpretations, which vary according to situations and stakes, and it needs to be specifically fashioned to be put to political uses.<br>

Abstract: A ideia de máquina ultrapassa as suas concretizações materiais sugerindo um certo tipo de objetividade e autonomia, inerente ao funcionamento de sistemas como o Direito. A conceção do Direito como uma espécie de máquina jurídica é ambivalente, mostrando tanto a imparcialidade do Direito como as suas perversões anti-humanas. A relação entre mente e corpo é central no Direito da responsabilidade, sugerindo, porém, uma máquina humana em que a responsabilidade corresponde apenas a uma técnica de preservação de um sistema. A pessoa, todavia, não tem de ser reduzida a um algoritmo como diz Penrose. É a configuração do objeto do Direito que o reduz a um funcionamento limitado e incapaz de uma justiça criativa. A redefinição do objeto humano no Direito reclama um novo pensamento, associado aos conhecimentos não jurídicos sobre o comportamento humano. The idea of machine exceeds its material embodiments suggesting a certain kind of objectivity and autonomy inherent to the functioning of systems such as Law. The conception of Law as a kind of legal machine is ambivalent, showing both the impartiality of the law as their anti-human perversions. The relationship between mind and body is central to the law of responsibility, even though suggesting a human machine on which liability is merely a technique for preserving a system. The person, however, need not be reduced to an algorithm as Penrose says. It is the configuration of the object of knowledge as a system identical to a machine and the subjects of norms as human machines which reduces it to a limited and incapable of running a creative justice. The redefinition of the human object in Law calls for a new thinking, not necessary associated with the legal knowledge about human behavior.<br>

Author(s): Heathcote Owen<br>
Abstract: This article considers the changing relationship between Balzac and theory from the 1970s onwards when Balzac was a favoured, if disparaged, object of theorization, as in Barthes s S/Z. More recent critics, however, see the multi-layered énunciations of/in his texts as evidence of their ability to theorize their own relationship to history, society, sexuality — and literature. In the same way, moreover, as texts such as Sarrasine and Une passion dans le désert critique their own relation to literature, ostensibly theoretical Balzac texts such as Une théorie de la démarche turn theory into a form of fiction. Whether moving from literature to theory or from theory to literature, Balzac — or 'Balzac'/Balzac — is thus shown to be (at) a nexus of literature, theory and literary theory.<br>

Issue: i40128002<br>
Date: 1 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Daniels John<br>
Abstract: Desire is examined here with a view to informing a theological response to capitalism. The notion of mimetic desire offered by René Girard is used as a starting point, Girard's ideas being brought into critical engagement with, first, other intersubjective accounts, namely those offered by Alexandre Kojève and by psychoanalysis in its Freudian and Lacanian variants; and then the account of desire as productive becoming offered by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, in which the link to capitalism is explicit. It is suggested that both mimetic desire and its productive counterpart can be understood as asserting the priority of desire itself over both subject and object. The possibilities for framing a coherent theological account of desire which is both mimetic and productive are then assessed with reference to Bernard of Clairvaux, Aquinas and Augustine, noting that accepting a metaphysics of participation makes plausible a productive desire which is nonetheless coded as a mimesis of the divine precedent. Such a conclusion brings into relief the inevitable difficulty of reconciling Christian and capitalist economies of desire.<br>

Abstract: The text aims at considering from various points of view the presence of the value of truth in the work of art. The first step is a phenomenological analysis of epistemológical, ontological and aesthetic phenomena connected with perception of the work of art. Its conclusion is the statement that truth belongs to the characteristics of both creation (contents, structure) and reception (cognition of various aspects) of the work. The very fact that the aesthetic value of the object claiming to be beautiful can be discussed proves the presence of the object on the rational-veritable plane. The next aspect undertaken in the article is concerned with the epistemological and methodological criticism of the view (represented here by R. Ingarden) that there is a radical difference between the objective domains of science and art. An attempt is made to show that the view is rooted rather in ideologically understood scientism and neo-positivism than in a realistic conception of cognition through art. In a completely realistic attitude the borderline between 'what is rationally cognised' and 'what is beautiful' (the sphere of quasi in Ingarden's meaning) is not an absolute borderline. The domain of the work of art also contains cognitive elements, often existentially and morally essential for man's life. As it appears, a similar position can be found in G. B. Vico's texts that proclaim the unity of poetic and metaphysical perspective in ancient beginnings of anthropological thought about the human world. Nowadays a methodological tendency is observed on the philosophical plane that allows joining the veritable and aesthetic aspects, and hence exploring the objective domain of art in the cognitive aspect. This is expressed today, among others, in the increase of the significance of art in social, cultural and scientific life.<br>

Abstract: This article with various models of relation between science and belief. The first part of paper discusses all theories which affirm an opposition between science and religious belief: some of the speak about a real and durable contradiction (logical empirism, marxism), another speak only about linguistic opposition (fideism, cryptofideism, theory of double truth). All these theories are controversial because they call in question the noetic value of religion or of science. The second part of the paper considers the theories affirming concordance between science and belief. They are following: the distinction of man's existential attitude toward religion and science (so-colled II. Wittgenstein), the theory of concordance, complementary character of science and belief, the theory of methodologie difference and of object's diversity. The author came do the conclusion that the best explication of the relation between science and religion is given by the synthetic-complementary theory.<br>

Publisher: Universitätsverlag WINTER GmbH<br>

Author(s): Hanich Julian<br>
Abstract: In this article I suggest that we, as human beings, gain personal recognition not only through intersubjective encounters with others, but also through aesthetic experience. To support my claims about what I call 'aesthetic recognition,' I focus on a pervasive but rarely explored phenomenon: the cinematic shock. Not only a staple ingredient of thrillers, horror films, and disaster movies, it is also found in art-films. The cinematic shock will serve as the case in point of my argument because in its lived intensity, density, and conspicuousness we can describe it more easily with appropriate words than other aesthetic experiences that are equally able to foster aesthetic recognition but are less readily accessible via language. When experienced in the social environment of the movie theater, cinematic shocks enable two widespread types of aesthetic recognition: aesthetic experience as individual self-recognition, and aesthetic experience as a collective recognition of accord. Due to the strongly affective lived-body experience brought about by an encounter with the aesthetic object, the recipient not only feels self-aware of and self-affirmed in his or her own embodied existence, he or she also experiences confirmation as part of a group responding equally—in accordance—to an aesthetic object. This double recognition gained from the cinematic experience of shock derives from the individual film experience and the collective theatrical experience. An additional outcome of my methodological reliance on dense phenomenological descriptions may be an argument for the value of phenomenology in both the study of film and of aesthetics more generally.<br>

Author(s): PAYEN Pascal<br>
Abstract: A l'intérieur du corpus des Vies parallèles de Plutarque, la Vie de Sertorius offretrois singularités : elle est la seule qui se déroule presque en totalité en Occident ; elle appartient au seul couple - Sertorius-Eumène — où le Romain est placé en premier ; le récit ne couvre pas la durée d'une vie, mais isole dix années (83/2 à 73 av. J.-C). Comment rendre compte ensemble de ces trois données situées sur des plans différents ? Les Vies parallèles délimitent un espace qui, à la fin du Ier siècle et au début du IIe, correspond au monde dominé par Rome, devenue garante et protectrice d'une histoire commune. Or autant l'Orient a reçu l'empreinte dts Grecs et des Romains, autant l'Occident est resté à l'écart. Ainsi formulera-t-on l'hypothèse que le sujet principal de cette Vie, tout autant que le personnage même de Sertorius, est l'Espagne, ou plus exactement l'extrême Occident, qui fait écho à l'extrême Orient, aussi bien à l'intérieur du récit (avec l'épisode de la troisième guerre de Mithridate) qu'au sein de l'ensemble des Vies. L'objet de cette étude est donc d'étudier en quoi une source grecque, postérieure de deux siècles aux événements qu'elle rapporte, témoigne de la place et de la fonction de l'extrême Occident dans la Méditerranée gréco-romaine, et, en cela, de mettre au jour quelques-unes des contraintes que pose, en tant que source, la Vie de Sertorius pour l'étude de l'Hispanie de la fin de la République. Within the corpus of Plutarch's Parallel Lives, the Life of Sertorius presents three peculiarities: it is the only one to take place almost entirely in the West; it belongs to the only couple -Sertorius-Eumenes- in which the Roman is given precedence; the narrative does not cover a whole lifetime but isolates ten years (83/2 to 73 BC). How then take together and account for those three facts situated at different levels ? The Parallel Lives delimits a space which, by the end of the 1st century and the beginning of the second, corresponds to a world unde~<br>

Abstract: L'âne des Métamorphoses d'Apulée est à la fois objet, vecteur et témoin de nombreuses activités commerciales de proximité. Le héros Lucius, avant sa transformation, est une figure représentative d'un autre commerce : celui qui s'exerce à grande échelle, fait appel au relais de manieurs d'argent, dépend de la prospérité de la navigation en Méditerranée. La structure d'ensemble du roman met en valeur la confrontation entre ces deux univers, mais aussi les relations qu'ils entretiennent. Apulée établit une série d'étroites correspondances, un véritable réseau métaphorique entre les déplacements et transformations qui sont de l'essence du commerce, d'une part, et d'autre part la série des métamorphoses qui forment l'objet avoué du récit. The donkey in Apuleius' Metamorphoses is at the same time the object, vector and witness to a number of short distance commercial activities. Lucius, the hero, before his transformation is a representative figure of another kind of commerce: a wide-scale operation calling on money changers as relays and depending on a thriving navigation in the Mediterranean. The overall structure of the novel sets into relief the confrontation between those two worlds but also the relationships they entertain. Apuleius set up a series of close correspondences, a real metaphorical network between the journeys and the transformations which are of the essence of commerce on one hand and on the other hand the series of metamorphoses which are the overt object of the narrative.<br>

Abstract: A metafísica aristotélica não considera o ser enquanto ser em si mesmo, mas enquanto símbolo daquilo que é simultaneamente o mais universal e o mais singular para o espírito. Platão antecipou a concepção propondo uma dialéctica ascendente, completada por uma dialéctica descendente, cuja dinâmica fora objecto de pesquisa nas suas últimas obras. A metafísica encontra-se na intersecção destas duas dialécticas, no eixo em que a primeira passa na outra. Este eixo começa a fazer sentido a partir do saber que o pensamento tem de si mesmo. A mentalidade representativa, desatenta à especificidade deste eixo, não consegue aceder à dimensão dos caminhos da razão. O eixo no coração das dialécticas clássicas é assumido pela metafísica contemporânea em termos de tempo associado com o espírito vivo em detrimento do ser conceptual. Aristotelian metaphysics does not consider being qua being in itself, but rather as a symbol of what is, for the spirit, at once the most universal and the most particular. Plato had anticipated the conception, the dynamic of which had been the object of investigation in his last works. Metaphysics finds itself at the intersection of these two dialectics, at the axis around which the first passes into the other. The axis takes its sense from the knowledge that thought has of itself. The mentality, based on representation, inattentive to the specificity of this axis, does not have access to the amplitude of the paths that reason can take. The axis at the heart of classic dialectics is taken up by contemporary metaphysics in terms of time associated with the living spirit rather than as conceptual being.<br>

Abstract: Psychology has uncritically adopted the individual person as its object of study without examining the concept and role of personhood within contemporary society and Western culture more generally. We examine three perspectives that challenge this familiar and unexamined object of our disciplinary inquiry: (1 ) Critical Theory's concept of the bourgeois individual as psychology's subject of ideology; (2) Poststructuralism's challenge to the concept of personhood as an integrated and self-present center of consciousness and action; (3) System Theory's alternative epistemology in which relations rather than entities have primacy. Each perspective introduces a concept of personhood that significantly differs from our present understanding of psychology's subject and that lays the foundation for a new subject of psychological inquiry: a multicentered, multidimensional subject.<br>

Abstract: Using postwar El Salvador as a case study, I argue against the dominant paradigm that situates the repressive role of the state as both the central object of memorialization and the main subject of history. Instead, I focus on the ways in which the memory of insurgent collective action is constructed among young members of the popular classes in postwar El Salvador. Drawing on extensive ethnographic research in the communities of northern Morazán, I understand memory as the suspended time of praxis. Media—such as Internet, Facebook, and TV play a key role in this process, impinging on the ways youth relate with the revolutionary past of their relatives making sense of their present living conditions. I argue that memory must be understood as a particular form of praxis, one that is embedded in historic concrete forms of class constitution in which the role of media has become a constitutive element in the labors of memory, particularly among young people.<br>

Abstract: What makes the figure of the passenger distinctive as both a subject and an object of mobility and transportation systems? What distinguishes the passenger from other mobile subjectivities, from nomad, flaneur to consumer? How is the passenger represented, practiced and performed? How has the passenger and their experiences been conceived, imagined, manipulated, regulated and engineered? And what kind of human-technology assemblages do passengers enact? Through four short perspectives, this paper seeks to 'profile' the passenger as a distinctive historical and conceptual figure that can help to add greater precision to the analysis of our mobile ways of life. The passenger is explored as an object of speculative theoretical debate, a figure entangled in a host of identities, practices, performances and contexts, and an important way to illuminate key conceptual problematics, from representation to embodiment.<br>

Abstract: D'un côté, l'Enquête d'Hérodote rapporte les projets de domination qui, de Crésus à Xerxès, constituent la trame des rapports entre Grecs et Barbares, de 561 à 479. Mais, de l'autre, le lecteur ne peut oublier que de larges sections décrivent les coutumes et l'espace de nombreux peuples dès que la conquête les menace. Cette dynamique s'enracine dans les conditions matérielles de création et de lecture au Ve siècle avant J.-C, et dans les héritages narratifs que transforme Hérodote (Vies, Catalogues ...). Or aucun conquérant n'est glorifié ni présenté comme un vainqueur, tandis que les peuples visés opposent la singularité de leur espace et l'étrangeté de leurs coutumes, soit un genre de vie devenu stratégie de résistance, en associant particularisme insulaire et fuite calculée sur le modèle nomade. Les Grecs, de même, tantôt conquérants insatiables mais défaits, tantôt résistants invaincus, contribuent à monter que, chez Hérodote, l'autre a le visage de celui qui résiste plutôt que du Barbare. Il s'agit donc bien d'une autre écriture du passé, qui sauve de l'oubli tous les peuples décrits, non les seuls hauts faits des Rois. Les mêmes images sont employées pour décrire la résistance insulaire des nomades, et pour dire le cheminement de l'écriture, ainsi en relation d'homologie avec son objet. On one hand, Herodotus' Inquiry reports the plan of domination which from Croesus to Xerxes composes the system of the relation between Greeks and Barbarians, from 561 to 479. But on the other hand, the reader cannot forget that large sections describe customs and many people's area when they are threatened by conquest. This discrepancy has its roots in the material conditions of creativity and reading in the fifth century B.C., and to the narrative forms available to Herodotus (Lives, Lists...). However, no conqueror was praised nor spoken of as a victor, while people shown opposed their individual space and their peculiar customs, that is to say a way of life set up as a stra~<br>

Abstract: Dans cette leçon inaugurale, l'auteur se penche sur l'Évangile, compris au sens large de «promesse», comme objet et comme source de subversion. Deux textes bibliques illustrent chacun de ces deux aspects : le livre de Job et la parabole matthéenne des ouvriers de la onzième heure (Mt 20, 1-16). Une troisième et dernière partie porte sur la relation entre révélation et mystère. Le style oral a été en partie conservé. In this inaugural lecture, delivered on September 24, 2012 at the Faculty of Theology of the University of Geneva, the author develops the theme of the Gospel — understood broadly as «promise» — as both the object and subject of subversion. Two biblical texts are taken as illustrations of these two aspects: the book of Job and Matthew's parable of the vineyard workers of the eleventh hour (Mt 20:1-16). A third and final part focuses on the relation between revelation and mystery. The original style of the lecture has been partly maintained.<br>

Abstract: Où situer le danger ? Qui court un risque et qui le fait courir à qui ? Il s'agit de présenter deux analyses inverses de la notion de danger. Leur originalité tient au fait qu'il ne semble pas y avoir pour elles d'équité ou de réciprocité dans le danger: la menace vient exclusivement d'un côté de la relation. Pour Hegel, c'est le moi qui est l'objet de menaces. L'auteur de ces menaces est toujours l'autre, celui que je ne suis pas, et c'est précisément son altérité qui en fait une puissance dont je peux craindre la violence. C'est pourquoi la vérité – et la sécurité – se trouve toujours du côté de la réduction de la transcendance de l'autre. Pour cette raison, Levinas affirme qu'il n'y a pas d'autre dans la philosophie de Hegel, absence qu'il analyse justement comme un danger: c'est l'autre qui court un risque, et la menace vient de moi. La menace n'émane plus de l'étrangeté de l'autre, mais au contraire de la suppression de cette étrangeté. Ce qu'il est à craindre est, pour Hegel, que l'autre mette la main sur moi, et, pour Levinas, que je mette la main sur l'autre. Where is the danger? Who is at risk and who is a menace to whom? This article presents two opposite analyses of the notion of danger. Their originality lies in the fact that there seems to be no fairness or reciprocity in danger: the threat comes exclusively from one side of the relationship. For Hegel, oneself is always the object of threats. The source of these threats is always the other person, the one I am not, and it is precisely the other's alterity which is a force whose violence I should fear. That is why truth - and security – are always to be found in reducing the transcendence of the other. For this reason, Levinas claims that there is not an other in the philosophy of Hegel, an absence which he analyses as a danger; it's the other who is at risk, and the threat comes from me. The threat no longer emanates from the strangeness of the other, but, on the contrary, from the suppression of this ~<br>

Abstract: À Santiago deux femmes s'affrontent. La procédure du délit d'injures nécessite, dans cette société orale de la première moitié du XVIIIe siècle, l'exposé de questions sensibles qui concernent, dans ce cas particulier, les identités féminines. Croisées par de multiples variables, dont l'ethnie est l'une des plus importantes, ces identités de femmes s'expriment dans des lieux sociaux plus ou moins contestés: la fragilité de ces identités s'observe dans l'expression de la violence privée et dans les discours juridiques. Réfléchir sur la manière d'appréhender et de vivre les possibilités d'être femme dans une des villes de l'Amérique hispanique est un des objectifs de cette analyse. L'autre, montre comment les discours sur le métissage et les valeurs qu'ils portent s'incarnent dans les sujets au niveau des conflits mineurs, quotidiens, jusqu'à faire basculer, à travers la parole et l'opinion sur autrui, des parcours individuels. Verbal confrontations between women in early 18th century Santiago brought women into the courtroom where juridical procedures concerning slander raised issues about feminine identity. A variety of factors shaped these identities, including most notably ethnicity. In contested social locations, women were often the object of interpersonal violence and juridical discourse. This article considers the varieties of women's experiences and how these shaped their identities in a Spanish American city of the period. It also examines the discourses about miscegenation and how they became embodied on the subjects engaged in acts of minor daily conflicts; the words and judgments of others at times had dramatic consequences on individual lives.<br>

Abstract: Par sa notion de « lecture » et de « décréation », Simone Weil ébauche une philosophie critique en tant qu'analyse perceptive du réel que nos jugements font éclater, à tout instant, en une infinité de textes valorisés. Guidée par la méthode reflexive d'Alain et de Lagneau, elle dépasse la problématique phénoménologique des actes interprétatifs dans une herméneutique métaphysique. Le désir constitue alors le fondement de toute métaphorisation du réel à partir d'une conscience gestuelle où les signes, les symboles et les concepts préfigurent une transcendance absente, mais néanmoins réelle. Saisir, à la suite de Kant, cette contradiction en tout objet, c'est fonder la pratique perceptive sur le modèle christologique qui remplit par excellence la fonction d'une « métaphore réelle ». L'exigence proprement philosophique d'une telle synthèse permet de reconnaître une valeur originale à S. Weil dans le débat moderne autour de l'élaboration du signifié. Through her ideas of « lecture » and « décréation », Simone Weil sketches out a critical Philosophy as well as a perspective analysis of that which is real which our judgments, at every moment, split up into an endless number of valued texte. Guided by the reflexive method of Alain and of Lagneau, she goes beyond the phenomenological problematic of interpretative acts into a metaphysical hermeneutic. Desire then constitutes the foundation of every métaphorisation of the real starting with a consciousness in wich signs, symbols and concepts foreshadow an absent, but nevertheless real, transcendence. Taking hold of this contradiction in every object, following upon Kant, is to establish the perceptive practice on the christological model which fulfills belter than any other the function of a "real metaphor". The properly philosophical demand of such a synthesis allows us to recognize an original value in Simone Weil within the modern debate concerning the elaboration of that which is signified.<br>

Abstract: La philosophie herméneutique contemporaine comporte, dans sa démarche fondamentale, une rencontre avec la pensée fondatrice de Descartes que l'on peut nommer son « moment cartésien ». Celle thèse est vérifiée successivement à propos de la « phénoménologie matérielle » de Michel Henry, directement liée à une interprétation du cogito cartésien développée dans la Généalogie de la psychanalyse ; puis en dégageant les motifs herméneutiques impliqués dans la critique du cogito développée par Heidegger; enfin en analysant, dans la phénoménologie herméneutique de Paul Ricœur, la signification du « cogito blessé » , par rapport au conflit des interprétations et dans les perspectives de l'identité narrative pour une nouvelle conception du sujet. In making its fundamental approach, contemporary interpretative philosophy inevitably encounters the basic thinking of Descartes, resulting in what may be called a « Cartesian touch ». Successive examples of this are to be found in (1) Michel Henry's "physical-object phenomenology", which is directly linked with one interpretation of the Cartesian cogito developed in The Genealogy of Psycho-analysis; then in (2) Heidegger's critique of the cogito, if one isolates the interpretative aims which are implied therein; and finally in (3) Paul Ricœur's interpretative phenomenology, if one analyses the meaning of the "wounded cogito", bearing in mind the conflict of interpretation and the possibility that the identical data could give rise to new conclusions on the subject.<br>

Author(s): Williams Wai Chee<br>
Abstract: Does a literary text remain the same object across time? This essay answers no and bases a defense of literature on that answer. Temporal extension, a phenomenon neglected in contemporary literary studies, makes some meanings unrecoverable and others newly possible. A text endures as a nonintegral survivor, an echo of what it was and of what it might become, its resonance changing with shifts in interpretive contexts. Since this resonance cannot be addressed by synchronic historicism, I propose an alternative, diachronic historicism, inspired especially by scientific theories on background noise, by Einstein's account of the relativity of simultaneity, and by critiques of the visual bias in Western epistemology. I try to theorize the text as a temporal continuum, thick with receding and incipient nuances, exercising the ears of readers in divergent ways and yielding its words to contrary claims. Literature thus encourages a semantic democracy that honors disagreement as a crucial fact of civil society.<br>

Abstract: «At the basis of the literary act is a consciousness of language. Whether or not the writer is given to abstract reflexion, there is in literature itself a metaliterary dimension.» In his article on the Evolution of Literary Theory, Tzvetan Todorov examines the relation between the «discourse on Literature» and the object of that discourse: literature. Whereas exegesis concerns itself with the Elucidation and explanation of an historically given object, theory itself constitutes its object. Theory then is in turn seen to be historically informed. From the Poetics of Aristotle, through the medieval hermeneuts, the Renaissance concern with genres, Todorov traces the development of the theoretical discourse which proposes literature as its object. Only in the romantic period is a theory of literature, in the strict sense, elaborated. In the 20th century this theory is further influenced by other emergent disciplines :Marxism, psychoanalysis etc. The final pages of Todorov's paper consider in detail the impact of structuralism, particularly in France, on the literary theoretical discourse. He concludes with reference to the changes taking place currently. According to Todorov, it is in the «idea of genre» that the «transformation will take place.»<br>

Abstract: The construction of gender as patterned and enacted in many northern California bachelor parties is central to a more inclusive clustering and dichotomization of qualities and experiences in which masculine intentionality is defined in contradistinction to female "Otherness" and object-status. As forced Otherness, the bachelor's feminization, accomplished in part by cross-dressing and then stripping him, is thus also an objectification, a humiliation, and an expulsion.<br>

Abstract: This paper is an advocacy for the employment of psychoanalytical concepts within sociological theorizing about the individual. Through an exposition of Freud's views on the development of intra-psychic structure and a critique of Parson's reduction of psychoanalysis to a branch of learning theory, I attempt to show that the sociological approach to the individual is implicitly behavioural and imprisoned in a series of assumptions which, among other things, treats subjectivity as epiphenomenal and identity as an unmediated reflection of some external reality. In contrast, psychoanalysis presents to us a picture of the individual as flawed and ambivalent in his relation to society, formed by but at odds with the demands of culture. In particular, the psychoanalytic concept of identification reveals that the acquisition of identity is a hard-won achievement marked by the renunciation of lost and forbidden objects. I argue, following Freud and Lacan, that the ego, far from being an agency of reason, somehow directly 'plugged into' reality, constitutes itself in the fantasied image of another and that the quality of this identification crucially affects the way the world is experienced and believed by the individual. This argument is elaborated through a discussion of Peter Berger's remarks on the social causes of identity crisis which, when set against the work of object-relations theorists on those suffering from disturbances of identity such as, for example, schizoid personalities, are shown to be both superficial and misleading. I conclude the paper by arguing that while psychoanalysis can enhance our understanding of the way in which the individual is formed by and through culture it also cautions us against making simple generalizations about the impact of culture upon the person, showing that the individual never submits himself unequivocally to its demands and interdicts.<br>

Abstract: Sumbanese descriptions of the "traditional house" as a microcosm and emblem of local identity are neither unproblematic expressions of a cultural totality nor simply objectifications imposed by ethnography or modernity. One way the house is able to serve as a discursive object reflects, in part, specifically Sumbanese models of action and beliefs about language as refracted in changing historical circumstances. In ritual, speakers seek to engage and elicit responses from powerful others, whereas current religious and political developments reframe ritual words as means of describing a cultural world. Both sets of practices draw on the authority of "entextualized" language but interpret it in different ways. Emerging representations of cultural meaning are shaped by long-standing speech genres and by recent social and cultural transformations, mediated by shifting language ideologies.

Abstract: Peirce's general theory of signs, or semiotic, as he called it, yields a theory of the self that sees it both as the object and the subject of semiotic systems. From this viewpoint, the locus, unity, and continuity of the self will be found in the systems of signs that constitute the dialogues between utterers and interpreters of the signs. Personal identity, in this theory, is also a social and cultural identity and is not confined to the individual organism. Peirce's anti-Cartesianism, which denies intuitive and introspective knowledge of the self, derived that knowledge from the fallible inferences we all make from the observations of external facts, including the signs of the self. This laid the foundation for a semiotic psychology as well as for a semiotic anthropology<br>

Abstract: Representations of the active brain have served to establish a particular domain of competence for brain mappers and to distinguish brain mapping's particular contributions to mind/brain research. At the heart of the claims about the emerging contributions of functional brain mapping is a paradox: functional imagers seem to reject representations while also using them at multiple points in their work. This article therefore considers a love-hate relationship between scientists and their object: the case of the iconoclastic imager. This paradoxical stance is the result of the formation of an interdisciplinary approach that brings together a number of scientific traditions and their particular standards of what constitutes scientific evidence. By examining the various ways in which images are deployed and rejected, the origins of these conflicting tendencies can be traced to the technological, methodological, and institutional elements in the work of functional imagers. This approach provides insight into the current demarcation of imaging and reflects on features of visual knowledge.<br>

Abstract: Jurisprudence traditionally approaches the law as an external object; the jurisprudential scholar generally seeks to describe legal doctrine in terms of its objective and observable properties. Professor Balkin argues that seemingly fixed, inherent characteristics of legal doctrine-most notably, whether or not a given body of law is "coherent" or possesses "integrity"-are better understood as projections from the individual observer. Judgments about legal coherence are in reality the result of only one of many interpretive postures an observer might take, but one that implicates the integrity of the observer's own world view. Furthermore, this process of interpretation does not leave the observer untouched, for the process of interpretation itself constructs the observer.<br>

Abstract: Recent scholarship has given considerable attention to lyric poetry as a form of sensuous knowledge. This approach emphasizes the corporeal origins of poetry, its genesis in the body or in language viewed as material. The question of sensuous knowledge is central to the larger theoretical issue of modernity itself, in which lyric holds a central yet ambiguous status. The question of sensuous knowledge is ultimately a question of meaning. However, modern thought — thought pertaining to “modernity” — is fundamentally circular. This would seem to establish an epistemological impasse for aesthetics. But I argue that this circularity offers an important, and necessary, way to limit knowledge and thereby ground an ethical subjectivity. My essay places formalism at the heart of sensuous knowledge. In this essay I develop an account of the importance of abstraction in sensuous knowledge by way of Kant's concept of
         Darstellung, “presentation [of sensory experience].” The “presentation” is the object as it has undergone a structural process of internalization and been made available for psychic use as meaning; that requires a recognition of loss. Where this is important for literature is that twentieth-century American poetry frequently uses very personal images of family life as a way of conveying sincerity about corporeal experience. I use this discussion of circularity in modern aesthetic thought to argue that there is a risk to taking shortcuts to meaning through images of the material bodies of children. In these contemporary poems by Gary Snyder, Sharon Olds and Rita Dove, the poets reject loss in favor of a very modern “affirmation” of the material. But affirmation and the visual image as a sign of affirmation cannot alone bind meaning to us. That meaning must be internalized through theworkof poetic presentation.<br>

Abstract: Desire, as Martin Hägglund claims in
         Dying For Time, has been erringly conceived in philosophical, literary, and psychoanalytic traditions as testifying to a fundamental lack of being. In response, Hägglund develops the notion of chronolibido, a theory that posits the constitutive difference of desire as testifying to temporal finitude and mortality as the object of desire. In the rubric of chronolibido, the desire for immortality dissimulates a preceding desire for survival. This review takes up Hägglund's theory of desire and examines the implications of chronolibido for reading modernist literature.<br>

Abstract: Of plagiarism, little new can be written. In fact, the preceding line is lifted entirely and set without quotation marks from Hillel Schwartz's
         The Culture of the Copy.
               Which raises the question: Is the only difference between citation and theft that wily set of quotation marks? What is the relationship between the citation and its new context (my article)? Since intellectual and artistic theft are not transhistorical concepts, but are construed differently at different times and in different places,32
            
               how can we understand the concept of “authorship”? Although contemporary poetic recycling is being trumpeted as a new method, and has the allure of nowness as it engages with digital processes, information management, and the rhetoric of the Internet search, it is an age-old strategy. Poetic plagiarism and appropriation are found in the constraints of Oulipo, surrealist aleatory juxtaposition, romanticism, early modern imitation, and further back to the Greeks. Just think of the cento, a classical poetic form that can be traced to the first few centuries of the last millennium, which is made up entirely of lines from other texts (at first, lines from Homer were particularly popular as fodder for recombination). The cultural currency of copia, however, differs based on time and place—just as ideas of authorship, originality, and work (as activity and object) are construed differently. Cast positively, cultural recycling may be viewed as homage, pastiche, parody, or ludic recombination; on the flip side, it engages in deception, forgery, theft, plagiarism, hoax, usurpation. In both of these interpretations of the politics of form, discourses of power are in play.33
            
               Form itself may be neutral, as many have argued,34

Abstract: In the same line of argument as House's, Stephen Halliwell states in
         Aristotle's Poeticsthat pity and fear refer specifically to the “capacity to sympathize with the sufferer.” He emphasizes that “Aristotle does not derive this sympathy from an undifferentiated sense of humanity: instead, he takes it to be rooted in a felt or perceived affinity between the subject and the object of the emotion.” In that regard, tragic characters “have to be within the reach of an audience's compassion” (175–79). When we see actors perform on stage, we become direct witnesses to their fate. In narratives, the poet/novelist achieves the same effects by providing us with realistic details that bring the characters to life so that we can begin to know them. In B. L. Ullman's understanding, “pitiful and fearful situations are better produced by the structure of the story than by actual scenes on the stage. But those, who through such scenes produce not fear but mere sensationalism, have nothing to do with tragedy” (26). Stories become relevant to readers or audiences in the totality of their elements, through which the story reflects plausible events to the readers themselves. Paul Ricoeur's understanding of the function of poetry, as indicated in the epigraph, goes to the core of the relation of narrative and ethics. Poetry enables the imagination to piece together, in ways acceptable to human flourishing, bits of human conduct, the elements of our happiness and misfortune. He explains in “Life in Quest of Narrative,” that by “means of poetry we learn how reversals and fortune result from this or that conduct, as this is constructed by the plot in the narrative” (23). Ricoeur differentiates between phronetic (prudential), and theoretical/scientific understanding of human nature. Narratives provide the former, while science provides the latter. In line with Ricoeur, Richard Kearney states in “Narrative and Ethics” that “what is peculiar to the ethical quality of narrative unders~<br>

Abstract: However, as J.-P. Sartre, Michel Henry, Sydney Shoemaker, Dieter Henrich, Manfred Frank, Dan Zahavi et al. (including more or less implicitly, Husserl also) have shown, unless one is pre- and nonreflectively self-present, that is, always already familiar with oneself prior to reflection, it is not clear that a reflective act could ever achieve a noncriterial, immediate, direct self-presence that cashes out as the identity so important for Brentano. Indeed, if this prior self-acquaintance or self-awareness that is prior to all forms of reflection and identifying knowing, is not there from the start, then serious problems of an infinite regress arise if all self-knowing is thought of as requiring criterial identifying features; in other words, there are problems of establishing these criterial features by which one is identified as oneself, how they indeed are tied to oneself, are me, mine, and so on and not someone, or proper to someone, else. Fugali's Brentano would seem to fall into this error because he does not separate the essentially inadequate self-reflection of the personal I from the essential nonreflective self-presence of the I. This latter is denied on the basis that for Brentano an I cannot exist without its acts, for example, it may be unconscious, asleep, or in a coma. And self-awareness properly is an act analogous to perception, and at least it is an awareness of the possibility of enjoying itself as an object in reflection.<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: The expression “theological turn,” coined by Janicaud, was intended as a complaint that philosophy was again becoming a handmaiden of a theological agenda. But it also described a genuine renewal of what had been traditionally called the “philosophy of religion,” resulting in a new subdiscipline, a specifically “Continental philosophy of religion,” offering an alternative to the reigning neo-Scholastic and analytic approaches, conceived in the spirit of Heidegger's critique of “onto-theo-logic” and his meditations on “non-objectifying thinking.”
            
                  God is not an object for a subject, not the referent of a propositional assertion, not the subject matter of a demonstration, all staples of “modernity,” which is why the theological turn is sometimes called “postmodern theology.” Heidegger produced a paradigm shift of revolutionary proportions for the philosophy of religion, for theology, and for religion itself. While the young Heidegger was immersed in Augustine, Kierkegaard, and the letters of Saint Paul, the later Heidegger had in mind the Greek divinities, and by nonobjectifying thinking he meant poetic thinking, not biblical. That was the basis of the critique of Heidegger, first by his contemporary Levinas, thinking from the Jewish tradition, and in the next generation by Jean-Luc Marion, working from the Catholic tradition, each of whom proposed alternate ways of thinking God “otherwise than Being” or “without Being.” Levinas and Marion are the central figures in the theological turn (singled out for sharp criticism by Janicaud). Levinas has been the subject of countless sessions at SPEP for several decades, while Marion was introduced to the membership in a plenary address he gave at SPEP in 1993 (Chicago) and has since built up a very considerable American presence.18

Abstract: The first of these four sections, entitled “Radicalizing Phenomenology,” consists of three articles, each of which pushes phenomenology beyond itself into exciting new directions. Frédéric Seyler's “Fichte in 1804: A Radical Phenomenology of Life?” compares two thinkers who stand at the ends of the chronological spectrum of the phenomenological movement—Fichte and Michel Henry—but who nevertheless share the common aim of offering a phenomenology of life. Seyler argues that this aim leads them to confront an unsurpassable limit, inasmuch as a phenomenology of life attempts to grasp something that is strictly invisible or ineffable: the absolute as life that lies beyond or underneath the subject/object split. Crina Gschwandtner's article, “Revealing the Invisible: Henry and Marion on Aesthetic Experience,” also discusses Henry and considers him in relation to Jean-Luc Marion, with a focus not on the religious implications of their work but, rather, on their aesthetics. Concentrating on the relationship between the visible and invisible and on the way that each thinker privileges the phenomenon of art, Gschwandtner uncovers parallels between and also critically interrogates Henry's and Marion's theories of art and the artist. Finally, in “Is a Hermeneutic Phenomenology Wide Enough? A Ricoeurian Reply to Janicaud's
      Phenomenology ‘Wide Open,’” Scott Davidson stages a critical engagement between Dominique Janicaud and Paul Ricoeur, arguing both that Janicaud's attempt to distance himself from hermeneutic phenomenology is unsuccessful and that the true significance of his minimal phenomenology has yet to be fully appreciated. Davidson further argues that reflecting on the relationship between minimal and hermeneutic phenomenology reveals important new possibilities for phenomenological reflection today.<br>

Abstract: The account of the aspect in Husserlian phenomenology is well known. With his theory of adumbrations, Husserl described how the perceived object is given in a one-sided, partial manner. The perception of its actual profile or aspect is given against the horizon of a set of potential perceptions of its other sides. Together these actual and potential perceptions are unified to form the sense of the thing that is perceived. For Deleuze, though, Husserl's account operates on the level of aftereffects because it does not ever consider the genesis or coming into being of the aspect itself. It is this event—the genesis of the aspect as such—that Deleuze's work brings to the fore. The Deleuzian aspect is separated from every figure and context. Think of it as being like the smile of the Cheshire Cat, which wanders away from the cat's body. This is not simply an imaginary or hallucinatory appearance; instead it indicates the genesis of a sensation prior to the work of figuration or its placement within a context. Every figure or form is a secondary coagulation or solidification of this primary sensation. To the extent that the aspect disarticulates itself from every position or background field, it can rightly be called an in-visible. This is how a minimal phenomenology approaches the invisible. That is, it approaches this minimal threshold of sense—the threshold that gives rise to sensation and conscious experience.<br>

Abstract: At its heighthyperbole, the absolute opening, the uneconomic expenditure, is always reembraced by aneconomyand is overcome by economy. The relationship between reason, madness, and death is an economy, a structure of deferral whose irreducible originality must be respected. This attempt-to-say-the-demonic-hyperbole is not an attempt among others; it is not an attempt which would occasionally and eventually be completed by the saying of it, or by its object, the direct object of a willful subjectivity. This attempt to say, which is not, moreover, the antagonism of silence, but rather the condition for it, is the original profundity of will in general. (1978, 61–62)<br>

Abstract: Let us return to Ricoeur's understanding of “appropriation.” One of the advantages of Ricoeur's formulation is that it recognizes the significance of readerly agency while not relying on the idea of a self-possessed subject. Ricoeur argues that appropriation should not be understood as a function of a sovereign subject who “would possess the key” to understanding. Rather, the reader of a text “exchange[s] the
         me,masterof itself, for theself,discipleof the text” (Ricoeur 2007, 37). Such a reader does not project him- or herself onto the text but receives “an enlarged self from the apprehension of proposed worlds which are the genuine object of interpretation” (Ricoeur1981, 182). The ability to perform this function depends on what Ricoeur calls “second-order reference,” which requires the reader to suspend concerns with whether the events “really” happened in order fully to understand the world opening up through her or his imaginative engagement with the text (Ricoeur1977, 216–56).
               This “world of the work” that reveals itself before the text becomes the referent of fictional narrative. When engaged in interpretation, then, the reader should seek to understand this “proposed world” as one “which I could inhabit and in which I could project my ownmost possibilities” (Ricoeur 2007, 36). Fictional narratives, then, ultimately create an imagined world that prepares readers to act their way into it, so to speak. In13
            Time and Narrative, Ricoeur explains that historical narrative employs a related but distinct “referential mode”: whereas fiction refers to an imagined world that could potentially be enacted in front of it, so to speak, historical narrative also claims to refer to an actual world that already exists behind it (1984, 1:82). Ricoeur productively blurs these distinctions inMemory, History, Forgetting, explaining that both types of narrative enable the reader to inhabit the “world of the text” (2004, 262).<br>

Abstract: Fully primed, faith thrusts hope into the world with a corresponding mission, a motivating moral imperative, whose fulfillment becomes the object of intense human pursuit. The envisioned end state may be mundane or sublime, its scale may be limited or universal, and its dynamism may comprise the catalyzed aspirations of an individual, a group, a nation, or the race as a whole. For Shaw and Ricoeur, the mission is ecumenical in scope, simple in theory, and incontrovertible in substance—humbly: to give more than you take, to treat others as you would wish to be treated, to care for the defenseless, to act justly, to love mercy, to be peacemakers, and to make the world a better place than you find it. Needless to say, the task has proven extraordinarily difficult to complete even locally, let alone globally. If ever there were a “mission impossible,” implementing Jesus's social gospel seems to be it. History itself testifies to the arduousness of the enterprise. Yet, as receptive auditors of the Bible's metaphorical discourse, it is precisely to this singular calling that Shaw and Ricoeur conscientiously harken. In this connection, two things are especially noteworthy about the momentous parallel choices they make. First, they are accompanied by a commensurate hopefulness maintained over lengthy faith-driven lives. Second, they reflect shared philosophical perspectives on the nature of hope and faith, perspectives that are sometimes unreflected in scholarly explorations of these saving graces. In fact, invoking Ricoeur in this context throws a penetrating light not only on hope and faith as phenomena but also on Shaw the tragic-optimist, the Shaw who never allows the tragic dimensions of existence to overwhelm his qualified positivism about the constructive role humans can play in the promotion of life.<br>

Abstract: This present study revisits the role of the subject in the light of mimesis theory and the urgency of the questions it raises in the theory of fictional worlds, mainly following the model that Lubomír Doležel has “canonized,” after many years' reflection, in his essential book,
         Heterocosmica(1998). The study measures the shift within this theory that has occurred under the influence of the subject, sketches the complex of problems that it raises, and shows how the subject itself, conversely, demands redefinition in the light of the theory of fictional worlds. Because this area is very wide, the study is limited to that part of it defined by the pairing of subject and mimesis as literary categories. And it indicates that it is precisely the theory of fictional worlds that can prove how ambiguous the simple dichotomy of subject and object is.<br>

Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: An obvious criticism of Burke's idea of rhetorical transcendence is that it is utopian in the unrealistic sense. It seems so abstract in its focus on generalized terminology and images that it may have no possible concrete object. Burke realized this utopian quality reminiscent of the lack of actualized topos in More's utopian “no-place.” As rhetorician James Zappen explains, “These acts of pure persuasion are devoid of partisan advantage-seeking but also devoid of persuasive purpose. As such, they might not even exist.”
      
               The important thing to take away from Burke's ramblings, though, is the humanistic sense that the search for perfection is inherent in human nature and that understanding this utopian impulse can only help us to live and to seek happiness in a world of competing power and advantage: “Let us observe, all about us, forever goading us, though it be in fragments, the motive that attains its ultimate identification in the thought, not of the universal holocaust, but of the universal order…. [E]ach kind strives toward the perfection of its kind, and so toward the kind next above it, while the strivings of the entire series head in God as the beloved cynosure and ninecure, the end of all desire.”35

            GodBurke means an ultimate ideal transcending all other symbols and fulfilling all desire—the kind of nirvana that would eliminate the need for further utopia-making altogether. This, of course, is not achievable in the course of history, but the mythic experience of it would activate a downward movement in the process, bringing the transcendent ideals back into the pragmatic world of discourse and human affairs. This would be the function of utopia in Burkean terms, and it would result in a habit of mind that would amount to a large-scale educational scheme—dare I say, the education of desires. If the young were informed of the dialectical-rhetorical process of transcendence from the beginning, ~<br>

Abstract: Nicholas Brown proposes that “in a first, utopian moment,
         Ulyssesshort-circuits the rift between subjectivity and the object-world, miraculously imbuing the accidents of daily life with inscrutable significance.” However, as Brown adds, “this Utopia fails to bear on an actuality for which it can only compensate. But in a second moment this failure makes itself manifest.”
               In Jameson's words, such manifestations of the anti-Utopian impulse as those we appear to witness in Joyce's work may afford “the discovery that our most energetic imaginative leaps into radical alternatives were little more than the projections of our own social moment and historical or subjective situation.”139

Abstract: Culture apprentices the body to its style. Gestures are the visible and kinaesthetic trace of that apprenticeship. They are specific to bodies, families, age grades, ethnic groups, social orders, and historical moments. They are folklore. The gestures I consider here are affiliated with talk. They conjure up in the gesture space in front of the body the iconic and metaphoric objects that talk mentions. In a gesture, Maurice Merleau-Ponty writes, "the intentional object is offered to the spectator at the same time as the gesture itself” ([1962] 1995:186). The gesturer's intentionality colonizes the spectator's, making it intersubjective: phenomenology's foundational perspective.<br>
