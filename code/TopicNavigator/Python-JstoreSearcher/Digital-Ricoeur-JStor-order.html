  Abstract: Fundamentalism has its roots in revivalism, but the Fundamentalist movement of the twentieth century has emerged as a radical reformulation of revivalist idealism. When Charles Finney addressed listeners and readers in his 1835
                  Lectures on Revivals of Religion, he warned of individual enemies that the revival church would have to confront and overcome in order to establish Christ’s kingdom on earth. He warned of “professors of religion” who would dismiss and speak against the work of revival. He warned often of a personal devil who conspired to keep sinners out of heaven. When he spoke against institutions and systems, however,<br>

  Book Title: Enigmas of Sacrifice-A Critique of Joseph M. Plunkett and the Dublin Insurrection of 1916<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Cormack W. J. Mc<br>
  Abstract: Enigmas of Sacrifice: A Critique of Joseph M. Plunkett and the Dublin Insurrection of 1916is the first critical study of the religious poet and militarist Joseph M. Plunkett, who was executed with the other leaders of the Dublin insurrection of 1916. Through Plunkett the author gains access to areas of nationalist thought that were more often assumed or repressed than publicly formulated.In this eye-opening book, W. J. Mc Cormack explores and analyzes Plunkett's brief life, work, and influence, beginning with his wealthy but dysfunctional family, irregular Jesuit education, and self-canceling sexuality. Mc Cormack continues through Plunkett's active phase when amateur theatricals and a magazine editorship brought him into the emergent neonationalist discourse of early twentieth-century Ireland. Finally, the author arrives at Holy Week 1916, when Plunkett masterminded the forgery of official documentation in order to provoke and justify the insurrection he planned. Mc Cormack analyzes Plunkett's significant texts and provides context through critical perspectives on his milieu.Enigmas of Sacrificeis unique in its effort to understand a major figure of Irish nationalism in terms that reach beyond political identity.<br>

  The Forged Dublin Castle Document 1916 from:

  Abstract: The third part of the critique is even less concerned with chronology than its predecessors, though these investigated certain sequences of events, personal or public. The brevity of Plunkett’s public career—an almost Christlike three years—argues against too much reliance on any stage-by-stage analysis of cause and effect. In contrast, this chapter presents a number of largely discrete investigations the order of which is neither random nor absolute. Each is intended to illuminate a facet of the sacrifice enigma as it intermittently discloses itself through Joseph Mary Plunkett, antipolitical insurgent and religious poet.<br>

  Author(s) Alison James<br>
  Abstract: When the term
                  sacrificeis used to designate practices common to various world religions and used to designate a historical scapegoat at the founding of a social order, are we referring to the same thing? Perhaps not. Th e sacrifi ce of which the Girard school speaks applies to any social order—whether a political order, an ideological organization, a social movement, or such—not merely to an established religious tradition.¹ So, let us pose the question: What is the value of Girardian theory? Is it to illuminate the religious concept of sacrifice or to illuminate human nature in general?<br>

  Author(s) Ell Theodore<br>
  Abstract: My main aim in this essay is to show that Girard’s argument for Christ’s divinity hides a variation of the classic ontological argument for the existence of God.¹ In order to do so, it is first important to distinguish three distinct hermeneutical approaches to Girard’s mimetic theory:
                  internal and literal, internal nonliteral,andcritical. If we take an internal and literal approach, we find that Girard writes nothing about the ontological proof. If we take an internal and nonliteral approach to Girard, we can try to deduce what he might have thought about the ontological proof on the basis of<br>

  Author(s) Hariman Robert<br>
  Abstract: One rewrites in order to improve a text. Sometimes the result is thought to be the better expression of an original meaning; at other times, it extends the idea in a new direction. In any case, textual revision is a process characterized by imperfection, change, negotiation, and fallibility. Traditionally, realism has seemed to be above this process: One identifies the relations of power or suffers the consequences. This attitude is reflected in the standard invocation of the classics of realism, which are seen as equivalent statements of a core doctrine of universal truths.

  Book Title: Executing Democracy-Volume One: Capital Punishment & the Making of America, 1683-1807<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hartnett Stephen John<br>
  Abstract: Executing Democracy: Capital Punishment & the Making of America, 1683-1807is the first volume of a rhetorical history of public debates about crime, violence, and capital punishment in America. This examination begins in 1683, when William Penn first struggled to govern the rowdy indentured servants of Philadelphia, and continues up until 1807, when the Federalists sought to impose law-and-order upon the New Republic.This volume offers a lively historical overview of how crime, violence, and capital punishment influenced the settling of the New World, the American Revolution, and the frantic post-war political scrambling to establish norms that would govern the new republic.By presenting a macro-historical overview, and by filling the arguments with voices from different political camps and communicative genres, Hartnett provides readers with fresh perspectives for understanding the centrality of public debates about capital punishment to the history of American democracy.<br>

Among Evangelical men in Caracas, religion does not begin with disinterest. It begins with dis-ease that is consciously and rationally addressed through religious practice. And this pragmatic quality does nothing to challenge its viability or its sincerity. The smiles and tears, courage and fear are all real. It would be a mistake to regard this as unique to Latin American Evangelicalism. I suspect any close review of empirical research on contemporary religious and cultural practices around<br>

  Abstract: We can gain a sharper sense of the peculiar nature of the cultural order that Sanskrit helped to create, and the kind of political order for which it was cultivated, if we consider both from an explicitly comparative perspective. There is a natural tendency, exhibited even (or especially) in social and cultural theory, to generalize familiar forms of life and experience as universal tendencies and common sense. Comparison offers an antidote to this by demonstrating the actual particularity of these apparent universalisms.

However ubiquitous death is—we all ultimately suffer from it—it calls into question the social order and its value systems; it attacks our mad scramble for power, our simplistic rationalism and our unacknowledged, child-like belief in immortality.”¹ Death, Vogel suggests,<br>

  Book Title: A Usable Past-Essays in European Cultural History<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): BOUWSMA WILLIAM J.<br>
  Abstract: The essays assembled here represent forty years of reflection about the European cultural past by an eminent historian. The volume concentrates on the Renaissance and Reformation, while providing a lens through which to view problems of perennial interest.
      A Usable Pastis a book of unusual scope, touching on such topics as political thought and historiography, metaphysical and practical conceptions of order, the relevance of Renaissance humanism to Protestant thought, the secularization of European culture, the contributions of particular professional groups to European civilization, and the teaching of history. The essays inA Usable Pastare unified by a set of common concerns. William Bouwsma has always resisted the pretensions to science that have shaped much recent historical scholarship and made the work of historians increasingly specialized and inaccessible to lay readers. Following Friedrich Nietzsche, he argues that since history is a kind of public utility, historical research should contribute to the self-understanding of society.<br>

  Abstract: Central to the great upheavals marking the transition between the medieval and the modern world were profound disagreements about the nature of order, whether in the social and political realm, in the church, in the cosmos, or in the exalted spheres of metaphysics. High medieval culture, broadly speaking, had tended toward a unified and hierarchical conception of order which assigned to all men, experiences, places, things, and ideas their appropriate positions in a vast, graded system of values. Conversely the attack on medieval civilization at its deepest level, operating simultaneously in both the material and ideal realms, was directed at<br>

In addition to Nietzsche, Zuckert examines four other thinkers—Heidegger, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Leo Strauss, and Jacques Derrida—who share the conviction that Plato must be confronted<br>

  Abstract: After the outbreak of World War II and increasingly throughout the 1940s, Egyptian public life was radicalized. Parliamentary politics was viewed as detached from the country’s real problems, and politicians appeared as self-serving and corrupt.

Thus, the largest opposition group, the Muslim Brotherhood, openly challenged the state by murdering Prime Minister Maḥmūd Fahmī al-Nuqrāshī.

  Abstract: Michel Beaujour states his dissatisfaction with the term 'autoportrait' to encapsulate adequately literary endeavours at self-representation.¹ The connection between self-portraiture and painting is evident, and the slippage of the term across mediums leads, in Beaujour's opinion, to deny the specificity of literary works. Yet, referring to works such as Michel de Montaigne's

  Book Title: Figures of a Changing World: Metaphor and the Emergence of Modern Culture-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): BERGER HARRY<br>
  Abstract: Figures of a Changing World offers a dramatic new account of cultural change, an account based on the distinction between two familiar rhetorical figures, metonymy and metaphor. The book treats metonymy as the basic organizing trope of traditional culture and metaphor as the basic organizing trope of modern culture. On the one hand, metonymies present themselves as analogies that articulate or reaffirm preexisting states of affairs. They are guarantors of facticity, a term that can be translated or defined as fact-like-ness. On the other hand, metaphors challenge the similarity they claim to establish, in order to feature departures from preexisting states of affairs. On the basis of this distinction, the author argues that metaphor and metonymy can be used as instruments both for the large-scale interpretation of tensions in cultural change and for the micro-interpretation of tensions within particular texts. In addressing the functioning of the two terms, the author draws upon and critiques the work of Friedrich Nietzsche, Roman Jakobson, Christian Metz, Paul Ricoeur, Umberto Eco, Edmund Leach, and Paul de Man.<br>

  Abstract: Postmodern theology has come of age.¹ It now has its own countermovement, philosophers marching under the flag of materialism, realism, and anti-religion and complaining that the theologians are back at their old trick of appropriating critiques of religion in order to make religion stronger. So this is an occasion to clear the air and see just how hard and fast the borders are between religion and anti-religion, realism and anti-realism, materialism and anti-materialism, especially given that deconstruction is an exercise in anxiety about rigorous borders.

  Book Title: Aspects of Alterity: Levinas, Marcel, and the Contemporary Debate-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): TREANOR BRIAN<br>
  Abstract: Every other is truly other, but no other is wholly other.This is the claim that Aspects of Alterity defends. Taking up the question of otherness that so fascinates contemporary continental philosophy, this book asks what it means for something or someone to be other than the self. Levinas and those influenced by him point out that the philosophical tradition of the West has generally favored the self at the expense of the other. Such a self-centered perspective never encounters the other qua other, however. In response, postmodern thought insists on the absolute otherness of the other, epitomized by the deconstructive claim every other is wholly other.But absolute otherness generates problems and aporias of its own. This has led some thinkers to reevaluate the notion of relative otherness in light of the postmodern critique, arguing for a chiastic account that does justice to both the alterity and the similitude of the other. These latter two positions-absolute otherness and a rehabilitated account of relative otherness-are the main contenders in the contemporary debate.The philosophies of Emmanuel Levinas and Gabriel Marcel provide the point of embarkation for coming to understand the two positions on this question. Levinas and Marcel were contemporaries whose philosophies exhibit remarkably similar concern for the other but nevertheless remain fundamentally incompatible. Thus, these two thinkers provide a striking illustration of both the proximity of and the unbridgeable gap between two accounts of otherness.Aspects of Alterity delves into this debate, first in order understand the issues at stake in these two positions and second to determine which description better accounts for the experience of encountering the other.After a thorough assessment and critique of otherness in Levinas's and Marcel's work, including a discussion of the relationship of ethical alterity to theological assumptions, Aspects of Alterity traces the transmission and development of these ~<br>

  Book Title: Crediting God: Sovereignty and Religion in the Age of Global Capitalism-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Vatter Miguel<br>
  Abstract: Tocqueville suggested that the people reign in the American political world like God over the universe.This intuition anticipates the crisis in the secularization paradigm that has brought theology back as a fundamental part of sociological and political analysis. It has become more difficult to believe that humanity's progress necessarily leads to atheism, or that it is possible to translate all that is good about religion into reasonable terms acceptable in principle by all, believers as well as nonbelievers. And yet, the spread of Enlightenment values, of an independent public sphere, and of alternative projects of modernitycontinues unabated and is by no means the antithesis of the renewed vigor of religious beliefs.The essays in this book shed interdisciplinary and multicultural light on a hypothesis that helps to account for such an unexpected convergence of enlightenment and religion in our times: Religion has reentered the public sphere because it puts into question the relation between God and the concept of political sovereignty.In the first part, Religion and Polity-Building,new perspectives are brought to bear on the tension-ridden connection between theophany and state-building from the perspective of world religions. Globalized, neo-liberal capitalism has been another crucial factor in loosening the bond between God and the state, as the essays in the second part, The End of the Saeculum and Global Capitalism,show.The essays in the third part, Questioning Sovereignty: Law and Justice,are dedicated to a critique of the premises of political theology, starting from the possibility of a prior, perhaps deeper relation between democracy and theocracy. The book concludes with three innovative essays dedicated to examining Tocqueville in order to think the Religion of Democracybeyond the idea of civil religion.<br>

  Abstract: There are many ideological and epistemological obstacles to understanding the politics of Judaism. Its foundational text, the Torah, both in regard to its biblical-Talmudic meaning and in regard to the historical condition of the Jews, has long been prone to misunderstanding. In order to approach the question of politics in Judaism, one must abandon the perception that this politics is theocratic. Since Flavius Josephus positively defined Israel’s political specificity in comparison with monarchic and oligarchic regimes in his book
                  Against Apion, theocracy has become equivalent to the very negation of the political. Spinoza’sTheological-Political Treatisehas established this negative understanding<br>

  Book Title: Technologies of Life and Death: From Cloning to Capital Punishment-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Oliver Kelly<br>
  Abstract: The central aim of this book is to approach contemporary problems raised by technologies of life and death as ethical issues that call for a more nuanced approach than mainstream philosophy can provide. To do so, it draws on the recently published seminars of Jacques Derrida to analyze the extremes of birth and dying insofar as they are mediated by technologies of life and death. With an eye to reproductive technologies, it shows how a deconstructive approach can change the very terms of contemporary debates over technologies of life and death, from cloning to surrogate motherhood to capital punishment, particularly insofar as most current discussions assume some notion of a liberal individual. The ethical stakes in these debates are never far from political concerns such as enfranchisement, citizenship, oppression, racism, sexism, and the public policies that normalize them. Technologies of Life and Death thus provides pointers for rethinking dominant philosophical and popular assumptions about nature and nurture, chance and necessity, masculine and feminine, human and animal, and what it means to be a mother or a father. In part, the book seeks to disarticulate a tension between ethics and politics that runs through these issues in order to suggest a more ethical politics by turning the force of sovereign violence back against itself. In the end, it proposes that deconstructive ethics with a psychoanalytic supplement can provide a corrective for moral codes and political cliches that turn us into mere answering machines.<br>

This feeling of suffocation steals over the philosopher when he attends to the long tradition of texts and studies in his field. Then, the history of philosophy seems to be an externally imposed and pressing structure, controlled entirely by lines of investigation laid out in the far distant past and extending into one’s present activity only in order to cramp and discourage the creative mind.

  Author(s): Lourdeaux Lee<br>
  Abstract: "This penetrating study examines how these filmmakers confronted their cultural heritage and used it as a counterpoint to their depiction of mainstream America." --American Cinematographer In this unique film history, Lee Lourdeaux traces the impact of Irish and Italian cultures on four major American directors and their work. Defining the core values and tensions within each culture, and especially focusing on the influence of American Catholicism, he presents John Ford, Frank Capra, Francis Coppola, and Martin Scorsese as ethnic Americans and film artists. Lourdeaux shows each filmmaker on set with writers and actors, learning to bypass stereotypes in order to develop a shrewd reciprocal assimilation between his ethnic background and Anglo America. Beginning with D. W. Griffith's depiction of Irish and Italian immigrants, the author discusses Hollywood's stereotypical portrayals of ethnic priests, cops, politicians, and gangsters, as well as their surface acculturation in the movies of the 1920s. By the decade's end, John Ford was using all-American stories to embody the basic myths and tensions of Irish-American life. In his later westerns and foreign films, he tried to understand both Irish political strife and the key figures of Irish liturgy. Frank Capra pitted Italian family values against the Anglo success ethic, turning out social comedies about oppressed little people. Several decades later, Martin Scorsese and Francis Coppola were highly critical of their religio-ethnic heritage, though they gradually discovered that to outline its weaknesses, like the blind pursuit of success, was to fashion a critical mirror of mainstream America. Lourdeaux discusses a number of recent films by Coppola and by Scorsese that have not yet been analyzed in any book. And, in the chapter on Scorsese, a personal interview with the director reveals how his ethnic childhood shaped his work in film. Examining the conflicts within American culture, Lourdeaux shows how the filmmake~<br>

  Book Title: The Wisdom and Foolishness of God-First Corinthians 1-2 in Theological Exploration<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Askani Hans-Christoph<br>
  Abstract: The first two chapters of Paul’s first epistle to the Christians of Corinth, written in the fifth decade of the first century, have played a significant role in the history of Christian theology. Interpreting the central event in Christianity, namely the crucifixion of Jesus, Paul reflects on the wisdom and foolishness of God, which he opposes to the world’s wisdom. According to Paul, the “word of the cross," which is “foolishness" to some and “scandal" to others, leads to an upheaval in one’s way of thinking. For two millenia, theology has often turned to these passages in order to sustain its reflection. Many central questions emerge from Paul’s text on the meaning of a crucified Messiah, on God’s omnipotence, weakness, and suffering. This volume hopes to achieve two things by seeking to place exegetes, historians, philosophers, and theologians in conversation: to better understand Paul’s text and its reception and also to examine the ways in which it can nourish our theological reflection today.<br>

  Book Title: Britain and Africa Under Blair-In pursuit of the good state<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Gallagher Julia<br>
  Abstract: Africa was a key focus of Britain’s foreign policy under Tony Blair. Military intervention in Sierra Leone, increases in aid and debt relief, and grand initiatives such as the Commission for Africa established the continent as a place in which Britain could ‘do good’. Britain and Africa under Blair: in pursuit of the good state critically explores Britain’s fascination with Africa. It argues that, under New Labour, Africa represented an area of policy that appeared to transcend politics. Gradually, it came to embody an ideal state activity around which politicians, officials and the wider public could coalesce, leaving behind more contentious domestic and international issues. Building on the story of Britain and Africa under Blair, the book draws wider conclusions about the role of ‘good’ and idealism in foreign policy. In particular, it discusses how international relationships provide opportunities to create and pursue ideals, and why they are essential for the wellbeing of political communities. It argues that state actors project the idea of ‘good’ onto idealised, distant objects, in order to restore a sense of the ‘good state’. The book makes a distinctive and original contribution to debates about the role of ethics in international relations and will be of particular interest to academics, policy-makers and students of international relations, Africa and British foreign policy, and to anyone interested in ethics in international affairs.<br>

  Aristide and the Apocalypse from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt15r3x8s">Tropical Apocalypse</a><br>
  Abstract: Maximilien Laroche writes of an archetypal antihero figure in Haitian writing, whose function is to transform “an individual decline into a collective deliverance.” In Haitian literature, Laroche writes, “the hero makes himself a zombie amongst zombies in order to free the community. And it is by accepting his victimhood, by acknowledging it, that he denounces it, and thereby attacks the victimization to which he and his people are subject” (n.p.). Laroche’s theory of the Haitian antihero addresses patterns of victimization and self-sacrifice in Haitian literature—notably in classic works of fiction by Roumain, Alexis, and others. His idea however seems<br>

  Author(s) Sooväli-Sepping Helen<br>
  Abstract: The concept of cultural biography is applied to cultural landscapes and urban environments in order to get a grip on the complex and layered memory, stored in one way or another, linking spatial-physical environments and people, dead or alive. In my research I use the metaphor of
                     memory, which focuses on the same aspects. A biography and a memory are similar, in that they are both linked to people and they reflect dynamic and cyclical aspects of the past.<br>

  Author(s) WINTER JAY<br>
  Abstract: In February 1945, six months after the liberation of Paris, a Jewish writer in the French capital described the situation of his fellow Jewish survivors: “We are like the inhabitants of a city that has been devastated by an earthquake; we survey the ruins and do what comes naturally; we utilize that which is still usable in order to organize emergency relief.”¹ The comparison of the condition of French Jewry in the immediate postwar period with the aftermath of a natural disaster seemed a particularly apt one, at least in the first months after liberation.

  Book Title: Restoring the Right Relationship-  Publisher: ATF Press<br>
  Author(s): O’Brien Mark A<br>
  Abstract: A leading biblical scholar, Hans Heinrich Schmid, believes that righteousness, or the right order of the world, is 'the fundamental problem of our human existence'. It is a key theme in the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament's theology of creation and salvation, along with associated themes such as justice, steadfast love/loyalty, truth/ fidelity, compassion/mercy, sin and disorder/chaos. A number of studies of righteousness have been undertaken but most have tended to focus on Israel's call to be righteous, as voiced in particular in the Prophetic Books and the Psalter. In contrast, this book focuses on divine righteousness as the basis for all other notions of righteousness, as this is outlined in the foundational teaching or revelation of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament— namely, the Torah or Pentateuch. It then undertakes a study of how righteousness in the Prophetic Books, the Psalter and the Book of Job relates to this foundational teaching.<br>

As pointed out in the Preface recent studies of the termtsedeq/tsedaqahfavour the view that it refers primarily to right order in relationships; the judicial or legal usage of the terminology is an application of this more basic meaning. Although the term is employed in relation to the covenant with Israel, Schmid and others argue that this operates within the larger context of biblical creation theology.

  Abstract: The twentieth century dawned with the expectation of social and political emancipation. The growth of both industrialization and urbanisation throughout the nineteenth century, the rise of the masses against political exclusion, and the threatening fragmentation of the imperial order brought the world to a new threshold in 1900. There was every sense of the dawn of a new era.¹ The threshold, however, was turbulent and violent, as it was fragile. Imperialism unravelled in the First World War.

  Abstract: In recent times, biblical interpreters have drawn on a range of interpretive approaches in order to ensure that the biblical text ‘may not simply be a word from the past, but a living and timely word’.¹ Among the more recent approaches have been ecological readings, which have arisen as a response to the ecological crisis and as a result of a growing sense of responsibility among biblical scholars and theologians towards God’s creation. The Old Testament book of Ecclesiastes (or Qoheleth) has evoked many conflicting responses over the centuries, mainly because of its recurring refrain of ‘vanity of vanities’ or<br>

  Abstract: In the 1992 Bampton Lectures Colin Gunton drew attention to the powerful influence in the Christian tradition of two ancient philosophies; the Parmenidean and the Heraclitean.² Whereas the former stressed the underlying unity and stability of the world, the latter gave prominence to plurality, particulars and state of flux of the world. The tradition of Parmenides provided the backdrop for the first millennium and a half of the Christian tradition and appeared to offer support to a Christian theism that gave order and meaning to the world.

  Abstract: Does ethnic tourism lend itself to postcolonial analysis? One must attempt to understand the construction of the gaze on “exoticism” in order to verify the hypothesis of a symbolic inheritance from the colonial era. With this in mind, my analysis relies on the discourse and images found in the brochures of twelve tour operators specializing in the sale of “ethnic” destinations in order to determine which essential arguments these businesses rely upon to capture the attention of future clients. My initial hypothesis is that this discourse and these images answer to the expectations and desires of the clients and therefore<br>

  Abstract: I have long admired Maurice Merleau-Ponty’s writing on Paul Cézanne because it provides insight into the artist’s practice beyond the general conventions of art history. The philosopher saw the painter as a paradigm example of the essence of perception.¹ As he writes, “Cézanne did not think he had to choose between feeling and thought, between order and chaos. He did not want to separate the stable things which we see and the shifting way in which they appear; he wanted to depict matter as it takes on form, the birth of order through spontaneous organization” (Merleau-Ponty 1964 [1945]: 13).<br>

This argument is in no sense demonstrative, as the term is commonly understood, and there is nothing representational about the presentation, which opens the way to the essence of what Nietzsche would have only incompletely thought: nihilism, as the “covert basic law of Western history.”² What, then, does it mean to interpret?

  Abstract: They have stalked the horizons of our culture, wreaked havoc on moribund concepts of dead and not dead, threatened our sense of identity, and endangered our personal safety. Now zombies have emerged from the lurking shadows of society's fringes to wander the sacred halls of the academy, feasting on tender minds and hurling rot across our intellectual landscape. It is time to unite in common cause, to shore up defenses, firm up critical and analytical resources, and fortify crumbling lines of inquiry. Responding to this call, Brain Workers from the Zombie Research Center poke and prod the rotting corpus of zombie culture trying to make sense of cult classics and the unstoppable growth of new and even more disturbing work. They exhume "zombie theory" and decaying historical documents from America, Europe, and the Caribbean in order to unearth the zombie world and arm readers with the brain tools necessary for everyday survival. Readers will see that zombie culture today "lives" in shapes as mutable as a zombie horde-and is often just as violent.<br>

It is also a question the incurved self cannot ultimately answer, because it seeks to answer this question itself through reflection on its own possibilities and acts.

  Author(s): Dun Tan<br>
  Abstract: Yayoi Uno Everett focuses on four operas that helped shape the careers of the composers Osvaldo Golijov, Kaija Saariaho, John Adams, and Tan Dun, which represent a unique encounter of music and production through what Everett calls "multimodal narrative." Aspects of production design, the mechanics of stagecraft, and their interaction with music and sung texts contribute significantly to the semiotics of operatic storytelling. Everett's study draws on Northrop Frye's theories of myth, Lacanian psychoanalysis via Slavoj Žižek, Linda and Michael Hutcheon's notion of production, and musical semiotics found in Robert Hatten's concept of troping in order to provide original interpretive models for conceptualizing new operatic narratives.<br>

  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): PARKIN DAVID<br>
  Abstract: William C. Olsen, Walter E. A. van Beek, and the contributors to this volume seek to understand how Africans have confronted evil around them. Grouped around notions of evil as a cognitive or experiential problem, evil as malevolent process, and evil as an inversion of justice, these essays investigate what can be accepted and what must be condemned in order to evaluate being and morality in African cultural and social contexts. These studies of evil entanglements take local and national histories and identities into account, including state politics and civil war, religious practices, Islam, gender, and modernity.<br>

However, politics also has to do with the prevention of lawlessness and insecurity; that is, it concerns law and order, the implementation of the rights of persons, conflict resolution and social integration.<br>

  Book Title: Mexico in Verse-A History of Music, Rhyme, and Power<br>
  Publisher: University of Arizona Press<br>
  Author(s): BEEZLEY WILLIAM H.<br>
  Abstract: The history of Mexico is spoken in the voice of ordinary people. In rhymed verse and mariachi song, in letters of romance and whispered words in the cantina, the heart and soul of a nation is revealed in all its intimacy and authenticity.
      Mexico in Verse, edited by Stephen Neufeld and Michael Matthews, examines Mexican history through its poetry and music, the spoken and the written word.Focusing on modern Mexico, from 1840 to the 1980s, this volume examines the cultural venues in which people articulated their understanding of the social, political, and economic change they witnessed taking place during times of tremendous upheaval, such as the Mexican-American War, the Porfiriato, and the Mexican Revolution. The words of diverse peoples-people of the street, of the field, of the cantinas-reveal the development of the modern nation. Neufeld and Matthews have chosen sources so far unexplored by Mexicanist scholars in order to investigate the ways that individuals interpreted-whether resisting or reinforcing-official narratives about formative historical moments.The contributors offer new research that reveals how different social groups interpreted and understood the Mexican experience. The collected essays cover a wide range of topics: military life, railroad accidents, religious upheaval, children's literature, alcohol consumption, and the 1985 earthquake. Each chapter provides a translated song or poem that encourages readers to participate in the interpretive practice of historical research and cultural scholarship. In this regard,Mexico in Verseserves both as a volume of collected essays and as a classroom-ready primary document reader.<br>

  Abstract: The modern age is no stranger to the cabinet of curiosities, the freak show, or a drawer full of odds and ends. These collections of oddities engagingly work against the rationality and order of the conventional archive found in a university, a corporation, or a governmental holding. In form, methodology, and content, The Year's Work in the Oddball Archive offers a counterargument to a more reasoned form of storing and recording the avant-garde (or the post-avant-garde), the perverse, the off, the bent, the absurd, the quirky, the weird, and the queer. To do so, it positions itself within the history of mirabilia launched by curiosity cabinets starting in the mid-fifteenth century and continuing to the present day. These archives (or are they counter-archives?) are located in unexpected places-the doorways of Katrina homes, the cavity of a cow, the remnants of extinct animals, an Internet site-and they offer up "alternate modes of knowing" to the traditional archive.<br>

  Abstract: This important volume investigates the many forms of Catholic activism in Latin America between the 1890s and 1962 (from the publication of the papal encyclical Rerum Novarum to the years just prior to the Second Vatican Council). It argues that this period saw a variety of lay and clerical responses to the social changes wrought by industrialization, political upheavals and mass movements, and increasing secularization. Spurred by these local developments as well as by initiatives from the Vatican, and galvanized by national projects of secular state-building, Catholic activists across Latin America developed new ways of organizing in order to effect social and political change within their communities.<br>

  Book Title: Radical Theology-An Essay on Faith and Theology in the Twenty-First Century<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Dalferth Ingolf U.<br>
  Abstract: Ingolf U. Dalferth develops a “radical theology" that unfolds the orienting strength of faith for human life from the event of God’s presence to every present. In a concise and clear manner, Dalferth outlines the theological and philosophical approaches to hermeneutics in the modern era, in order to promote a convincing and defensible theology for the twenty-first century, critically carrying on Martin Heidegger and Rudolf Bultmann, without forgetting Karl Barth. The result of his reconstruction is a “radical theology" that neither glorifies premodern theology in an antimodern attitude nor seeks a mystical deepening of the secular, but argues for a radical change in theological perspective of the possible. In doing so, theology unfolds “limit concepts" that restrict the claims of science and philosophy critically, and develops “ideas of orientation" that illumine the ways in which human life is understood and lived in radically new ways in faith. From here, Dalferth unfolds the reality of revelation and the Christian sense of an unconditional hope that fundamentally transcends all beliefs based on mundane realities and orients the world on something beyond its own temporal horizon—its loving Creator.<br>

In its concern with epochs, mentalities, and collective representations, it uses anthropology as a repository of concepts, methods, and empirical data that historians can raid.

  Book Title: Identity and Networks-Gender and Ethnicity in a Cross-Cultural Context<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Webber Jonathan<br>
  Abstract: Contrary to the negative assessments of the social order that have become prevalent in the media since 9/11, this wide-ranging collection of essays, mostly by social anthropologists, focuses instead on the enormous social creativity being invested as collective identities are reconfigured. Using fieldwork findings drawn from Africa, Asia, and Europe, special emphasis is placed on the reformulation of ethnic and gender relationships and identities in the cultural, social, political, and religious realms of public life. Under what circumstances does trust arise, paving the way for friendship, collegiality, knowledge creation, national unity, or emergence of leadership? How is social life constructed as a collective endeavour? Does the means towards sociability become its end? And what can be said about the agency and collegiality of women? The inspiration for examining these conundrums is the work and persona of Shirley Ardener, to whom the volume is dedicated.<br>

  Abstract: Identity categories are at the core of anthropological practice, in terms of both individual identities (or notions of the self ) and collective identities (or notions of ethnicity). In this chapter I shall deal primarily with the interface between the self and the collectivity in order to discuss identity as a response to multiple actualities rather than a fixed frame of subjectivity. This tallies with other attempts at understanding the self as composite and malleable (Cohen 1994; Rapport 1997). It also in its own way reflects the insight of relational identities provided by scholars of gender such as Shirley Ardener<br>

  Abstract: Virtually every cultural minority in America has had to face exclusion, forced conformity, and subordination. All these patterns are variations on the same theme: those who are different cannot belong as full members of the community. The victims of cultural domination, therefore, face a serious problem: they must necessarily live their lives within the larger society, and in order to define themselves they must satisfy their basic needs for connection. They may choose to turn inward to the solidarity of the excluded group, banding together to confront the larger society. Alternatively, individual members of the cultural minority may, as to<br>

  Abstract: From its earliest beginnings, Christianity has had trouble finding a proper role for nature. While the ancient concept of
                  naturacontained strong overtones of a mythological kind, linking natural generation not only with demiurgic guidance, as in Plato’sTimaeus, but also with sexual desire, as in Plato’sSymposium, in the later Neoplatonism of Proclus and others such mythological aspects were muted as philosophically stratified forms of organic emanation. The cosmos should above all present traits of rational adornment, it seemed, as the order of nature could only survive by repressing its more animal-like instinctual impulses.

  Abstract: Incarnation, in the first place, refers to the condition of a being who possesses a body or, more precisely, a flesh. Are the body and the flesh thus the same thing? Like every fundamental question, the question of the body—or of the flesh—points back to a phenomenological foundation on the basis of which it can be elucidated. A phenomenological foundation should be understood as a pure appearing that is presupposed by everything else that appears to us. This pure appearing must appear first in order for anything else to appear and to be shown to us. Phenomenology is<br>

  Book Title: Re-treating Religion: Deconstructing Christianity with Jean-Luc Nancy-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Nancy Jean-Luc<br>
  Abstract: One of the most complicated and ambiguous tendencies in contemporary western societies is the phenomenon referred to as the turn to religion.In philosophy, one of the most original thinkers critically questioning this turnis Jean-Luc Nancy. Re-treating Religion is the first volume to analyze his long-term project The Deconstruction of Christianity,especially his major statement of it in Dis-Enclosure.Nancy conceives monotheistic religion and secularization not as opposite worldviews that succeed each other in time but rather as springing from the same history. This history consists in a paradoxical tendency to contest one's own foundations-whether God, truth, origin, humanity, or rationality-as well as to found itself on the void of this contestation. Nancy calls this unique combination of self-contestation and self-foundation the self-deconstructionof the Western world.The book includes discussion with Nancy himself, who contributes a substantial Preambleand a concluding dialogue with the volume editors. The contributions follow Nancy in tracing the complexities of Western culture back to the persistent legacy of monotheism, in order to illuminate the tensions and uncertainties we face in the twenty-first century.<br>

  Book Title: Writings on Medicine-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Meyers Todd<br>
  Abstract: At the time of his death in 1995, Georges Canguilhem was a highly respected historian of science and medicine, whose engagement with questions of normality, the ideologization of scientific thought, and the conceptual history of biology had marked the thought of philosophers such as Michel Foucault, Louis Althusser, Pierre Bourdieu, and Gilles Deleuze. This collection of short, incisive, and highly accessible essays on the major concepts of modern medicine shows Canguilhem at the peak of his use of historical practice for philosophical engagement. In order to elaborate a philosophy of medicine, Canguilhem examines paramount problems such as the definition and uses of health, the decline of the Hippocratic understanding of nature, the experience of disease, the limits of psychology in medicine, myths and realities of therapeutic practices, the difference between cure and healing, the organism's self-regulation, and medical metaphors linking the organism to society. Writings on Medicine is at once an excellent introduction to Canguilhem's work and a forceful, insightful, and accessible engagement with elemental concepts in medicine. The book is certain to leave its imprint on anthropology, history, philosophy, bioethics, and the social studies of medicine.<br>

From Foucault we know the importance of the iterative structures both materially and discursively that sustains subjectivities through various disciplines, such as the trained sinews of the soldiers body that remind him that he is no longer a peasant but a well trained disciplined soldier. However, when this iterability fails, both materially and discursively then there is a crisis of being.<br>

  Author(s): O’Connor Terry<br>
  Abstract: This volume is derived, in concept, from a conference held in honour of John Evans by the School of History and Archaeology and The Prehistoric Society at Cardiff University in March 2006. It brings together papers that address themes and landscapes on a variety of levels. They cover geographical, methodological and thematic areas that were of interest to, and had been studied by, John Evans. The volume is divided into five sections, which echo themes of importance in British prehistory. They include papers on aspects of environmental archaeology, experiments and philosophy; new research on the nature of woodland on the chalklands of southern England; coasts and islands; people, process and social order, and snails and shells - a strong part of John Evans' career. This volume presents a range of papers examining people's interaction with the landscape in all its forms. The papers provide a diverse but cohesive picture of how archaeological landscapes are viewed within current research frameworks and approaches, while also paying tribute to the innovative and inspirational work of one of the leading protagonists of environmental archaeology and the holistic approach to landscape interpretation.<br>

Christ’s lordship is universal, knowing no bounds and hindered by no opposing powers. Hence, even in their continuing rebellion, the powers are instruments of divine order. This instrumentalization of the powers denies them their autonomy, and is part of their redemptive subordination.

  Book Title: Lyrical Theology of Charles Wesley - Expanded Edition-A Reader<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Kimbrough S.T.<br>
  Abstract: One of the difficulties in studying the theology of Wesleyan hymns and sacred poems is that it is couched in a literary and liturgical art form that does not fit into the usual intellectual paths defined over the last two centuries for the study of theology, which tends to be a prose endeavour. Charles Wesley composed a number of thematic collections of hymns, such as those based on the Christian year, e.g., Hymns for the Nativity of our Lord, Hymns for our Lord’s Resurrection, Hymns for Ascension-Day, Hymns for Whitsunday, but his lyrics on a plethora of theological themes, such as sanctification, perfection, holiness, etc., are scattered throughout his over 9,000 hymns and poems from a writing and publishing career that spanned almost fifty years. One of the primary purposes of this volume is to bring together a collection of hymns and sacred poems representative of Charles Wesley’s theological thinking. The texts are organized within a theological outline in order to make the study of his theological ideas and concepts more readily accessible, though many of them could be placed in diverse theological categories. This is a welcome addition to Wesleyan scholarship and a book that all those who sing Wesley's hymns will be interested in.<br>

  Book Title: Grasping Truth and Reality-Lesslie Newbigin's Theology of Mission to the Western World<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Le Roy Stults Donald<br>
  Abstract: When Lesslie Newbigin returned to Britain in 1974 after years of missionary service, he observed that his homeland was as much a mission field as India, where he had spent the majority of his missionary career. He concluded that the Western world needed a missionary confrontation. Instead of the traditional approach to missions, however, Newbigin realized that the Western world needed to be confronted theologically. From his earliest days at Cambridge University, Newbigin developed the theological convictions that shaped his understanding of the Christian faith, and he used these theological convictions as criteria to evaluate the belief system of Western culture and to provide an answer to its dilemma. The Enlightenment reintroduced humanism and dualism into Western culture, which resulted on the loss of purpose and the rise of skepticism. This book discusses Newbigin's theological convictions and how they factored into both his critique of and his solution to Western culture's spiritual and worldview problems. Donald Le Roy cleverly explains Newbigin's solution to reintroduce the Christian belief system into Western culture in order to restore purpose and truth to Westerners and put them back in contact with true reality through Jesus Christ.<br>

During the long years of their separation, he made no effort to retrieve her from Saul’s sphere but found time to meet with Jonathan more than once.

  Book Title: Theology in Language, Rhetoric, and Beyond-Essays in Old and New Testament<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Lundbom Jack R.<br>
  Abstract: Theology in Language, Rhetoric, and Beyond' places before a broad audience of students and general readers theological essays on both the Old and New Testaments. Theology is seen to derive from a number of sources: the biblical language, biblical rhetoric and composition, academic disciplines other than philosophy, and above all a careful exegesis of the biblical text. The essay on Psalm 23 makes use of anthropology and human-development theory; the essay on Deuteronomy incorporates Wisdom themes; the essay called "Jeremiah and the Created Order" looks at ideas not only about God and creation but also about the seldom-considered idea of God and a return to chaos; and the essay on the "Confessions of Jeremiah" examines, not the words that this extraordinary prophet was given by God to preach, but what he himself felt and experienced in the office to which he was called. One essay on "Biblical and theological themes" includes a translation into the African language of Lingala, which weaves together the story of early Christianity with the more recent founding of churches in Africa and Asia. Jack R. Lundbom argues eloquently through these essays that theology is rooted in biblical words, in themselves, in rhetoric and their different contexts.<br>

  Abstract: It is now time to quickly review where we have come from in order to situate where we have arrived and anticipate next steps. The preceding has attempted to do theology dialogically, with twelve conversation partners, in order to exemplify an effective model of Christian theological inquiry at the beginning of the third millennium. I have also shown that such a dialogical approach is theologically funded by a pneumatological imagination as manifest particularly in the Acts narrative. Further, such a pneumatologically inspired dialogical method may be uniquely suited to enable navigation of our postfoundationalist, post-Christendom, postsecular, postmodern, and pluralistic landscape.<br>

Divine travail, of course, increased divine risk or vulnerability with respect to unfaithful humans in all of their misery. Thus, while God voluntarily endured the agony of divine sacrifice,<br>

  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>
  Author(s): Rampton David<br>
  Abstract: More than fifty years after the publication of
      Anatomy of Criticism, Northrop Frye remains one of Canada's most influential intellectuals. This reappraisal reasserts the relevance of his work to the study of literature and illuminates its fruitful intersection with a variety of other fields, including film, cultural studies, linguistics, and feminism. Many of the contributors draw upon the early essays, correspondence, and diaries recently published as part of theCollected Works of Northrop Fryeseries, in order to explore the development of his extraordinary intellectual range and the implications of his imaginative syntheses. They refute postmodernist arguments that Frye's literary criticism is obsolete and propose his wide-ranging and non-linear ways of thinking as a model for twenty-first century readers searching for innovative ways of understanding literature and its relevance to contiguous disciplines. The volume provides an in-depth examination of Frye's work on a range of literary questions, periods, and genres, as well as a consideration of his contributions to literary theory, philosophy, and theology. The portrait that emerges is that of a writer who still has much to offer those interested in literature and the ways it represents and transforms our world. The book's overall argument is that Frye's case for the centrality of the imagination has never been more important where understanding history, reconciling science and culture, or reconceptualizing social change is concerned.<br>

Grace, as we have seen, calls nature into being precisely so that grace can charge nature with its life.

  Author(s): ABBOTT FRANK A.<br>
  Abstract: There are many analyses of Tractarianism – a nineteenth-century form of Anglicanism that emphasized its Catholic origins – but how did people in the colonies react to the High Church movement? Beating against the Wind, a study in nineteenth-century vernacular spirituality, emphasizes the power of faith on a shifting frontier in a transatlantic world. Focusing on people living along the Newfoundland and Labrador coast, Calvin Hollett presents a nuanced perspective on popular resistance to the colonial emissary Bishop Edward Feild and his spiritual regimen of order, silence, and solemnity. Whether by outright opposing Bishop Feild, or by simply ignoring his wishes and views, or by brokering a hybrid style of Gothic architecture, the people of Newfoundland and Labrador demonstrated their independence in the face of an attempt at hierarchical ascendency upon the arrival of Tractarianism in British North America. Instead, they continued to practise evangelical Anglicanism and participate in Methodist revivals, and thereby negotiated a popular Protestantism, one often infused with the spirituality of other seafarers from Nova Scotia and New England. Exploring the interaction between popular spirituality and religious authority, Beating against the Wind challenges the traditional claim of Feild’s success in bringing Tractarianism to the colony while exploring the resistance to Feild’s initiatives and the reasons for his disappointments.There are many analyses of Tractarianism – a nineteenth-century form of Anglicanism that emphasized its Catholic origins – but how did people in the colonies react to the High Church movement?

  Abstract: So far I have discussed conventional kinship organization among the Grecanici, based predominantly on sharing the same blood. Alongside blood kin, further lines of relatedness are pursued that create equally strong politicized links between the related parties, thus forming dense networks for minority governance. This chapter discusses

Civil society factions are predominantly based on friendship, godparenthood, and kinship, creating an ultra-dense matrix for claims to national and international resources available for the governance of the linguistic minority.

  Abstract: "We tell ourselves stories in order to live," Joan Didion observed in
         The White Album. Why is this? Michael Austin asks, inUseful Fictions. Why, in particular, are human beings, whose very survival depends on obtaining true information, so drawn to fictional narratives? After all, virtually every human culture reveres some form of storytelling. Might there be an evolutionary reason behind our species' need for stories?<br>

  Book Title: Forms of Life-Character and Moral Imagination in the Novel<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): PRICE MARTIN<br>
  Abstract: Martin Price writes here about ways in which character has been conceived and presented in the novels of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Beginning with chapters that cogently argue the artistic value of character, Price then deals with the different forms character has taken in individual novels. His first discussions center on authors-Jane Austen, Stendhal, Charles Dickens, George Eliot, and Leo Tolstoy-who define individuals by their adherence or opposition to social norms. The next chapters deal with novelists for whom the moral world is largely internalized. The characters of Henry James, Joseph Conrad, D.H. Lawrence, and E.M. Forster live in society and act upon it, but the authors are particularly concerned with the confusions, terrors, and heroism that lie within consciousness. The last chapter uses novels about the artist by James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, and Thomas Mann in order to apprehend the process by which experience is transformed into art.<br>

  Abstract: It is difficult to account for the remarkable sense of depth as well as breadth we feel in reading Tolstoy. Sir Isaiah Berlin, in describing that sense, has come closer than anyone else to explaining it. Tolstoy’s heroes achieve a kind of serenity through coming to accept “the permanent relationships of things and the universal texture of human life.” Through them we become aware of an order underlying and perhaps girding the world of our experience. It is an order which “ ‘contains’ and determines the structure of experience, the framework on which it—that is, we and all we<br>

  Abstract: “Radical interpretation” means the redescription, in one’s own language, of sentences from an alien system of concepts and beliefs. My thought is that this idea describes, in a rough, preliminary sort of way, the logic of allegorical interpretation, at least in the case of someone like Philo Judaeus, who lived in Alexandria about the time of Christ and produced a number of commentaries on the Septuagint, the (almost legendary) Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, in order to make sense of it in terms of the concepts and beliefs of Hellenistic culture.

  Abstract: In may 1990 a woman made a pilgrimage to Tinos in order to fulfill a vow.¹ In and of itself, this was an event so common as hardly to be worthy of notice. This particular woman, however, was more famous than most of the pilgrims who come to Tinos. She was a former Olympic airline stewardess and former mistress (and now wife) of the recently defeated Socialist prime minister Andreas Papandreou. Their affair prior to Papandreou’s divorce from his American-born wife had received considerable attention in the press, and may have helped contribute to the downfall of the Socialist government.²<br>

  Abstract: The present discussion is not exclusively devoted to the thought and work of Jacques Derrida. It is rather an attempt to bring the reading and discussion of Derrida in relation with other texts, and other heritages, in order to illustrate how his manner of philosophizing has transformed our understanding of certain fundamental problems. I would argue that what distinguishes his specific practice of deconstruction is the way in which it displaces the classical question of the “paradoxes of the universal,” if only because it dismantles the metaphysical opposition between the universal and the particular, along with that of the absolute<br>

While imperialist Europe may have dominated the nineteenth-century’s imagination of civilization, in the wake of two world wars, the twentieth century witnessed the dislocation of a geopolitics dominated by European imperialist expansion, and the establishment of a new global political order increasingly dominated by the capitalist market economy and American foreign policy.

  Abstract: “In common sense as well as in scholarship,” writes Eva Illouz, “romantic love stands above the realm of commodity exchange and even against the social order.”¹ Indeed, Illouz’s research on love in capitalist culture begins by expanding on this common divide; whereas the concept of “romantic love” is predicated on the private sphere, irrationality, selflessness, and singularity, the capitalist market is associated with the public sphere, rationality, self-interest, and interchangeability. However, working against this division, Illouz shows how the very modern construction of romantic love is paradoxically shaped by the forces of the capitalist market itself. In a similar vein,<br>

  Abstract: There is an influential historical consensus that 1960s radicalism in Britain had no significant or lasting impact on the social and political order. In this view, the longer-term effects of the ideas and movements, often associated with the climactic year of 1968, have been confined to popular culture, life-styles and inter-personal relations. It is said that political institutions remained unperturbed and almost unaffected by the intellectual and ideological ferment occurring in the arts, media, universities, street politics and youth cultures. From this historical-empiricist perspective the significance of ’68 in Britain was apolitical and confined to the personal and cultural sphere<br>

It is a practice constituting subjectivity, personal, partial and particularistic bonds, and at the same time it articulates specific moral/ethical expectations of behaviour and universalistic demands.¹ Friendship fosters goodness, reciprocity and generosity, entails mutual trust, solidarity and cooperation. Thus, it creates both social ties and is related to the political order of a community, its ethical prerequisites and the ways in which common matters are negotiated.<br>

This study seeks to show that comprehending the transformation of culture in the modern world requires taking into account the transformation of society as a whole.

It seems to me that, in order to be fruitful, this contribution must avoid two extremes.

  Book Title: Children of God in the World-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): O’Callaghan Paul<br>
  Abstract: Children of God in the World is a textbook of theological anthropology structured in four parts. The first attempts to clarify the relationship between theology, philosophy and science in their respective approaches to anthropology, and establishes the fundamental principle of the text, stated in Vatican II's Gaudium et spes, n. 22, "Christ manifests man to man." The second part provides a historical overview of the doctrine of grace: in Scripture (especially the teaching of the book of Genesis on humans 'made in the image of God', as well as Paul and John), among the Fathers (in particular the oriental doctrine of 'divinization' and Augustine), during the Middle Ages (especially Thomas Aquinas) and the Reformation period (centered particularly on Luther and the Council of Trent), right up to modern times. The third part of the text, the central one, provides a systematic understanding of Christian grace in terms of the God's life present in human believers by which they become children of God, disciples, friends and brothers of Christ, temples of the Holy Spirit. This section also provides a reflection on the theological virtues (faith, hope and charity), on the relationship between grace and human freedom, on the role of the Church and Christian apostolate in the communication of grace, and on the need humans have for divine grace. After considering the relationship between the natural and the supernatural order, the fourth and last part deals with different philosophical aspects of the human condition, in the light of Christian faith: the union between body and soul, humans as free, historical, social, sexual and working beings. The last chapter concludes with a consideration of the human person, Christianity's greatest and most enduring contribution to human thought.<br>

Believing that language possesses its own reality, I intend to follow, in O’Connor’s phrase, “words moving secretly toward some goal of their own.” Her metaphors are rarely simple resemblances or satisfying correspondences between man and a natural order, as those of Eudora Welty and Wallace Stevens often are. An apocalyptic poet like T. S. Eliot, O’Connor finds limited value in analogies with the physical world and<br>

  Abstract: When confronted by Phaedra’s desire, Euripides’ Hippolytus retreats to a Utopian vision of sexless, or rather womanless, reproduction. As an alternative to procreation from women, he desiderates the acquisition of offspring by leaving gold, silver, or bronze in the temples of Zeus (
                     Hipp.616-24).¹ Seneca’s hero, confronted with Phaedra, takes refuge not in an imaginary social order outside of time or in a timeless present, but in a historical construction, an idealized image of the Golden Age (483-564).<br>

  Book Title: Sanctity as literature in late medieval Britain-  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): BERNAU ANKE<br>
  Abstract: Explores how sanctity and questions of literariness are intertwined across a range of medieval genres.This collection explores some of the many ways in which sanctity was closely intertwined with the development of literary strategies across a range of writings in late medieval Britain. Rather than looking for clues in religious practices in order to explain such changes, or reading literature for information about sanctity, these essays consider the ways in which sanctity - as concept and as theme - allowed writers to articulate and to develop further their 'craft' in specific ways. While scholars in recent years have turned once more to questions of literary form and technique, the kinds of writings considered in this collection - writings that were immensely popular in their own time - have not attracted the same amount of attention as more secular forms. The collection as a whole offers new insights for scholars interested in form, style, poetics, literary history and aesthetics, by considering sanctity first and foremost as literature<br>

Instead of restricting his role to deflating metaphysics, which, as he saw it, assumed a universe governed by the commanding self-consciousness of a thinking subject (Derrida’s charge against Husserl), Derrida turned to Jewish tradition and, at different moments, to Nietzsche in order to stake a far wider claim for his philosophy.

  Book Title: Simplexity-Simplifying Principles for a Complex World'<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Weiss Giselle<br>
  Abstract: In a sense, the history of living organisms may be summed up by their remarkable ability to find solutions that avoid the world's complexity by imposing on it their own rules and functions. Evolution has resolved the problem of complexity not by simplifying but by finding solutions whose processes-though they can sometimes be complex-allow us to act in the midst of complexity and of uncertainty. Nature can inspire us by making us realize that simplification is never simple and requires instead that we choose, refuse, connect, and imagine, in order to act in the best possible manner. Such solutions are already being applied in design and engineering and are significant in biology, medicine, economics, and the behavioral sciences.<br>

  Abstract: What is sin? Is it simply wrongdoing? Why do its effects linger over time? In this sensitive, imaginative, and original work, Gary Anderson shows how changing conceptions of sin and forgiveness lay at the very heart of the biblical tradition. Spanning nearly two thousand years, the book brilliantly demonstrates how sin, once conceived of as a physical burden, becomes, over time, eclipsed by economic metaphors. Transformed from a weight that an individual carried, sin becomes a debt that must be repaid in order to be redeemed in God's eyes.<br>

  Abstract: Writers are different from other people. Not all writers—not those who write only for wages—but the poets, novelists, and essayists who believe they have no choice in the matter, who feel no less compelled to write than to think, and who therefore receive the continuing news of their existence as potential lines on a page. For them, what happens happens in order to be turned into verse or prose. And so literature itself may be understood as sheer ego channeled into print, undertaken with the perfect conviction that experience is concluded only upon being written down.<br>

A historical and comparative overview of related terms – exile, émigré, expatriation, travel, emigration/immigration, diaspora, and nomadism – helps us understand displacement as a dynamic migrant experience that may range from being totally negative to very positive. Exiles are reconciled to their present predicament and have nostalgic feelings for the past; émigrés are actively involved in the contemporary literary process in the homeland and seek to return; emigrants/immigrants integrate and adapt themselves<br>

  Abstract: The only undeniable information one can have access to is that they were living people, and now they are dead. Apart from this information, there is an accumulation of discursive constructions in which the deaths of people are used in media images and political discourses in order to endorse a given logic or strategy in the battle for recognition and power. However, the statement of passage from life to death is more than a referential base. It is a way of reinstating an ethic of recognizing the Other. It traces a path towards self-reflection that demands new and different solutions.<br>

  Book Title: The Vision of the Soul-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): Wilson James Matthew<br>
  Abstract: Ours is an age full of desires but impoverished in its understanding of where those desires lead-an age that claims mastery over the world but also claims to find the world as a whole absurd or unintelligible. In
      The Vision of the Soul, James Matthew Wilson seeks to conserve the great insights of the western tradition by giving us a new account of them responsive to modern discontents. The western- or Christian Platonist-tradition, he argues, tells us that man is an intellectual animal, born to pursue the good, to know the true, and to contemplate all things in beauty. Wilson begins by reconceiving the intellectual conservatism born of Edmund Burke's jeremiad against the French Revolution as an eff­ort to preserve the West's vision of man and the cosmos as ordered by and to beauty. After defining the achievement of that vision and its tradition, Wilson off­ers an extended study of the nature of beauty and the role of the fine arts in shaping a culture but above all in opening the human intellect to the perception of the form of reality. Through close studies of Theodor W. Adorno and Jacques Maritain, he recovers the classical vision of beauty as a revelation of truth and being. Finally, he revisits the ancient distinction between reason and story-telling, between mythos and logos, in order to rejoin the two.Story-telling is foundational to the forms of the fine arts, but it is no less foundational to human reason. Human life in turn constitutes a specific kind of form-a story form. The ancient conception of human life as a pilgrimage to beauty itself is one that we can fully embrace only if we see the essential correlation between reason and story and the essential convertibility of truth, goodness and beauty in beauty. By turns a study in fundamental ontology, aesthetics, and political philosophy, Wilson's book invites its readers to a renewal of the West's intellectual tradition.<br>

  Abstract: What has contemporary China inherited from its revolutionary past? How do the realities and memories, aesthetics and practices of the Mao era still reverberate in the post-Mao cultural landscape? The essays in this volume propose “red legacies" as a new critical framework from which to examine the profusion of cultural productions and afterlives of the communist revolution in order to understand China’s continuities and transformations from socialism to postsocialism. Organized into five parts—red foundations, red icons, red classics, red bodies, and red shadows—the book’s interdisciplinary contributions focus on visual and performing arts, literature and film, language and thought, architecture, museums, and memorials. Mediating at once unfulfilled ideals and unmourned ghosts across generations, red cultural legacies suggest both inheritance and debt, and can be mobilized to support as well as to critique the status quo.<br>

  Abstract: This accessible book is structured around six philosophical ideas concerning our relations with others: values, morality, aesthetics, order, rules and respect. Using examples from a range of countries, it provides a platform for engaging with important topical issues.Philosophical criminology asks big questions about how we get on with one another and what happens when we do not. This accessible book in the New Horizons in Criminology series is the first to foreground this growing area. The book is structured around six philosophical ideas concerning our relations with others: values, morality, aesthetics, order, rules and respect. Building on the author’s theoretical and empirical research, the book considers the boundaries of criminology and the scope for greater exchange between criminology and philosophy. The book is illustrated using examples from a range of countries, and provides a platform for engaging with important topical issues using philosophical and theoretical insights.<br>

  Abstract: So far this book has considered philosophical ideas of values, morality, aesthetics, order and rules and how they relate to criminological concern. This chapter explores a positive way forward centred on the concept of respect. The meaning of ‘respect’ has been a concern for moral philosophy for some time (for example Darwall, 1977; Dworkin, 1977; Hill, 2000; Bagnoli, 2007; Carter, 2011). Much of this work draws, at least in part, on the writings of Immanuel Kant centred on the categorical imperative (see Chapter Three) and the notion of human dignity, that ‘respect for the moral law entails treating persons (oneself<br>

  Abstract: Mapmaking can be a process by which individuals orient themselves and navigate from place to place. The process of mapmaking can also be used as a tool for understanding one’s sense of place. The mapmaking experience is rooted in what Sobel (1998, p 5) identifies as ‘our visual, kinesthetic, and emotional experiences’. As a visual method, mapmaking provides one example of how individuals engage with place. Individuals throughout the lifecourse – from young children to ageing adults – influence and are influenced by place.

  Book Title: Divine Simplicity-A Biblical and Trinitarian Account<br>
  Publisher: Fortress Press<br>
  Author(s): BARRETT JORDAN P.<br>
  Abstract: Divine Simplicityengages recent critics and address one of their major concerns: that the doctrine of divine simplicity is not a biblical teaching. By analyzing the use of Scripture by key theologians from the early church to Karl Barth, Barrett finds that divine simplicity developed in order to respond to theological errors (e.g., Eunomianism) and to avoid misreading Scripture. The volume then explains how divine simplicity can be rearticulated by following a formal analogy from the doctrine of the Trinity in which the divine attributes are identical to the divine essence but are not identical to each other.<br>

  Book Title: Negative Cosmopolitanism-Cultures and Politics of World Citizenship after Globalization<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): TOMSKY TERRI<br>
  Abstract: From climate change, debt, and refugee crises to energy security, environmental disasters, and terrorism, the events that lead nightly newscasts and drive public policy demand a global perspective. In the twentieth century the world sought solutions through formal institutions of international governance such as the United Nations, the International Criminal Court, and the World Bank, but present-day responses to global realities are often more provisional, improvisational, and contingent. Tracing this uneven history in order to identify principal actors, contesting ideologies, and competing rhetoric, Negative Cosmopolitanism challenges the Kantian ideal of cosmopolitanism as the precondition for a perpetual global peace. Uniting literary scholars with researchers working on contemporary problems and those studying related issues of the past – including slavery, industrial capitalism, and corporate imperialism – essays in this volume scrutinize the entanglement of cosmopolitanism within expanding networks of trade and global capital from the eighteenth century to the present. By doing so, the contributors pinpoint the ways in which whole populations have been unwillingly caught up in a capitalist reality that has little in common with the earlier ideals of cosmopolitanism. A model for provoking new and necessary questions about neoliberalism, biopolitics, colonialism, citizenship, and xenophobia, Negative Cosmopolitanism establishes a fresh take on the representation of globalization and modern life in history and literature.

This order was to be led by a "good European" cultural elite whose goal would be to encourage the rebirth of Greek high culture. In relocating Nietzsche's politics to their own time, the book offers not only a novel reading of the philosopher but also a more accurate picture of why his political thought remains so relevant today.<br>

Cycles of estrangement invariably follow those of familiarisation, as Heaney seeks to recapture something of the ‘outsider’s’ perspective in order to revitalise the poetic energy that familiarity saps from the world around him.

  Book Title: The Ambiguous Allure of the West-Traces of the Colonial in Thailand<br>
  Publisher: Hong Kong University Press, HKU<br>
  Author(s): Chakrabarty Dipesh<br>
  Abstract: The book brings studies of modern Thai history and culture into dialogue with debates in comparative intellectual history, Asian cultural studies, and postcolonial studies. It takes Thai Studies in new directions through case studies of the cultural hybridity and ambivalences that have emerged from the manifold interactions between Siam/Thailand and the West from 1850 to the present day. Central aims of The Ambiguous Allure of the West are to critique notions of Thai "uniqueness" or "exceptionalism" and locate Thai Studies in a broader, comparative perspective by arguing that modern Siam/Thailand needs to be understood as a semicolonial society. In contrast to conservative nationalist and royalist accounts of Thai history and culture, which resist comparing the country to its once-colonized Asian neighbours, this book's contributors highlight the value of postcolonial analysis in understanding the complexly ambiguous, interstitial, liminal and hybrid character of Thai/Western cultural interrelationships. At the same time, by pointing to the distinctive position of semicolonial societies in the Western-dominated world order, the chapters in this book make significant contributions to developing the critical theoretical perspectives of international cultural studies. The contributors demonstrate how the disciplines of history, anthropology, political science, film and cultural studies all enhance these contestations in intersecting ways, and across different historical moments. Each of the chapters raises manifold themes and questions regarding the nature of intercultural exchange, interrogated through theoretically critical lenses. This book directs its discussions at those studying not only in the fields of Thai and Southeast Asian studies but also in colonial and postcolonial studies, Asian cultural studies, film studies and comparative critical theory.<br>

                  The Idiot.² This condensed set of idea-signals points not only to the problem content ofThe Idiot, but to the complex dialectic of Dostoevsky’s esthetic thought. The first phrase, “Beauty will save the world,” is a model of syntactic precision and order; it promises direct, unimpeded action. But the second phrase is disruptive; it shatters the integrity of the beauty-savior and bogs down the action in ambiguity and enigma. “Is it true, Prince, that you once said that ‘beauty will<br>

  Book Title: The Superstitious Muse-Thinking Russian Literature Mythopoetically<br>
  Publisher: Academic Studies Press<br>
  Author(s): Bethea David M.<br>
  Abstract: For several decades David Bethea has written authoritatively on the “mythopoetic thinking" that lies at the heart of classical Russian literature, especially Russian poetry. His theoretically informed essays and books have made a point of turning back to issues of intentionality and biography at a time when authorial agency seems under threat of “erasure" and the question of how writers, and poets in particular, live their lives through their art is increasingly moot. The lichnost’ (personhood, psychic totality) of the given writer is all-important, argues Bethea, as it is that which combines the specifically biographical and the capaciously mythical in verbal units that speak simultaneously to different planes of being. Pushkin’s Evgeny can be one incarnation of the poet himself and an Everyman rising up to challenge Peter’s new world order; Brodsky can be, all at once, Dante and Mandelstam and himself, the exile paying an Orphic visit to Florence (and, by ghostly association, Leningrad).This sort of metempsychosis, where the stories that constitute the Ur-texts of Russian literature are constantly reworked in the biographical myths shaping individual writers’ lives, is Bethea’s primary focus. This collection contains a liberal sampling of Bethea’s most memorable previously published essays along with new studies prepared for this occasion.<br>

  Book Title: Sonata Fragments-Romantic Narratives in Chopin, Schumann, and Brahms<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Davis Andrew<br>
  Abstract: In
      Sonata Fragments, Andrew Davis argues that the Romantic sonata is firmly rooted, both formally and expressively, in its Classical forebears, using Classical conventions in order to convey a broad constellation of Romantic aesthetic values. This claim runs contrary to conventional theories of the Romantic sonata that place this nineteenth-century musical form squarely outside inherited Classical sonata procedures. Building on Sonata Theory, Davis examines moments of fracture and fragmentation that disrupt the cohesive and linear temporality in piano sonatas by Chopin, Brahms, and Schumann. These disruptions in the sonata form are a narrative technique that signify temporal shifts during which we move from the outer action to the inner thoughts of a musical agent, or we move from the story as it unfolds to a flashback or flash-forward. Through an interpretation of Romantic sonatas as temporally multi-dimensional works in which portions of the music in any given piece can lie inside or outside of what Sonata Theory would define as the sonata-space proper, Davis reads into these ruptures a narrative of expressive features that mark these sonatas as uniquely Romantic.<br>

  Abstract: On levinas’s reading, formal conceptions of time depict a neutral order within which we experience events and beings. These accounts correlatively naturalize a subject who comprehends and controls her surroundings. When Levinas identifies the deformalization of time as central to his philosophical work, he is thus engaged in the critique of the image of subjectivity presupposed by formal conceptions of time. Starting in the late 1960s, Levinas describes time’s “meaningful content somehow prior to form” as traumatic: a responsibility for the other imposed on the subject, which consciousness is always too late to assimilate as a phenomenon (OUJ 232).<br>

Subjectivity turned to stone has also been linked (most notably in the wake of Benjamin’s reflections on Baudelaire) to another distinction—that between symbol and allegory in the aesthetics of poetic representation. In Baudelaire the petrified order of things signifies the death of the “symbol,” understood as the quasi-animistic, “living,” and embodying force of analogy and

  Abstract: Ancient Greece would seem to be the easy case when it comes to the axial age. Greece gave rise to a form of democracy based on decisions made after rational argument in the assembly; to philosophy, including formal logic (second-order reasoning); to at least the beginnings of science based on evidence and argument; not to mention that it also gave rise to extraordinary artistic and literary achievements. Some have been so overwhelmed by the culture of ancient Greece as to imagine a “Greek miracle” emerging, without forerunners or rivals, full-blown from the head of Zeus so to speak. The Greeks<br>

  Abstract: In order to assess the success or even just the specificity of a philosophical position, one must first have an understanding of what philosophy is, of its status and role. However, this is precisely what Marcel questioned, challenging, in particular, Western philosophy’s inbuilt assumption that to philosophize always entails building a system: ‘le propre d’une expérience en cours n’est-il pas [plutôt] de présenter une inconsistance fondamentale?’ (
                  RA: 291), he asks in ‘Regard en arrière’ (1947). The problem of consistency that Chapter 1 points to, it therefore emerged, subscribed to the very tradition that Marcel was contesting. His metaphysical discussions of<br>

  Book Title: The Signifying Self-Cervantine Drama as Counter-Perspective Aesthetic<br>
  Publisher: Modern Humanities Research Association<br>
  Author(s): Henry Melanie<br>
  Abstract: The Signifying Self: Cervantine Drama as Counter-Perspective Aesthetic offers a comprehensive analysis of all eight of Cervantes's Ocho comedias (published 1615), moving beyond conventional anti-Lope approaches to Cervantine dramatic practise in order to identify what, indeed, his theatre promotes. Considered on its own aesthetic terms, but also taking into account ontological and socio-cultural concerns, this study compels a re-assessment of Cervantes's drama and conflates any monolithic interpretations which do not allow for the textual interplay of contradictory and conflicting discourses which inform it. Cervantes's complex and polyvalent representation of freedom underpins such an approach; a concept which is considered to be a leitmotif of Cervantes's work but which has received scant attention with regards to his theatre. Investigation of this topic reveals not only Cervantes's rejection of established theatrical convention, but his preoccupation with the difficult relationship between the individual and the early modern Spanish world. Cervantes's comedias emerge as a counter-perspective to dominant contemporary Spanish ideologies and more orthodox artistic imaginings. Ultimately, The Signifying Self seeks to recuperate the Ocho comedias as a significant part of the Cervantine, and Golden-Age, canon and will be of interest and benefit to those scholars who work on Cervantes and indeed on early modern Spanish theatre in general.<br>

  Abstract: In traditional terminology, the world was conceived as a “cosmos,” that is, as an appealingly structured ensemble endowed with internal coherence and a high degree of intelligibility. In conformity with this conception, human societies were seen as small replicas of the cosmic order, replicas whose constituent elements were integrally related, with each fitting harmoniously into a preordained pattern. Since the onset of Western modernity, this orderly vision has been increasingly sundered or thrown into disarray. In large measure, the trajectory of modernity can be construed as a series of steadily deepening dualisms or polarities. In the course of this development,<br>

  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Nylund Anastasia<br>
  Abstract: Narratives are fundamental to our lives: we dream, plan, complain, endorse, entertain, teach, learn, and reminisce through telling stories. They provide hopes, enhance or mitigate disappointments, challenge or support moral order and test out theories of the world at both personal and communal levels. It is because of this deep embedding of narrative in everyday life that its study has become a wide research field including disciplines as diverse as linguistics, literary theory, folklore, clinical psychology, cognitive and developmental psychology, anthropology, sociology, and history. In
      Telling Storiesleading scholars illustrate how narratives build bridges among language, identity, interaction, society, and culture; and they investigate various settings such as therapeutic and medical encounters, educational environments, politics, media, marketing, and public relations. They analyze a variety of topics from the narrative construction of self and identity to the telling of stories in different media and the roles that small and big life stories play in everyday social interactions and institutions. These new reflections on the theory and analysis of narrative offer the latest tools to researchers in the fields of discourse analysis and sociolinguistics.<br>

  Book Title: Ethics in Light of Childhood-  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wall John<br>
  Abstract: Childhood faces humanity with its own deepest and most perplexing questions. An ethics that truly includes the world's childhoods would transcend pre-modern traditional communities and modern rational autonomy with a postmodern aim of growing responsibility. It would understand human relations in a poetic rather than universalistic sense as openly and interdependently creative. As a consequence, it would produce new understandings of moral being, time, and otherness, as well as of religion, rights, narrative, families, obligation, and power.
      Ethics in Light of Childhoodfundamentally reimagines ethical thought and practice in light of the experiences of the third of humanity who are children. Much like humanism, feminism, womanism, and environmentalism, Wall argues, a new childism is required that transforms moral thinking, relations, and societies in fundamental ways. Wall explores childhood's varied impacts on ethical thinking throughout history, advances the emerging interdisciplinary field of childhood studies, and reexamines basic assumptions in contemporary moral theory and practice. In the process, he does not just apply ethics to childhood but applies childhood to ethics-in order to imagine a more expansive humanity.<br>

  Abstract: At least in the Western context, our age is commonly referred to as that of “modernity”—a term sometimes qualified as “late modernity” or “post-modernity.” Taken by itself, the term is nondescript; in its literal sense, it simply means a time of novelty or innovation. Hence, something needs to be added to capture the kind of novelty involved. To pinpoint this innovation, modernity is also referred to as the “age of reason” or the age of enlightenment and science—in order to demarcate the period from a prior age presumably characterized by unreason, metaphysical speculation, and intellectual obscurantism or darkness.<br>

  Abstract: The concept of community has become central to constructions of Spanish identities since the transition to democracy. Contemporary Spain is witnessing a political, social, and economic resurgence of community, which both cuts across and is prioritized over nation. Yet few studies of contemporary Spanish culture deal with this concept. This book aims to fill a gap in Spanish cultural studies by providing an in-depth analysis of the intersections of theories, narratives, and concepts of community identities across a broad range of media. Literature, film, music, and photography are analysed here in order to explore the diverse means by which community is imagined and constructed.<br>

Attempts to draw clear-cut conclusions on community would result in a discursive stasis, whereby the larger context of modernity and postmodernity—as late modernity or an intensification of the tensions between discourse and practice that characterise modernity—would be lost. The notion of community in postmodern Spain can be seen to be foregrounded in political and cultural contexts over emphases on nation or state. Nevertheless, community is itself a problematic concept: necessarily fluid in order to survive in current contexts, yet loaded with the fixed structures<br>

  Book Title: Art and Its Uses in Thomas Mann's 'Felix Krull'-  Publisher: Modern Humanities Research Association<br>
  Author(s): Schonfield Ernest<br>
  Abstract: The turn of the twentieth century was a time of identity crisis for the upper and middle classes, one in which increased social mobility caused the blurring of traditional boundaries and created a need for reference works such as the British Who's Who (1897). At the same time, the rise of a new leisure industry and an increase in international travel led to a boom period for confidence men, who frequently operated in hotels and holiday resorts. Thomas Mann's "Felix Krull", written between 1910-13 and continued (though never completed) in 1951-54, uses contemporary accounts of these figures as a starting-point from which to explore the aesthetics of society. The early Krull marks an important stage in Mann's development in a number of respects.In writing it, Mann acquired a more flexible conception of identity and a new understanding of the relation between artist and public. Krull also signals a deeper engagement with Goethe and a shift in Mann's work towards a more open treatment of sexuality. The novel presents art as being central to the development of the individual and to social interaction. While Krull is nominally a confidence man, he is more of a performance artist, a purveyor of beauty who relies upon the complicity of his audience. The later Krull takes up where Mann left off and continues the justification of art as an essential human activity. This study draws upon unpublished material in order to provide a comprehensive reading of "Felix Krull". It examines the novel within the context of Mann's work as a whole, and, in doing so, it seeks to demonstrate the remarkable continuity of Mann's creative achievement.<br>

                  Horizontverschmelzung) is the central concept of the universal hermeneutics developed by the German philosopher H. G. Gadamer in his influential bookTruth and Method. It will be the main topic of this essay, but in order to set it into the proper context, I need to say something about Gadamer’s overall enterprise. In so doing I will try to clarify the meaning of hermeneutics and discuss the sense in which it is intended to be universal. This discussion will culminate in a fundamental criticism of Gadamer’s hermeneutics. In the second half of the essay, I<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapter we looked at three descriptive philosophical currents that offer tools for the clarifying of concepts, beliefs, and practices in religion. The objective was to get biblical scholars’ heads around the idea that we engage in descriptive philosophy of religion that limits itself to the elucidation of meaning. Now we go one step further than theorizing about a philosophical perspective

  Abstract: By popular reading of the Bible we mean in Latin America the use of the Bible in small groups of believers, usually led by a pastoral agent, either a woman religious (a member of a religious order) or, in most cases, a priest. In Protestant circles, where parishes are not so large, a local congregation is usually the place for this type of Bible study. In introducing Catholic and Protestant—including Pentecostal—groups, a brief reflection is necessary.<br>

  Book Title: Aliens and Sojourners-Self as Other in Early Christianity<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): DUNNING BENJAMIN H.<br>
  Abstract: Early Christians spoke about themselves as resident aliens, strangers, and sojourners, asserting that otherness is a fundamental part of being Christian. But why did they do so and to what ends? How did Christians' claims to foreign status situate them with respect to each other and to the larger Roman world as the new movement grew and struggled to make sense of its own boundaries?
      Aliens and Sojournersargues that the claim to alien status is not a transparent one. Instead, Benjamin Dunning contends, it shaped a rich, pervasive, variegated discourse of identity in early Christianity. Resident aliens and foreigners had long occupied a conflicted space of both repulsion and desire in ancient thinking. Dunning demonstrates how Christians and others in antiquity capitalized on this tension, refiguring the resident alien as being of a compelling doubleness, simultaneously marginal and potent. Early Christians, he argues, used this refiguration to render Christian identity legible, distinct, and even desirable among the vast range of social and religious identities and practices that proliferated in the ancient Mediterranean. Through close readings of ancient Christian texts such as Hebrews, 1 Peter, theShepherd of Hermas, and theEpistle to Diognetus, Dunning examines the markedly different ways that Christians used the language of their own marginality, articulating a range of options for what it means to be Christian in relation to the Roman social order. His conclusions have implications not only for the study of late antiquity but also for understanding the rhetorics of religious alienation more broadly, both in the ancient world and today.<br>

The presence of this shadow can therefore never be forgotten; but in order to fulfill its role as a negative background, neither can it be brought into the full daylight of memory and recollection.

  Book Title: Seasons of Misery-Catastrophe and Colonial Settlement in Early America<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): DONEGAN KATHLEEN<br>
  Abstract: The stories we tell of American beginnings typically emphasize colonial triumph in the face of adversity. But the early years of English settlement in America were characterized by catastrophe: starvation, disease, extreme violence, ruinous ignorance, and serial abandonment.
      Seasons of Miseryoffers a provocative reexamination of the British colonies' chaotic and profoundly unstable early days, placing crisis-both experiential and existential-at the center of the story. At the outposts of a fledgling empire and disconnected from the social order of their home society, English settlers were both physically and psychologically estranged from their European identities. They could not control, or often even survive, the world they had intended to possess. According to Kathleen Donegan, it was in this cauldron of uncertainty that colonial identity was formed. Studying the English settlements at Roanoke, Jamestown, Plymouth, and Barbados, Donegan argues that catastrophe marked the threshold between an old European identity and a new colonial identity, a state of instability in which only fragments of Englishness could survive amid the upheavals of the New World. This constant state of crisis also produced the first distinctively colonial literature as settlers attempted to process events that they could neither fully absorb nor understand. Bringing a critical eye to settlers' first-person accounts, Donegan applies a unique combination of narrative history and literary analysis to trace how settlers used a language of catastrophe to describe unprecedented circumstances, witness unrecognizable selves, and report unaccountable events.Seasons of Miseryaddresses both the stories that colonists told about themselves and the stories that we have constructed in hindsight about them. In doing so, it offers a new account of the meaning of settlement history and the creation of colonial identity.<br>

  Abstract: In a recent study of the relationship between the King James Version and English-language biblical translations by/for Jews, I concluded: “In no other language or culture does a single non-Jewish version exert such influence over Jewish translations.”¹ In order to establish a firm foundation for this declaration, two propositions must be demonstrated. The first, which is implicit in my statement, is that the KJV exerted a significant influence on subsequent Jewish English-language texts. The second, which I might term explicit, is that there are no parallels for such extensive influence by any other non-Jewish version in another language or culture.<br>

These political scientists reconceptualize

Ricoeur’s analysis is anchored to the established phenomenological precepts of Kant and Husserl, for in order that metaphor may refer, its transgressive character must ultimately be tamed by the master discourse of philosophy.

                  The Walls of Jerichoidentifies “black states of desire” as economic, socio-political, and sexual, championing the transfer of financial means and the mobilization of erotic energies beyond lines of class, heteronormativity, and “race” in order to effect meaningful social change. Its project to break down the “walls” of the title – be they between black and white neighborhoods, different class positions in the African American community, or emotional repression mandated by hegemonic gender discourses – situates the text within modernist economies no longer governed by the imperative to save both money and corporeal capital but rather, as Michael<br>

  Saying the Unsayable in Édouard Glissant’s Reading of Faulkner from:

  Author(s) Lahens Yanick<br>
  Abstract: In a recent article in
                  Black Music Research Journal, French sociologist Denis-Constant Martin proposed that Martinican writer Édouard Glissant’s concept of creolization could help reconcile jazz’s historical roots as an African American music with its recent universalization (Martin, 2008). Martin thus joined a growing group of scholars who use the concept of creolization in globalization studies in order to emphasize the fluid and unstable nature of culture. Meanwhile, scholars in postcolonial studies have embraced creolization’s potential to celebrate the creative ingenuity of ‘subaltern and deterritorialized peoples’ and its power to subvert ‘older notions of cultural dissolution and disorganization’ (Khan, 2007:<br>

  Abstract: It took rather longer than I care to admit before I was prepared to concede that Ruskin’s ‘intrinsic value’ is itself a term without intrinsic value.¹ The phrase is at best a promissory note, at worst a semantic relic to ward off the evil eye of commodity. One would suspect that I was taken with, and by, the idea of a talismanic key; an idea which I then read into Ruskin’s words in order to find there the confirmation that I desired.

  Book Title: Varieties of World Making-Beyond Globalization<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): WAGNER PETER<br>
  Abstract: Globalization has been the topic of heated debate in recent years, with one side asserting that it will produce a better standard of living for people around the world, and a fierce opposition arguing that it will ultimately lead to greater poverty and the destruction of unique human cultures. Varieties of World Making tackles the issue from a different angle, proposing that the contemporary global network of business, politics and culture be viewed from the inter-disciplinary perspective of ‘world making’. Drawn from the ranks of sociology, law, international relations, political philosophy and history, the distinguished contributors cut through polarized rhetoric to examine the current global situation. Their proposed diagnoses draw upon thoughtful analyses of various political dilemmas whose ripple effects are felt around the world, such as the volatile relationship between Islam and Europe, or the legal foundations for a true international order absent in the shadows of imperialism. Varieties of World Making will be an essential resource for all those grappling with the complex consequences of globalization for the future.<br>

  Abstract: This chapter looks at world-making from the viewpoint of one of its constitutive ingredients: solidarity. Solidarity is the substance of a successful world-making, if world-making is defined as the creation of a common universe. It makes sense to think that in order for this common universe to exist, there must be something that holds it together. Here, I will argue that solidarity should not be conceptualized as the ‘something that holds the common universe together’ but rather as the ‘there must be something that holds the common universe together’. The distinction here lies in a step I think worth taking,<br>

  Book Title: Thresholds of Meaning-Passage, Ritual and Liminality in Contemporary French Narrative<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): DUFFY JEAN H.<br>
  Abstract: Thresholds of Meaning examines contemporary French narrative and explores two related issues: the centrality within recent French fiction and autofiction of the themes of passage, ritual and liminality; and the thematic continuity which links this work with its literary ancestors of the 1960s and 1970s. Through the close analysis of novels and récits by Pierre Bergounioux, François Bon, Marie Darrieussecq, Hélène Lenoir, Laurent Mauvignier and Jean Rouaud, Duffy demonstrates the ways in which contemporary narrative, while capitalising on the formal lessons of the nouveau roman and drawing upon a shared repertoire of motifs and themes, engages with the complex processes by which meaning is produced in the referential world and, in particular, with the rituals and codes that social man brings into play in order to negotiate the various stages of the human life-cycle. By the application of concepts and models derived from ritual theory and from visual analysis, Thresholds of Meaning situates itself at the intersection of the developing field of literature and anthropology studies and research into word and image.<br>

  Abstract: In this penetrating biography, Brodsky's life and work are illuminated by his great friend, the late poet and literary scholar Lev Loseff. Drawing on a wide range of source materials, some previously unpublished, and extensive interviews with writers and critics, Loseff carefully reconstructs Brodsky's personal history while offering deft and sensitive commentary on the philosophical, religious, and mythological sources that influenced the poet's work. Published to great acclaim in Russia and now available in English for the first time, this is literary biography of the first order, and sets the groundwork for any books on Brodsky that might follow.<br>

  Abstract: Tolstoy’s early stories use misdirection, diversion, in order to create the experience of real presentness for the reader, who, happily distracted, passes into a world of fiction perhaps without realizing it. The late stories, on the contrary, often feign the simplicity of pure readerly experience, while alienating that experience through complex narrative structures. In the former, Tolstoy struggles against the alibi of narrative, continually collapsing the distance between “elsewhere” and the present “here.” In the latter, however, Tolstoy raises a narrative barrier to purely present meaning; and though his stories often contain what should be a simple moral meaning, they<br>

Instead, it is the antisemite who constructs the notion of the "Jew" and "Semitism" in a contingent manner (Virchow 162). The standard understanding of the notion is that of "being against Jews."

  Book Title: Great Fool-Zen Master Ryokan--Poems, Letters, and Other Writings<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): HASKEL PETER<br>
  Abstract: Taigu Ryokan (1759-1831) remains one of the most popular figures in Japanese Buddhist history. Despite his religious and artistic sophistication, Ryokan referred to himself as "Great Fool" and refused to place himself within the cultural elite of his age. In contrast to the typical Zen master of his time, who presided over a large monastery, trained students, and produced recondite religious treatises, Ryokan followed a life of mendicancy in the countryside. Instead of delivering sermons, he expressed himself through kanshi (poems composed in classical Chinese) and waka and could typically be found playing with the village children in the course of his daily rounds of begging. Great Fool is the first study in a Western language to offer a comprehensive picture of the legendary poet-monk and his oeuvre. It includes not only an extensive collection of the master's kanshi, topically arranged to facilitate an appreciation of Ryokan's colorful world, but selections of his waka, essays, and letters. The volume also presents for the first time in English the Ryokan zenji kiwa (Curious Accounts of the Zen Master Ryokan), a firsthand source composed by a former student less than sixteen years after Ryokan's death. Although it lacks chronological order, the Curious Account is invaluable for showing how Ryokan was understood and remembered by his contemporaries. It consists of colorful anecdotes and episodes, sketches from Ryokan's everyday life.<br>

  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>
  Author(s): Folkart Barbara<br>
  Abstract: When Hermes handed over to Apollo his finest invention, the lyre, in exchange for promotion to the status of messenger of the gods, he relinquished the creativity that gave life to his words.The trade-off proved frustrating: Hermes chafed under the obligation to deliver the ideas and words of others and resorted to all manner of ruses in order to assert his presence in the messages he transmitted. His theorizing descendants, too, allow their pretentions to creatorship to interfere with the actual business of reinventing originals in another language.Just as the Hermes of old delighted in leading the traveller astray, so his descendants lead their acolytes, through thickets of jargon, into labyrinths of eloquence without substance.Charles Le Blanc possesses the philosophical tools to dismantle this empty eloquence: he exposes the inconsistencies, internal contradictions, misreadings, and misunderstandings rife in so much of the current academic discourse en translation, and traces the failings of this discourse back to its roots in the anguish of having traded authentic creativity for mere status.<br>

Sometimes, as with the Rawlsian family of arguments, they intend both to offer a novel interpretation of liberal principles and, in parallel, reflect given cultural understandings unconsciously and unintentionally. On the whole, though, writers about liberalism have tended to elucidate a tradition rather than depart from it.<br>

  Author(s) GATTI HILARY<br>
  Abstract: The new science that begins to emerge at the end of the sixteenth century can be seen as a search for the order that underlies the vicissitudes of the natural world. This immediately raises the problem of the language, or languages, most appropriate for grasping and following the logic of that order. The great scientific names of the end of the sixteenth century, Galileo, Kepler, Tycho Brahe, had no doubts about the answer to that question: God wrote the universe in the language of mathematics, and the new science must learn that language in order to discover the order that<br>

  Book Title: Contesting Spirit-Nietzsche, Affirmation, Religion<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROBERTS TYLER T.<br>
  Abstract: Nietzsche criticizes the ascetic hatred of the body and this-worldly life, yet engages in rigorous practices of self-denial--he sees philosophy as such a practice--and affirms the need of imposing suffering on oneself in order to enhance the spirit. He dismisses the "intoxication" of mysticism, yet links mysticism, power, and creativity, and describes his own self-transcending experiences. The tensions in his relation to religion are closely related to that between negation and affirmation in his thinking in general. In Roberts's view, Nietzsche's transfigurations of religion offer resources for a postmodern religious imagination. Though as a "master of suspicion," Nietzsche, with Freud and Marx, is an integral part of modern antireligion, he has the power to take us beyond the flat, modern distinction between the secular and the religious--a distinction that, at the end of modernity, begs to be reexamined.<br>

  Abstract: As I hope has been made clear in chapter one, attempts at solving the problem of social order all turn ultimately on one’s view of what constitutes (or does not) the individual social actor. Rational and social choice theories—like their economistic prototype—all hark back to a more or less Hobbesian view of the individual as a self-contained actor who is director of his or her own passions and interests, chief among which is, for Hobbes, the fear of death and the corresponding right to flee its approach.<br>

  Abstract: When violence is transformed into art—or even artful prose, be it reportorial or even analytic—its aestheticization is obvious. Art makes sense out of the senseless. The aestheticizing impulse, however, is less obvious in another creation of culture: the nation-state, that political work of art. The nation-state too promises to bring forth order out of disorder, mold form from that in which form is absent. But even though this order may be posited as a future hope, something to be achieved in the making, this hope is drenched in nostalgia, the imagined glory that once was. In South Asia<br>

This figure emerges at the intersection of three domains—life, labor, and language—unstably unified around, and constituting, a would-be sovereignsubject. The doubling of a transcendental subject and an empirical object and their dynamic and unstable relations defined the form of this being.

Although civil society in the past largely coincided with the boundaries of the state, it is now being reconstructed internationally in ways that strain the capacity of any government to order, guide, or control.

  Abstract: Meta-utopian fiction written since 1987 is, as might be expected, more radically reductive than its forebears, finding naked coercion behind all but the most locally defined ideologies. It exposes a similar matrix of responses as the critical discussion about utopia. On the one hand, it harbors the same fear of the abyss as the only real alternative to stable, if oppressive, order, while, on the other, it is strongly concerned with reopening language to untried possibility, with reexamining deep social scripts, and with probing automatized readerly expectations.

Announcing a major “inversion of Platonism” in Western philosophy, they claimed that reality lies in the immediate flux of sensory appearances and not in a rational order beyond it. Our conceptual systems, they argued, are not copies of eternal forms underlying the sensory flux; they are instrumental constructs that overlie an experiential stream irreducible to rational formulation. Despite the extraordinary progress of natural science in this era, philosophers (as well as certain scientists) denied that our knowledge reflects the essential structure<br>

Like Cooper, he faced the complete loss of his dwindling audience as reward for his persistence.

  Abstract: In order to avoid the kind of frivolity that holds ethical concerns to be irrelevant in a discussion of the reader in (of) texts, it may be wise to revisit briefly the Russian critical tradition. This tradition has entertained with high seriousness the notion—somewhat disreputable in the West—that literature, and particularly fiction, must be held accountable, since it encodes messages which affect not only the subjective world view of readers, but their attitudes and actions.

  Book Title: Fabricating History-English Writers on the French Revolution<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Friedman Barton R.<br>
  Abstract: Barton Friedman demonstrates the ways in which English men of letters in the nineteenth century attempted to grasp the dynamics of history and to fashion order, however fragile, out of its apparent chaos. The authors he discusses--Blake, Scott, Hazlitt, Carlyle, Dickens, and Hardy--found in the French Revolution an event more compelling as a paradigm of history than their own "Glorious Revolution." To them the French Revolution seemed universally significant--a microcosm, in short. For these writers maintaining the distinction between "history" and "fiction" was less important than making sense of epochal historical events in symbolic terms. Their works on the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars occupy the boundary between history and fiction, and Fabricating History advances the current lively discussion of that boundary.<br>

  Book Title: Living Prism-Itineraries in Comparative Literature<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): KUSHNER EVA<br>
  Abstract: She discusses the current state of comparative literary studies and the renewed role of comparative literature in a world that is at once more plural and more globalized, as well as some of the debates now taking place within literary criticism as a whole, including the interchange between comparative literature and cultural studies, the re-envisaging of the Renaissance, the work of Northrop Frye, myth and literature at the end of the twentieth century, modern drama, and post-colonialism. To play an important role in the human sciences, comparative literature had first to free itself of a number of restrictive habits, such as an insufficiently critical literary history. In order to do this, it had to think theoretically, but without yielding to the temptation of letting theory become an end in itself. Kushner demonstrates that, while under strong pressures to be a more rigourous science, comparative literature has realized that in the human sciences the validation of knowledge has to seek its own tests and criteria, becoming increasingly more open to individuality, difference, and life situations and controlling its tendency to universalize. With its emphasis on whether literary history is possible and the problems it raises for literary theory and for comparative literature in particular, The Living Prism adds an important dimension to the ongoing debate about criticism and comparative literary studies.<br>

  Abstract: To work in the humanities, particularly in early modern studies, forces upon us a double sense of time: on the one hand, all documents and monuments from even the most distant past, at least those that have been stored, preserved, printed, discovered, reclaimed, are at our disposal in a kind of eternal present, and we feel a kinship with all these creations of human imagination; on the other, when we attempt to make them our own, we very quickly discover the immensity of distance to be bridged and that, in order to exist in history, the phenomena of the past<br>

  Abstract: With the above quotation the Dutch philosopher Ton Lemaire started his essay “The Appearance of Landscape,” which describes the evolution of a neutral space into a meaningful landscape. Apparently “landscape” is not an a priori category; it has to emerge from the disordered elements of the world. This arrangement of things into a new, coherent order called landscape follows not only the rhythms of the day or the seasons but also the course of every human life.³ Consequently, the

  Abstract: THE BIBLICAL DESCRIPTION of the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem has generated many diverse architectural speculations throughout our history. According to tradition, the Temple followed the designs of God and therefore could be interpreted as the archetypal work of architecture - a work that revealed a true order beyond the whimsical tastes of man and any temporal expressions of political power. In diverse times and cultures, mythical accounts of technological making and building demonstrated mankind’s keen awareness of the problems involved in transforming a given “sacred” world for the sake of survival.

The role of intellectuals is derived from and legitimized by an ethical system that relied on reason to discover and explicate objective justice. While Protestant ethics (particularly Calvinism) is conducive to a subjective understanding of interests in which feelings provide the measuring rod, the Catholic ethical tradition tempers the individual’s ability to determine her or his own rules of conduct.

But before freedom could be described, it was necessary to analyse its precursors: angst, reflection, and consciousness.

In so doing, he says, we do not simply reflect a pre-existing truth: philosophy is, “like art, the act of bringing truth into being”.¹ The analogy between phenomenology and art, especially the visual arts, runs through Merleau-Ponty's writings, sometimes as asides to a general philosophical discussion, and sometimes in the form of extended essays on particular<br>

  Book Title: The Sense of the Universe-Philosophical Explication of Theological Commitment in Modern Cosmology<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Nesteruk Alexei V.<br>
  Abstract: The Sense of the Universe deals with existential and phenomenological reflection upon modern cosmology with the aim to reveal hidden theological commitments in cosmology related to the mystery of human existence. The book proposes a new approach to the dialogue between science and theology based in a thorough philosophical analysis of acting forms of subjectivity involved in the study of the world and in religious experience. The uniqueness of this book is that it uses recent advances in phenomenological philosophy and philosophical theology in order to accentuate the existential meaning of cosmology as the discourse that ultimately explicates the human condition. The objective of the book is not to make a comparative analysis of the cosmological scientific narrative and that of the Bible, or the Fathers of the Church (in what concerns the structure of the universe), but to reveal the presence of a hidden theological dimension in cosmology originating in the God-given ability of humanity to discern and disclose the sense of creation. The book contributes to the synthesis of appropriation and incorporation of modern philosophical ideas in Christian theology, in particular its Eastern Orthodox form.<br>

  Abstract: Our intention now is to provide a concise and symbolic (graphical) description of the universe as a whole in order to explicate an epistemological meaning of such a description, in particular its dependence upon some irreducible beliefs that make this description possible. To do this we need to give a brief overview of the major methodological presumption in cosmology, namely the cosmological principle.¹ Since we cannot empirically verify the statistics of distribution of matter from other locations in space we have to speculate on the overall distribution of matter in the universe, appealing to philosophical and hence physically untestable assumptions.<br>

Our hope is that the definitions capture the essence of the assumptions Augustine brought to his preaching, and that they can then operate as tools to help us better explicate what he believed himself to be doing as a preacher.

Metaphorical references to war and hunger, however, play a very different role in the book of Lamentations.

  Book Title: Young Men in Uncertain Times-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Dyck Noel<br>
  Abstract: Anthropology is particularly well suited to explore the contemporary predicament in the coming of age of young men. Its grounded and comparative empiricism provides the opportunity to move beyond statistics, moral panics, or gender stereotypes in order to explore specific aspects of life course transitions, as well as the similar or divergent barriers or opportunities that young men in different parts of the world face. Yet, effective contextualization and comparison cannot be achieved by looking at male youths in isolation. This volume undertakes to contextualize male youths' circumstances and to learn about their lives, perspectives, and actions, and in turn illuminates the larger structures and processes that mediate the experiences entailed in becoming young men. The situation of male youths provides an important vantage point from which to consider broader social transformations and continuities. By paying careful attention to these contexts, we achieve a better understanding of the current influences encountered and acted upon by young people.<br>

  Abstract: Advanced reader on the history of education Developments in educational systems worldwide have largely contributed to the modernization and globalization of present-day society. However, in order to fully understand their impact, educational systems must be interpreted against a background of particular situations and contexts. This textbook brings together more than twenty (collaborative) contributions focusing on the two key themes in the work of Marc Depaepe: educationalization and appropriation.

  Abstract: “My life in the history of education” – to borrow the title of a recent British series of scholarly autobiographies¹ – began with a lively interest in educational practice. I became interested in the organization of the subject-based grade-school system and wished to find its origins. This was an organizational form introduced for reasons not particularly educational, and it persisted chiefly because of the order and efficiency to which it gave rise.² My work was both a form of educational criticism and a demonstration of the relevance of the history of education to educational science, practice, and policy.<br>

The latter reason will lead us to consider the toolbox concept we deploy here in order to enrich our understanding of Belgian constitutional case law relating to federalism.<br>

  Abstract: In some Muslim quarters, there is a lingering, and even increasing skepticism over the universal validity of human rights. those quarters may consider human rights as vehicles of Western arrogance and supremacy that run roughshod over deeply held cultural and religious convictions. Such skepticism demonstrates that human rights are still in what An Na’im has termed ‘a process of universalization’. Their full realization is an aim to which all States have committed themselves, and which is dependent on (1) domestic political willingness and strong institutions, (2) grassroots support, (3) international assistance, and (4) evenhandedness.

  Abstract: Broadly generalized, there are two strains of literature on legal services lawyers. One strain takes an explicitly normative stance regarding what outcomes, relationships, or processes are “good.” Scholarship in this genre provides advice about how legal services lawyers should act in order to optimize the assistance they provide to their clients. They advise on everything from choosing cases and clients from disparate community interests to empowering clients and avoiding paternalism. Such literature is not purely instrumental, as much of it provides a rationale for the underlying values promoted. These authors share the espousal of value-based practice, even when they are<br>

Postmodernism is neither a theory nor a concept; it is rather a skeptical attitude or aesthetic that “distrusts all attempts to create large-scale, totalizing theories in order to explain social phenomena.” ¹ Postmodernists resist the idea that “there is a ‘real’ world or legal system ‘out there,’ perfected, formed, complete and coherent, waiting to be discovered by theory.”² As developed in linguistics, literary theory, art, and architecture, postmodernism is also a style that signals the end of an era, the passing of the modern age.³ It marks a certain “chronological<br>

  Book Title: The Disarticulate-Language, Disability, and the Narratives of Modernity<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Berger James<br>
  Abstract: Language is integral to our social being. But what is the status of those who stand outside of language? The mentally disabled, wild children, people with autism and other neurological disorders, as well as animals, infants, angels, and artificial intelligences, have all engaged with language from a position at its borders. In the intricate verbal constructions of modern literature, the 'disarticulate' - those at the edges of language - have, paradoxically, played essential, defining roles.Drawing on the disarticulate figures in modern fictional works such asBilly Budd, The Sound and the Fury, Nightwood, White Noise,andThe Echo Maker,among others, James Berger shows in this intellectually bracing study how these characters mark sites at which aesthetic, philosophical, ethical, political, medical, and scientific discourses converge. It is also the place of the greatest ethical tension, as society confronts the needs and desires of the least of its brothers. Berger argues that the disarticulate is that which is unaccountable in the discourses of modernity and thus stands as an alternative to the prevailing social order. Using literary history and theory, as well as disability and trauma theory, he examines how these disarticulate figures reveal modernity's anxieties in terms of how it constructs its others.<br>

  Book Title: Liberalism at Its Limits-Crime and Terror in the Latin American Cultural Text<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): RODRÍGUEZ ILEANA<br>
  Abstract: In
      Liberalism at Its Limits,Ileana Rodríguez considers several Latin American nations that govern under the name of liberalism yet display a shocking range of nondemocratic features. In her political, cultural, and philosophical analysis, she examines these environments in which liberalism seems to have reached its limits, as the universalizing project gives way to rampant nonstate violence, gross inequality, and neocolonialism.Focusing on Guatemala, Colombia, and Mexico, Rodríguez shows how standard liberal models fail to account for new forms of violence and exploitation, which in fact follow from specific clashes between liberal ideology and local practice. Looking at these tensions within the ostensibly well-ordered state, Rodríguez exposes how the misunderstanding and misuse of liberal principles are behind realities of political turmoil, and questions whether liberalism is in fact an ideology sufficient to empower populations and transition nation-states into democratic roles in the global order.In this way,Liberalism at Its Limitsoffers a critical examination of the forced fitting of liberal models to Latin American nations and reasserts cross-cultural communication as crucial to grasping the true link between varying systems of value and politics.<br>

In the film, Ivan is trapped between two worlds—the persistent poverty of Jamaica’s suffering underclass and an alluring metropolitan North American lifestyle.

  Abstract: Like Sidney and Spenser, Marlowe deployed instrumental aesthetics in order to establish his art as a distinct and valued cultural form. Unlike them, however, Marlowe never sought patronage by promising to improve his audiences morally; rather, he attempted to draw people to the Bankside with the charisma of his persona, expanding the market in which theatre arose as an independent institution by staging astonishingly powerful performances whose effects appeared to transcend the disenchanted boundaries that usually frame the experience of a play. Nor did he hesitate to exploit the connection of instrumental aesthetics and magic to achieve his artistic goals.<br>

For Milner, we must now recognise that ‘the heart of the question of politics’ is ‘the issue of bodies and their survival’.² Accepting this ‘hard kernel’ of the political entails that we adopt a sceptical position vis-à-vis political action, in which a certain kind of pragmatism should order our actions.

  Poststructuralism Today? from:

  Author(s) Porter Robert<br>
  Abstract: The term ‘poststructuralism’ will first be considered in relation to the play that it bestows on the term ‘structuralism’ in order to outline its double movement of legacy and secession that the former retains in relation to the latter. Before disembowelling, drilling deep into the notion to find its own attributes, it is necessary to make it resonate with the humus that it emerges from. The nature of the relationship between poststructuralism and structuralism presents both an organic link and a mutation, a continuity and a divergence. The lowest common denominator represented by the structuralist thought of Lévi-Strauss, Benvéniste, Genette<br>

  Abstract: Whitehead described Western philosophy as a footnote to Plato’s. As recent philosophical tradition has shown, some footnotes have established texts of their own. Aesthetics is one such footnote. Whereas Plato banished aesthetics to the realm of
                  doxa, Continental philosophy stands witness since the late nineteenth century to a renaissance of aesthetic thought. Now, not only has the discipline achieved a philosophical autonomy but aesthetics has come to haunt those philosophies that marginalize the apparent and the subjective. If earlier forms of aesthetics feted order, recent forms of twentieth-century Continental philosophy are attracted to the sublime and its disruptive power. The<br>

  Abstract: Philosophies of Differenceengages the philosophies of Nietzsche, Heidegger, Derrida and Deleuze in order to mark a distinction between philosophical thinking (which perhaps in the work of these thinkers is pushed in some sense to its limit) and a new, more general mode of thinking which will be called non-philosophy. Laruelle’s text itself bridges the diff erence both methodologically and thematically between these two kinds of thought; it is at once philosophicalandnon-philosophical. Keeping in mind that non-philosophy is not meant to be a negation but rather a generalisation of philosophy, we should understand this ‘at once’ as in<br>

In order for a phrase to be deviant, it must be different from a more ordinary way of saying something similar or of employing the same construction. A similitude within dissimilitude is required here, as, if one were to see no resemblance between the ordinary and the deviant phrase, they would stand in no relation to each other at all, the one would not be recognised as a deviant form of the other (I shall go on to qualify<br>

  Author(s) Critchley Simon<br>
  Abstract: In this chapter, I follow the path of a dislocation. When Levinas reads Derrida, he renounces the ‘ridiculous ambition of “improving”’ (

I shall report this encounter by following the reading that Levinas gives of Derrida, a reading which, while continually transgressing the order of commentary, remains faithful, I believe, to the ultimate ethical orientation of the thinking under discussion. At stake here is the perverse fidelity of a dislocation in the act of reading.<br>

As discussed, such an approach to the relationship between self and world may be contrasted with Heidegger’s ontological emphasis in

  Author(s) Boucher David<br>
  Abstract: Constructivism in political theory is opposed to both scepticism and foundationalism. Against the sceptic the constructivist hopes to defend the objectivity of at least some political principles. Against the foundationalist the constructivist hopes to show that the defence of objectivity need not appeal to any account of the necessary and unchanging foundations for moral reasoning. Evil has traditionally been seen in foundationalist terms, as a theological concept depending on the existence of God or as depending on some alternative scheme of absolute moral judgement, in order to mark out a special sort of wrongness.

  Abstract: The argument about the relationship between time and narrative is now coming into focus. It begins in the Kantian notion that we have no access to things in themselves, but only, as phenomenology holds, to things as they are experienced, apprehended in consciousness, thought about, or understood. But the concept of consciousness cannot be taken for granted. Philosophy in general, both in the phenomenological and in the Anglo-American analytical traditions, has turned to language in order to investigate the realms of experience, perception, thought and understanding.

  Abstract: Whether on a patrol beat, in social service offices, or in public school classrooms, street-level workers continually confront rules in relation to their own beliefs about the people they encounter. Cops, Teachers, Counselors is the first major study of street-level bureaucracy to rely on storytelling. Steven Maynard-Moody and Michael Musheno collect the stories told by these workers in order to analyze the ways that they ascribe identities to the people they encounter and use these identities to account for their own decisions and actions. The authors show us how the world of street-level work is defined by the competing tensions of law abidance and cultural abidance in a unique study that finally allows cops, teachers, and counselors to voice their own views of their work.Steven Maynard-Moody is Director of the Policy Research Institute and Professor of Public Administration at the University of Kansas.Michael Musheno is Professor of Justice and Policy Studies at Lycoming College and Professor Emeritus of Justice Studies, Arizona State University.<br>

  Abstract: Understanding continuity and change in international order is a central question in the study of International Relations. IR theories conceptualize order in different ways. Each theory underpins a narrative about how an effective resolution to obstacles or tensions in the international system can be reached and stability secured. Neorealists conceive order as the result of power balances in the international system between dominant states (Waltz 1979). The English school conceives order being built on a “society of states” (Bull 2002; Linklater and Suganami 2006; Linklater 2007).

Clov’s statement is, on one level, the complaint of a weary domestic servant employing chores as consolation to make the space he tends for three other people more tolera ble.

  Book Title: Moving Consciously-Somatic Transformations through Dance, Yoga, and Touch<br>
  Publisher: University of Illinois Press<br>
  Author(s): Fraleigh Sondra<br>
  Abstract: The popularity of yoga and Zen meditation has heightened awareness of somatic practices. Individuals develop the conscious embodiment central to somatics work via movement and dance, or through touch from a skilled teacher or therapist often called a somatic bodyworker. Methods of touch and movement foster generative processes of consciousness in order to create a fluid interconnection between sensation, thought, movement, and expression. In Moving Consciously , Sondra Fraleigh gathers essays that probe ideas surrounding embodied knowledge and the conscious embodiment of movement and dance. Using a variety of perspectives on movement and dance somatics, Fraleigh and other contributors draw on scholarship and personal practice to participate in a multifaceted investigation of a thriving worldwide phenomenon. Their goal: to present the mental and physical health benefits of experiencing one's inner world through sensory awareness and movement integration. A stimulating addition to a burgeoning field, Moving Consciously incorporates concepts from East and West into a timely look at life-changing, intertwined practices that involve dance, movement, performance studies, and education.

In the early 1900s, for example, it was common for Russians to speak of a “Russian soul” naturally inclined toward “brooding and melancholy.”¹ More deleterious have been claims about other cultures: Serbs are belligerent, Romanians are intensely emotional, “Gypsies” are impassioned but irresponsible, Germans desire order, Jews are avaricious.

  Abstract: Following the socialist revolution, a colossal shift in everyday realities began in the 1920s and '30s in the former Russian empire. Faced with the Siberian North, a vast territory considered culturally and technologically backward by the revolutionary government, the Soviets confidently undertook the project of reshaping the ordinary lives of the indigenous peoples in order to fold them into the Soviet state. In

  Abstract: The conclusion to Chapter 7, that “the East” has been cut loose from its geographical point of reference and has become a generalized social marker in European identity formation, is one that may also serve as an initial conclusion to the book as a whole. “The East” is indeed Europe’s other, and it is continuously being recycled in order to represent European identities. Since the “Eastern absence” is a defining trait of “European” identities, there is no use talking about the end of an East/West divide in European history after the end of the Cold War.

In the first place, Derrida argues that expression not only (as Husserl sees) does not require fulfillment in order to exercise its meaning function, but essentially involves a lack of fulfillment.¹ The very structure of Husserl’s pure grammar shows that meaning excludes intuition, the presence of the object meant. This would be true even for words such as “I,” which means that the meaningfulness of my own utterances requires my own absence or death.

Such a transformation was enabled by the imposition of a dominant symbolic order on the indigenous cultures, followed by the appropriation of this symbolic order by the native elites.

Essays address the rise of Qing Confucianism, the development of the Dai Zhen and Zhu Xi traditions, and the response of the historian Zhang Xuecheng to the Dai Zhen approach. They take stock of the thematic importance of Cao Xueqin's eighteenth-century masterpieceHonglou meng(Dream of the Red Chamber) and the influence of Sun Yat-sen'sThree Principles of the People, as well as the radicalization of China in the twentieth century and the fundamental upheavals of modernization and revolution. Ying-shih Yü also discusses the decline of elite culture in modern China, the relationships among democracy, human rights, and Confucianism, and changing conceptions of national history. He reflects on the Chinese approach to history in general and the larger political and cultural function of chronological biographies. By situating China's modern encounter with the West in a wider historical frame, this second volume ofChinese History and Cultureclarifies its more curious turns and contemplates the importance of a renewed interest in the traditional Chinese values recognizing common humanity and human dignity.<br>

  Book Title: Why Only Art Can Save Us-Aesthetics and the Absence of Emergency<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): ZABALA SANTIAGO<br>
  Abstract: The state of emergency, according to thinkers such as Carl Schmidt, Walter Benjamin, and Giorgio Agamben, is at the heart of any theory of politics. But today the problem is not the crises that we do confront, which are often used by governments to legitimize themselves, but the ones that political realism stops us from recognizing as emergencies, from widespread surveillance to climate change to the systemic shocks of neoliberalism. We need a way of disrupting the existing order that can energize radical democratic action rather than reinforcing the status quo. In this provocative book, Santiago Zabala declares that in an age where the greatest emergency is the absence of emergency, only contemporary art's capacity to alter reality can save us.
      Why Only Art Can Save Usadvances a new aesthetics centered on the nature of the emergency that characterizes the twenty-first century. Zabala draws on Martin Heidegger's distinction between works of art that rescue us from emergency and those that are rescuersintoemergency. The former are a means of cultural politics, conservers of the status quo that conceal emergencies; the latter are disruptive events that thrust us into emergencies. Building on Arthur Danto, Jacques Rancière, and Gianni Vattimo, who made aesthetics more responsive to contemporary art, Zabala argues that works of art are not simply a means of elevating consumerism or contemplating beauty but are points of departure to change the world. Radical artists create works that disclose and demand active intervention in ongoing crises. Interpreting works of art that aim to propel us into absent emergencies, Zabala shows how art's ability to create new realities is fundamental to the politics of radical democracy in the state of emergency that is the present.<br>

  Publisher: University of Texas Press<br>
  Author(s): BASSO ELLEN B.<br>
  Abstract: An especially comprehensive study of Brazilian Amazonian Indian history, The Last Cannibals is the first attempt to understand, through indigenous discourse, the emergence of Upper Xingú society. Drawing on oral documents recorded directly from the native language, Ellen Basso transcribes and analyzes nine traditional Kalapalo stories to offer important insights into Kalapalo historical knowledge and the performance of historical narratives within their nonliterate society. This engaging book challenges the familiar view of biography as a strictly Western literary form. Of special interest are biographies of powerful warriors whose actions led to the emergence of a more recent social order based on restrained behaviors from an earlier time when people were said to be fierce and violent. From these stories, Basso explores how the Kalapalo remember and understand their past and what specific linguistic, psychological, and ideological materials they employ to construct their historical consciousness. Her book will be important reading in anthropology, folklore, linguistics, and South American studies.<br>

According to Kalapalo, before firearms became prevalent, many boys were trained to betafaku oto. If a parent had dreamed about the sparrow hawk it was felt that the next male child would, if properly prepared, become atafaku oto.

His fortunes were intimately linked with the fate of his site: his capture or sacrifice, admittedly the probable result of military or economic misfortunes, was the symbolic collapse of what Stephen Houston and others have termed “moral authority.”²<br>

  Author(s): Cody Francis<br>
  Abstract: The Light of Knowledgeis set primarily in the rural district of Pudukkottai in Tamil Nadu, and it is about activism among laboring women from marginalized castes who have been particularly active as learners and volunteers in the movement. In their endeavors to remake the Tamil countryside through literacy activism, workers in the movement found that their own understanding of the politics of writing and Enlightenment was often transformed as they encountered vastly different notions of language and imaginations of social order. Indeed, while activists of the movement successfully mobilized large numbers of rural women, they did so through logics that often pushed against the very Enlightenment rationality they hoped to foster. Offering a rare behind-the-scenes look at an increasingly important area of social and political activism,The Light of Knowledgebrings tools of linguistic anthropology to engage with critical social theories of the postcolonial state.<br>

  Book Title: Forgotten Dreams-Revisiting Romanticism in the Cinema of Werner Herzog<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Johnson Laurie Ruth<br>
  Abstract: Werner Herzog (b. 1942) is perhaps the most famous living German filmmaker, but his films have never been read in the context of German cultural history. And while there is a surfeit of film reviews, interviews, and scholarly articles on Herzog and his work, there are very few books devoted to his films, and none addressing his entire career to date. Until now. Forgotten Dreams offers not only an analytical study of Herzog's films but also a new reading of Romanticism's impact beyond the nineteenth century. It argues that his films re-envision and help us better understand a critical stream in Romanticism, and places the films in conversation with other filmmakers, authors, and philosophers in order to illuminate that critical stream. The result is a lively reconnection with Romantic themes and convictions that have been partly forgotten in the midst of Germany's postwar rejection of much of Romantic thought, yet are still operative in German culture today. The film analyses will interest scholars of film, German Studies, and Romanticism as well as a broader public interested in Herzog's films and contemporary German cultural debates. The book will also appeal to those interested in the ongoing renegotiation - by Western and other cultures - of relationships between reason and passion, civilization and wild nature, knowledge and belief.

  Book Title: Medievalist Enlightenment-From Charles Perrault to Jean-Jacques Rousseau<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Montoya Alicia C.<br>
  Abstract: Literary medievalism played a vital role in the construction of the French Enlightenment. Starting with the Quarrel of the Ancients and Moderns, it influenced movements leading to the Romantic rediscovery of the Middle Ages, and helped to shape new literary genres, from the epistolary novel to the fairy tale and opera. Indeed, the dominant mode of the early Enlightenment, 'galanterie', was of medievalist inspiration. Moreover, the academic study of medieval texts underlay modern ideals of scholarship, institutionalized at the royal academies. The Middle Ages polemically functioned as an alternative site, allowing authors to rethink their age's political and social ideologies. At the centre of these debates was the notion of historical progress. Was progress possible, as the 'philosophes' held, or was human history a process of degeneration, with the Middle Ages as a lost Golden Age? From the re-evaluation of the medieval thus emerged not only the seeds of a new poetics, but also the central questions that preoccupied Enlightenment thinkers from Montesquieu to Rousseau. This book shows how, in order to understand the aesthetic and intellectual transformations that marked modernity, it is essential to examine how this period conceived of the past, and particularly those "Dark Ages" that served as the defining foil for the modern Age of Light.

  Abstract: Este libro evalúa la aportación del documental cinematográfico y televisivo producido en España a partir de los años 90 al debate en torno a la memoria de la represión franquista, por un lado, así como a la construcción de la identidad democrática, en términos más generales. Propongo que tanto los documentales con un enfoque histórico explícito como aquellos cuya mirada retrospectiva se realiza sin referentes tan concretos cuestionan el proyecto político teleológico concebido durante la Transición. La primera parte de mi estudio trata de la memoria histórica de la guerra civil específicamente y, la segunda, de la memoria en un sentido socioeconómico para apuntar el déficit de agencia del sujeto en la democracia neoliberal. En última instancia se reivindica la marginalidad social de la víctima a la vez que se deja al descubierto su obliteración de los procesos democráticos. Isabel M. Estrada is Visiting Assistant Professor, Franklin & Marshall College. ENGLISH VERSION This book examines how a selected group of documentaries made since 1995 for both film and television inform the debate centered on the so-called "recuperation of memory" of the Spanish Civil War and dictatorship. Estrada contends that these documentaries modify Spanish identity as it was conceived by the teleological historical project of the transition. The narrative of mass media should be examined in order to comprehend the process of the "recovery of memory" that culminated in the Law of Historical Memory (2007). She carries out a comparative analysis of the visual discourse of the documentary and the narrative discourses of history and testimony, paying special attention to the relations of power among them. Using theoretical frameworks provided by Badiou, Adorno, Renov, and Ricoeur, this study ultimately sheds light on the status of the victim in the context of Spain's neoliberal democracy. Isabel M.

  Abstract: Hanslick’s 1854 treatise

Thus, in order to demonstrate what he could not clearly posit in terms of pure sound, Hanslick employed a theory of musical perception as a more substantive criterion of judgment, drawing on various manifestations of listening to describe the effects of musical beauty. This approach led Hanslick to examine the incompetent musical listener as thoroughly as he did the competent listener, the true disciple of the beautiful. As Nicholas Cook<br>

  Book Title: Dialogic Aspects in the Cuban Novel of the 1990s-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): DORADO-OTERO ÁNGELA<br>
  Abstract: This book examines six Cuban novels published between 1991 and 1999, all part of the new "boom" of the Cuban novel in the 1990s. It analyses how in undermining monolithic representations of reality these texts employ discursive techniques that question absolute truths, defy established boundaries of literary genres and challenge concepts of national, gender and individual identity. The authors studied in this book---Reinaldo Arenas, Leonardo Padura Fuentes, Abilio Estévez, Daína Chaviano, Yanitzia Canetti, and Zoé Valdés---are placed beyond the dichotomy of outside and inside Cuba in order to focus on the fluidity and heterogeneity of Cuban culture displayed in its literature. This study establishes similarities and differences in the way these authors create polyphonic texts that question whether notions of country and nation coincide in novels that respond to economic hardship, political and social changes, issues of cubanía, and exile.

Individuals, families, religious communities, political parties, and other groups use them as vehicles to communicate how they arrived where they are, how they want to be seen and understood. Above all, the cultural construction of these narratives, understood in the broadest possible sense, is one of the central planks in the formation of national identity, the collective myth-making which so often essentializes the otherwise contingent nation-state.<br>

  Book Title: Narrative Deconstructions of Gender in Works by Audrey Thomas, Daphne Marlatt, and Louise Erdrich-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Rosenthal Caroline<br>
  Abstract: By analyzing the works of Thomas, Marlatt, and Erdrich through the lenses of subjectivity, gender studies, and narratology, Caroline Rosenthal brings to light new perspectives on their writings. Although all three authors write metafictions that challenge literary realism and dominant views of gender, the forms of their counter-narratives vary. In her novel 'Intertidal Life', Thomas traces the disintegration of an identity through narrative devices that unearth ruptures and contradictions in stories of gender. In contrast, Marlatt, in 'Ana Historic', challenges the regulatory fiction of heterosexuality. She offers her protagonist a way out into a new order that breaks with the law of the father, creating a "monstrous" text that explores the possibilities of a lesbian identity. In her tetralogy of novels made up of 'Love Medicine', 'Tracks', 'The Beet Queen', and 'The Bingo Palace', Erdrich resists definite readings of femininity altogether. By drawing on trickster narratives, she creates an open system of gendered identities that is dynamic and unfinalizable, positing the most fragmented worldview as the most enduring. By applying gender and narrative theory to nuanced analysis of the texts, Rosenthal's study elucidates the correlation between gender identity formation and narrative. Caroline Rosenthal is Professor and Chair of American Literature at the Friedrich-Schiller University in Jena, Germany. Her book 'Narrative Deconstructions of Gender' was published by Camden House in 2003.<br>

  Author(s) Smith Jill Suzanne<br>
  Abstract: In recent years several scholars have investigated the role of popfeminism, a term coined in 2007 by Sonja Eismann, which denotes Germany’s own version of contemporary feminism.¹ While these scholars have scrutinized the relationship between popfeminism, pop literature, and neoliberalism, and they have pointed out the absence of concepts of race and ethnicity in numerous popfeminist texts, they have paid little attention to those popfeminist works that do analyze the intersections between sexuality, race, and ethnicity.² In this essay I address this gap by investigating the humor-inflected popfeminist autobiographical works

  Book Title: Arturo Pérez-Reverte: Narrative Tricks and Narrative Strategies-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): WALSH ANNE L.<br>
  Abstract: The writings of Arturo Pérez-Reverte, one of Spain's most renowned contemporary authors, have been described as a minefield. This monograph examines the complexities behind the narrative technique employed in creating such a minefield, including an analysis of the role played by both male and female characters, the relevance of the past as a motif, and aspects of the role of storytelling in creating mystery where none should exist. Both Revertian novels and journalistic writing are seen to be part of an over-all game which is played between their author and his readers. Film, too, forms part of the material reviewed as, though Pérez-Reverte is not a script writer, many films have been based on his novels. The text-centred analysis concludes that the themes of interest in all Revertian output revolve around two main areas: the significance of the past, whether historical, cultural, or literary, and the role of the written word in communicating, in rescuing and in challenging versions of that past in order to combat what Pérez-Reverte terms 'dismemory'.

  Book Title: Juan Goytisolo: The Author as Dissident-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): de Menezes Alison Ribeiro<br>
  Abstract: This monograph offers two new perspectives on Spanish writer, Juan Goytisolo. First, under the themes of authorship and dissidence, it integrates his writing across several genres, providing a rounded assessment of his contribution to cultural debates in Spain since the sixties and arguing that resistance to repressive discourses characterizes his essays and autobiographies as much as his fiction. Second, it revises the prevailing critical interpretation of Goytisolo's fiction by building on four premises: that his novels are less clearly oppositional than prevailing interpretations imply; that, in order to engage with discourses of identity, he employs an idiom which, contrary to his own statements, is not a poststructuralist autonomous world of words; that a textual practice grounded in the recognizable experience of post-Civil War Spain, rather than one which seeks out the realm of pure textuality, is essential to Goytisolo's subversive political intentions; and that the autobiographical element of much of his work constitutes a more complex narrative aesthetic than has been appreciated. The book argues that if Goytisolo's work is interpreted as an ethical engagement with postmodernist theory, rather than as an illustration of it, then certain contradictions for which he has been criticized are seen in a new and valuable light. ALISON RIBEIRO DE MENEZES is a Senior Lecturer in Spanish at University College Dublin.<br>

  Abstract: If, for twentieth-century writers, the question of authorship and its relationship to the authority of a ‘writing subject’ has posed considerable problems, then writing the life of the self – encapsulated perfectly, if in reverse order, in the very term auto-bio-graphy – makes these issues even more acute. The practice of autobiography necessarily confers on the autobiographical text an implied truth value upon which the weight of contemporary theory since existentialism and structuralism has cast considerable doubt. Unmoored from the Cartesian certainties of consciousness, contemporary autobiography stages an interplay between facts and imaginative creativity, replacing the original ‘confessional’ status of<br>

  Author(s) Lidz Victor M.<br>
  Abstract: Although one might be sceptical of Talcott Parsons’s research program for social theory, there is much less doubt in viewing his solution of the so-called Hobbesian problem of social order as a turning point in the development of sociological thought. In providing proof of the thesis that the main representatives of sociological thought in Europe converged on a solution for this problem, Parsons (1937/1968) did two things. First, he built upon the classical phase of sociological theory to bring it to a remarkable completion, and second, he established the foundation for the dominance of a normatively oriented functionalism in American<br>

  Abstract: There is a form of mordant humor illustrated by the story of two Frenchman who, following World War I, are trying to explain that disastrous set of events. “We wouldn’t have been in the war if it weren’t for the bicycle riders and the Jews,” said the first. “Why the bicycle riders?” asked the second. The first one replied, “Why the Jews?” It is a vein of irony in which an explanation is proffered seemingly assuming order and consistency in the world. The punchline is the reverse: a world of caprice, whim, and random unpredictability.<br>

  Abstract: In untangling this complicated subject it will be helpful to resort to a simplified schema, founded upon the following point of departure: that religion—Serbian Orthodoxy, in this particular context—defines man and his place in the universe. In order to function effectively, it is essential that a person or group have a precisely focused and systematically conceived definition of its environment and of itself. Such a definition of the system and the cosmos to which it is related is a conception of identity.

The examination targeted the rhetoric of continuity, inquiring how judge-made continuity rhetoric takes shape and, also, how such continuity rhetoric contributes to shaping identities in polities operating under constitutions with troubled founding myths. In addition to constructing constitutional continuity, justices entrusted with applying such constitution myths often invoke historical narratives in order to settle accounts with the past (reconciliation). Building on these previous findings, Chapter Five seeks to unravel the effect of reconciliation rhetoric on the relationship between the constitutional text and<br>

Author(s): Lara Maria Pia<br>
Abstract: This account of illocutionary force is particularly suited to illuminating struggles for recognition on the part of women who have often entered the public sphere only through the narrative form, in novels, biographies, and autobiographies. Lara is particularly interested in the way in which women take up each other’s lives to make moral claims and to fashion and refashion identities. Hannah Arendt looks at the life of Rahel Varnhagen in order to assume her own identity as a pariah, as a Jew, and as a woman; later, contemporary feminists take up Arendt’s identity as reflected in her biography of Varnhagen to fashion their own. Simone de Beauvoir creates a fictional self to sort through her lived relationship to Jean Paul Sartre, which then becomes the site for contemporary feminists to sort through their own identity and autonomy. This loop occurs repeatedly in what Lara, following Ricoeur, sees as a tripartite mimesis. In mimesis 2, Jane Austen takes up the limited life of the women of her time (mimesis 1) to construct an identity for women that is then taken up again by contemporary women in films of Jane Austen’s novels (mimesis 3) to continue to construct that identity. Moreover, what is told in these looping narratives is the way in which women are and become moral agents. Thus, while many commentators have associated Austen only with Aristotle, with an ethics of virtue, Lara is just as interested in the morality of principle that Austen’s heroines exhibit. Moreover, she emphasizes the extent to which the moral claims Austen raises are validated through the narrative structure of her novels. This is a relationship that Martha Nussbaum also articulates, as Lara notes. For both, it is through the structure of narrative and imaginative speech that moral claims become not only rationally justified but compelling as well.<br>

Abstract: In the seventeenth and eighteenth century, at a time when the idea of eternal punishment loses ground in dogmatic theology, divines insist on keeping it as a tool for the maintenance of moral and social order. See Daniel Pickering Walker,
            The Decline of Hell: Seventeenth‐Century Discussions of Eternal Torment(Chicago, 1964). Something analogous took place for the resurrection. As Bunyan warned, “he that denyeth the Resurrection of the dead, he setteth open a Floud‐gate to all manner of impiety, he cutteth the throat of a truly holy life, and layeth the Reins upon the neck of the most outragious lusts” (Bunyan,The Resurrection of the Dead,p. 214).<br>

How do these categories overlap and mutually imply one another? For example, one group might express upstanding citizenship by avoiding disagreement, while another group might express upstanding citizenship by arguing. Do people enjoy talking for its own sake?

Abstract: 1. Is paradigm the right choice, and have I used it correctly?There is always a risk in adopting a concept that comes from a different tradition. It is even riskier when we fiddle with it and stretch it to fit a set of data for which it was not designed as I have done. But I believe that the risk is warranted for two reasons. The first is that there is considerable confusion within and outside of anthropology regarding the nature of the anthropological study of language. The oscillation mentioned in the article among a number of labels, including linguistic anthropology, anthropological linguistics, sociolinguistics, and ethnolinguistics, is only the most superficial and yet telling example of the widespread lack of clarity as to what constitutes linguistic research from an anthropological perspective. Further evidence of confusion can be inferred from the typically partial and often clumsy attempts to represent the linguistic subfield (or the study of language) in sociocultural anthropology textbooks. I felt that it was time to come to terms with the fact that perhaps those of us inside the subfield had not been communicating to those outside as effectively as we thought we were. I then realized that to address this issue I needed a notion that by its very nature would force us to think in terms of broad trends rather than particular notions or hypotheses. The popular notions of paradigm and paradigm shift seemed to me the perfect candidates; they could force us to think in terms of the major features of our research projects. CookGumperz and Gumperz are right when they write that Kuhns approach gives a sense of structural containment to the flow of ideas that to those living with them appear much more fluid and overlapping. (Their proposal to adopt Holtons themata is a bit cryptic given that his model is not considered an improvement on Kuhns by most historians of science.)

Author(s): Luhmann Niklas <br>
Abstract: Although an influential figure within German social theory for decades, Luhmann has never been an especially popular figure in American circles, perhaps because his theory is in actuality what many sociologists have accused Parson’s of being: a theory reducing social actors to nothing more than epiphenomena of their social system. Hence, Luhmann’s book consists of his application of concepts such as system/environment, medium/form, first‐ and second‐order observation, self‐reference and external reference and above all the distinction between psychic systems (systems of consciousness) and social systems (systems of communication) to the realm of art, thereby conceptually transforming it into the “art system.” One of the ironies in Luhmann’s analysis is that his claim for the “autonomy of art” is seemingly refuted by his own, wholly social, assessment of it. Indeed, reading Luhmann’s book is a little like watching Frankenstein at work: his conceptual apparatus renders the ostensibly organic associations we might have of art as being instead mechanical and clinical. For all of Parsons’s own romance with systems theory and cybernetics, his central concern was always with the cultural product of those systems, which he referred to variously as “instrumental activism” and “institutionalized individualism,” that is, the way in which differentiation led to the production of a more complex and sophisticated individualism within the societal community. This constituted Parsons’s standard for the evolution of societies. Luhmann, meanwhile, consistently held that social systems operate “behind the backs” of actors, operating to reduce complexity for such actors, on the one hand, while furthering systems imperatives, on the other. This contrast between mentor and student becomes most obvious in their respective views of culture: while Parsons never fully unpacked the concept of culture in his own work, his emphasis on values and norms opened the door to what today is known as t~<br>

Author(s): Mialet Hélène<br>
Abstract: We have thus followed a strange movement, a sort of coming and going between perceiving subjects and perceived objects, a zoom effect like that of a camera trying to set the right distance with its object in order to achieve a maximum degree of clarity—total transparency. On the one hand, we have seen how the tricky adjustment between the multiplicity of stabilized representations of Hawking and my face‐to‐face interaction with him has fragmented his identity. Like an impressionist painting, distance allows us to see what proximity causes us to lose. The layering of the multiplicity of narratives about Hawking reveals the stable identity of an individual that face‐to‐face contact does not allow. The closer we get to the object‐subject, the further we move from it. We no longer know who or where he is. All the categories we normally use in thinking about a person, a body, a machine, a mind, an interaction, a conversation, a text, and speech are blurred. In his presence, Hawking seems even more difficult to seize than we had imagined. The reason is, first, because, as we have shown, the depth of the social body (the one that talks of the other as much as of itself and allows the accumulation of self‐definitions), normally visible but unnoticed in any interaction, is absent in his case. Second, the internal functioning of the flesh‐and‐blood body, normally invisible, becomes visible and distributed here (the
      Iandlegsare mixed in the same discourse and are detached from the body; they are before him while his voice is next to him, and the flesh‐and‐blood body is collectively taken care of) and omnipresent (it appears at different moments during the interaction). Third, the machine, by the coordination of the actions it allows, disturbs the interaction as much as it creates it. This is where the confusion and fragmentation of identity is pursued by recomposition. Here we follow, step by step, how the machine to which this silent body is attached makes the component~<br>

Author(s): Juillerat Bernard<br>
Abstract: Juillerat has an extended view of the Oedipus complex, one that includes the tales/complexes of Laius and Jocasta. His understanding of the complex incorporates at least two not altogether compatible approaches. On the one hand, following Paul Ricoeur, the complex is a
      seuilor threshold, a structured moment that opens up a set of possibilities. Methodologically one decomposes the range of possibilities that are given expression in the cultural products of the unconscious (p. 72)myths, rituals, and dreamsin order to discover the minimal structure from which they can be derived. That which is universal is not such and such a particular form of the Oedipus [complex], but rather that which is common in all the possible figures of the Oedipus combinatory, the varied cultural expressions of which must be able to be reduced to a model that contains them all (p. 69). Like all quest arguments, Juillerats is circular: that for which he searches is predetermined by the object of his questthe Oedipus complexand by the range and definition of material that quest presupposes. What is more interesting, as Juillerat acknowledges at times, is the transformational capacity of the minimal structurethe thresholdas it is given varied cultural expression.<br>

Abstract: Despite this, metaphysics has indeed replied (whether it should be allowed to or not) to the question concerning man’s definition of himself. And we know well that the Cartesian

Nevertheless, it would be more fitting to doubt this vulgate of Cartesianism, because the texts of Descartes so often contradict it. Contradiction occurs first of all because theego’s very performance of its existence unfolds within a space that is, from the outset, dialogical (with theDeus qui potest omnia, with thegenius aliquis malignius).43Next, contradiction occurs because theegoof thecogitorecognizes that its finite thought culminates in a faculty of will that is paradoxically infinite, “ratione cujus imaginem quandam et similitudinem Dei me refere intelligo” (“in virtue of [which] … I understand myself to bear in some way the image and likeness of God”); and above all the common understanding of the comprehensibility of theegois contradicted because theegoidentifies its faculty of thinking of itself with the image and likeness of God within it, to the point that the faculty of self‐knowing is simply one with the faculty of knowing God: “ex hoc uno quod Deus me creavit, valde credibile est me quodammodo ad imaginem et similitudinem ejus factum esse, illamque similitudinem, in qua Dei idea continetur, a me precipi per eandem facultatem, per quam ego ipse a me percipior” (“but the mere fact that God created me is a very strong basis for believing that I am somehow made in his image and likeness and that I perceive that likeness, which includes the idea of God, by the same faculty which enables me to perceive myself”).44Let us consider this extraordinary text: founding the thinking of self upon my thinking of God, to the point of merging them within the space opened by the image of and likeness to God.

Abstract: Braudel addressed the critics directly in
            The Mediterranean,2d ed. (1972), 2:1243–44: “The question is frequently put to me, both by historians and philosophers, if we view history from such a distance, what becomes of man, his role in history, his freedom of action?” A classic example is embodied in Braudel’s portrait of Philip II himself. “What degree of freedom was possessed by Philip II, or by Don Juan of Austria as he rode at anchor among his ships, allies, and troops? Each of these so‐called freedoms seems to me to resemble a tiny island, almost a prison.” See the conclusion of Part III, 2:1236 that recounts the death of Philip II on September 13, 1598, based on three secondary sources of the 1920s, not from contemporary accounts of Philip’s “good death.” Braudel’s last poignant paragraph suggests that Philip did not know what he was doing: “[Philip] was not a man of vision: he saw his task as an unending succession of small details. Every one of his annotations is a small precise point, whether an order, a remark, or the correction of a spelling mistake or geographical error. Never do we find general notions or grand strategies under his pen.” The king’s “grand strategy,” however, is exactly what Geoffrey Parker set out to demonstrate inThe Grand Strategy of Philip II(New Haven, Conn., 1998). Braudel may be correct that Philip, as a prince, was not a student of geography. But what Philip did study, architecture, emphasized design. No discipline was more useful to understanding “general notions or grand strategies.” Thus, Braudel’s Part III, as traditional as it is often said to be, appears to get the story and the king wrong because Braudel’s steering assumption, not Philip II, was in control: “Good reasons for us to reflect once more on the distance separating biographical history from the history of structures, and even more from the history of geographical areas” (2:1237). For a similar critique, see also M. J. Rodríguez‐Salgado, “Dust and Ashe~<br>

Abstract: Second, if articulated structure displaces verbal connective tissue in argument, the effect of such brevity can be a kind of poverty, an overreliance on mere enumeration as a result of which logical relations fail to manifest themselves at all.
            56Recently Edward Tufte, author of magisterial works on the graphic and visual representation of information, has offered a severe critique of PowerPoint for just this failure. In PowerPoint, connective verbal tissue is removed entirely, and oral presentations based on this skeletal writing often display a version of Ong’s “secondary orality” impoverished of information content, in which argument is reduced to mere list.57Tufte’s critique of PowerPoint confirms a distinction between concision and clarity; the burden of his critique is to remind us that sometimesmorewords are required in order for communication to be effective. There is no easy correlation between the quantity of words and the quality of communication, and this mysterious intransigence of language, which goes very deep, means that it will probably never be possible to reduce writing to rules, schemata, or the algorithms that run computer programs.<br>

Abstract: A situation of radical pluralism combined with an automatic instinct to define oneself in oppositional terms thus threatens to turn a tradition inside out. In overdefining itself in this way, a theological tradition suppresses those internal theological tensions that, like the creative tensions of metaphor that generate new dimensions of meaning, are productive of theological insight. Tensions that once could be readily found within the tradition are now apparent—at least initially—only outside of it. A theological tradition that has unintentionally suppressed sources of creative theological tension within itself in an effort to define itself vis‐à‐vis others will be forced now to cross interreligious boundaries in order to reappropriate such tensions.
         64This generation of theological insight from tensions spanning religious boundaries is precisely the aim of the defamiliarization procedure outlined above. Defamiliarization thus functions as an antidote to the tendency toward hyperdefinition that results from a situation of radical pluralism.<br>

Author(s): Robbins,  Jeffrey W.<br>
Abstract: While these readings of Marion and Lévinas are admirable descriptions of a worthy project, objections that would strengthen Robbins’s argument can be made. Contrary to Robbins’s aim, the authors that serve as his models of philosophical theology present their work in a form that maintains the division between a theological side (Marion’s
      God without Being, Lévinas’s Talmudic commentaries) and a philosophical side (Marion’s phenomenology and Lévinas’s ethical philosophy). In not fully recognizing this, Robbins does not so much prove himself wrong as he overlooks an important point of his own argument. For, in order to understand how theology and philosophy relate, they must be distinguished. Only if differences remain can there be conversation and mutual, transformative indebtedness.<br>

Author(s): McNay Lois <br>
Abstract: Whatever the starting point for investigation of agency, and whatever correctives are proposed, there must be both individual and social uptake of those changes in order for them to have any impact on women’s lives. Meyers faces this necessity more squarely in her final chapter on sexuality, where she points out that female sexual agency cannot change without concurrent changes in masculine sexual identity, although the problem of how to effect such changes remains. Similarly, McNay writes hopefully about creative connection and interdependence with others, but in her work—perhaps because of her reliance on a fractious group of theorists—these “others” remain largely abstractions. The discomforts in social roles of which she writes are not just between the self and a set of institutions or expectations; they are between the self and other people, people with their own specificity and their own discomforts. Despite—or perhaps because of—her emphasis on collective action, McNay seems to defer genuine selfhood to some future possible world. Nevertheless, McNay’s emphasis on collective action is a helpful complement to Meyers’s focus on imagery.<br>

Author(s): Mandry,  Christof<br>
Abstract: Granting the important historical work of part 1 of this book, it is in part 2 that Mandry begins to make some innovative moves. The gambit is to shift the discussion from the relations that can and ought to obtain between theology and philosophy toward a consideration of the ethical self. In order to make that move, Mandry draws on the recent work of Paul Ricoeur, especially
      Oneself as Another(Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992). This is important because, while Ricoeur’s thought has had considerable impact in the United States and in France, his work has not been used nearly so much within German theology. To be sure there are some theologians, like Dietmar Mieth, who have engaged in hermeneutical reflection and, further, work of Jürgen Habermas, Hans‐Georg Gadamer, and other German thinkers is certainly well known. But the contribution of Ricoeur to theological reflection is just now gaining interest. Happily, with the work of Mandry and others this development will continue.<br>

Abstract: MacIntyre shows how narratives constitute social life: “I can only answer the question ‘What am I to do?’ if I can answer the prior question ‘Of what story or stories do I find myself a part?’ We enter human society, that is, with one or more imputed characters—roles into which we have been drafted” [
         13, p. 216]. While there continues to be argument over the claim that stories are lived before they are recounted and that life is stories being lived out, the work of Carr shows that this is so, for the overall temporal structure of action is narrative in character; life is an inchoate narrative [24]. Human reality is not just a sequence because it can be demonstrated that narrative coherence inheres in “even the most elementary experience or action” [24, p. 88]. Narrative coherence is “an essential structural feature of the very fact ofhavingan experience orperformingan action” [24, p. 88]. Hence, order is present in events even before a narrative is imposed on them, and “the real difference between ‘art’ and ‘life’ is not organization versus chaos, but rather the absence in life of that point of view which transforms events into a story bytellingthem” [24, p. 59]. This emphasis on activity is also found in MacIntyre: “Narrative is not the work of poets, dramatists and novelists reflecting upon events which had no narrative order before one was imposed by the singer or the writer; narrative form is neither disguise nor decoration” [13, p. 211]. For MacIntyre, human actions are themselves enacted narratives; for Carr, it is in living out a life that we achieve a “grasp” at the level of attempting to make meaning or sense of relationships [24]. According to Gare, following this line of thought shows us the following:
               
         Actions are lived stories. The more complex the action, the longer its duration and the more people involved, the more obviously this is the case. Actions such as building a community or developing our understanding of the~<br>

Abstract: My analysis of the pervasiveness of the race‐gender analogy raises the obvious question about whether it is possible to theorize race and gender in any way other than analogically. Has analogy been so powerfully deployed that we simply cannot escape it when we think of race and gender? To the extent that feminist theory—white or otherwise—refuses specificity, there is always a danger of analogizing. Take, for instance, Sandoval’s attempt to articulate an oppositional politics in
         Methodology of the Oppressed(2000). Although Sandoval critiques Haraway’s appropriation of the methodologies of women of color into examples of cyborg feminism (Sandoval2000, 71), her book remains indebted to Haraway’s construction of the cyborg as a generalized locus of difference and contradiction. Perhaps that is why the predominant mode of analysis inMethodology of the Oppressedis analogizing different forms of dissident consciousness, such as Roland Barthes’s punctum (a meaning that cannot be named, because it is not part of a collective code; Barthes1981, 27), Anzaldúa’smestizaje(mixture, hybrid; Anzaldúa1987), and Haraway’s cyborg feminism. While it might well be important to demonstrate the undeniable structural similarities among these concepts, the very methodology of generalization and analogy might blind us to problems apparent only through localized readings. For instance, to bypass the reading of Anzaldúa’smestizajein the context of Mexico, where it was the official policy of amalgamation and adopted in order to disempower black races, is to miss the crucial contradiction here between progressive feminism and hegemonic racial hierarchies.15<br>

Abstract: For the notion of strategic essentialism, see Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, “Subaltern Studies: Deconstructing Historiography,” in her
            The Spivak Reader, 214–21. Serene Jones has drawn attention to the fact that the poststructuralist theoretical assumptions about the always oppressive nature of binarisms do not necessarily hold up under the pressures of concrete political struggles and that, in order to strengthen the bond of solidarity for a coalition of diverse social and cultural identities, what is called for is some kind of grand narrative that clearly defines the powers to be resisted and dismantled. I think this applies to a coalition of different religious identities as well.

Abstract: See Emanuele Tesauro, “Il Commentario,” in
            Panegirici sacri(Venice: Tramontin, 1682), pt. 2, 84. Emanuele Tesauro was born in Turin in 1592 into the noble family of the counts of Salmour. He became a Jesuit in 1611. Some twenty years later (1634), he left the order but remained a secular priest. In 1633, he published the first edition of thePanegirici sacri, which was a big success and was dedicated to Christine of France. In 1654, at the age of sixty‐two, Tesauro published the first edition of theIl Cannocchiale aristotelicoand in 1661 the three tragediesErmenegildo,Edipo, andIppolito. Considered a master of the art of preaching, between 1619 and 1670 Tesauro also wrote the vast collection ofInscriptiones(first ed., 1666), made of innumerable emblems, mottoes, epigraphs, devices for royal palaces, and all kinds of objects. He died in 1675. For a detailed biography, see Maria Luisa Doglio, “Emanuele Tesauro e la parola che crea: Metafora e potere della scrittura,” in Emanuele Tesauro,Il cannocchiale aristotelico, facsimile reproduction (Turin: Editrice artistica piemontese, 2000), vii–xvi.<br>

Abstract: Frei’s discussion of Midrash contrasts with his criticism of Phillips’s position. He describes Midrash as a practice of reading that is primarily responsible to the community, but in such a way that it enables second‐order discourse to emerge. Indeed, the description above is very close to the type 4 of Barth’s theology. Midrash avoids “parroting” because of its recognition that there are gaps, or problems, within the biblical text—issues that arise within the practice of reading by the community.
         Derasharises from withinpeshat,which, as Loewe describes, always already has a latent dynamism. The priority of the literal sense emerges in how the problems raised by such gaps are resolved—namely, through intratextual reading that relates the words and phrasings of the texts to other scriptural passages. The juxtaposition and interplay of diverse, often “surprising” passages opens the world of understanding for Midrash, without appeal to a general logical framework that would be imported and imposed onto the text. This practice of reading then becomes authoritative for the community—in Frei’s words, “a kind of instruction that has continuity of form.” It is, then, an interpretive practice that is primarily directed toward the community’s self‐understanding—but that can, to some degree, be understood by outsiders, and may make use of alternative logics to help clarify a particular case.<br>

Abstract: What then did happen in the pages of

The ten authors most often cited, in descending order of frequency, are Jacques Derrida, Sigmund Freud, Michel Foucault, Walter Benjamin, Roland Barthes, Jacques Lacan, Fredric Jameson, Edward Said, Theodor Adorno, and Immanuel Kant (seetable 2). Ranking the theorists we tracked by the number of times they’d been cited produced some interesting juxtapositions (seetable 3). Karl Marx tied with Stanley Fish for fifteenth place. Some ties seem fortuitous (Kuhn, Latour, Merleau‐Ponty, and Weber tied for seventy‐sixth), others jarring (Aristotle and Homi Bhabha? Harold Bloom, Northrop Frye, and Gayatri Spivak?).<br>

Abstract: In sum, the various Christian frameworks for understanding 9/11 that circulated in Mrs. Barrett’s classroom raised a host of troubling implications. The events of 9/11 were perpetrated by human hands, such that the deaths experienced were brutal, and the bodies of those lost, ugly. Those who were “saved,” however, suffered less and died more beautifully, by allowing God to “use” them toward his greater good. God allowed these events to occur in order to widen his presence in the public (secular) sphere and to encourage Americans to embrace Christianity. While God directs history and answers individuals’ prayers, then, God nonetheless enables atrocities like the Holocaust and the attacks on 9/11 to happen. And since all events in history, including 9/11, follow God’s logic and imply God’s approval, whether to act in this world to further the good is an open question rather than an obvious choice for most of the students in Mrs. Barrett’s classroom.<br>

Abstract: I trust that what I have written here clarifies, in the course of the discussion, the relevance and significance of the seven characteristics of Don Browning’s style of theologizing. Following in his footsteps I hope to have made a contribution to the public theology he espouses—the first characteristic I mentioned at the beginning of this article. I trust that I have likewise shown my interest—the second characteristic—in the institutions determining people’s concrete daily lives, as well as influencing and coloring their norms, values, and religiosity. I have referred specifically to the institution of law, especially human rights law. The third characteristic is also clear: as Browning’s study of marriage and the family is conducted in a global, more especially an interreligious perspective, I have paid due attention to interreligious interaction and dialogue, which dominate not only politics and the mass media but also the conversations in our living rooms. Both of us are convinced that any public theology must be characterized by an empirical approach—the fourth characteristic. In his family project, Browning not only collaborates with social scientists but also incorporates their empirical research into the goal and content of his project. In this article, I, too, have used insights from political and social sciences, as well as empirical‐theological research, in order to relate the assumptions and principles of interreligious interaction and dialogue directly to empirical reality.<br>

Author(s): Todorova Maria<br>
Abstract: Trying to make sense of the square between the National Gallery/former palace and the mausoleum as a semiotic space, the cultural historian Dafina Dicheva laments the victory of destruction. She notes that, while the two buildings were indeed entangled in an epic metaphoric struggle, their physical presence side by side secured not only a synchronic but also a diachronic representation of the city's historical meanings, like a palimpsest. Transition periods always vacillate between rewriting and reassessment, but one would hope that any act would bring in some new meaning. The demolition of the mausoleum, according to Dicheva, left only a “desemioticized center and the debilitating power of the symbol of destruction, threatening in its insistence that anything can disappear.” In this context, she interprets the subsequent
         Bierfestin the square as a symbolic demolition in the wake of the physical one. It does not invert reality into the carnivalesque and thus integrate culture; instead, it disintegrates culture by transforming reality into carnival, where theBierfestis experienced as total reality. “Destruction does not allow the reconstruction of the social and cultural order. … On the contrary, it is a mirror inversion, which blocks the social and individual experience at the level of anticulture.”91<br>

Abstract: Whatever normative conclusions may be drawn in the end, theological ethicists ignore the unique situation of children and childhood at their own peril. Neglecting such marginalized groups as women and minorities weakened the voice of theological ethics in the past, both by silently playing into larger social wrongs and by failing to learn and grow from those silenced. Childhood in the United States and the world presents theological ethics today with a new and different but just as acute social challenge. Methodologically, since children cannot speak up as fully as can adults for themselves, theological ethicists should engage as deeply as possible with children’s actual social experiences, including through the sophisticated observational work of the human sciences, in order more creatively to understand and respond. Substantively, childhood demands at the very least renewed attention to the asymmetrical tensions of human moral responsibility, the senses in which others demand of those around them creative self‐transformation. This childist gesture of responsiveness and self‐critique has already begun to animate the human sciences. How much more, then, should it be welcomed and deepened further by Christian ethicists, who in one way or another trace a transformed world to the possibilities incarnated in an infant’s birth.<br>

Abstract: A hermeneutically sophisticated
         imitatio Deiwill therefore resist all too frequent appeals to poetics as merely an expression of individual subjectivity or as its opposite, a representation of a given traditional narrative to be applied and adhered to. Understood instead as animitatio Creatoris, humanity is ultimately responsible for narrating itself over time. Its capability for doing so is presupposed in the fact that human beings tell moral stories and myths at all. The impossible possibility commanded by our own mysterious natures is to imitate our own Creator in creating ever less distorted, violent, and exclusive historical worlds. Those done violence can find herein a deep well of empowerment to work toward transforming the social order. Those who perpetrate violence can discover that social creativity belongs to humanity as such in all its vulnerability, difference, and otherness. In both cases, what is to be imitated, in a hermeneutically dynamic way, is neither a lost nor an eternally fixed moral order but our own morally invisible creative humanity.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur aims to make explicit the connections linking the modern notions of self with those of ancient world thinkers. This quite intriguing story begins with the chanting heroes of canonical Greek literature, who question their selves as they strive to explain the choices they have made. In so doing, says Ricoeur, these heroes recognize for themselves a sense of responsibility. The story then develops with the ethics of virtues developed by Aristotle, especially the virtue of wisdom. Following the correct rules of this virtue engages one to act as would a “wise man” under a given set of circumstances. Such a wise man directs his action under a second‐order rule about rational action—the rule of
      phronesis, of prudence. Through the exercise of his discretion, he reveals an important part of himself: his own point of view. This emergence of the moral self in action is the reason why Ricoeur wishes to trace back in Ancient Greece “the emergence of the point of view of the subject in the description of rational action” (87). To be sure, Ricoeur admits that this analysis is a retrospective reach. But it is no small feat to have been able to reach through many centuries of writing and thinking with such a clear and concise canvas.<br>

Article Title: Toward a Practical and Normative Ethics for Librarianship<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: lq.2006.76.issue-3<br>
Date: 07 2006<br>
Author(s): Budd John M.<br>
Abstract: A genuine atmosphere of deliberation requires three principles: “The basic premise of reciprocity is that citizens owe one another justifications for the institutions, laws, and public policies that collectively bind them. … Together with reciprocity, two other principles specify the conditions of democratic deliberation. The principle of publicity requires that reason‐giving be public in order that it may be mutually justifiable. The principle of accountability specifies that officials who make decisions on behalf of other people, whether or not they are electoral constituents, should be accountable to those people” [
      34, pp. 133, 135]. Within the framework of rights (encompassing justice as fairness) and the process of deliberation according to a discourse ethical approach, librarianship can be better able to address the difficult issues it faces. The reality of pluralism necessitates both rights and deliberation. Deliberation, as a process, cannot help but be dialectical. As has been shown here, there are differing conceptions of right and good, of intellectual freedom and censorship, even of ethical theories. To at least some extent, the discussion and controversy surrounding these issues are antinomies, contradictions between statements that each has reasonable grounds. Dialectics, as a means of resolving contradictions and reconciling division, has its foundations in Hegel. Steven Smith ably summarizes the key elements of a dialectical approach:
               It is by such an approach that we, as a profession, can arrive at a fully formed practical and normative ethics. It would be fruitless to ignore the divisions and disagreements; they must be addressed dialogically. Further, the dialogue is inescapably phenomenological (as described above) in that legitimacy, which includes beliefs and voice, must be assumed by all, with regard to all. The foregoing is an attempt to further the dialogue.Three general features of this method can be noted in advance. ~<br>

Issue: ci.2007.33.issue-2<br>
Date: 01 2007<br>
Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: At this juncture let me return to the Platonic motif of the care of the soul and the first awakening of responsibility that is the core idea of European life, but with which the Christian understanding of the responsible self must also, according to Patočka, make a clear break. Let us thus once again remind ourselves that knowledge of what is eternal—justice, beauty, the Good—is the basis of Greek responsible life. Responsibility itself is something public because it is based upon knowledge, to which everyone has access in principle. It is possible to account for the concept of responsibility and to universally establish what responsibility and being responsible consist of, but such an understanding of responsibility also implies that the responsible self must be able to give reasons for any of his or her actions and beliefs, publicly whenever possible. According to this Platonic conception of responsibility, “not knowing, having neither a sufficient knowledge or consciousness of what being
      responsiblemeans, is of itself a lack of responsibility. In order to be responsible it is necessary to respond to or answer to what being responsible means” (GD,p. 25). To the extent that the Platonic conception of the care of the soul is the first awakening of and to responsibility and hence that this understanding of responsibility is the first moment in the genealogy of responsibility in (or as) Europe, this demand that knowledge be involved in responsible decision making is at the heart of the history of the concept. It dominates the thought on responsibility in Europe from Plato’s to Husserl’s reflections on an absolutely self‐responsible universal science. Derrida refers to this Greek moment and endorses it, thus highlighting a certain continuity between his own thought and that of Husserl on this issue when he writes that responsibility consists, “according to the most convincing and most convinceddoxa, inresponding, hence in answering to the other, before the other ~<br>

Author(s): Harootunian Harry<br>
Abstract: The current return to a historical present teeming with competing temporalities from the past recalls both repetitions from other times and places and what perceiving them meant for social theory. Specifically, this recognition refers to those attempts envisaged by people like Tosaka and Maurice Halbwachs before World War II who sought to account for the spectacle of mixed temporalities in the present. Both, it is important to acknowledge, discounted the veracity of history’s claims to a true time and proposed conceptions of temporality they believed to be emanating from the historical process itself (as they conceived it). The consequence of Halbwachs’s and Tosaka’s interventions was to deprivilege state archives and thus shifted the order of the Hegelian allegory symbolizing the conflict between Chronos, the god of Time, and Zeus, the god of politics who created state and hearth. In this struggle, Chronos, who inevitably devours his own, engulfing all in his passage, is ultimately dominated by Zeus, who creates the state, which in turn conquers time. Just as important is the state’s capacity to transform in history all that Mnemosyne—the goddess of memory—had been able to collect after the rampaging passage of time.
         25It is also worth mentioning that while Halbwachs codified the separation of history from memory and upheld the claims of the latter over the former (that is to say, the claims of time over space) the effort to rematerialize time—yet retain its qualitative character—by freeing it from an interiorized, psychological consciousness was not attempted in Europe or America, but Japan. Tosaka’s critique of what he called “borrowed time,”26referring to history’s reliance on conceptions of time from other disciplines—the physical sciences, but especially the inner time consciousness of phenomenology and even mythology—and his identification of the everyday (especially as lived by the worker) revealed the real source of historical time, the “mystery of~<br>

Abstract: After the JST describes the evolution of a godly order and rebellious antiorder among Adam and Eve’s immediate progeny, the generations of the patriarchs are listed consistent with the KJV. While the KJV was able to tell Enoch’s story in thirteen words—“And Enoch walked with God, and he was not; for God took him”—the
         JSTrequired 4,600.80Smith’s Enoch is the most representative of Mormonism’s understanding of the divine‐human relationship and its rejection of contemporary Christian anthropology. For the sake of brevity, two themes must suffice to make this point. First, in the JST, Enoch “built a city that was called the city of Holiness, even Zion.”81The people were also called Zion “because they were of one heart and of one mind and dwelt in righteousness and there were no poor among them.” In short, the story of Enoch tells of a community that experienced the end of evil. This is made clear in their overcoming the separation from God occasioned by the fall: “Enoch and all his people walked with God, and he dwelt in the midst of Zion.” They triumphed over their enemies because Enoch “spake in the word of the Lord,” and, when he did, humans and nature “were turned out of their course.” Ultimately, not only Enoch, as implied in the KJV, but also his city were taken up to heaven without experiencing death.82Second, and most significant for the argument of this article, Smith’s narrative depicts an extended theophany in which Enoch is portrayed as obtaining guarantees of redemption from God in virtue of Enoch’s God‐given right to access heavenly power and exercise it in temporal affairs. This is the final example of the way in which Smith’s mythos “recalibrates” categories of thought and privilege inherent in the status quo of Christian theologizing on the divine human relationship.83<br>

Author(s): Browning,  Don S.<br>
Abstract: This book is based on Don Browning’s most recent work on the relation of Christian ethics and the moral psychologies—a plural that the author uses in order to indicate the pluralist nature of this academic field. Browning states his guiding question as follows: should “moral theologians critique these psychologies and perhaps cleanse both theology and the wider culture of the possible mistaken images of moral responsibility proffered by them?” His “brief answer” is that “
      contemporary moral psychology can contribute to Christian ethics, but only when it does its research with competent pre‐scientific or pre‐empirical understandings of morality”(2). Accordingly, Browning’s special interest refers to the understandings of morality that research presupposes. It is these preunderstandings that require critical analysis by, among others, theologians. The model that Browning uses in his analysis is an adaptation of Paul Ricoeur’s critical hermeneutical ethics. This ethics combines hermeneutical sensitivity to different cultural and religious traditions with a critical point of view informed by, among others, the social sciences and philosophical ethics. It gives due attention to particular visions of the good life and of the “status of humans” (10) without losing touch with the claims of universalist ethical criteria (“the deontological test” [52]). It may also be called “antifoundationalist” in that it begins with history and moral tradition rather than with empirical research as a supposedly objective basis.<br>

Abstract: Characteristic of this new attitude toward the past are the closing words of Sanders’s recently published volume,
         Adaptation and Appropriation(2006), in the Routledge Critical Idiom series. Opening her final paragraph with the claim that “We need then to restore to the subgenres or practices of adaptation and appropriation a genuinely celebratory comprehension of their capacity for creativity, and for comment and critique,” she concludes: “Adaptation and appropriation … are all about multiple interactions and a matrix of possibilities. They are, endlessly and wonderfully, about seeing things come back to us in as many forms as possible” (Sanders2006, 160). This is the rhetoric of hedonistic liberalism, celebrating multiplicity and pluralism for its own sake, for the choices it allows; it is Fredric Jameson’s postmodernity whose “relationship to the past is that of a consumer adding another rare object to the collection, or another flavour to the international banquet” (1998, 129). Typically, there is no word about the future re‐vision might help to envision, no sense of “memory as a means to liberation” (Greene1991b, 291), of the interlocking of memory and the feminist project, of looking back in order to move forward. On the left, concerns about the disappearance of the future and capitalism’s increasing monopoly on it are growing, as are laments about the loss of a sense of historical time as a teleology moving away from a past from which we could learn and into a future that would be different (see Gumbrecht2004, 120; see also Jameson2005). There are those who are bitter about it, complaining, as does Terry Eagleton inAfter Theory(2003), that “Over the dreary decades of post‐1970s conservatism, the historical sense had grown increasingly blunted, as it suited those in power that we should be able to imagine no alternative to the present” (Eagleton2003, 6–7).

Abstract: It is important to clarify at this point that the historicism we espouse is strictly a methodology to preserve the historical record. As stated above, the historicism we are advocating is founded upon the works of Johann Gottfried von Herder. We see in his reflections on mankind’s intellectual development a way to avoid the question of objective truth in librarianship for the sake of historical comprehension. It is very similar to Descartes suspending the truth value of the propositions of his beliefs in order to arrive at epistemological certainty. Our suspension of truth value does not arrive at epistemological certainty about the propositions contained in the many volumes housed in a library but rather at certainty that the historical record has not been compromised by the elimination of any these volumes. In other words, librarians must suspend the truth value of singular items and artifacts in the historical record in order that the whole truth of any given period of history be accurately analyzed and understood. As Herder states: “If history in its simplest sense were nothing but a description of an occurrence, of a production, then the first requirement is that the description be
         whole, exhaust the subject, show it to use from all sides” [74].<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Author(s): Stewart Garrett<br>
Abstract: So I return to that invented novel one last time, anomalous though it is, as an exemplar of more familiar novelistic tendencies in order to make clear the methodological implications its concoction does
         notentail. Narratography per se has nothing to do with the conjuration of wholesale counternovels. Albeit an assiduous close reader of fiction, that Oxford don is no practitioner of narratography—or at least not in anything we've heard from him here. He is a virtual biographer, in other words a fiction writer. The contrapuntal tale of the lost mother takes to an extreme dilation the fleeting thoughts anyone might have in learning of her so suddenly, and then learning no more, and then being denied even the closural satisfaction of watching the hero find out the stunning truth, even if it only transpired for the reader in a second or two of reflective recoil from the headlong settlements of the plot. But the work of narratography (a matter always of diction, syntax, punctuation, figuration) comes later—most intensely when the very wordmother's(possessive in every sense) is seen to assimilate the male hero to its lexical confines across the prose cadence, and ghostly grammatical antecedence, of plot's immediate marital aftermath.<br>

Abstract: In the present article I have undertaken the examination of individual volition in Augustine, the church father who introduced the idea of “free will” (liberum arbitrium) in religious discourse. Augustine’s portentous contribution to the discussion of volition as a token of identity and a reflection of self‐awareness consists of the identification of desire with love. To Augustine, our soul (
         animus) is not a constant and immutable attribute, but the expression of a perfectible self, which wills its own optimal instantiation when it desires first and foremost to love. After discussing Augustine, I proceeded to examine the different way whereby Marcel, the protagonist ofÀ la recherche du temps perdu, curbs his own conscious volition, which he considers an incurable source of personal egoism, in order for his better self to surrender to the love buried in his unconscious memory.<br>

Author(s): Miller Richard B.<br>
Abstract: Viewed in these Augustinian terms, just‐war morality invites one to ask what a war means—how we interpret ourselves and others regarding matters of life and death. Death raises fundamental questions regarding horizons of meaning and desire, and war asks in the starkest terms whether its participants are willing to impose or take on the ultimate sacrifice. In this respect we continue to travel with Augustine despite our distance from him. For surely he would have us ask whether we possess a second‐order framework for determining whether the desires aroused by killing, death, and sacrifice are themselves desirable. That is to say, Augustine would have us ask about the effects of killing on individual and corporate character and how death affects the practices of self‐interpretation and the public history we wish to write about ourselves. War for Augustine was not only a matter of personal virtue and vice; it also raised questions of meaning and memory as these bear upon the formation of civic identity and the construction of desire across generations.<br>

Abstract: Other events, celebrations, and sorrows, religious and otherwise, could be mentioned.

What then is the aim of intellectual labor? How can knowledge grow so that life might increase, especially in our age when so many forms of life and cultural forms are endangered? Is it possible to rejuvenate the humanities and to probe the religions in order to envision a new self‐overcoming of human power and knowledge into responsibility for the integrity of life within the complexity of the world? That is the work of humanizing religion.<br>

Author(s): Zimmerman Virginia<br>
Abstract: The centrality of excavations and traces reappears in the discussion of archaeology, which focuses on London and Pompeii, and Zimmerman once again emphasizes the need for an authoritative writer to interpret remains in order to give them meaning. Charles Roach Smith is an important figure here, as is Henry Layard, and Zimmerman also explores the correlations between geology and archaeology, both of which she characterizes as excavatory sciences dependent on careful fieldwork and interpretive narrative reconstruction. The examination of Pompeii looks at Victorian efforts to reanimate Pompeii through historical writing, fictional or otherwise, concentrating on the works of Edward Bulwer-Lytton, and also at Victorian recreations of Pompeian daily life, which blended past and present. It is, however, the regeneration of Victorian London, which revealed the urban archaeological sites so important to Roach Smith, that leads into the discussion of Dickens's
      Little DorritandOur Mutual Friend. Zimmerman explores and explains how, in both of these works, Dickens uses explicitly archaeological language and his characters endeavor to excavate the past in order to understand and control the present. Though not all Dickens's characters can master the march of time, those who do achieve their happy ending, as did Ida and the Prince inThe Princess. Even so, Dickens does not give his plots the completion and closure that the reader might expect, and the characters are sometimes unable to excavate their own pasts completely.<br>

Author(s): Andrew Dudley<br>
Abstract: The organization's 1959 birthdate has obscured earlier efforts at coordinate film education. Dana Polan lays these out in
         Scenes of Instruction: The Beginnings of the U.S. Study of Film, bringing to light and paying tribute to individual scholars and the initiatives of particular universities. Polan nicely summarizes the attributes that turn a common interest or topic (the study of film) into an academic discipline (film studies) “with lineages, legacies, commonly shared assumptions, and regularized procedures.”8He suggests that curricula, conferences, canon formation, graduate students, journals, peer reviews, and other protocols of academic fields are disciplinary in order to realize what is most essential, an idea of progress and continuity. A discipline needs to see current work in relation to the momentum of prior study, just as it needs to look forward to the advancements that graduate students will make when they take up the reins. It is here above all that the early scholars Polan celebrates—some as prophetic, some as merely maverick—belong as atopicin film studies more than as part of itsrootsystem. Polan resurrects the earliest glimmers of academic interest in this popular entertainment around 1915 and traces a series of independent projects and lines of thought up to the formation of the first curricula (1937) that looked forward to, but did not really generate, the programs and departments committed to the all‐out study of cinema that started to coalesce in the late 1950s.<br>

Abstract: D'Holbach's caveat is essential for understanding the implications of his system for the relationship between person and nature, but also between the transcendent and the immanent. If nature is meant to assume the role once assigned to the divine in Christian theology, it does so in an entirely different manner—not as an all-knowing, all-powerful subject, but as a blind and will-less force. At the same time, the human person is both identified with and in large part reduced to an effect of this force. D'Holbach's abandonment of transcendence in his materialist system thus drastically altered the relationship between God and soul as it was understood in orthodox religion. What had been an exchange between two distinct, albeit unequal persons, was reduced to an arrangement between two objects. The meaning of immanence likewise changed. Once mainline Christian theology began to assert the self's inward transcendence vis-à-vis the world as “masters and possessors of nature” (to cite Descartes), atheist philosophes such as d'Holbach reacted by asserting the immanent power of things to dispossess the self in order to repudiate the concept of divinity that stood behind it. However, this was no mere reversion to the world of “enchantment.” While d'Holbach was momentarily willing to anthropomorphize nature for rhetorical effect, he and Spinoza persistently applied the mechanized organization of the universe to human beings as well. In lieu of the semitranscendent, personified objects of the enchanted universe, one was left with the prospect of a world inhabited by wholly immanent, objectified entities.<br>

Abstract: Aiding in this iconical reconfiguration were the microadjusting features of ritual performance. Procedures such as shaving, showering, praying, and blowing Quranic verses helped to heighten the register of the ritual event, and ultimately to instantiate an irreversible commitment to the end goal. Indeed, the entire ritual process might be seen as secondary to, or at least supportive of, the oath unto death in section 1. No differently than oaths in ancient war literature, the oath of the last instructions was a highly sanctified liturgical order that aimed to instantiate a commitment and to communicate binding intent.<br>

Abstract: But even when the token is received in trust, there is no debt created since the final gift has not yet arrived. One might feel obligation in anticipation of the gift, but such obligation differs from that in which a gift would actually have been received rather than a gift one might receive. Because of the translation of obligation into the future, it opens up a space for exchange without debt. One can take this token in trust and then offer gratitude in return to God without debt, without obligation in freedom. Derrida constructed the pure gift in order to preserve it from exchange and reciprocity. He did not thereby think that the gift so purified would not affect the world of exchange, forever hovering aloft. Rather, his preferred way of describing the gift is as an interruption, a trace, or cinders that would in some oblique or indirect way haunt or challenge the ordinary economy. By contrast, because the giving of the promise indebts God to the one promised in some sense, this token and final gift enters into the already existing exchange of gifts in human culture or the political sphere. Derrida’s gift, in some of its formulations, could silence immanent political criticism. Tillich feared that aphasia in the political was the consequence of dialectical theology when it refused to allow God to interact with the world for fear of tainting God’s wholly otherness. This refusal would prevent the token offered in promise, as well as the one promised, from entering into the give‐and‐take of life with the token in hand or the trust of the word, even though it can radically challenge by its interruption of gift economy.<br>

Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: This solicitation had its effect, not only on his students at the École Normale Israélite Orientale, where his weekly
         cours rachibecame a highlight of the school's curriculum, but on many who came to ENIO on Saturdays merely to attend these lessons. Benny Lévy, most famously, turned away from secular existence and became abaal teshuvain response to Lévinas's influence.18Yet Lévinas's drive to rejuvenate Judaism did not culminate in a revival of France's Jewish community. It was more ambitious. Lévinas argued for the universal significance of the Jewish message. It was the plurivocity of the text that allowed him to claim that this message was already in the Talmud, but it was also this message that led him to offer readings of the Talmudic text that themselves reduce the text's plurivocity to a singular interpretation. In order to specify Judaism's message as one that is universally communicable Lévinas must ultimately claim one meaning as primary—the philosophical core buried beneath a multifaceted surface. The model Lévinas invokes looks much like Kant's inReligion within the Limits
            of Reason Aloneor Maimonides's in theGuide for the Perplexed, where we find a hierarchy of meaning. Philosophical meaning is cloaked by an outward mythology. Scripture's truth is not arrived at by discovering its seventy faces of meaning but in the location of the text's philosophical essence.<br>

Abstract: All this raises the question of whether or not
      Confessionscan be properly read at all. If the dividing lines between gift and desire, past and future, time and eternity, memory and oblivion are no longer what they seem to be, becoming quite evanescent when measured against narrative and discursive order, how does one read a discourse under the pressure of the present of the present that is in its turn under the pressure of eternity? Here Adorno's question,Wie zu lesen sei?becomes quite urgent. It would be another matter altogether to explain why reading the discourse ofConfessionsfrom the viewpoint of Augustine's own concept of temporality had to wait till the rise of modernism, although, on the other hand, we may tend to be misled by the Petrarchan tradition of readingConfessionsand as a result neglect the earlier, monastic handling of Augustinian meditative texts, such as Anselm's, which may have been much closer to the original. However that may be, it is Hans Robert Jauss who, in his book on Proust, has spotted the potential of Augustinian time for understanding the “modern” novel and, by implication, Augustine himself. Paving the way for his treatment of Proust, Jauss assesses, in the first chapter of his book, Joycean temporality inUlysses:
            Jauss's characterization of Augustinian temporality, with its emphasis on the actual flux of time within a consciousness that, being just present, refuses any and all distinctions outside this actual flux, can shed light on the way to gain access to Augustine's own handling of time and narrative.If we wish to express the principle of temporality in
         Ulyssesin terms of a formal concept, we could say with Augustine: within the continuous flux of unarticulated consciousness, everything is only to the extent that it is present; the past aspraesens de praeteritis[the present of the past], the present aspraesens de praesentibus[the present of the present], the future aspraesens de futuris[the present of ~<br>

Article Title: Why Devils Came When Faustus Called Them<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 660269<br>
Date: 08 2011<br>
Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: I would now like to return to the rumor circulated by Prynne about the performances of
      Doctor Faustusthat seemed to conjure “the visible apparition of the Devil on the stage” to the “great amazement of both the actors and spectators…there being some there distracted with that fearful sight.” The ambiguity of Prynne's final phrase, “there being some there distracted with that fearful sight,” suggests both that the participants in the performance were distracted by the fearful sight of the devil appearing among them and that the devil appeared among them exactly because some participants were already driven to distraction by a fearful sight. And what else was this latter sight but the representation of conjuration itself? If you imagined magic as a spectacle meant to produce thoughts and feelings that would be watched and judged by both devils and God, to apprehend yourself taking pleasure in the staging of conjuration was to sense yourself being led into reprobation. Let us take, for example, the divertissement we have just quoted, in which Mephistopheles brings in devils who give “crowns and rich apparel” to Faustus and “dance and depart.” Mephistopheles is quite obviously entertaining the audience with this spectacle as much as he is entertaining the magician himself. And he is doing so after having made the audience complicit in his intent to deceive Faustus with his confiding aside: “I'll fetch him something to delight his mind” (2.1.82). To characterize “delight” as what would fatally distract Faustus from thoughts of God and repentance is to remind the audience that delight is theologically suspect in this context, and as such is something to be resisted. Yet how could the audience not delight, at least somewhat, in the unusual sight of jewels and embroidered brocade glittering bright, in the sweet sound of the music playing as graceful devils moved in intricate patterns, in the very qualities of lightness and harmony that the moving figures exuded into t~<br>

Author(s): Bowman Sharon<br>
Abstract: Yet Larmore also suspects the ideal of personal autonomy underlying the constricted view of the mind as a “mirror of the world”; he thinks it encourages the idea that we have to endorse or decide to adopt any “element of good or bad” or criterion found in the world before it can move us (104). But, while Larmore offers ample reasons to reject this view of the mind as essentially disengaged before its choices or endorsements, neither this disengaged view nor the suspect “specular model” of the mind in general follows from the more modest thesis that decision has a unique role to play in our agency—for decisions may always respond to considerations that are either apprehended as normative or potentially action guiding before we are intentionally committed to them, or to considerations that are dependent on past decisions (to which this same condition applies together with a ban on infinite regresses). Similarly, we should not construe “autonomous” decision or action as completely independent of all prior reasons or even of the community of language speakers in relation to which our thoughts have meaning (105). This is a straw man version of autonomy that goes beyond even Stoic autarky to total solipsism—as if Sartrean arbitrary choice were the only way to explain the concept of self-determination or deep responsibility for one’s character. Nor need Kant’s conception of autonomy imply that the world or order of reality itself cannot contain any normative facts (107), although it has sometimes been misread that way. Instead it may simply mean that distinctively moral norms are not essentially coercive—that right is not mere might—because they fit our fundamental nature as beings capable of making decisions in response to the other nonmoral normative aspects of reality that Larmore calls a “third ontological order” in addition to physical and psychological facts (126). Kant does not hold that our rational assent to moral norms is optional; it is implicit in what we are. ~<br>

Author(s): Regan Ethna<br>
Abstract: In addition to developing a theological anthropology, Regan lays the groundwork for a human rights praxis of “just memory,” drawing on the work of Paul Ricoeur. Situating human rights discourse between the memory of suffering and the hope for a better future, Regan develops an ethics toward just memory, which includes allowing individuals to face the scars and wounds of memory in order to work through the past (101), enabling the pragmatic use of memory throughout a community through construction of narrative (101–2), and articulating an ethical-political duty of remembrance for purposes of preventing destructive tendencies, allowing the possibility of forgiveness, and retaining a heritage of victimization to counter the historical tendency to celebrate victors (102). Regan discusses the report of human rights violations and their individual and societal impacts, produced by the Office of the Catholic Archdiocese of Guatemala, as an example of how such an ethic can be put into practice.<br>

Abstract: Since the anachronism implicit in these arguments is seldom recognized, it is necessary to begin our discussion with a historical survey of models of infection in order to establish a more fitting interpretive context by which to understand the biblical evidence.
         
               Pre-modern conceptions of infectious diseases are invariably structured by metaphors.33
            
               Nutton writes: “It is important first to remember that in all this we are dealing with descriptions of the invisible, with hypothetical reconstructions of how things are or act, based only on the observance of ‘macrophenomena.’”34
            
               Although Galen’s references to “seeds of disease” in the second century35
            c.e.may have prefigured germ theory to some degree, this potential was left virtually unexplored for the next 1,600 years. In the meantime, Western medicine was dominated by the metaphor of a stain (Greekmiasma, Latininfectio), that could spread corrupting influence either by means of direct contact or through the bad air emitted by putrefaction (Greeksepsis).
               These two models for infection persisted as late as the mid-nineteenth century36
            c.e., represented by the rival schools of contagionism (via direct contact) and miasmatism (via bad air) which attempted to account for the spread of cholera in London.
               In fact, these models—based on an assumed correlation between perceptible means of transmission and the spread of infection—severely impeded the emergence of alternative accounts, including the correct one, that cholera was transmitted by imperceptible water-borne germs.37

Abstract: In the societies with which I am (more or less) intimately acquainted (Europe, U.S.A., India, and China), people make distinctions between good and bad, just as they make distinctions between beautiful and ugly, powerful and powerless, or, even more broadly, between day and night, young and old, et cetera. For the comparative study of society the importance of these distinctions is that, while they are universal, they are applied in very different ways. So, while the distinction between hot and cold is universal, it is applied in India, for example, to eating meat versus eating vegetables that have consequences for one’s entire quality of being. Such are the moral consequences of certain food habits, but inversely there is also an understanding in India that one’s birth in a particular social group determines who one is and what one eats. This explains why the warrior has to kill and why the Brahman refrains from killing. Killing is not reprehensible, as it belongs to the nature of the warrior. Certainly, not killing is superior to killing, but in order for some to be able not to kill, others have to. India offers us a case of moral relativism, related to a hierarchical social system. However, since the nineteenth century, reformers in India have wanted to reform this way of thinking, because, as they argue, it implies a system of social discrimination against untouchables who do impure work; it goes against one of the basic tenets of a modern society, the moral value of social equality. What we have in the anthropology of India is research on uneasy combinations of caste and class, of hierarchy and equality, of social impurity and hygiene. Indian society emphasizes right behavior in terms of family, sexuality, gender, and food; it is, at the same time, a society with extreme inequality, extreme infant mortality, and extreme poverty. It is highly moral and highly immoral at the same time, depending on one’s viewpoint.<br>

Author(s): Fisher Cass<br>
Abstract: Cass Fisher has set for himself a noble goal: “to reframe the debate about the role of theology in Judaism and Jewish studies by proposing a new model for understanding Jewish theological language” (2). The impetus for this project is the awareness that although the discipline of Jewish studies has thrived in the past half century, theology is still marginal because of the mistaken perception that “there is no Jewish theology” (3) or that “Judaism has produced the wrong kind of theology” (4). Fisher correctly and persuasively argues that such perception not only is historically incorrect but also ignores a thriving “post-Holocaust theology, feminist theology, exegetical theology, and covenantal theology” (3), a list that could have included environmental theology. To appreciate the degree to which theological thinking is central to Judaism, a new and more appropriate understanding of theology is in order. Theology is not to be reduced to propositional speculations about God but should rather be understood as belief-forming activities that are an integral part of Jewish religious practice, including exegesis, hermeneutics, rational discourse on divine perfection, and religious experience.<br>

Author(s): Rüpke Jörg<br>
Abstract: There is a clear difference between philosophy and history, and it is epistemological. In his last book, dedicated to “special and selected deities,” Varro dealt with those gods who were defined by Roman places of worship and statues but had also to admit the limits of his interpretations:
         
               
            de diis…populi Romani publicis, quibus aedes dedicaverunt eosque pluribus signis ornatos notaverunt, in hoc libro scribam, sed ut Xenophanes Colophonios scribit, quid putem, non quid contendam, ponam. hominis est enim haec opinari, dei scire.
            
                     
               61
                  
               The history of an old people, as indicated in fragment 12, had a more binding authority ([I will write in this book about the public deities of the Roman people, to whom they have dedicated temples and whom they have marked out by many images, but, as Xenophanes from Colophon wrote, I say what I believe, not what I claim. A human can only surmise these things, only a god knows them for sure.]
            quoniam in vetere populo esset, acceptam ab antiquis nominum et cognominum historiam tenere, ut tradita est, debere se). But history’s authority did not imply intellectual consent. The very special, and nevertheless binding, history of the urban territory and the society built in that place contained wrong decisions by the old Romans—and maybe by contemporaries. Varro does refer to contemporaneous conflicts, as the Egyptian cults and the “leveling of temples” demonstrate. Narrating such events in such a manner offers the possibility of distancing. Varro supports Roman religious tradition despite crucial historical mistakes by its agents, right at the start as well as later on in the introducing of images. Such a traditional religion might even be embarrassing, for example, in their use of images as in the old Romans’ invention of divine genealogies, that is, mythical narratives of sexual relationships among gods (frag. ~<br>

Abstract: After this incident I could never reread the dream episode without experiencing that sense of assignatory vertigo. In the extensive critical literature on Eve’s dream, the central debate is between those who believe that these words belong to Satan alone and those who attribute them, at least in part, to Eve. For the sake of convenience, we might refer to them as “externalists” and “internalists,” according to where they place the true source of the dream voice in relation to Eve. In the early and mid-twentieth century, when the “fallen before they fell” theory of our first parents was much discussed, it was common to assign the greater responsibility to Eve. Tillyard confidently claimed that “if the dream has disturbed Eve so much, she has really passed from a state of innocence into one of sin.”
         
               Tillyard recognizes Satan’s act of “insinuating” some of the sentiments into Eve, but he insists that the “mere fact of entrance implies some pre-existing sympathy” on the sleeper’s part and that she found this voice “far from alien.”10
            
               Millicent Bell also asserts that despite the obvious satanic influence, “already we suspect [Eve] receptive to the Tempter’s choice flattery.”11
            
               More recently Harinder Singh Marjara has argued in a similar vein that “Eve’s susceptibility to temptation must be a part of her nature, since her behavior, in order to be convincing, must give the sense of being caused, and it must be caused by Eve’s own nature rather than by an external force.”12

Article Title: From Religionless Christianity to Immanent Grace: Bonhoeffer’s Legacy in Badiou<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 677726<br>

Abstract: Badiou also emphasizes that the subjects to the truth of the resurrection, by the very fidelity toward that truth, are enabled to “refuse to submit to the order of the world as it has existed and instead struggle for a new one.”
         
               The community of the believers is constituted by their faithfulness toward the event that, in turn, allows them—and only them—to see the truth that it communicates. While the State’s interest is always in reforming the world, the believers are not interested in reforming the existing reality but in the birth of a new one. Therefore, those who feed on the truth-event adopt “a necessary distance from the State and from what corresponds to the State in people’s consciousness: the apparatus of opinion.”168
            
               Following Paul, Badiou admonishes that “a truth is a serious and concentrated procedure, which must never enter into competition with established opinions.”169
            
               This distinction between the opinions and the truth may suggest the same anti-idolatrous tendency that underlies Bonhoeffer’s reflection on the arcane discipline: the church must not allow the truth of the resurrection to be “sold” to the world as one of many products, since that would cause the specifically Christian discourse of the evental grace to degenerate into something we might call the “market-discourse” or, somewhat ironically, the “American discourse.”170<br>

Author(s): Huth Kimberly<br>
Abstract: This process is illustrated evocatively in and by Shakespeare’s
      King Lear. In this play, physical pain is both a sensory experience and a metaphor for other, less corporeal types of suffering—a point noted both by audiences of the play and by its characters. These characters practice a distinct way of appealing to bodily knowledge to understand otherwise unintelligible things that does not treat physical pain merely as a prompt for philosophical reflection. Before the intense physical suffering of the characters even begins, Lear frequently uses metaphors and other figurative tropes that transform nonphysical pain into something more tangible when his emotional or psychological anguish seems to him utterly incomprehensible. Like many of the metaphors discussed above, these figures often ask audiences to imagine a type of physical pain they may not have actually experienced. But Lear’s imagery then uses those concrete associations to interpret the world in which he finds himself. The pain of his thankless daughters, for instance, is so baffling to Lear that he must consider it metaphorically in order to grasp associatively what he cannot process directly: “[She] Look’d black upon me, strook me with her tongue, / Most serpent-like” (2.4.160–61); “[You are] a disease that’s in my flesh, / Which I must needs call mine. Thou art a bile, / A plague-sore, or embossed carbuncle, / In my corrupted blood” (2.4.222–25); and of course, “How sharper than a serpent’s tooth it is / To have a thankless child!” (1.4.288–89).
            This last image may be the most recognized, but it is the image of the diseased blood that brings Lear closest to understanding his own role in creating his thankless children, a theme he picks up later in his summative vision of life: “I am bound / Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears / Do scald like molten lead” (4.7.45–47). The metaphors reveal that his own flesh and blood, his own tears—and by extension his own tragic mistakes—play a r~<br>

Abstract: In an effort to overcome David Hume's skepticism, Immanuel Kant attempted, among other things, to establish both the validity of knowledge and the impossibility of knowledge without sensory experience. The idea of times derives from the succession of our perceptions. For, as it is from the disposition of visible and tangible objects that we receive the ideas of space, it is also from the succession of ideas and impressions that we form the idea of time. Time, then for Kant, becomes a “necessary” representation that underlies all “time,” he remarks, “is therefore a purely subjective condition of our (human) intuition [ … ] and in itself, apart from the subject, is nothing” (p. 166). G. F. W. Hegel proceeded beyond Kant to posit that “the narration of history and historical deeds and events appear at the same time; a common inner principle brings them forth together.” In discussing Paul Ricoeur's approach to the question of time, formulated in
      Time and Narrative, Mooij traces the philosophic traditions of idealism, phenomenology, and hermeneutics in that three‐volume work. For Ricoeur, “time requires narratives in order to manifest itself fully” (p. 240).<br>

Issue: jpolitics.68.issue-2<br>
Date: 05 2004<br>
Author(s): Eubanks Cecil<br>
Abstract: This theme of a postliberal order is explored in
         Eric Voegelin's Dialogues with the Postmoderns, which attempts to understand Voegelin as a postmodern thinker in search of a philosophical foundation but without foundationalism: to see whether a society can recover a sense of transcendence without resorting to metaphysical certainty (21). In “Voegelin and Ricoeur,” Peter Petrakis opens the book with the belief that such a recovery is possible. By showing how both thinkers believed that stories and symbols can serve as a foundation for politics and ethics, Petrakis demonstrates how both Voegelin and Rioecur can recover transcendence without returning to metaphysical certainty. Both Voegelin and Ricoeur cite a “unified self” who symbolizes or creates a narrative out of his experiences that can be verified both externally and internally. Critical to this understanding is that the “unified self” is one that respects the mystery of being and therefore does not attempt to place himself outside of reality to survey all of it: The self exists within a historical or linguistic process not of his own making and must accept it. By accepting this epistemologically limited position, the “unified self” protects himself against charges of metaphysical reductionism.<br>

Author(s): Anderson Judith H<br>
Abstract: The final chapter, which considers the
      Lex Mercatoria(1622) of the merchant Gerrard de Malynes, can stand for what is most distinctive about Anderson’s book. Like all that precedes it, it is the product of equal parts intense close reading and deep research. (The endnotes, fully a third again of the book’s length and set in smaller type, are a rich mine both of reference and reflection.) She unfolds Malynes’s body-soul-and-spirit allegory of “the three Essentiall Parts of Trafficke” (177) — commodities, money, and exchange — in order to show how he argues for the overriding economic importance of monetary policy. Malynes has his critics, both on account of his metaphors (which were disparaged by contemporaries such as Thomas Mun) and his theory (Mun again, and most modern economists). What Anderson is ultimately concerned to show, however, is how, for all of the potential intricacy of the relations between body and exchange, Malynes’s conceit is sterile, never transforming or vitalizing what I. A. Richards would call its economic tenor. His book had little power to change the way his contemporaries talked about money. Critics mostly celebrate the discovery of metaphorical overplus: here is a valuable lesson in how metaphor might fail.<br>

Abstract: This is the paradox that challenges Paul Beauchamp’s epistemological realism in
            Création et séparation, for example, where he observes: “Ceci vaut quelque soit l’échelonnement chronologique du Ps…, de Job et de l’Heptaméron: le début des séries cosmologiques se présente comme moins archaïque dans l’Heptaméron, plus archaïque dans les deux autres textes. Mais cela peut s’expliquer par les différences de genre ou par les intentions théologiques” (147–48). R. Alter also observes: “The justly celebrated Psalm 8 is a luminous instance of how poetic structure was made to yield a picture of the world that eloquently integrated underlying elements of Israelite belief. The poem might be described as a kind of summarizing poetic paraphrase of the account of creation inGenesis1, more or less following the same order of things created and stressing, as doesGenesis1, man’s God-given dominion over the created world” (2011, 146–47).<br>

Issue: hsns.2012.42.issue-5<br>
Date: 11 2012<br>
Abstract: This essay brings together and builds upon histories of cold war American science and studies of objectivity, scientific personae, and the self by exploring the physicist Merle A. Tuve‘s career in the late 1940s and 1950s as a history of selfhood and the emotional dimensions of scientific identity. As director of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution of Washington after World War II, Tuve followed a convoluted path through the institutions, politics, identities, and sensibilities of science in the cold war, and he struggled to preserve a sense of meaning and identity centered on the humanistic and aesthetic possibilities of scientific inquiry in an era of rapidly growing instrumentalism. His predicament highlights not just the political and institutional shifts within postwar science, but also the intricate entanglements between feeling, selfhood, and the cold war order.<br>

Abstract: As Cardwell indicates, Maybeck's design was criticized because of his liberal mix of Greek and Roman sources—especially due to the combination of a Greek entablature in conjunction with arches and a domed structure (Cardwell,
               Bernard Maybeck, 149). In fact, Maybeck was quite open about his approach. In his typescript "The Palace of Fine Arts" he made numerous references to "the Greek" and "the Greeks" as an explanation to certain aspects of his design. His working drawings also demonstrate his interest in the Greek version of the Corinthian order (cf.Figure 18and the capital onFigure 7).<br>

Abstract: The L.D.S Church's use of commemorative rituals and narrative history to simultaneously adapt and maintain identity is not unique, but it is uniquely available to analysis because of the immediacy of the change and the Saints' devotion to record-keeping. Thus, the drama of LDS survival during the Progressive Era illuminates age-old religious strategies for adaptation to social norms, which strategies preserve the faithful's confidence in the timelessness of their god's moral and ecclesiastical order. More narrowly, these events in American church history are critical for understanding how the civilly disobedient Saints finally accepted the rule of federal law without losing their religion.<br>

Author(s): Gross Daniel M.<br>
Abstract: Abstract: Vico's theory of metaphor is best understood as a monster in the tradition of classical rhetorical invention. It is the mutant offspring of metaphor characterized as "necessary" (an "ear" of com, for example) and metaphor characterized in terms of analogy. From the perspective of his method. Vico marries these apparently incompatible forms inherited from Aristotle and thereby identifies a third type of linguistic metaphor. I argue that the metaphor identifies a stipulatory definition taken out of context. In order to situate this claim, I outline Vico's genetic analysis and elaborate in general terms what metaphor and definition share. Most importantly. Vico insists that beings, actions, and events are linguistically identifiedin some particular diseursive context. Indeed, in many cases that context alone determines whether the expression can be called a definition or a metaphor. Like Cicero's ideal jurist, Vico's hero employs motivated words and realizes possibilities available to common sense. Henee Vico's theory of metaphor is both "constructivist"—language has the power to makes things—and "humartist"—it must do so in a form appropriate to history and culture. Vico's theory is consequently important to us because it challenges the proper/figurative distinction championed in the philosophy of language and adds a pragmatic dimension to contemporary views of metaphor at work in literary theory.<br>

Abstract: Abstract:The fact that classical and early medieval allegorical personifications were exclusively female has long perplexed literary scholars and rhetoricians. Although arguments have been made about this gendering using grammatical formalism for the most part, an examination of rhetoric's own deep structure—that is, the discursive metaphors it has always employed to talkabouttropes and figures—promises to better articulate the gendered bases of the figure. Using analytical tactics drawn from Paul de Man's discussions of prosopopeia, this essay re-examines some of the rhetorical record along with programmatic imagery from patristic writings in order to demonstrate how women theinselves could serve as the "figures of figuration."<br>

Abstract: Abstract:This essay argues that in 1 Thessalonians, Paul uses eschatological discourse—language about the end of hme—in order to evoke a symbolic world-view in which his readers become God's elect, living at the end of time and awaiting the sudden, imminent retum of Christ from heaven. This self-identification explains their present misfortunes, while at the sam.e time demanding that they fulfill the ethical and moral demands of the Christian faith. More broadly, this essay points to the role that eschatological discourse played within early Christianity in general, suggesting that it formed a central, paradigmatic drama which helped to define ontological and teleological reality for the movement's adherents.<br>

Abstract: Research on identity suggests that a critical factor in identity concerns presentation or the behaviors actors perform in order to convince others of their identity. Yet identity also involves the attributions others make on the basis of these behaviors. In this paper, I argue that all acts do not fare equally in the process of attribution. Rather, individuals making attributions engage in a process of mental weighing as a way to determine which acts “count” toward identity and to what extent. While various components of the act contribute to its social weight—its presence or absence, markedness, frequency, context, and the manner in which it is performed—the lens through which the attributer views the act also influences the weighing process.<br>

Abstract: There are two ways of reading Goffman--as a theorist of trust and ritual accommodation, that is, as a theorist of the interaction order, or as a theorist of deception. I suggest a way of making these two readings compatible, by arguing that Goffman was interested in what I call the “production of credibility.” Credibility is the quality of being believable, and this quality is integral to both trust and deception. Viewed in this way, Goffman explored the ways in which people make their actions convincing to other people. Although Goffman's analysis of the interaction order did not need a theory of the self, his work actually contains two quite different theories of the self: one linked to role analysis, one to his analysis of mental illness. I argue for the latter at the expense of the former. I conclude that Goffman both initiated substantive work about the interaction order and contributed to a synthesis of a theory of the interaction order and a theory of the self.<br>

Abstract: Sociology and neighboring disciplines have produced different analytic tools to examine the dialogical relationship between individuals and society ("narrative work," "identity work," "moral career," "moral breakdown"). However, the question of how individuals negotiate the interpretation of personal experience over their lifetimes in a changing cultural context remains unexplored. This article introduces narrative elasticity as a feature of narrative work and as a time-sensitive analytic tool for conducting inquiries into processes of temporal retraction and expansion of what storytellers conceive as the normal order of significance. The application of this tool to the analysis of mature and elderly Chileans' life stories shows how cultural change occurs at the individual level, considers factors that motivate and inhibit processes of reinterpretation of personal experience, and identifies different levels at which it operates.<br>

whatever an explanation can or cannot do, this always applies: in order that what
has been purely written of in the poem may stand forth a little clearer, the explanatory
speech must break up each time both itself and what it has attempted. The final,
but at the same time most difficult step of every exposition consists in vanishing away
together with its explanations in the face of the existence of the poem" (pp. 234-35)<br>

Author(s): Hodder Ian<br>
Abstract: Archaeological periodization constructs narratives with beginnings, middles and ends. But the material culture on which such narratives are built is also involved in narratives according to which past agents lived their lives. According to Ricoeur, such lived narratives are also related to agents' practical experience of time. As archaeologists we have to 'read' past narratives through the rhetoric by which they were expressed. While Hayden White's scheme for temporal cycles of rhetoric is rejected, the sequence of material culture at Sitagroi is examined in order to explore the relationships between the plots written by archacologists and those lived by past agents at the site. Past and present concepts of time are embedded in different narratives and expressed through different rhetorics, but some interaction between the two is possible.<br>

Abstract: The feminist pedagogical approach introduced here can raise self-awareness about gender inscriptions that people bestow on what they perceive. Gender inscriptions are normative assumptions formed as abstract idealized perceptions of gender (Hayles, 1992). These inscriptions are embedded in society's signs and discourse and appear natural, yet they are often at odds with our lived-experiences. As we expose these "normative" stereotypes we recognize that these constructed perceptions are attitudes that prejudice art as noteworthy or insignificant. Stereotypes of females tend to be aligned with qualities not highly valued in this society and do not match prevalent definitions of art and artists. My goal in presenting this study is to encourage its use as a teaching approach that exposes gender stereotypes and the devaluation of women artists. In this interpretive content analysis, I studied viewer rationales used for inscribing an artist's gender when looking at art in order to render visible gendered cultural inscriptions. Responses suggest that gender inscription impacts how viewers interpret a work, and how men and women diverge in describing similar themes.<br>

Article Title: Reconstructing the Fair Use Doctrine<br>
Publisher: Harvard Law Review Association<br>

Abstract: The fair use doctrine, codified at 17 U. S. C. § 107, permits a court to excuse a putatively infringing use of copyrighted material when the circumstances surrounding the use make it "fair." In this Article, Professor Fisher criticizes the doctrine - and in particular the changes wrought by two recent Supreme Court decisions - and considers how it might be improved. The most serious of the many problems with current fair use jurisprudence, he maintains, is that it rests on considerations derived from four disparate philosophic traditions; this incoherent foundation makes the application of the doctrine unpredictable and aggravates the cacophony of contemporary legal argumentation. To alleviate these problems, Professor Fisher considers two alternative strategies for reconstructing the field. First, he examines fair use from an economic standpoint, arguing that, by comparing the various entitlements that might be accorded copyright owners in terms of the incentives they provide for creativity and the costs they impose on consumers, courts could employ the doctrine to increase efficiency in the use of scarce resources. Second, building on a discussion of the limitations of the economic approach, Professor Fisher deploys a "utopian" analysis of fair use, suggesting how the doctrine might be recast to incorporate particular conceptions of the "good life" and the "good society." So formulated, the fair use doctrine would contribute to the realization of a more just social order and a more integrated legal discourse.<br>

Abstract: Psychodynamically, Augustine's conversion responds to and reconstitutes tensions and relational ambivalences generated by his experiences with the "betraying embrace," principally as he has encountered its symbolic representation in his mother Monica's retentive and rejective tears, in one of her controlling dreams, and in his association with and loss of an unnamed friend. Those experiences crucially affect his own betrayals of secular covenants in his passage to conversion -- covenants with language and rhetoric, with order, and with "lower instincts," among others -- and are themselves transformatively replicated in divine and divinely sanctioned alliances scrupulously structured by his emotional requirements to prevent betrayal: in particular, Augustine's "Romantic" relationship with deific embrace perpetuates in an altered mode the discontent that brought him to seek it.<br>

Author(s): VetterAbstract: Arguments by Utpaladeva and Abhinavagupta for evidence of a Self that is one and the same as the Great Lord Śiva are interpreted. The views of these authors are clarified and the contradictory relationship between the limited individual subject and the recognition of the true Self is shown. With the help of Utpaladeva's distinction between "seeing" and "noticing," a further interpretation is attempted. Some remarks are made concerning practical meditation and the theoretical presuppositions of this way of thinking in order to find starting points for a comparison with Western philosophy.<br>

Publisher: University of Notre Dame<br>
Issue: i261382<br>
Date: 10 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Pangle Fred<br>
Abstract: Recent literature on Heidegger concentrates heavily on his (temporary) involvement in or collusion with Nazi ideology and policies. Without belittling the gravity of the issue, this article shifts the focus somewhat by invoking a distinction which recently has emerged (or reemerged) in political thought: namely, the distinction between "politics" and "the political" or between politics viewed as partisan ideology or policy making, on the one hand, and politics seen as regime or paradigmatic framework, on the other. The main thesis of the article is that Heidegger's promising contributions to political theory are located on the level of ontology or paradigmatic framework rather than that of ideological partisanship. While not neglecting the dismal intrusions of the latter plane, the article probes Heideggerian cues for a "rethinking of the political" by placing the accent on four topical areas: first, the status of the subject or individual as political agent; second, the character of the political community, that is, of the polity or (in modern terms) the "state"; thirdly, the issue of cultural and political development or modernization; and finally, the problem of an emerging cosmopolis or world order beyond the confines of Western culture. In discussing these topics, an effort is made to disentangle Heidegger from possible misinterpretations and to indicate how, in each area, his thought pointed in the direction of an "overcoming" of Western political metaphysics.<br>

Publisher: Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture, Inc.<br>
Issue: i262141<br>
Date: 1 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Tyler Daniel M.<br>
Abstract: This paper proposes a theoretical foundation for extending our understanding of study drawings by bringing forward concepts from a number of disciplines that are concerned with the structure of knowledge. Study drawings are defined as the informal, private drawings that architectural designers use as a medium for graphic thinking in the exploratory stages of their work. Drawings from the work of Paxton through Picasso are analyzed to confirm the familiar characteristics of study drawings and to identify the properties which account for their role in the working process of design, including their use as a means of inquiry. This epistemological function is compared with certain features of written language in order to propose an internal structure for study drawings. The paper concludes that much of the origin and nature of knowledge in design can be explained in terms of the properties and processes of study drawings and that these terms should be used to evaluate proposals for new media in design.<br>

Article Title: Is Zoroastrianism Dualistic or Monotheistic?<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263718<br>
Date: 12 1, 1961<br>
Author(s): Zaehner Donald A.<br>
Abstract: The question raised in the title has been much debated by past and present interpreters of Zoroastrianism. In the first two parts of this paper we present some dualistic and monotheistic interpretations of the religion. The interpretations can be labeled as follows: 1. DUALISTIC INTERPRETATIONS 1. The View That Angra Mainyu Is Primordial But Lacks Omnipotence And Omniscience (Dhalla, Henning) 2. The View That Angra Mainyu Is Primordial But Lacks A Physical Nature (Shaked, Boyce) II. MONOTHEISTIC INTERPRETATIONS 1. The Created Spirits View (Zaehner, Fox, Gershevitch) 2. The Transformationist (Maskhiyya) View 3. The Zurvānite View 4. The View That Good And Evil Are Coeternal Only In A Logical Sense (Moulton, Bode and Nanavutty, Duchesne-Guillemin) We present each of these views and discuss it critically in light of the following criteria: (1) textual evidence; (2) the continuity of the religion throughout its history, including the present time; (3) philosophical cogency; and (4) religious satisfaction. Our conclusion is that each of the above positions, despite its elements of strength, falls seriously short of one or more of these criteria, and hence that there is need for a more adequate interpretation of Zoroastrianism than any of them can offer. Accordingly, we present another interpretation in order to provoke further discussion and, hopefully, to advance the cause of trying to gain a more precise grasp of the teachings of this remarkable religion. In brief, the interpretation we favor is that Zoroastrianism combines cosmogonic dualism and eschatological monotheism in a manner unique to itself among the major religions of the world. This combination results in a religious outlook which cannot be categorized as either straightforward dualism or straightforward monotheism, meaning that the question in the title of this paper poses a false dichotomy. The dichotomy arises, we contend, from a failure to take seriously enough the central role played by time in Zoroast~<br>

Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263711<br>
Date: 3 1, 1974<br>
Author(s): Wilson Mark C.<br>
Abstract: Despite the significant impact of the awareness of perspectival relativism on the religious imagination, recent philosophers and theologians have rarely subjected epistemological relativism to careful scrutiny. This paper attempts to overcome the current theological impasse by a careful exploration of the metaphysical implications of relativism. The central thesis of the essay is that truth is relative because meaning is contextual and being is relational. Contextualized meaning and relational being join to form relative truth disclosed through symbolic awareness. The roots of contemporary relativism lie deep within eighteenth and nineteenth century philosophical movements and are inseparably entangled with the psycho-social pluralization endemic to the process of modernization. The efforts of Neo-orthodoxy, polytheism, and the scientific study of religion to resolve dilemmas posed by epistemological relativism are inadequate. What has gone unnoticed is that the discovery of truth's relativity is the realization of its inherently dialectical character. This insight begins to emerge when it is recognized that meaning is contextual and context is semiophantic. Principles identified in Hegel's logic, in Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of temporality, and in Ricoeur's and Gadamer's hermeneutics disclose that meaning assumes form through dialectical interrelationship in which co-implicates mutually constitute each other. The synchronic and diachronic dimensions of relationality reveal the inexhaustability and perpetual revisability of meaning. The problem of semantics, however, is inseparable from the question of ontology. Ontological reflection leads to the conclusion that being itself is dialectical-fundamentally social or essentially relational. Determinate identity is born of ontological intercourse with otherness. Relations are not external and accidental, but are internal and essential to being itself. Identity and difference, unity and plurality, oneness and manynes~<br>

Date: 12 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Rauschenbusch Walter<br>
Abstract: Walter Rauschenbusch's Christianity and the Social Crisis, viewed by many as the masterpiece of the social gospel movement, has been confined to the dusty shelves of the library. Can we catch no glimpse of what astounded its massive reading public, no glimmer of Rauschenbusch's own sense of the work as a "dangerous book" written in fear and trembling? This article suggests that a generic analysis of Christianity and the Social Crisis might lead to surprising disclosures. Any generic analysis involves the discussion of a group of texts. Consequently this study proceeds via a comparison of the structure of Christianity and the Social Crisis with those of other works of a similar type which were produced between 1890 and 1915. The genre is isolated by utilizing the techniques of Tzvetan Todorov. Certain negative traits are specified which separate the genre from its neighbors. The positive leitmotif of a dual crisis-a crisis affecting society as a whole and the ramifications of that crisis within the Christian churches-is specified as the decisive trait of the genre. To deal with this leitmotif a specific structure was generated by the works under consideration. They provided-to pirate the words of Clifford Geertz in his landmark essay on modern ideologies-"maps of problematic reality" and "matrices for the creation of collective conscience." In designing their maps of problematic reality our authors worked along two separate but related vectors. The first of these vectors was constituted by a historical analysis of the origins of the present crisis, while the second consisted of a systemic analysis of the present social order. Each of these elements of the genre is examined in turn. The mapping of problematic reality by means of a historical and a structural analysis was geared towards provoking as well as defining the crisis. Crisis, once defined, demanded decision. Nevertheless the "permanent basis for action" which Rauschenbusch and others sought could not be groun~<br>

Abstract: Through the provision of a set of theses for the interpretation and evaluation of theologies of liberation, this paper attempts to mediate the existing conflict between academic theologians and theologians of liberation. It seeks to establish the legitimacy of theological discourse focused on the problem of alienation and liberation if carefully executed according to a clear set of guidelines. The paper begins with the argument that all interpretations of theologies of liberation must begin with an analysis of the theological genre within which these works fall. After insisting that theologies of liberation belong neither to the genre of systematic theology nor that of Christian social ethics, the paper develops the second thesis that theologies of liberation are best understood as members of a genre whose distinctive characteristics and functions are analogous to those intrinsic to secular ideologies. This thesis hinges upon a revisionist understanding of ideology drawn from the works of Clifford Geertz et al. and upon a careful specification of the generic similarities between the two forms of discourse. The second part of the paper moves from the level of interpretation to that of evaluation. It argues that theologies of liberation share with ideologies a tendency to occlude self-critical reflection. It suggests that a conscious recognition that theologies of liberation do not exhaust the possibilities of theological discourse but are relative models which select and interpret Christian symbols and doctrines in the light of the central dynamic of alienation and liberation might provide an antidote to this pathology. It maintains with Rosemary Ruether that there is no absolutely adequate model of alienation and liberation and that various models of alienation and liberation must be "interstructured" in order to overcome the perspectival biases of models which focus upon a single root of oppression. To establish relative degrees of adequacy between various theologi~<br>

Augustin may be the most thorough academic study on the Confessiones to date. Courcelle calls
attention to but does not analyze why Augustine dis/articulates silences voluntaires regarding les
personnages non nomms; rather, in order to clarify for historical reasons particular episodes (espe-
cially in the Milanese period) of Augustine's life, Courcelle at least attempts to identify some of
those persons not named (40-43)<br>

Abstract: Concluding his "Confessions," Augustine chose as the work's final word aperietur, "will be" or "shall be opened." The oddity of ending and closing a book on a conjugation of to open provokes reflections into the nature of questioning, reflections that open into a larger investigation concerning how Augustine understood the nature of religious belief and faithful life. For him, faithful life is a project of resisting our always premature attempts at conclusion, in order better to see the project of "inquiry into God" as an infinite undertaking, in community with others, organized centrally around reading and inhabiting the thought world of the Scriptures. The "Confessions" turns out to be a story of Augustine learning to ask questions in the right way and to accept the dynamic of questioning as an energy moving him toward God. Appreciating the "Confessions" as a story of "learning to ask questions" illuminates not only the work's content but also its structure, most notably the odd change of tone and topic from books 1-9 to books 10-13.<br>

Abstract: Anecdotal evidence suggests that many qualitative researchers have had the experience of discovering that their informants had told them lies. This is quite different to those instances where faulty memory, subjective perception, partial or erroneous knowledge, a desire to give the researcher what they think they want, or even where a 'personal myth' comes in to play, because a lie is a conscious and deliberate intention to deceive. What should researchers do when they discover that they have been misled? What are the implications for qualitative methodology and its practitioners in the light of the criteria for good practice outlined in the Tooley Report? This article draws on two examples of informants who lied, in order to explore some of the questions and issues that can arise. It suggests, tentatively, that generic criteria may not always be sufficiently sensitive to cope with complexities of social life.<br>

Abstract: Rather than viewing Freud as a presumptuous Viennese physician who late in life attempted to "apply" some of his provocative psychological speculations to various social phenomena, this essay argues that from first to last, Freud was a social theorist. Indeed, what drew Freud to the study of biology and medicine was precisely the hope of addressing scientifically the most fundamental cultural problems: the nature of man and his culture; the origins of religion, morality, and tradition and the nature of their extraordinary power; the sources of social order and disorder; the direction of contemporary cultural development; and, finally, the problem of how to live in a disenchanted and psychologically impoverished world. Reading Freud in this manner moves his "cultural" texts from the periphery to the center of his work and makes possible an appreciation of the more complex, coherent, and illuminating social theory that lies at its heart.<br>

Abstract: Freud: "The analytic treatment now proceeds to follow [the libido]; it seeks to
track down the libido, to make it accessible to consciousness and, in the end, serviceable
for reality. Where the investigations of analysis come upon the libido withdrawn into
its hiding place, a struggle is bound to break out; all the foreces which have caused the li-
bido to regreess will rise up as 'resistances' against the work of analysis, in order to con-]
serve the new state of things" (1912:12)]

Abstract: Despite his persistent polemics against the Hegelian 'speculative' philosophy, Kierkegaard recognized his own 'enigmatic respect for Hegel', and one of his pseudonyms (Johannes Climacus) even acknowledged that his 'own energies are for the most part consecrated to the service' of speculation. Nowhere are Kierkegaard's energies more productively devoted to this service than in the work of his last pseudonym, Anti-Climacus, "The Sickness Unto Death." In this essay, I argue that not only are there structural parallels between the anatomy of despair in "The Sickness Unto Death" and the analysis of the 'unhappy consciousness' in Hegel's "Phenomenology," but that there are striking parallels in terms of the actual content of the respective accounts. I develop these parallels in order, finally, to reconsider the terrain of difference between Kierkegaard's Christian therapeutics of despair and Hegel's phenomenological therapeutics.<br>

Abstract: Rawls's recent modification of his theory of justice claims that political liberalism is free-standing and "falls under the category of the political. It works entirely within that domain and does not rely on anything outside it." In this article I pursue the metatheoretical goal of obtaining insight into the anthropological assumptions that have remained so far unacknowledged by Rawls and critics alike. My argument is that political liberalism has a dependence on comprehensive liberalism and its conception of a self-serving subjectivity that is far more binding as well as undesirable than it has been so far acknowledged. I proceed with a heuristic approach that introduces us to the possibility that political liberalism presupposes tacitly the Occidental metanarrative of reason harnessing rampant self-interest and subordinating it to a higher-order interest. As the presuppositions of political liberalism emerge, I draw from the debate between Rawls and Habermas in order to illustrate my argument for the existence of a dependence on these presuppositions. I outline some implications of the anthropological basis of political liberalism and conclude by exemplifying them with reference to Rawls's comments on the division of a cake.<br>

Abstract: Town twinning can be seen as the first activity to involve municipal institutions as such in wide-ranging and long-term international action. Twinning fits Eric Hobsbawm's definition of an 'invented tradition'. The French federalists played a decisive part in this process of invention, bringing European municipalities together in order to ensure an eventual European political union. Before long, however, the so-called bilingualist movement also turned to twinning as a way to further a universal mutual understanding that transcended the East-West divide. This resulted in a big clash between the French twinning organisations. Thus, the invention of town twinning needs to be studied alongside the dynamic political tensions that emerged on the French political scene during the Cold War. /// Les jumelages urbains peuvent être considérés comme la première activité à impliquer les institutions municipales en tant que telles dans une action internationale de grande ampleur et de long terme. Le jumelage est un de ces 'traditions inventées' définies par Eric Hobsbawm. Les Fédéralistes français jouèrent un rôle décisif dans cette invention, qui regroupa un nombre important de municipalités européennes dans la perspective de construire l'union politique de la région. Très vite, des mouvements et définitions concurrentes se mirent en place, notamment avec le 'mouvement bilingue' qui s'empara des jumelages pour en faire l'outil d'une compréhension universelle qui aurait transcendé la division Est-Ouest. Une 'guerre des jumelages' fit rage pendant plusieurs années sur la scène française, guerre dont la compréhension appelle à l'inscription de ses enjeux dans le contexte de la Guerre Froide, et dont le déroulement participe de la dynamique de cette période. /// Städtepartnerschaften können als erster Versuch, städtische Institutionen in weiterreichende und dauerhafte internationale Aktivitäten einzubeziehen, gesehen werden.

Abstract: Contemporary social theory has turned increasingly to concepts such as civil society, community, and the public sphere in order to theorize about the construction of vital, democratic, and solidaristic political cultures. The dominant prescriptions for attaining this end invoke the need for institutional and procedural reform, but overlook the autonomous role of culture in shaping and defining the forms of social solidarity. This article proposes a model of solidarity based on the two genres of Romance and Irony, and argues that these narrative forms offer useful vocabularies for organizing public discourse within and between civil society and its constituent communities. Whilst unable to sustain fully-inclusive and solidaristic political cultures on their own, in combination the genres of Romance and Irony allow for solidaristic forms built around tolerance, reflexivity, and intersubjectivity.<br>

Abstract: Concordo sulla modernizzazione acritica di Euripide corne poeta scettico e sulla serie-
tà sostanziale della religiosità delle tragedie; mi sembra invece azzardata l'idea che queste
tragedie avessero la funzione di "rassicurare" il pubblico sull'esistenza di un "ordine e di
un piano" divino per quanto imperscrutabili. Afferma S.I. "The most terrifying thing is a
world that has no meaning, no order, and no plan. Euripidean tragedies show that the world
does have order and meaning, and works on a plan of Zeus" (p. 410). È assai probabile che
gli ultimi venti anni del quinto secolo abbiano rappresentato un periodo di instabilità di
valori e di crisi, tuttavia l'idea di un mondo "senza significato, ordine e finalità" mi sembra
molto moderna, se non post-moderna, e assai difficilmente significante nell'Atene di fine
quinto secolo. Più pertinente è invece l'accento sull'importanza di praticare il culto per
mantenere il rapporto di benevolenza tra uomini e dèi (ibidem).<br>

Abstract: This paper focuses on gendered processes of socialization experienced by Christian religious groups in different Christian churches in post-civil war Gorongosa, a district in the centre of Mozambique. Discourses of radical social transformation through Christian interventions and experiences are prominent among Christians, both men and women. Yet a comprehensive and longitudinal analysis of the social world in which the Christian groups are embedded and the performances of Christian men and women demonstrates the emergence of complex processes of transformation and continuities with local cultural beliefs and practices that many non-Christians have partially or thoroughly reformed or abandoned. These changes and continuities also encompass the manifestation of fluid forms of submission and creativity, and masculinities and femininities against the ideological notion of thoroughly new and closed Christian identities. The overall analysis suggests that the tension between the practices of change and continuity are necessary in order to create and sustain the legitimacy of the various Christian groups in Gorongosa.<br>

Abstract: The basic matrix of concepts of the modern mind was largely formed during the English, French and German Enlightenments, as they built upon the legacy of Descartes. After asking why a new philosophic outlook was needed, the paper turns to its wide acceptance as differently manifested in the three divergent Enlightenments. From Hobbes to Kant, we see the root of the ideas that form the contemporary mind. Distinguishing these from each other, as well as the movements within the French Enlightenment, the paper concludes noting the good and bad that emerged. It calls for a fidelity to the western intellectual tradition which, uniquely, produced the kind of free social order that makes reconciliation of divergent cultural values possible.<br>

Abstract: Unquestionable as history may seem, there are all the same quite different readings and disparate inferences despite the same series of facts. This goes to show that even professional historians can sometimes be overcome by meditations on past possibilities of bifurcations. As to "alternatives to actual history," is serves well to bear in mind that few are plausible, but that belief in a predeterminative universe of necessities would certainly be misplaced. Whereas some occurrences are clear-cut enough to make us understand which components would have had to be changed in order to get a different outcome, others are of such a high degree of complexity that attempts to imagine an alternative course and divergent results remain rather illusory: the examples of Midway (the former type) and the defeat of France in 1940 (intricately overdetermined) clearly show that it pays in any case, in defiance to all complexities, to consider past potential. It is prerequisite for choosing between future options in more reasonable and efficient ways than hitherto.<br>

Author(s): Chenavier Robert<br>
Abstract: Au cours d'une période qui voit Husserl livrer son testament philosophique, la Krisis, l'étudiante Simone Weil ouvre son Diplôme d'études supérieures, en 1930, par le constat du désarroi dans lequel se trouve l'époque et de l'incertitude dans laquelle nous laisse la science. Il faut opérer un retour à Descartes, dans une automéditation proche de celle que recommandait Husserl. Cependant Simone Weil ne s'oriente pas vers une phénoménologie. Loin d'explorer la sphère d'être du cogito, elle cherche à en sortir, plus rapidement encore que Descartes, pour rencontrer la réalité du monde, et inventer une sagesse pour notre condition d'être percevant, ce qui signifie, avant tout, d'être qui travaille. Seul le travail permet d'éprouver la nécessité réelle, et de retrouver « l'union de l'âme et du monde », dans les conditions créées par l'industrie. C'est dans la ligne de la vocation mondaine de la philosophie de Descartes, que Simone Weil amorce sa réflexion sur le rôle du travail comme fondement d'une sagesse, dans ces nouvelles conditions d'existence déterminées par la forme collective de la production. À partir de 1935, elle verra dans la crise un signe de la « faillite de Descartes ». During the period that Husserl was declaring his philosophical testament, Die Krisis, Simone Weil was a student starting her Diplôme d'études supérieures in 1930, mindful of the utter confusion of the times and of the atmosphere of uncertainty generated by science. One must return to Descartes, in a self-meditation similar to the one recommended by Husserl. But Simone Weil did not move toward a phenomenology. Far from exploring the sphere of being through the cogito principle, she sought to escape from that sphere, even more rapidly than did Descartes, in order to confront the reality of the world and to invent a wisdom for the condition of a conscious being, which means, above all, a being who works. Only work makes it possible to experience real necessity and to reestablish « the union of~<br>

Abstract: Across cultures, narrative emerges early in communicative development and is a fundamental means of making sense of experience. Narrative and self are inseparable in that narrative is simultaneously born out of experience and gives shape to experience. Narrative activity provides tellers with an opportunity to impose order on otherwise disconnected events, and to create continuity between past, present, and imagined worlds. Narrative also interfaces self and society, constituting a crucial resource for socializing emotions, attitudes, and identities, developing interpersonal relationships, and constituting membership in a community. Through various genres and modes; through discourse, grammar, lexicon, and prosody; and through the dynamics of collaborative authorship, narratives bring multiple, partial selves to life.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i211059<br>
Date: 11 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Kane Anne E.<br>
Abstract: Though the process of meaning construction is widely recognized to be a crucial factor in the mobilization, unfolding, and outcomes of social movements, the conditions and mechanisms that allow meaning construction and cultural transformation are often misconceptualized and/or underanalyzed. Following a "tool kit" perspective on culture, dominant social movement theory locates meaning only as it is embodied in concrete social practices. Meaning construction from this perspective is a matter of manipulating static symbols and meaning to achieve goals. I argue instead that meaning is located in the structure of culture, and that the condition and mechanism of meaning construction and transformation are, respectively, the metaphoric nature of symbolic systems, and individual and collective interpretation of those systems in the face of concrete events. This theory is demonstrated by analyzing, through textual analysis, meaning construction during the Irish Land War, 1879-1882, showing how diverse social groups constructed new and emergent symbolic meanings and how transformed collective understandings contributed to specific, yet unpredictable, political action and movement outcomes. The theoretical model and empirical case demonstrates that social movement analysis must examine the metaphoric logic of symbolic systems and the interpretive process by which people construct meaning in order to fully explain the role of culture in social movements, the agency of movement participants, and the contingency of the course and outcomes of social movements.<br>

Abstract: The first part of the article discusses the usefulness of the biographical method in order to solve some epistemological crucial issues: the integration between comprehension and explanation, the possibility of an objective (or at least intersubjective) knowledge, the overcoming of the micro-macro dicothomy. The second part holds the utility of such a method in order to study the reflexive post-modern society and especially the contribution intellectuals can offer to the post-modern culture. Results from recent empirical research are discussed. The last part-though recognizing some methodological problems linked with life stories — stresses flexibility and openess as the main virtues of this method.<br>

Abstract: I argue that the aporetic character of clemency must be understood in terms of its unmerited and merited character to achieve the underlying purposes of justice within criminal justice: justice as fairness (punishment must be deserved and proportionate) and justice as restoration (repair of the harm to victims and society and the reintegration of offenders) are paramount goals. Rather than destabilizing political order, pardons can render productive potential tensions between justice as fairness and justice as restoration. Taking as my conceptual point of departure Paul Ricoeur's claims about the suprajuridical and supraethical character of pardon, I develop the argument through three central sections: an excursus into historical and contemporary practices of clemency in the United States; a critical analysis of the merited and unmerited aspects of clemency with respect to remorse and atonement theories within theological and legal discourse; and a normative engagement with pardons and felony disenfranchisement.<br>

Abstract: What role do emotions play in the way in which young people confront the history of the Holocaust? This article examines memorial sites and video interviews of survivors as interfaces of the representation and appropriation of the past. These contact zones satisfy the need for emotional participation and for information. Videos uploaded by youngsters on the internet following their visit to memorial sites, and short films extracted by pupils from survivor's video interviews, were used as examples in order to examine emotional strategies. These products of involvement point to stored images and ideas mediated by mass media. This repertoire of cultural knowledge and feelings can serve as a template for understanding how young people process the Holocaust emotionally.<br>

Date: 1 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Scott Bede<br>
Abstract: This article explores the crisis initiated by colonial modernity in Naguib Mahfouz's 1947 novel Midaq Alley. I begin by discussing the significance of anger within the narrative, arguing that this dominant structure of feeling could be read as a collective response to wider social and historical forces. In other words, rather than understanding emotion as the "subjective property" of the individual, I regard it here as a relational practice embedded within and determined by quite specific sociocultural circumstances. I then proceed to discuss the role of rumour in the novel and the significance of its pronounced melodramatic qualities. In the first case, I shall argue, the circulation of rumour provides a way of containing or quarantining the negative feelings produced by modernity, while also reinforcing the boundaries of a community facing the very real possibility of its own demise. In the second case, I would like to suggest that the narrative's tendency to privilege the melodramatic mode creates a sense of social order and moral intelligibility by channelling these feelings into a stable and predictable generic structure. This latter project is ultimately frustrated, however, when the forces of evil emerge to destroy the novel's principle representative of virtue.<br>

Abstract: This essay analyzes the contemporary culture of memory in Buenos Aires. The development of this culture since the democratic transition — and since Nestor Kirchner's turn in government in particular — is investigated. Data come from field-work research during the period of Cristina Kirchner's election victory in 2007. The official explanation of the duty to remember in order to re-establish the nation's democratic basis is shown through an analysis of Buenos Aires's urban landscape, and the building of such places of memory as the Museum of Memory and the Park of Memory, coinciding respectively with Nestor Kirchner's first election, and with Cristina Kirchner's election. The analysis of contemporary collective sensibility about the past dictatorship introduces an interview with a Madre de Plaza de Mayo, suggesting the task of watching over memory, and of coping with its current multiple interpretations.<br>

Author(s): Youniss James<br>
Abstract: This paper offers a discussion of contemporary theories of moral development. At present, these theories are at odds regarding the origins of morality. One camp has proposed a cognitive basis, while the other claims that morality consists in affectivity. Both these positions are discussed, and a third alternative is proposed for their resolution, based upon the model of the subject within communicative relations, whose life involves constructing reality through social procedures with others. This model is described and contrasted with the model of the self-reflecting individual which seems to underlie most current theories. In addition, a number of studies are reviewed in order to show more clearly how this third alternative provides insight into the social basis of moral judgment. Throughout the paper, two themes remain central: (a) that rationality can be considered to result from consensual validation which is obtained through communication; and (b) that sense of community, the grounds for moral action, is not incompatible with establishing or maintaining one's own individual identity.<br>

Abstract: A theory of the moral subject of cooperative relations proceeds from a different point of departure than a formalistic ethics based on individualism and rationalism. Shweder (Merrill-Palmer Quarterly, 1982, 28, 41–69) fails to see that, in this theory, persons communicate in order to co-construct knowledge and to maintain and promote mutual respect. Moral principles are, thus, cooperatively generated because validity is grounded in the structure of reciprocal relations.<br>

Abstract: En Grèce classique, les premières formes d'historiographies dépendent d'une volonté mémorielle: garder en mémoire et publier les actions des hommes, dans le passé récent. Mais ces formes visent aussi à donner un sens à ces actions: ordre de la justice humaine et territoriale chez Hérodote; anthropologie de la domination chez Thucydide. Dans ce « façonnement » discursif de l'histoire, la rhétorique de la vue joue un rôle essentiel. Occasion de s'interroger sur les modes d'une « fiction » qui, au sens étymologique du terme, « fabrique » et par conséquent « fictionnalise » le factuel; occasion d'envisager le rôle du vraisemblable dans des constructions narratives partagées entre cohérence interne et référence externe. De là l'oxymore de « fiction référentielle ». In Classical Greece, the first forms of historiography sprung from a preoccupation with memory: to memorialize and publicize the actions of men in the recent past. They also aimed to make sense of those actions: order of human and territorial justice for Herodotus, anthropology of domination for Thucydides. In this discursive "shaping" of History, rhetoric played an essential role. Opportunity to muse about modalities of "fiction", which, etymologically, "makes" hence "fictionalize" facts; opportunity also to think about the importance of verisimilitude in the narrative constructions torn between internal coherence and external references. Hence the oxymoron of "referential fiction".<br>

Abstract: Social scientific explanations of the role of European law associations in the making of a new European legal order argue that they were critical in empowering the European Court of Justice and defining the results of European legal integration. However, these approaches fail to highlight the complex context in which these associations evolved. By exploring the history of the French Association des juristes européens from 1951 to 1970 on the basis of comprehensive archival material, this paper provides a more contextualised understanding of what appears as a struggle with limited impact on the French reception of European law. La recherche en sciences sociales sur le rôle d'associations nationales de juristes et de leur fédération dans l'élaboration d'un nouvel ordre juridique européen soutient qu'elles contribuèrent fortement à l'essor d'un droit spécifiquement européen. Néanmoins, cette recherche échoue à mettre en évidence la complexité du contexte dans lequel ces associations se sont développées. Fondé sur une documentation d'archives très complètes sur les premières années d'existence de l'Association française des juristes européens, cet article permet de mieux saisir les difficultés d'une lutte à l'effet limité sur la réception en France d'un droit fondamentalement européen entre 1951 et 1970. Sozialwissenschaftliche Erklärungen zur Rolle europäischer juristischer Vereinigungen beim Aufbau einer neuen europäischen Rechtsordnung argumentieren, dass sie beim Ermächtigen des Europäischen Gerichtshofs und Definieren der Ergebnisse der europäischen Rechtsintegration entscheidend gewesen seien. Doch diese Ansätze beleuchten nicht die komplexen Umstände, unter denen sich diese Vereinigungen entwickelt haben. Diese Studie untersucht die Geschichte der französischen Association des juristes européens von 1951 bis 1970 auf der Grundlage umfassender Archivunterlagen und vermittelt dadurch ein kontextualisierteres Verständnis dessen, was als Kampf mit begrenzten Auswirku~<br>

Abstract: Jaspers' thesis (while rejecting the claim of philosophers of the Western tradition to universal validity and Truth, yet conceding that their metaphysical systems express an awareness of Being) is as follows: "Reality is neither the object nor the subject, but that which encompasses both, the Encompassing which is illuminated in the division between subject and object"; He — the One God — is Encompassing and the greatest closeness which has its place within the inwardness of man". The whole inquiry leads Jaspers to claim that the existential self is rooted in Transcendence and the ground of all things lies in the real ization of the existential self in freedom in which eternity and time coalesce. In this freedom time — far from being the "moving image of eternity" — becomes the actual scene of the existential self's moral striving with the forces of this world, and by seizing the cipher (= the language of Transcendence) as the symbol of Transcendence, the existential self achieves authentic existence, thus endowing the historical process of time with unique and ultimate meaning. 1) Reason: It is because of reason with which God has endowed man that any content of a pretended revelation possesses any self-evidencing power: "In diesem Menschwerden durch Vernunft wird das Eine der Transzendenz fühlbar dem Einen der jeweils geschichtlichen Existenz". Yet by abandoning belief in universal Truth we become open for Truth, realised and determined in its concrete historic form for each individual by means of communication. Communication therefore becomes "the universal condition of man's being". It follows that Truth cannot be separated from communicability. It only appears in time as a realitythrough-communication so much so "that I can not even become myself alone without emerging out of my being with others". Now the element in which existential communication lives and moves and has its spiritual being is — reason ("reason is what penetrates everything"). 2) Unity of Mank~<br>

Publisher: Giannini Editore<br>

Author(s): Wolfe Charles T.<br>
Abstract: The category "organism" has an ambiguous status: is it scientific or is it philosophical? Or, if one looks at it from within the relatively recent field or sub-field of philosophy of biology, is it a central, or at least legitimate category therein, or should it be dispensed with? In any case, it has long served as a kind of scientific bolstering for a philosophical train of argument which seeks to refute the mechanistic or reductionist trend, which has been perceived as dominant since the 17th century, whether in the case of Stahlian animism, Leibnizian monadology, the neo-vitalism of Hans Driesch, or, lastly, of the "phenomenology of organic life" in the 20th century, with authors such as Kurt Goldstein, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Georges Canguilhem. In this paper I try to reconstruct some of the main interpretive stages or layers of the concept of organism in order to evaluate it critically. How might organism be a useful concept if one rules out the excesses of organismic biology and metaphysics? Varieties of instrumentalism and what I call the projective concept of organism are appealing, but perhaps ultimately unsatisfying.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur has initiated a new direction in the field of hermeneutics by applying the phenomenological method to the interpretation of texts. By this he has effected a transition from description to hermeneutic phenomenology. In order to explicate his position the paper deals with this transformation: In developing hermeneutics Ricoeur tends to eliminate Husserl's transcendental idealism, to retain some central phenomenological motifs, and to add new elements. These elements were eclectically picked up by him from analytic and linguistic philosophy and from the current linguistic and structural theories. Since the deepest and most genuine roots of Ricoeur's thought lie in the phenomenology of Husserl, the paper concentrates on the explication of his phenomenological presuppositions and attempts to show how they were reformulated within the new science of interpretation. Thus, the first part of the paper is mainly an exposition of the transition from phenomenology to hermeneutics. The second part points to some difficulties inherent in such a move. The paper ends with a discussion of the problem of "the hermeneutic circle", which is an immanent part of hermeneutics.<br>

Abstract: This article considers the function of the mashal (parable) in Rabbinic literature and the connection between the use to which the mashal is put in that literature and the literary form it takes. Following a consideration of the contexts, narrative and exegetical, in which the mashal appears in midrashic and talmudic literature, three disctinct models for the form are proposed: (1) As a didactic tool, whose form is exoteric and relies largely on figurative language that illustrates the ideas the parable teaches. (2) As an instrument of sectarian doctrine, often esoteric in its form, and one which closely resembles allegory and seeks to disguise its message if not to hide it. (3) As a homiletical device with the form of an allusive tale told for an ulterior purpose, in order to persuade its audience of a certain inexplicit message. The article suggests that the mashal in Rabbinic literature generally falls into the third category, and that the messages it seeks to persuade are mainly on the order of praise or blame (or a subtype of praise or blame, like apologetics, polemics, eulogy, or complaint). Examples of meshalim for several of these categories are briefly discussed. The article concludes with a detailed analysis of the meshal found in Lamentations Rabba 3, 21. This is a praise-mashal whose narrative also suggests a certain kind of blame and, in effect, allows the mashal to be read in two ways. On the basis of this analysis, it is suggested that the rhetorical richness of the mashal derives in part from the tension between the mashal's function and its narrative complexity, and that the popularity of the form was a result of the fact that the use of narrative in the mashal allowed the Rabbis to express certain feelings and attitudes that other, more prosaic, midrashic literary forms could not convey.<br>

Abstract: Cet article s'intéresse au conflit foncier à la Martinique. Il propose l'étude d'une grande propriété — « Providence » — ayant fait l'objet d'une occupation des terres de plus de vingt ans par des agriculteurs voulant ainsi faire valoir leurs droits à la terre. À travers ce conflit, on voit se préciser l'importance de l'espace en tant que porteur d'un langage capable de véhiculer la mémoire collective et de donner forme à l'identité. L'espace prolonge les termes du conflit originel entre maîtres et esclaves au travers d'une codification cadastrée toujours dotée d'efficacité, comme il sert de transmetteur de pratiques d'opposition et de résistance à un tel ordre incarné, devenant ainsi l'une des ressources fondamentales de la continuité identitaire du groupe des petits agriculteurs. This article focuses on the land property conflict in Martinique. The case study is "Providence", a large property that has been occupied for twenty years by a group of farmers who claim their rights to the land. In hee we can see how space is of crucial importance in providing the collective memory with words loaded with significations and contributing to the construction of identity. The memory of the old masters-slave conflict is embodied in space through an ever efficient social and racial codification. Space is also a tool to transmit a set of practises of resistance to this physical order and, in this way, becomes a fundamental resource to construct the collective identity of the group of small farmers<br>

Issue: i23548425<br>
Date: 1 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): BLOOMQUIST L. GREGORY<br>
Abstract: In this article I suggest ways in which rhetorical analysis can complement sociological analysis of early Christianity. On the basis of a universally acknowledged saying of Jesus ("blessed are you poor"), I suggest that those who use social scientific perspectives need to clarify more accurately the levels of data from which they are working (i.e., when they are working with probably early material, possibly the words of Jesus himself, and when they are working with the later elaboration of the traditional material) and to identify the rhetorical value of each level. I then show how, contrary to sociological analysis that depicts Jesus as merely proclaiming reversal, the historical Jesus proclaimed a reversal that had already happened but one that was away from God's intended order: what the historical Jesus was calling for was a future restoration to a state that existed before the reversal. Attention to the rhetorical nature of his follower's use of this proclamation, however, shows that when the author of the Gospel of Luke and the Lukan Acts of the Apostles uses the language of reversal and restoration, he now does so to describe what was happening not primarily vis-à-vis "the world" but in their own, now Christian communities Jesus' message of reversal of the fate of the poor becomes in this way the Lukan message of the apostolic governance of that reversal, that is, the broker's (the apostolic leadership's, after the model of Jesus) dispensation of the patron's (God's) resources.<br>

Author(s): DANIELS JOHN<br>
Abstract: In this article, an attempt is made to relate the "intuitive" classical phenomenology of Gerardus van der Leeuw and the neo-phenomenology of Jacques Waardenburg. An outline of van der Leeuw's methodology is presented along with a summary of Waardenburg's critique. An account is then given of Waardenburg's alternative approach. When the two methodologies are juxtaposed, two points of convergence emerge. The first relates to the nonempirical nature of meanings; the second relates to the need to reconstitute the believer's world in order to gain understanding of phenomena. Discussion suggests that both methodologies entail the combined use of Erklären ['explanation'] and Verstehen ['understanding'] in explicating meanings. The conclusion is ventured that neo-phenomenology can be plausibly viewed as a modification of van der Leeuw's approach which is distinguished by greater hermeneutical sensitivity.<br>

Abstract: This article summarizes the claims of Owen Flanagan that psychology can make important criticisms of and viable contributions to both religious and philosophical ethics. Flanagan insists that both fields of ethics should pass the test of what he calls the Principle of Minimal Psychological Realism (PMPR). However, in order for Flanagan to escape naïve naturalism, his PMPR test should be used within a hermeneutic philosophy such as that of Paul Ricoeur. Ricoeur's concepts of "diagnosis" and "distanciation" can help the moral theologian find a limited but important role for PMPR.<br>

Abstract: Biblical texts make demands which the reader cannot refrain from answering. In giving an answer, the reader should dare to say more than the text has already said and to take responsibility for this. This biblical demand forces us to understand by ourselves and does not offer the possibility of referring to something that is already understood. To understand a biblical text, one must therefore take the risk of misunderstanding. In view of this precarious freedom, the author shows that hermeneutical research is necessary in order to avoid accidents in understanding. We first see a text, then we read it and finally understand it by creating a "text world". Thus we can misunderstand a text if we don't see or read it correctly or if we miss the essence of the text. Any research on misunderstanding texts would have to deal with the relationship between the reader's own understanding and that which is not the reader's own. Understanding is not only what we understand, nor is it only understanding that which is foreign to us in a text, it is always both.<br>

Abstract: À ceux qui ont pu s'étonner de l'estimation globalement positive de la phrénologie par Auguste Comte, les historiens et les philosophes des sciences ont pu opposer des arguments épistémologiques et méthodologiques convaincants, qui permettent de rendre raison de l'engouement comtien pour une entreprise souvent considérée aujourd'hui comme irrémédiablement pseudo-scientifique. Pourtant, il existe d'autres motivations, de nature politique ou — comme Comte le dirait lui-même — sociologique, qui nous paraissent pouvoir expliquer cet engouement mais qui n'ont pas jusqu'ici reçu la même attention. En effet, la « physiologie phrénologique » fournit à l'édifice comtien la base d'une authentique « théorie de la nature humaine » à partir de laquelle penser l'organisation ou la réorganisation des sociétés occidentales. Ce rôle crucial dévolu à la phrénologie n'est quant à lui que l'illustration d'une spécificité encore plus générale du système comtien, à savoir le rapport privilégié, dans l'ordre de la connaissance, qui unit sociologie et biologie. Or, pour bien saisir toute la difficulté du problème du rapport biologie/sociologie chez Comte, il est éclairant de considérer la manière dont il s'articule dans le cas précis de la question de l'égalité des sexes. Ce que nous aimerions mettre en évidence, en nous appuyant plus particulièrement sur la correspondance de Comte et John Stuart Mill lue à la lumière du Cours de philosophie positive, c'est la manière dont la biologie, et en particulier la phrénologie, œuvre de manière souterraine au cœur même de l'argument sociologique de Comte en faveur de l'assujettissement des femmes et les conséquences potentielles de cette « contamination » biologique. To those who have been puzzled by the globally positive assessment Auguste Comte made of phrenology, historians and philosophers of science have responded by offering convincing epistemological and methodological arguments, which enable one to suggest a rationale for his interest in wh~<br>

Abstract: Pour comprendre la genèse du spinozisme, nous avons misé sur la personnalité libertine cachée du maître en latinité de Spinoza, van den Enden dont Meinsma a fait l'élève du philosophe, occultant ainsi l'importance historique du cercle de v. d. Enden au profit de celui de Spinoza. L'étude du combat politique de v. d. Enden et des libertins français contre Louis XIV nous a révélé les œuvres politiques anonymes du maître de Spinoza : Vrye Politijke Stellingen (t. I : 1665, extraits manuscrits des t. 2 et 3), puis Kort Verhael Van Nieuw Nederlants (1662). Nous redécouvrions par suite le Philedonius (1657). Nous avons établi la filiation directe entre ces œuvres et celles de Spinoza dans leur tentative de donner une traduction profane de la tradition hermético-alchimique. In order to understand the genesis of spinozism, we have relied on the free-thinking and secret personality of Spinoza's master in latinity, v. d. Enden whom Meinsma made his philosophers' disciple, thus concealing the historical importance of v. d. Enden's circle for the benefit of Spinoza's. The study of the political struggle waged by v. d. Enden and by French freethinkers against Louis XIV showed us the anonymous political works of Spinoza's master : Vrye Politijke Stellingen (pt. 1, 1665; mss extracts pts 2 and 3); then Korte Verhael Van Nieuw Nederlants (1662). Thus we rediscovered the Philedonius (1657). We have shown a direct line between these works and those of Spinoza in their attempt to give a lay translation of the secret Alchemical and Hermetic tradition.<br>

Abstract: Tolerance is a concept fundamental to the order of a pluralistic society. The concept, however, contains within it various dimensions and is therefore subject to misunderstanding (I). This article will first examine the ways in which tolerance as a social behavioural virtue differs from the duty of neutrality required of the public authorities (II). Furthermore, it will discuss whether and to what extend the public authorities are authorised to educate society in tolerance (III). Finally, a distinction will be drawn between the expectation of tolerance and the more far-reaching principle of recognition (IV).<br>

Article Title: Professional Ethics in Social Work—What Future?<br>
Publisher: OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS<br>
Issue: i23714806<br>
Date: 4 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): BANKS SARAH<br>
Abstract: This paper examines the ethical implications of recent changes in social work, particularly in relation to the conception of social workers as professionals guided by a code of ethics. These changes include the fragmentation of the occupation, the increasing proceduralization of the work and the growing focus on consumer rights and user participation. Some people have argued that codes of ethics are becoming increasingly irrelevant in this climate, in that they assume a unified occupational group and are based upon professionals' definition of values without consultation with service users. On the other hand, it has also been maintained that it is ever more important to retain and strengthen codes of ethics in order to maintain professional identity and to defend the work of the profession from outside attack. This paper explores the relevance of a code of professional ethics for social work, focusing particularly on the British Association of Social Workers' code, in the context of the changing organization and practice of the work. It considers two alternative approaches: the 'new consumerism' which focuses on the worker's technical skills (rather than professional ethics) and consumer rights (as opposed to professional obligations); and a 'new radicalism' which stresses the worker's own personal or political commitment and individual moral responsibility (as opposed to an externally imposed code of professional ethics). It is concluded that the changes in social work do threaten the notion of a single set of professional ethics articulated in a code, and that, in some types of work, this model is less appropriate. However, there is still mileage in retaining and developing a code of ethics, not as an imposed set of rules developed by the professional association, but as part of a dynamic and evolving ethical tradition in social work and as a stimulus for debate and reflection on changing and contradictory values.<br>

Abstract: The theoretical premise of this essay is that metaphors are not simply decorative figures of speech; they have instead played a decisive role in the formation of scientific theory. My specific intention is to show how the metaphors of the "machine", the "body" and the "invisible hand", in diverse ways, provided models with which to represent a social and economic order which was the unintended outcome of human actions. Moreover, reciprocal comparison reveals the limitations on their use, and the reasons why the "invisible hand" was more successful than the other two metaphors in conveying the concept of the competitive market.<br>

Abstract: Quentin Skinner's methodological project contains a fundamental imprecision that is rarely mentioned by the secondary literature: the assumption, present in several of his methodological texts, that a theory designed for the analysis of oral communication (speech act theory) can be unreservedly used for interpreting text. In this article I will use some of Paul Ricoeur's phenomenological insights on the difference between textual and oral communication in order to advance a systematic critique of Skinner's project and to suggest new methodological possibilities for the history of political thought and related disciplines. This procedure will also allow me to organize some of the criticism raised against Skinner's Collingwoodean approach since its inception.<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i23880984<br>
Date: 12 1, 2002<br>
Author(s): ANTHIAS FLOYA<br>
Abstract: This article argues that the concept of 'identity' is of limited heuristic value and proposes that it may instead be more useful to deploy the notion of narratives of location and positionality for addressing the range of issues normally thought to be about collective identity. Location and positionality (and translocational positionality) are more useful concepts for investigating processes and outcomes of collective identification — that is, the claims and attributions that individuals make about their position in the social order of things, their views of where and to what they belong (and to what they do not belong) as well as an understanding of the broader social relations that constitute and are constituted in this process. This enables a complete abandonment of the residual elements of essentialization retained even within the idea of fragmented and multiple identities so favoured by critics of unitary notions of identity. The article will draw on research into the ways in which experiences of 'race' and ethnicity were articulated in the narrations produced by British-born youngsters of Greek Cypriot background.<br>

Author(s): SCOTT-BAUMANN ALISON<br>
Abstract: In order to manage our daily lives, we make many decisions based on empirical evidence derived from instrumental action. At the other extreme, we are often attracted by a so-called postmodern solution that invites us to make arbitrary choices. In the education system, the pressing dilemma should not be a choice between standards of competence or unthinking relativism, but how to take action towards intercultural tolerance. Establishing a small teacher training course for a group of British Muslims has shown that communicative action informed by understanding can be disabled by the instrumentality of positivist frameworks, such as those used by government inspectors. In philosophy, Ricoeur offers a provisional dialectic of hope that can be used to show why neither positivist methods, rational analytic philosophy, postmodernity nor any one belief system for interpreting the world should be allowed to exert hegemonic control. The ethicopractical philosophy of Ricoeur also offers a reconstructive view of reality that helps us to rehabilitate belief in human nature and encourages us to seek solutions to conflicts of interpretation in understanding others. It is applied, in this instance, to project work with Muslim women in the UK, in which an ontology of action shows the power of working collaboratively towards an understanding of oneself as another.<br>

Abstract: This article discusses the theoretical and methodological debates concerning the experience and consequences of upward social mobility between generations. The methods employed by researchers working on this subject are diverse, and the results they arrive at are sometimes contradictory. This article proposes, firstly, to give an overview of the different traditions of studying the experience of social mobility in order to identify the conditions for potential "cumulative" knowledge. In a second step, we argue that it is mainly through a study of the narratives of mobility that one can, simultaneously and comprehensively, grasp the ambivalence and multiplicity of effects that produce upward social mobility. Cet article revient sur les débats théoriques et méthodologiques sur l'expérience et les conséquences de la mobilité sociale ascendante intergénérationnelle. Les méthodes mobilisées par les chercheurs travaillant sur ce sujet sont multiples, et les résultats auxquels ils parviennent parfois contradictoires. Cet article se propose donc, dans un premier temps, de donner une vue d'ensemble des différentes traditions d'étude de l'expérience de la mobilité sociale afin de cerner les conditions d'une potentielle «cumulativité» des savoirs qu'elles produisent. Dans un second temps, nous défendons l'idée que c'est principalement à travers une étude du discours des personnes en mobilité que l'on peut, dans un même temps et dans un même élan, saisir l'ambivalence et la multiplicité des effets que produit la mobilité sociale ascendante.<br>

Author(s): Kwon Soo-Young<br>
Abstract: The current methods in psychoanalytic studies of God images and representations have focused almost exclusively on individual, internal processes. This article examines how psychological anthropologists go about formulating symbolic representations of deity in their research, in comparison with the object relations method of God-representations. Drawing on Melford Spiro's integrative proposal for interpreting the mental and collective representations in religious symbol systems, this paper proposes that there is a need for a comprehensive model of the representational process in the Eastern world in order to suit its cultural traditions. The author uses both theoretical and historical materials as well as personal narrative throughout its entirety to balance the two in a mutual and coherent flow of understanding. Noting the culturally patterned interactions with culturally postulated God-symbols, the object relations method of God-representations will be utilized to probe how God is both created and found on a collective (cultural) level as well as individual level.<br>

Issue: i23917895<br>
Date: 9 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Mills Kevin<br>
Abstract: This paper sets out to question contemporary notions of language which employ metaphors of imprisonment or confinement to describe the alleged failure of the word to connect with the world. Valentine Cunningham's recent book. In the Reading Gaol, is confronted with Helen Keller's experience of being excluded from language (as described in her autobiography), in order to argue that the issue of hermeneutic freedom needs to be rethought. This involves raising certain doubts about freedom—doubts identified by means of a consideration of the cases of New Testament prisoners: Peter, John, Paul and Silas. I conclude that freedom, confronted by doubt (evident in ascetical gestures) is produced by a hermeneutics of hope. Hope, constituted by its own rivenness, both allows and limits the effects of hermeneutical suspicion. The imprisoning effect ascribed to language can then be seen as a failure with regard to hope.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23917895<br>
Date: 9 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Ward Bruce K.<br>
Abstract: The contemporary philosopher, Paul Ricoeur, has characterized the dominant trend in modern interpretative thought as the 'school of suspicion', whose most significant 'masters' are Freud and Nietzsche. For them, to seek meaning—whether in a text, dream, discourse, or institution—is, first and foremost, to suspect 'truth as lying'. It is my contention that Ricoeur could well have named Dostoevsky as a third master of this modern school of interpretation, for he, too, was preoccupied with exploring the possibility of 'truth as lying', whether to others or to oneself. The general concern of my essay is to clarify Dostoevsky's relation to the modern 'hermeneutics of suspicion' in a manner which is mutually illuminating. The particular focus is on Dostoevsky's hermeneutics of suspicion as employed in The Brothers Karamazov, especially with the object of deciphering the avowed 'love of humanity' which motivates Ivan Karamazov's famous 'rebellion' against God. Ivan's humanism is highly ambiguous, as his words and actions (of omission and commission) throughout the novel demonstrate. I attempt to show that the ambiguity of Ivan Karamazov can be illumined as an exercise of suspicion on Dostoevsky's part which distinguishes between the manifest sources of Ivan's moral stance and what is in reality its hidden basis. And, in order to situate Dostoevsky in relation to the modern 'school of suspicion', his interpretation of the ambiguous text of modern humanism is compared with that of Nietzsche. The dialogue which the essay sets up between Nietzsche and Dostoevsky on the problem embodied by Ivan Karamazov reveals areas of convergence and divergence: the former apparent in a shared suspicion of a secular humanism which affirms the love of humanity apart from religious faith; and the latter apparent in their different understandings of love—whether of humanity or of God. The comparison between Dostoevsky and Nietzsche, then, highlights the distinction between a hermeneutics of sus~<br>

Author(s): Wallace Cynthia R.<br>
Abstract: Religious echoes are resonant with race and gender in Beloved, raising questions best posed in a psychoanalytic register. Freud's sceptical questioning of religion is important for a consideration of the gendered, raced, and specifically religious subjectivities explored in the novel, as is Lacan's paradigm of entry into the symbolic order. Reading the religious in Beloved in light of both Freud and Lacan, and reading the poetically evocative Word in all three, I locate within the novel a profound ambivalence, an awareness of the limitations of language under the Name of the Father and the necessity—even potential good—of imagining within its system.<br>

Abstract: Miroslav Volf has provocatively argued that redemption necessitates forgetting (1996, 2006). Yet, Volf's claims insufficiently consider the narratival configuration of memory. This essay utilises Paul Ricoeur's work on mimesis in order to challenge Volf's case for forgetting. The author advances Ricoeur's philosophical description of forgiveness toward a theological account of divine forgiveness as re-narration, gift-giving funded by trinitarian abundance.<br>

Abstract: Bourdieu fut le fondateur d'un paradigme structuraliste aujourd'hui appliqué à l'envi par certains sociologues et radicalement évincé par d'autres. Nous nous intéresserons ici aux tentatives intermédiaires de Lahire et Corcuff qui, sans omettre de pointer des impasses, ont bien vu l'intérêt du concept d'habitus « singulier ». Après avoir repris leurs approches, nous proposerons une définition « fictionnelle » de cet habitus afin de rendre ce paradigme opérationnel sur des terrains pour lesquels sa capacité heuristique est faible (comme les nouveaux mouvements sociaux). Bourdieu was the founder of a structuralist paradigm which is now often applied by some sociologists and strongly criticised by others. We are interested here in the intermediate attempts made by Lahire and Corcuff. Without omitting to notice some dead ends, they understood the interest of the "singular" habitus concept. After following their approach, we propose a "fictional" definition of this habitus in order to make this paradigm operational in areas where its heuristic capacity is low (like the new social movements). Bourdieu war der Begründer eines strukturalistischen Paradigmas, das heutzutage häufig von einigen Soziologen angewandt, von anderen vehement kritisiert wird. Wir hinterfragen Arbeiten von Lahire und Corcuff, die trotz mancher Sackgassen das Interesse des singularen Habitus gut erfasst haben. Nach einer ersten Analyse geben wir eine fiktionale Definition dieses Habitus, um ihn auf Gebiete anwenden zu können, bei denen sich seine heuristische Kapazität als zu gering erweist (z.B. die neuen Streikbewegungen).<br>

Abstract: This article inquires as to the meaning of nervoso (nerves) among poor, working-class women from Salvador, Brazil. Our aim is to understand nerves as an experience that emerges from the background of a life trajectory and that, in many significant ways, disrupts the taken-for-granted character of that trajectory. From a phenomenological-hermeneutical tradition, we explore the links between experience, embodiment and temporality and then discuss the relevance of this approach for the understanding of women′s nervoso. In order to do so we present the life histories of three middle-aged women who have been afflicted with nerves. The accounts describe significant ways in which culturally inherited possibilities – grounded in a lived context of class and gender – are recovered and come to pre-figure a certain future. As we argue throughout the article, it is only when we situate the experience of nervoso within the temporal frame of life that we can truly understand it – that is, grasp it as part of a movement that involves both recovery and creation of meaning.<br>

Author(s): Bell Allan<br>
Abstract: This article questions the aptness of 'discourse analysis' as a label for our field, and prefers the less reductionist concept of 'Discourse Interpretation'. It does this through drawing on ideas from the field of philosophical hermeneutics – the theory and practice of interpreting texts. It operationalizes and adapts the construct of the Interpretive Arc from the philosophy of Paul Ricoeur in order to address issues that are central to discourse work, including that of how we warrant the validity of our textual interpretations. The Interpretive Arc consists of six interlinked phases, which the article presents and exemplifies through discussion of a single text – the story of Babel. Phase I of the arc defines readers as being in a state of Estrangement before the text because of the distancing created by its written or technological form. Phase 2 is that of Pre-view, the state of opinion or knowledge that readers bring to a text. At phase 3, a first reading forms readers' Proto-understanding, their initial 'guess' at what the text means. Then processes of Analysis (phase 4) test and evidence the validity of alternative readings, limiting the interpretations which can plausibly be taken from a text. Three byways of interpretive analysis are challenged and discarded: the dominance of author intention, structuralist analysis and limitless polysemy. Analysis then leads into 5, the phase of informed Understanding of the matter or injunction of the text, of what is disclosed or unfolded before the text. The Interpretive Arc is completed in phase 6, Ownership. Here, through processes of critique of their own and the text's ideologies and of fresh listening, readers are led to a new self formed by the matter of the text. There is a dialectic amongst Analysis, Understanding and Ownership, with each informing and modifying the other. The approach emphasizes interpretation as the heart of discourse work. The 3000-year-old narrative of Babel is a subject as well as an object h~<br>

Article Title: Text as action, action as text? Ricoeur, λογοσ and the affirmative search for meaning in the 'universe of discourse'<br>
Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24049943<br>
Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Scott-Baumann Alison<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur placed a great deal of importance upon text and the interpretation of text. Bell accepts this by virtue of his extended analysis of the story of Babel, and I hope to offer ways of extending and developing Bell's arguments to incorporate the ethical demands that Ricoeur placed upon text, upon our interpretation of text and upon action as a form of readable text. This will not include a commentary on discourse analysis, which I am not qualified to give. Ricoeur differed from the structuralist tradition in that he saw the relationship between language and life as taking a dialectical form: debate that presumes the possibility of altering one's position by grappling with different views, and often taking inspiration from Hegelian dialectics, with their contrasting polarized views and the eventual attempt at affirmative common ground. The term λογοσ (logos) was first used in a philosophical way by Heraclitus to give us the principle of order and knowledge, and yet for Heraclitus the world was dominated by conflict and change. Ricoeur studied this tension within logos between order and disorder, partly by his writing about language and his work on signs and symbols, partly through metaphor and narrative and also through his insights on translation. For him, all these are facets of the need for both Explaining and Understanding as forms of interpretation of language, ethics and action. Ricoeur's work on logos provides us with an approach that asks whether ethics controls language or vice versa or both and how this fits in with structuralism and later movements. For Ricoeur, signs (words, texts) are not the centres of our perceptual experience. At the heart of our perception are our motivations and our actions, for which we must take responsibility in a sort of provisional affirmation that we will keep trying. In so doing we must doubt (be suspicious of) our own motives just as much as those of others, and see action as a form of readable text.<br>

Abstract: The article deals with the problem of revelation in Levinas' writings. The first part of the article analizes Levinas' ideas on the Same and the Other, more particularly the topics of the face and of discourse, as these come to the fore in the first section of Totality and Infinity. Investigating the non-totalising relationship between the Same and the Other presents us with the suitable framework for understanding the relation between the finite and the Infinite. Leaving out any ontotheological speech, Levinas shows how Metaphysics is enacted in the ethical relation. The second part cootinues with a description of Levinas' position on revelation in the Jewish tradition. The active Interpretation of Biblical texts "beyond the verse" represents an opportunity of hearing the divine word today and to enter into a more primordial Order than the Order of the Same. In the course of the article, we point to affinities and striking similarities between E. Levinas' and F. Rosenzweig's view on revelation. We also demonstrate how Levinas Orients his Jewish writings to his philosophy of the Other and vice versa. In writing on revelation, Levinas' main concern seems to be the description of the possibility of a fracture in the immanent order of totality and in the self-sufficiency of reason which is its correlative. This fraction is produced by the command "thou shalt not kill", calling the Same to open itself to the Other.<br>

Abstract: Der Politischen Theologie kann man sich auf drei Arten nähern, wobei sich diese hermeneutischen Zugänge nach ihrem jeweiligen Verhältnis von Politikwissenschaft und Theologie unterscheiden lassen: ein erster Zugang betont die substantielle Beziehung zwischen den beiden Disziplinen und ihrem jeweiligen Gehalt; ein zweiter Zugang unterstreicht die begriffsgeschichtliche Abkunft der Politikwissenschaft von der Theologie; und ein dritter Zugang legt Wert auf das rhetorische Moment innerhalb der Politischen Theologie. Während die ersten beiden Ansätze in der Vergangenheit in großem Maße Aufmerksamkeit auf sich gezogen haben, wurde das rhetorische Moment nur selten Gegenstand eingehender Untersuchungen. Der vorliegende Aufsatz betont dagegen die rhetorische Dimension der Politischen Theologie und verweist auf deren häufige Versuche, mittels metaphorischer Bezüge auf »Theologie« im politischen und wissenschaftlichen Streit zu obsiegen. There are three hermeneutical approaches to Political Theology, each of which points towards a distinct relationship between Political Science and Theology: the first approach stresses the substantial links between the two disciplines and their respective contents; the second approach emphasises the dimension of conceptual history, claiming that concepts of Political Science have their roots within Theology; the third approach points towards the rhetorical moment within Political Theology. While the first two approaches have been the object of considerable research in the past, the third has been rather neglected. This article highlights the rhetorical dimension of Political Theology. It points to numerous attempts in which »Theology« has been used metaphorically in order to bolster arguments within political and scholarly debates.<br>

Abstract: It is the purpose of this paper to present a reassessment of the works of the first nineteenth century French Utopian Socialists. It is well known that their contributions have been highly criticised, from both the economic and social point of view and the political or ethical one. Recent commentators, mostly historians and philosophers, have, however, underlined the realistic ambition and the reformist spirit of those approaches. This paper aims to develop this perspective. Indeed, it is my intention to defend the idea that the realism of utopia can be even better characterised by economists: the analyses of Leroux, Enfantin, Chevalier, Buchez or Considérant can be interpreted in terms of development. We study more specifically the initial flowering between 1830 and 1835 of the writings of the Saint-Simonians (Enfantin, Chevalier, Pereire), the works of the dissidents (Buchez, Leroux) and those of the main supporters of Fourier (Considerant, Transon, Lechevalier). We will conduct our survey proceeding from the notion of 'vision' proposed recently by Robert Heilbroner. We then examine whether these socialist pioneers really worked in order to elaborate a 'vision' in terms of 'development'.<br>

Abstract: Before any significant attempt is made to read Negro-African history, the first task is to conquer its field of research. The critical works of Frobenius, Westermann and Bauman, Delafosse, Homburger, Murdock, Leakey and Cheikh Anta Diop provide us with appropriate means of investigation (which still require to be refined) in order to obtain a profound, inner knowledge of the Negro-African social tradition. Prehistory must become a major science in the teaching profession — especially in Africa — because it offers man a general outline of the first consequences of his past before the appearance of writing. No Africanist or African historian can allow himself to by-pass this branch of study. The same applies to Egyptology and to African linguistics, sociology and ethnology. Diop has used the last three sciences to retrace the migrations of African peoples, to establish their cultural unity and to rediscover the continuity of Negro-African history. The study of African, Greco-Roman, Arab and European documents (whether oral or written, archaeological, linguistic or sociological) gives us information concerning the appearance of homo faber in Africa about 5,500,000 years ago, the Egypto-Nubian civilizations, the African Neolithic worlds, pre-colonial Africa, the Arab invasions, the slave-trade, colonization and the present-day national liberation struggles and the formation of new States. The African cultural world has its roots in the Tertiary Period and it is beyond doubt that the biological substratum of humanity is Negro or Negroïd (C.A. Diop and the discovery of Asselar Man by the Augiéras-Draper Saharan expedition in December 1927), that Negroes were in Europe during the Upper Paleolithic and Neolithic periods and helped in the formation of today's Europoïd races. The author uses the social structures of the Pharaonic Ancient Empire (2778 - 2423 B. C.) as models to describe the history of Negro-African societies in their ensemble and contrasts the former with thos~<br>

Abstract: Genocide is a political catastrophe. Yet it has not received much academic attention. A few social scientists have studied it. Philosophers have largely ignored it. There is a large literature on the Holocaust, but there is little agreement as to how this should be related to other genocides. Some have argued that the Holocaust represented a crisis of Western culture, but that Western culture has not responded adequately for the lack of the appropriate self-understanding. This crisis has been attributed to the predominance of scientistic models of rationality in our culture. Social-scientific approaches to genocide have been criticised because of their commitment to logical empiricism, which is held to be epistemologically and ethically inadequate. Ethical approaches based on liberal humanism have been criticised by post-Nietzschean philosophers for their attachment to allegedly outworn metaphysical assumptions. However, the deconstruction of social science and liberal ethics leads in the direction of relativism and nihilism, which are either useless or dangerous in the face of evils such as genocide. The arguments against conventional social science and ethics are examined, and a counter-critique made of post-modern philosophy in order to clear the ground for constructive thinking about genocide.<br>

Date: 1 1, 2000<br>
Author(s): ATKINS KIM<br>
Abstract: In his famous paper, What Is It Like To Be A Bat?, Thomas Nagel argues against a reductive physicalist account of consciousness by highlighting what he calls "the subjective character of experience". In this paper I will argue that Nagel's insight is important for understanding the value placed on patient autonomy in medical ethics. Appreciation of the subjective character of experience brings with it the necessity for an epistemological humility with respect to the lives of others and what can be said to be "right" for them. Appreciation of the subjective character of experience lies at the heart of empathy and our capacity to make decisions that genuinely reflect respect for the patient's autonomy. Through the example of a case involving extreme medical intervention, I identify some impediments to the proper recognition of autonomy. These kind of cases highlight the significance of affective responses with respect to the subjective character of experience, and, by extension, to our capacity to imagine and act in accordance with another's perspective. I argue that affective responses are appropriate and needed considerations in the case where one must attempt to assume another's perspective in order to respect autonomy. I conclude that understanding that experience has an irreducibly subjective character is essential to respecting patient autonomy.<br>

Abstract: The article refers to the hermeneutic methods of psychoanalysis. It scrutinizes Freud's strategy in transforming traditional myths of the devil into a theory of evil which reveals the dark side of the human soul. Relating to Freud's epistemic construction of metapsychology, it is argued that his hermeneutic system fashions its specific principles of causality, which are stipulated by the theory of libido, in order to reinterpretate the mythology of the devil as a relic left by the unconscious. Freud's argumentation, exemplified in his studies on religious superstition, demonstrates the interconnection between mythology and the unconscious. As the devil figures dirt and darkness, he represents distressing thoughts which are repressed and rejected by consciousness. The article is completed by a view on C. G. Jung's theory of the archetypes, which considers the evil as part of the preconscious thoughts beyond individual experience. Thus the fundamental difference between Freud's metapsychology and Jung's archetypes is reflected in the interpretation of the devil as a figure, retaining the dark energies concentrated in the human soul.<br>

Abstract: The concept Deckerinnerung (en. screen-memory), which appeared in Freud's work in 1899, points towards the important epistemological question about the possibility of adequation or coincidence (Deckung) between past experience and the current act that is being presentified. This can take the form of remembering as such or be conceived as fantasy. In order to clarify the differences between fantasy and memory, or rather their interconnection in the Deckerinnerung, they need to be looked at phenomenologically, and in doing so various aspects should be analysed, such as: the character of positional and neutralised acts of presentification; the interference of conscious attention and the phenomenon of inhibition in the act of presentification; the state of memories in the unconscious and the possibilities of their association between themselves or modification by other current acts. While Freud introduces the subject without further analysing it, Husserl's theories offer a valuable contribution here. In this context, there is first a need to outline the way in which Husserl's investigations into memory come close to Freud's discourse, in the sense that they lead to a "Phenomenology of the Unconscious" (Hua XI; Mat. VIII).<br>

Abstract: In ethics, when discussing problems of justice and a just social existence one question arises obviously: What is the normal case of the relation between I and you we start from? In moral philosophy, each position includes basic socio–anthropological convictions in that we understand the other, for example, primarily as competitor in the fight for essential resources or as a partner in communication. Thus, it is not the human being as isolated individual, or as specimen of the human species or socialised member of a historical society what needs to be understood. Instead, the individual in its relation to the other or others has been studied in phenomenology and the philosophy of dialogue of the twentieth century. In the following essay I focus on Martin Buber's and Jean–Paul Sartre's theories of intersubjectivity which I use in order to explore the meaning of recognition and disrespect for an individual. They offer a valuable contribution to questions of practical philosophy and the socio–philosophical diagnosis of our time.<br>

Abstract: Im Laufe der „nationalen Sattelzeit“ (Ute Planert) wurden Nationskonzepte zunehmend naturalisiert. Die Literaturgeschichte spielt dabei eine wesentliche Rolle. In drei Schritten verfolgt der Aufsatz den Transformationsprozess des nationalen Denkens im Kontext des sich wandelnden Naturbegriffs: Zum einen wird die nationale Wettkampfrhetorik im sog. deutsch-schweizerischen Literaturstreit skizziert, um demgegenüber die vormerklich funktionale Bedeutung des Nationalen und Nationalcharakteristischen in den Poetiken Gottscheds, Bodmers, Breitingers und Schlegels gewahr zu werden. Ein Blick auf die ‚Nationalidyllen‘ der aufgeklärten Hermannsdichtung zeigt, wie Natur und Nation trotz eines rationalen Naturbegriffs und in den Grenzen aufgeklärter Poetik als Einheit dargestellt wurden und so das Bildreservoir für spätere Generationen entstand. Die Wendung zu einem organologisch-dynamischen Naturdenken um die Mitte des 18. Jahrhunderts ermöglichte eine weit intensivere und scheinbar substantialisierte Verbindung von Natur und Nation, die sich schließlich auch in den Gärten und Parkanlagen der höfischen Gesellschaft niederzuschlagen begann. In the course of „nationale Sattelzeit“ (Ute Planert) concepts of nation were increasingly naturalized – a development in which the history of literature plays an important role. This essay traces the process of transformation of national thinking in the context of the changing concept of nature in three steps: Firstly, it sketches the national rhetoric of competition of the so-called German-Swiss controversy, in order to highlight the mainly functional meaning of the national and the nationally characteristic in the poetics of Gottsched, Bodmer, Breitinger and Schlegel. Secondly, a closer examination of the national idylls of enlighted Hermann literature shows how – despite a rational concept of nature and within the limits of enlighted poetics – nation and nature were depicted as a unity and created a common reservoir of images for later ~<br>

Abstract: In 1925 Heidegger stated that categorical intuition was one of the three major discoveries of Husserlian phenomenology. He also claimed that categorical intuition should be interpreted in a temporal way in order to open up a path for promising research on categories. Even though Heidegger never explicitly developed this temporal interpretation of categorical intuition, this essay shows how he did this implicitly. The first part locates his first approach to this problem in the concept of world-time. The second part sees Heidegger's second approach in his concept of Temporalität. Finally the third part develops the thesis that after the subjectivism of the first and the formalism of the second approach, Heidegger developed a metaphysical notion of time as a basis for promising hermeneutic-phenomenological research on categories.<br>

Abstract: This paper analyzes the different types of narrative self-reference employed in the autobiographical works of Felicitas Hoppe and Péter Esterházy. It argues that these texts illustrate and reflect an anthropological condition which can be described as ›eccentric positionality‹, a term coined by Helmuth Plessner, or ›constitutive homelessness‹. Self-narrating is both the expression of and compensation for that condition. According to Paul Ricœur it can be seen as an attempt to understand what is essentially indefinable: the individual self. Narrative configurations place different events, actions and perceptions in a (mostly) coherent order. By doing so, they configure the individual self as a being that changes in time. The novels by Hoppe and Esterházy display and simulate different modes of self-narrating between historicization and fictionalization, namely self-discovery (Selbstfindung), self-invention (Selbsterfindung), and self-determination (Selbstbestimmung). As these modes are confronted with different types of problems, they reflect the complex relationship of a person to herself as both the narrator and the protagonist of her life story.<br>

Abstract: In a will of 1335, Piero Morosini bequeathed to each of his daughters 1,000 lire ad grossos
(roughly 385 ducats) for her dowry and corredo, 'secundum usum nobilium dominarum de Veneciis'
('as is customary for noble women in Venice'); ASV, Notarile, 'Testamenti', Busta 1154, Bruto, no.
32. In a civil action of 1382, the Giudici del Procurator ordered that the estate of Federico Corner
should add to his dowry allocation to his daughters 'quid deffecerit congruentie' ('what it lacks to
make it suitable') in order to carry out Federico's testamentary provision that the daughters receive
'quelo che besogna per maridarle' ('what is necessary for their marriages'); ASV, Giudici del Pro-
curator, 'Sentenze a Legge', Reg. 2, fol. 114". In 1385 Nicolô Morosini ordered in his will that if his
descendants should lack the means of providing dowries for their daughters, then his bequest to them
in immovables might be sold to 'maridarle segondo la condicion soa' ('arrange marriages appropriate
to their status'); Notarile, 'Testamenti', Busta 679, Bellancini, prot., fol. 26v. In his will of 1416
Giovanni Morosini instructed his brothers to add enough from his estate to their father's bequest of
1,400 ducats for the marriage of their sister 'ut ipsa cum honore et prout congruit conditionem
domus mee honorificentius maritetur' ('in order that she may marry as honorably as possible and in a
manner befitting the status of my house'); ibid. Busta 1234, Sorio, no. 509.
Fathers also specified that they wanted their daughters to marry noble husbands; Andrea Ari-
mondo in 1427 declared that each of his daughters was to be married 'in uno zentilomo de Veniesia'
('to a Venetian gentleman') (ASV, Cancelleria Inferiore, 'Miscellanea Testamenti', Notai Diversi,
Busta 27, no. 2697); that same year Michele Navagero instructed his executors that his daughter 'se
debia maridar in zentil homo' ('should marry a gentleman') (ASV, Notarile, 'Testamenti', Busta

Abstract: Os atentados de 11 de setembro originaram diversas manifestações artísticas buscando não apenas explicações para a tragédia, mas também tentando repensar os acontecimentos. Neste sentido, este trabalho apresenta uma investigação a respeito da maneira como um romance se apropriou desse episódio para reavaliá-lo. Com os ataques, os Estados Unidos experimentaram uma forte sensação de vulnerabilidade, desencadeando reações do governo americano, que formulou com bastante rapidez uma nova doutrina de segurança nacional, baseada no combate ao terrorismo. Este artigo analisa as estratégias narrativas utilizadas pelo autor americano Don DeLillo (2007a) no romance Falling Man, para reexaminar a tragédia. Textos teóricos e críticos sobre a relação entre Literatura e História, ficção Pós-Moderna e terrorismo fundamentam as discussões aqui apresentadas. Este estudo objetiva ampliar os questionamentos acerca dos fatos que levaram à catástrofe e suas consequências, examinando personagens e grupos ligados ao 11 de setembro, revelando múltiplas verdades, condicionadas social, ideológica e historicamente. September 11 has originated a wide range of artistic manifestations which have not only searched for plausible explanations for the tragedy, but also tried to review the events. In this sense, this paper aims at showing how a novel reevaluates this episode. The attacks made the United States experience a strong sense of vulnerability, triggering reactions from the American government, whose quick action was translated into a new national security strategy, associated with the war on terror. This paper analyzes the narrative strategies employed by the American author Don DeLillo in his novel Falling Man (2007) in order to reevaluate that tragedy. The debate of the topics is based on texts concerning the relationship between literature and history, postmodern fiction and issues on terrorism. This study contributes to enrich the discussion related to the events that led to the catastro~<br>

Issue: i24439308<br>

Author(s): ESS CHARLES<br>
Abstract: I expand the metaphor of computing as philosophical laboratory by exploring philosophical insights gleaned from examining computer-mediated communication (CMC) technologies in terms of the cultural values and communicative preferences they embed, as well as their interactions with the values and preferences that define diverse cultures in which the technologies are deployed. These empirically grounded data provide new insights for debates in philosophy of technology, notions of the self, and epistemology. This approach to utilizing data drawn from the cultural encounters facilitated by CMC technologies further suggests more ambitious ways of making philosophical use of CMC venues as a laboratory for testing and refining basic claims and hypotheses. The approach also uncovers other grounds that should encourage philosophers to become interdisciplinarians – not only for the sake of perhaps developing new sorts of insights and even forms of knowledge but also in order to shape and contribute to a global ethic and a Socratic education needed to sustain cultural diversity as CMC envelops the globe.<br>

Author(s): STEELE MEILI<br>
Abstract: Although Ricoeur and Taylor are often grouped together, their conceptions of language, literature, and practical reason are very different. The first half of this essay focuses on Ricoeur's theory of triple mimesis and narrative, showing how his attempt to synthesize Kant, Husserl, and structuralism results in a formalism that blocks out the ontological, hermeneutical, and historical dimensions of literature and practical reason. The second half of the essay develops Taylor's ontological conception of public imagination and illustrates the dynamics of this conception of language and interpretation by showing how literary works debate with each other over language, subjectivity, and reference. Narrative does not just order; it argues.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing<br>
Issue: i24441733<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): VIDAL CLÉMENT<br>
Abstract: Philosophy lacks criteria to evaluate its philosophical theories. To fill this gap, this essay introduces nine criteria to compare worldviews, classified in three broad categories: objective criteria (objective consistency, scientificity, scope), subjective criteria (subjective consistency, personal utility, emotionality), and intersubjective criteria (intersubjective consistency, collective utility, narrativity). The essay first defines what a worldview is and exposes the heuristic used in the quest for criteria. After describing each criterion individually, it shows what happens when each of them is violated. From the criteria, it derives assessment tests to compare and improve different worldviews. These include the is-ought, ought-act, and is-act first-order tests; the critical and dialectical second-order tests; the mixed-questions and first-second-order third-order tests; and the we-I, we-it, and it-I tests. The essay then applies these criteria and tests to a concrete example, comparing the Flying Spaghetti Monster deity with Intelligent Design. For another application, it draws more general fruitful suggestions for the dialogue between science and religion.<br>

Publisher: Wiley Periodicals, Inc.<br>
Issue: i24542986<br>
Date: 10 1, 2013<br>
Author(s): Grethlein Jonas<br>
Abstract: This book examines Greek engagements with the past as articulations of memory formulated against the contingency of chance associated with temporality. Based on a phenomenological understanding of temporality, it identifies four memorializing strategies: continuity (tradition), regularity (exemplarity), development, and acceptance of chance. This framework serves in pursuing a twofold aim: to reconstruct the literary field of memory in fifth-century BCE Greece; and to interpret Greek historiography as a memorializing mode. The key contention advanced by this approach is that acts of memory entailed an "idea of history" that was articulated not only in historiography, but also in epinician poetry, elegy, tragedy, and oratory. The book offers a rich account of poetic conventions and contexts through which each of these genres counterbalanced contingency through the use of exemplary and traditional modes of memory. This fine analysis highlights the grip of the present on the past as a significant feature of both historiographical and nonhistoriographical genres. The essay argues that this work fills a disciplinary gap by extending the reflection on memory to a new period, Greek antiquity. The retrospective positioning of this period at the outset of Western historical thought brings Grethlein's investigation to the center of debates about memory, temporality, and the meaning history. In engaging with the book's argument, the essay suggests that historiographical memory emerged in Greece not as a first-order encounter with time, but as a second-order encounter with forgetting. This confrontation marked a certain separation of historiography from other memorializing genres. Whereas poetic and rhetorical memories were posited against contingency, historiography sought to retrieve those aspects of the past that may otherwise have been irretrievably lost and forgotten. In doing so, it formulated the historiographical imperative as a negation of forgetting that problematized~<br>

Abstract: In Romania, the fall of the Communist regime and the loss of referents that followed have inspired a revival in a "tradition of the nation" whose foundation was laid during the 19th century, associating a representation of identity based on ethnicity with a unitary and centralized conception of the state. The sudden opening up to the outside world, pressures from an internationalized economy and Western institutions – specifically, NATO and the European Union, which Romania hopes to join – have led some to modify this tradition, while others have attempted to render it an absolute in order to better resist what are deemed destabilizing changes. These two tendencies can be identified in the way in which Romanians represent their pre-Communist and Communist past, as well as their manner of apprehending the tension between unity and plurality (ethnic, regional) at the heart of the nation-state.<br>

Abstract: Dealing with North Korea is perhaps one of the most difficult challenges in global politics today. Totalitarian and reclusive, ideologically isolated and economically ruined, it is the inherent 'other' in a globalised and neo-liberal world order. The respective approaches are correspondingly divided: a confrontational approach relies on the projection of military threats and aims to undermine the authoritarian regime as fast as possible, leading to a quick disintegration and subsequent absorption. The second approach favours engaging North Korea in political, economic and cultural interactions. The essay outlines why engagement is more suited to diffusing tension on the peninsula and avoid a war. But it also draws attention to key issues that remain largely unaddressed: how exactly people divided by the traumatic memory of conflict and death might coexist in a respectful and non-violent manner, or whether or not forgiveness is necessary to promote reconciliation.<br>

Dicha estrategia se enmarca en una investigación cualitativa que permite reconstruir teóricamente un objeto en permanente dinamismo y obtener una comprensión holística de las situaciones sociales; propone para su desarrollo la utilización de un enfoque etnográfico, en tanto la etnografía es una modalidad de investigación que favorece la comprensión de los procesos sociales. This article seeks to present a methodological approach to the study of gated communities in order to focus on the perspective of the actors involved, taking into account the social representations and perceptions those supports. This strategy is part of a qualitative research project that enables one to theoretically reconstruct an object in constant dynamism and obtain a holistic understanding of social situations. To this end, it proposes using an ethnographic approach, since ethnography is a form of research that promotes the understanding of social processes.<br>

Abstract: The debate between metaphor theorists and conceptual historians has been intensifying in recent years. This article takes this debate beyond the bias toward Blumenberg's metaphorology, and starts from the interaction view of metaphor as formulated by Max Black. The article opens with a theoretical framework that reformulates Black's notions of metaphorical resonance and emphasis. It adapts them to the requirements of Conceptual History, and adds a third, historical criterion for metaphoricity. It then applies these suggestions to the history of the metaphor play/game/Spiel/jeu within twentieth-century political thought. Here, the focus lies on the role this metaphor plays in the conceptual relations between the ideas of political order, conflict, and immanence.<br>

Abstract: Ibid., p. 327: "As soon as a 'school' insulates itself from thinkers of another view,
exclusivism overshadows the difference in position and an inner stifling which introduces a
petty bourgeois mentality into the philosophical discussion becomes inevitable. Such a
mentality leaves no room for reciprocal respect and for the awareness that each in his own
way is working on a tremendous communal task.
Sectarian exclusivism betrays itself, on the one hand, in its inability to use immanent
criteria for criticizing philosophy of a different orientation and, on the other hand, in the
incapacity to enrich or enlarge one's own thinking by themes on which those have reflected
which do not belong to one's school...
One does no longer understand that every philosophical critique must have a dialectical
[elsewhere (Philosophia Reformata 6(1941), p. 20) Dooyeweerd speaks of 'dialogical'] nature in
order to be fruitful... that is to say, the nature of discussing the problem in such a way that
the critique on the other is, at the same time, a critique on oneself...
The philosophical community of thought ought not to be abandoned even between schools
which radically oppose each other in starting points."<br>

that creation possesses an ultimate ground of all order in the Word of the Creator God. See

perament, after having become obsolete at the end of the fifties and after decades of absence
in the scientific literatnre on personality and personality development, has re-emerged some
15 years ago and has begnn a second life.<br>

Abstract: 'Emergence' is meant in the sense that in the course of evolution structures sponta-
neously developed that, compared to existing structures, are conceptually or ontically of a
qualitatively different order. Within the continuity of the evolution process, then, something
new emerges. Stafleu is no evolutionist in the sense that evolution theory is his worldview; he
does adhere to the theory of evolution. As he sees it, systematic reformational philosophy has
concerned itself far too little with the issue of evolution. Stafleu holds that evolution is often
mistakenly taken to mean that the emergence of new structures, biotic structures for example,
can be explained via the laws for existing structures, in other words, by physical-chemical laws.
Approached in this way, the irreducibility of the modal aspects is at issue (the classical
objection from the side of reformational philosophy). The problem however dissolves entirely
as long as law and that which is subjected to it are not mixed. The laws for new structures are
not themselves a product of evolution; they become operational once the situation is ready for
them.<br>

Abstract: On a souvent décrit la modernité en la rapportant à l'idée de sécularisation du politique : à la faveur de la « grande séparation » hobbesienne, le pouvoir serait devenu un lieu vide, dissocié de toute attache à la transcendance, privé même de tout contenu substantiel. Cette étude entend rappeler que la philosophie politique contemporaine ne s'est nullement accommodée de ce processus de déthéologisation : au cours des dernières décennies, son propre a bien été, en s'appuyant sur le constat des « déraillements » de la modernité, de vouloir reconstituer une forme de lien entre le politique et le religieux. Cette intention partagée s'est incarnée dans trois grandes architectures de sens. La première tient dans le paradigme du recouvrement : il s'agit ici, tout en adhérant le plus souvent aux institutions démo-libérales, de replacer le droit politique sous dépendance de la norme religieuse. La deuxième position s'agence, quant à elle, autour du paradigme de la substitution : on saisit le politique alors comme un objet d'investissement religieux. La troisième figure relève du paradigme de la délibération : attachée au principe d'indétermination démocratique, à distance donc de toute primauté du spirituel comme de toute religion du politique, elle se construit, quant à elle, autour du dessein d'articuler, dans l'espace de la discussion civique, les convictions séculières et les croyances religieuses. Dans son ordre propre, la philosophie politique confirme l'hypothèse de l'inscription de nos sociétés dans une forme de post-sécularité. Modernity has been often described via the idea of a secularization of the Political: by way of the hobsian "great separation", power would have become an empty space, dissociated from all attachment to transcendence, deprived even of all substantial content. This study whishes to remind that contemporary Political Philosophy hasn't accommodated with this process of de-theologization: along the last decades, what characterized it has been, f~<br>

Abstract: This article presents the results of empirical research regarding Siberian regional identity with a particular focus on regional identity formation and transformation. Based on biographical interviews with residents of three Siberian cities, it analyzes the processes of regional identity formation in a "resettlement" society and identity (re)construction under conditions of social crisis. In order to capture the individual dimension of such (trans)formation in a resettlement society the authors introduce and use a methodology combining the so-called "actionist" version of the social constructionist approach to identity studies and narrative analysis. The final section of this article offers a detailed analysis of the life stories of three Soviet-generation women, demonstrating different scenarios of regional identity transformation on the level of the individual. The results suggest that the effect of dramatic social change on personal identity depends upon the core identity of an individual. Those whose identity was rooted in the Soviet privileging of Siberian economic development face the hardest challenge. Those who have multiculturalism or such values as work or family at the core of their identities handle the crisis more easily, and the consequences of social transformation for their identities are less severe.<br>

Abstract: The Schumann's sonata form (or sonata form-like) compositions little can be explained from the standpoint of tradition. Instead of classical dramatic contrasts, thematic action develops towards a definite goal. This type of musical narration often lasts to the end of the coda, in other cases the constant evolution of a thematic thought or the continual transformation of a motif receives the leading role. In order to obscure the essential events of the works or of the movements Schumann often employs "traditional" formal gestures. One of the most interesting is the repetition of a longer section in different keys, reminding of the exposition-recapitulation duality. The déjà vu feeling was generally one of the starting-point in Schumann's workshop to move away from traditional sonata procedures. Influenced by the narrative content of the works, various strategies were elaborated by him to excite the déjà vu, or to relive musical moments.<br>

Article Title: Rediscovering Collingwood's Spiritual History (In and Out of Context)<br>
Publisher: Wesleyan University<br>
Issue: i342984<br>
Date: 2 1, 1957<br>
Author(s): Jaspers David<br>
Abstract: Collingwood has often been depicted as a neglected and isolated thinker whose original ideas on the contextual nature of truth (in both history and philosophy) anticipated important trends in postwar thought. The spiritual aspects of his thought, however, have often been problematic, precisely because they seem to conflict with his more influential ideas. Although Collingwood's overtly theological and metaphysical writing can be safely confined to an early, perhaps even juvenile phase of his career, the spiritual dimension of some of his later work, including, for example, the famous doctrine of reenactment, has often been marginalized, repressed, or domesticated in order to preserve Collingwood's historical place in twentieth-century philosophy of history. This radical conflict continues to disrupt both the reception of Collingwood's ideas and attempts to contextualize them historically. However, if the spiritual and theological nature of Collingwood's thought is taken seriously, and not marginalized, it is hard to see his career as discrete stages of development. The problem of transcendent identity was a central concern for Collingwood throughout his career, and it unifies much of his thinking on divergent topics. The problematic idea of reenactment actually opens up a complex connection in Collingwood's thought between ethical action, historical time, and our relationship with divine reality. It is this rediscovery of Collingwood's spiritual ideas on history that leads to a reevaluation of his own historical context, for it becomes clear that these ideas were neither eccentric nor old-fashioned. The problems Collingwood was addressing link him with a much broader movement of European thought in the interwar period, one that was trying to mediate transcendent reality and concrete historicity in a situation of crisis and fragmentation.<br>

Publisher: Wesleyan University<br>
Issue: i342974<br>
Date: 10 1, 1957<br>
Author(s): Nietzsche Wulf<br>
Abstract: This essay analyzes the development of Hayden White's work from Metahistory to the present. It compares his approach to Roland Barthes's study of narrative and historical discourse in order to illustrate the differences between White's structuralist methods and poststructuralist forms of textual analysis. The author puts particular emphasis on the interdependence between the development of White's work and the criticism it has received during the last twenty years. Whereas historians have dismissed White's relativism, literary theorists and intellectual historians have criticized his formalist methods. White's attempts to counter these critiques have gone mostly unnoticed and have been unsuccessful in that they destabilized his original position without proposing a coherent alternative. The question about adequate representations of Nazism, which White has recently addressed, highlights the theoretical problems which have not received enough attention by White or his critics.<br>

Abstract: The trial of Adolf Eichmann, in 1961, is generally considered a turning point in the history of Holocaust memory because it brought the Holocaust into the public sphere for the first time as a discrete event on an international scale. In the same year, Jean Rouch and Edgar Morin's film Chronicle of a Summer appeared in France. While absent from scholarship on memory of the Nazi genocide for over forty years, Chronicle of a Summer contains a scene of Holocaust testimony that suggests the need to look beyond the Eichmann trial for alternative articulations of public Holocaust remembrance. This essay considers the juxtaposition in Chronicle of a Summer of Holocaust memory and the history of decolonization in order to rethink the "unique" place that the Holocaust has come to hold in discourses on extreme violence. The essay argues that a discourse of truth and testimony arose in French resistance to the Algerian war that shaped and was shaped by memory of the Nazi genocide.<br>

Abstract: La place de la musique dans À la recherche du temps perdu a suscité nombre de commentaires. Le présent propos connecte ces points à un débat interne aux musicologues français. Si certains l'envisage contre toute interpretation subjective, d'autres entendent la recentrer sur deux axes majeurs: 1) le statut d'écrit littéraire 2) révélant l'expérience musicale d'autre part. Or, de récents articles insèrent Proust à ce débat. Il s'agit de comprendre en quoi réactualiser écrivain ayant fait d'un roman un projet esthétique où la question du langage est centrale peut relancer la discussion du lien musique-langage, ici en un rapport où s'adjoint la musicologie, elle-même objet d'une dissension. /// The work À la recherche du temps perdu by Marcel Proust has provoked numerous commentaries which referred to the importance conferred upon music in this novel. In this, interest was pointed either at the music sources, the listening, or the connections between the architecture of the novel and the musical structure of the composer Vinteuil, the character in the novel. This article offers the articulation of those debates which occur within the French musicology which question its objects in the way that some consider it as a science or discipline at intersection of others, which has to return necessarily within sciences called exact and/or humane, opposed to all subjective interpretations; the other try to center again musicologist's activities in two main axes: the status of a writing with a literary aspiration on one side, and a report about musical experience on the other. In this, recent articles were putting Marcel Proust in the focus of a contemporary debate, trying to understand in which way the reactualisation of a writer - who out of one work had made an aesthetical project in which the question of language became central - can renew the discussion about connections between music and language, but this time within a triangular connection in which musicology is added, whi~<br>

Abstract: Lerner's interpretation is that as a result of the Fall, "humanity, in this act of
acquiring a higher level of 'knowing,' assumes the burden of distinguishing between good
and evil and of choosing the good in order to be saved"; but so far as humanity's newly-won
knowledge is, in part, sexual knowledge, the burden falls more heavily on the woman,
because God forbids her the "free and open sexuality of the fertility-goddess," symbolized,
at the time Genesis was written, by the serpent (The Creation of Patriarchy [New York: Oxford
UP, 1986] 196-97).<br>

The work of four scholars is noted as particularly influential in the development of post-processual approaches.<br>

Abstract: Este artículo es un análisis de la novela Una casa vacía (1996) del escritor chileno Carlos Cerda, basado en la identificación de elementos de imaginería gótica en distintos niveles de la obra. Se estudia el funcionamiento de estos elementos dentro del macro esencialmente realista de la obra, para intentar establecer los límites cruzados entre el testimonio, la historia oficial y sus metaforizaciones. La alegoría final que la obra novelesca construye en relación con la antigua casa de tortura y sus habitantes, se corresponde con el período final de la Dictadura Militar (1973-1989) y las prácticas de tortura realizadas por organismos de gobierno contra civiles. Sin embargo, también se trata de mostrar la dificultad del realismo testimonial para escribir una novela sobre la degradación y el sufrimiento de la sociedad chilena del período, sin caer en una ideología maniquea de la narración. This article is an analysis of Una casa vacía (1996), a novel written by the Chilean author Carlos Cerda. This analysis is based upon the identification of elements of the Gothic imaginery at different levels of this narrative. The functioning of these elements is studied within the basically realistic frame of the novel, in order to establish the permeable boundaries between testimonial narrative, the official history and its metaphorizations. The ultimate allegory that the novel builds around a former torture house and its inhabitants finds its correspondence with the final period of the Military Dictatorship (1973-1989) and the torture practices carried by Government Organizations against civilians. Nevertheless, this article tries to show the difficulty of testimonial realism in order to write a novel about the suffering and decadence of the Chilean society of the period, without succumbing to a Manichean concept of the narrative function.<br>

Abstract: In Juan Manuel's fourteenth-century masterpiece El Conde Lucanor, the analogical relationship between the narrative frame and the intercalated apologues has often been mentioned. This article makes use of recent work on the way analogies function in order to better understand the much-vaunted "didacticism" of the Conde Lucanor. Investigation of the first ejemplo from the standpoint of recent theoretical work on analogies reveals that two analogies are in fact in operation, the second of which "thinks" the Conde Lucanor as a book and makes Patronio and his apologues indispensable to Count Lucanor for the duration of book 1.<br>

Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
Issue: i25728159<br>

Author(s): ‮کامبانيني‬ ‮ماسيمو‬<br>
Abstract: The aim of the present article is to investigate how the passages of the Holy Text regarding natural sciences or the cosmological order of the universe can be read from a hermeneutical viewpoint, in a philosophical rather than a historical, grammatical or stylistic sense; the debated problems of literary and artistic character, and the relationship between Qur'an and science per se, are not involved here. If we assume as a working hypothesis the Gadamerian perspective that 'being, as far as we can understand it, is language', we can accept that the being of God and of the universe are disclosed in Qur'anic language and that the Qur'an becomes the framework of the aletheia (in the Heideggerian sense) of science. This paper utilises the above-mentioned epistemological and hermeneutical key in order to make a first attempt to explore the possibility of a philosophical analysis of the question of science in the Qur'an, and concludes that, although it can sound highly paradoxical, the attitudes of total agreement, partial agreement or no agreement between Qur'an and science are not mutually exclusive, but rather work in parallel at different linguistic levels. ‮الهدف من هذه الدراسة هو بحث کيف يمکن فهم الآيات القرآنية المتعلقة بالعلوم الطبيعية أو النظام الکوني من وجهة نظر منهج تفسيري من ناحية فلسفية لا تاريخية أو نحوية أو بلاغية. لن يتم هنا مناقشة قضايا أدبية أو فنية أو العلاقة بين القرآن والعلم في هذا البحث. إذا افترضنا أن وجهة نظر جادامير (remadaG)، ‮ وهي أن " الوجود، کما نفهمه، هو اللغة "، تعتبر نظرية قابلة للتطبيق، يمکن أن نقبل أن وجود الله والکون يبين من خلال اللغة القرآنية وأن القرآن يصبح إطار الوصول للحقيقة، طبقاً لفهم هيدجر (reggedieH). ‮إن هذا البحث يستخدم علم الحد والمنهج التفسيري من أجل القيام بأول محاولة لاستکشاف إمکانية تحليل فلسفي لقضية العلم في القرآن. وقد انتهى هذا البحث إلى أن التوافق بين القرآن والعلم تاما أو جزئيا أوعدم التوافق لا يعتبر أمرا قاطعا من الجهتين لکنه يعمل على درجات لغوية مختلفة متوازنة.‬<br>

Abstract: This article highlights two features of Qur'anic style and content: duality/opposition and typological figuration, which can be seen as providing a continuous and consistent 'narrative stream' through the Qur'an. It is of some interest that both of these features have been singled out as distinctive of apocalypse as a genre in the study of numerous religious and cultural traditions. As debate on whether or not the Qur'an is a bona fide example of apocalyptic literature quietly continues, the interplay of conceptual and substantive oppositions and dualities is discussed in order to highlight the importance of this prominent feature to both the form and contents of the Book. It is suggested that its function is profoundly related to the typological figuration indispensable to the Qur'anic depiction of, for example, the character of the prophets and therefore prophethood. Whether or not this represents a genuine instance of apocalyptic literature, it nonetheless remains that the prominence of the motif renders the Qur'an susceptible of a reading expressive of something called an apocalyptic imagination. It is hoped that this article succeeds in demonstrating that in fact these apparently familiar subjects are stimulated to new life by considering them as defining, interlocking, structural elements of a distinctive Islamic apocalypse. ‮تبرز هذه الدراسة خاصيتين لأسلوب القرآن ومادته: الثنائية/التقابل وتصنيف النماذج مما قد ينظر إليه على أنه يمثل تيارا مستمرا ثابتا في القرآن. ومن اللافت للنظر أنه قد جرى الترکيز على هاتين الخاصيتين على أنهما يختصان بالحديث عن أحوال الآخرة في کثير من الأديان والتقاليد الثقافية. وفي هذا المقال سندرس التفاعل بين الثنائية والتقابل لکي نبرز الأهمية الأساسية لهذه الخاصية بالنسبة لشکل القرآن ومحتواه. فنحن نرى أن وظيفتها تمت بقوة إلى ظاهرة تصنيف الأنواع في تصوير القرآن لشخصيات الأنبياء ثم النبوة نفسها. والأمل أن ينجح هذا المقال في التدليل على أن هذه الموضوعات المألوفة يمکن رؤيتها على أنها نمط إسلامي فريد في الحديث عن الأخرويات.‬<br>

Abstract: La obra de Manuela Infante es una de las más interesantes del teatro chileno emergente de la última década, por su contenido autorreflexivo y amplio espectro de alusiones culturales. En su pieza Juana (2004) destacan las referencias a obras de Vicente Huidobro, Rodolfo Usigli y Bernard Shaw, que vinculan la concepción dramática de esta joven dramaturga chilena con los postulados estéticos y filosóficos de estos autores, en los que convergen arte, mito y memoria. Se estudiará la reelaboración de la figura de Juana de Arco en la obra mencionada a la luz de estos intertextos, para demostrar que el "trabajo de la memoria" histórica que realizan Infante y la Compañía Teatro de Chile, tiene fundamentos en una sólida tradición latinoamericana y europea. The plays of Manuela Infante may be considered some of the most interesting works when we study the new Chilean drama of the last decade, both because of their introspective contents and because of the wide range of cultural allusions to be found in her plays. In her piece Juana (2004), we find significant references to the works of Vicente Huidobro, Rodolfo Usigli and Georges Bernard Shaw, thus establishing a relationship between the dramatic conceptions of this young Chilean playwright and the philosophical and esthetic tenets of those authors: there we may find a convergence of art, myth and memory. In this essay we will study the reworking of the character of Joan of Arc in the already mentioned play Juana, and we will explore the importance of these intertexts in order to show that the 'works of historical memory' to be found in Infante and the Compañía Teatro Club is founded on a solid Latin American and European tradition.<br>

Abstract: This article analyzes the ways in which Polish migrants in Ireland negotiate prevalent Polish discourses on migrant identity. The author emphasizes the complexity of migrant identity transgressions first, in order to displace a belief in a fixed homogeneity of the Polish migrant community, and secondly, to illustrate the problematics of young Polish migrants' relations with politically and culturally endorsed notions of Polishness, and, finally, to stress the need to engage migrant voices into the discussion on issues of Polish cultural and national identity. To that end the author analyzes two narratives of Polish migrants in Ireland which not only engage in contestation and negotiation of fixed identities but also emphasize the value of migration in shaping ideas about identity that transgress the idea of the nation as an absolute.<br>

Abstract: It is important to maintain the distinction between the experience of turmoil
and not getting tangled in it. The contemplative is not exempt from the experience
of inner turmoil (a term which necessarily covers a vast semantic field: from polit-
ical power struggles to gossip at table to interior trials) and, in fact, is often more
vulnerable to it. In his book, House of Wisdom (New York: Harper and Row,
1985), John S. Dunne expresses this through the metaphor of a storm: an impor-
tant leg of the spiritual journey is moving through the storm into its eye and then
Walking with this storm in order to remain in the still simplicity of its eye.<br>

Abstract: L'auteur porte un regard critique sur la construction d'un objet historique qui, pour retracer l'histoire des pratiques de lecture sur le long terme (des années trente à nos jours) et cerner les processus d'appropriation des textes lus en milieu ouvrier, a nécessité le recours à une démarche d'investigation en histoire orale. Il aborde donc les grandes questions méthodologiques puis précise quelques résultats de l'analyse des discours en insistant sur leur apport fructueux pour l'histoire socioculturelle. The author takes a critical look at the construction of an historical object which, in order to relate the history of reading practices over the long term (from the 1930s to today) and bring to the fore the appropriation process of texts read in a working class milieu, meant undertaking an investigation involving oral history. It discusses the main methodological questions and then indicates some results of the analysis of the discourse, while insisting on their fruitful contribution to socio-cultural history.<br>

Abstract: Cet article retrace le parcours singulier d'Arlette Farge. L'historienne y évoque sa propre trajectoire scientifique, parlant des rencontres qui ont joué un rôle déterminant dans l'évolution de ses recherches (Philippe Ariès, Michel Foucault). Elle revient sur ses ouvrages, rappelant l'intention qui a présidé à leur élaboration dans le contexte dans lequel ils ont été préparés et écrits. Enfin, l'entretien est l'occasion pour l'historienne d'évoquer son rapport à la discipline et aux autres sciences sociales, ou encore ses manières de lire les archives et d'écrire pour construire une « histoire de l'infime ». This article recounts the unusual intellectual journey undertaken by Arlette Farge. The historian recalls the scientific path she followed, including a discussion of her encounters with Philippe Ariès and Michel Foucault, both of which played a decisive role in the development of her research. She goes back over her published works, remembering the intentions that motivated them and the context in which they were researched and written. Finally, the interview offers the historian an opportunity to talk about her relationship to the discipline of history itself and to the other social sciences, and how she goes about reading historical records and writing in order to construct a "history of minute details".<br>

Abstract: Cf. Loy, Montesquieu, p. 101, who suggests that, at the time Montesquieu wrote
the Persian Letters, he accepted the superiority of monarchy, and the liberty defined and

noticing that Montesquieu shows 'admiration for states that have rejected or rebelled
against monarchy' in Letters 76, 81 and 86; see Betts, Montesquieu, pp. 75-7. Desserud
argues that Montesquieu's interest in moderate forms of government 'extends at least
back to the time of his writing of the Persian Letters'', see Desserud, 'Virtue, Commerce

Abstract: The critique of these bourgeois values was developed by writers after Freud, particu-
larly by Marcuse. From the latter's perspective, Freud's concept of the super-ego is anachro-
nistic: in modernity no genuine individuation and autonomy are acquired by the institution of
the super-ego, since the father and other close figures are no longer significant in forming this
psychic agency. 'Under the rule of economic, political, and cultural monopolies', Marcuse
writes, 'the formation of the mature super-ego seems to skip the stage of individuation: the
generic atom becomes directly a social atom. The repressive organization of the instinct
seems to be collective, and the ego seems to be prematurely socialized by a whole system of
extra-familial agents and agencies' (p. 97). This understanding of the super-ego and of the
resultant 'surplus repression' leads Marcuse to demand radical reorganization of social and
economic institutions in a manner that differs from Freud' s cautiousness and adherence to the
bourgeois order. See Marcuse, Eros and Civilization.<br>

Publisher: Leo S. Olschki<br>
Issue: e26230922<br>
Date: 8 1, 2008<br>
Abstract: In 2008, as a follow-up to the initiative taken the previous year, ISRE – Istituto Superiore Regionale Etnografico
         [Superior Regional Ethnographic Institute]organized the seminarGramsci ritrovato, tra Cirese e i Cultural Studies(Nuoro, October 24th- 25th, 2008)[Gramsci rediscovered: between Cirese and the Cultural Studies]. The seminar focused on another ‘find’: the readings of Gramsci’s works on folklore that Cirese had elaborated thirty-eight years before. The idea came from Giorgio Baratta, who – in hisGramsci in contrappunto [Gramsci in counterpoint](Carocci 2008) – has given special attention to an analysis of Cirese’s essayConcezioni del mondo, filosofia spontanea e istinto di classe nelle “Osservazioni sul folklore” di Antonio Gramsci [World Views, Spontaneous Philosophy and Class Instinct in the “Observations On Folklore” by Antonio Gramsci](1970). Giulio Angioni’s and Pietro Clemente’s contributions – coming, in part, from an intellectual autobiography standpoint (they both have been Cirese’s students at first, and his colleagues later) – helped elucidate the method and the contents of Cirese’s work. They also dealt with Gramsci, in order to theoretically reconstruct the foundations of Italian folklore studies between the Sixties and the Seventies of XX Century. Baratta’s renewed reading, a part of which we here republish, together with Brigitte Wagner’s contribution (dedicated to the issue of the feasibility of translations of languages and cultures), give evidence to the prospect of a vitality of Cirese’s critical work outside the usual context of Italian folklore studies. Prospect and vitality that have been demonstrated by Cirese himself, who, during the 2008 seminar in Nuoro, was a protagonist of the dialogue with other scholars as well as with the public that intervened in the debate. He was a generous testimony of the large spectrum of his interests, mostly methodological, and he very carefully underlined, with respect to Gramsci, two aspect~<br>

Publisher: International Phenomenological Society<br>
Issue: i345615<br>
Date: 6 1, 1958<br>
Author(s): Wittgenstein Daniel<br>
Abstract: This paper argues against causalism about reasons in three stages. First, the paper investigates Professor Davidson's sophisticated version of the claim that we must understand reason-explanations as a kind of causal explanation to highlight the fact that this move does no explanatory work in telling us how we determine for which reasons we act. Second, the paper considers Davidson's true motivation for regarding reasons-explanations as causal which connects with his claim that reasons are causes. He advocates anomalous monism in order to solve the mysterious connection problem. In assessing his proposed solution to this problem, the paper examines his `extension reply' to the charge that his token identity theory ultimately results in epiphenomenalism. The paper argues that only a reading of this reply makes for a stable anomalous monism but for this reason Davidson's compatiblist metaphysics is unfit for the task of solving the mysterious connection problem. Given that reductive accounts are incompatible with the special features of reasons explanations, the paper concludes that we must reverse the orthodoxy once again and eschew causalism about reasons and reason-explanations. Finally, the paper considers a possible way of recasting our understanding of causation so that the mysterious connection problem disappears.<br>

Abstract: This article presents and discusses the meaning of a possible foundation of ethics, both from a philosophical perspective and with regard to religious representations. It proposes to enlarge the conception of rationality in order to take into account the critical contribution of cultures, traditions and religions to an ethics of reconstruction. This also entails rethinking the role of theological ethics and seeking to make more explicit the cultural plausibility and the practical credibility of Christianity in public ethics today.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i27646172<br>
Date: 12 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Anderson Pamela Sue<br>
Abstract: I begin with the assumption that a philosophically significant tension exists today in feminist philosophy of religion between those subjects who seek to become divine and those who seek their identity in mutual recognition. My critical engagement with the ambiguous assertions of Luce Irigaray seeks to demonstrate, on the one hand, that a woman needs to recognize her own identity but, on the other hand, that each subject whether male or female must struggle in relation to the other in order to maintain realism about life and death. No one can avoid the recognition that we are each given life but each of us also dies. In addition, I raise a more general, philosophical problem for analytic philosophers who attempt to read Continental philosophy of religion: how should philosophers interpret deliberately ambiguous assertions? For example, what does Irigaray mean in asserting, 'Divinity is what we need to become free, autonomous, sovereign'? To find an answer, I turn to the distinctively French readings of the Hegelian struggle for recognition which have preoccupied Continental philosophers especially since the first half of the last century. I explore the struggle for mutual recognition between women and men who must face the reality of life and death in order to avoid the projection of their fear of mortality onto the other sex. This includes a critical look at Irigaray's account of subjectivity and divinity. I turn to the French philosopher Michèle Le Doeuff in order to shift the focus from divinity to intersubjectivity. I conclude that taking seriously the struggle for mutual recognition between subjects forces contemporary philosophers of religion to be realist in their living and dying. With this in mind, the lesson from the Continent for philosophy of religion is that we must not stop yearning for recognition. Indeed, we must even risk our autonomy/divinity in seeking to recognize intersubjectivity.<br>

Abstract: A presente análise do conto "Seqüência", do livro Primeiras estórias, de Guimarães Rosa, pretende demonstrar um recurso recorrente de estruturação das "estórias" do autor. Esses enredos mobilizam, de uma maneira geral, o motivo da viagem e, de uma maneira particular, o percurso do eterno retorno. Nesse trajeto estrutura-se a travessia por um rito de passagem, cujo desfecho dá-se, com uma espécie de sobrelevação lendária, numa paisagem mítica. Para perfazer esse processo, o autor parte de um motivo da cultura popular que acaba amalgamado ao universo da tradição erudita, por meio de referências à tradição da história do gênero da narrativa e de seus códigos míticos. /// This analysis of "Seqüência", a short story from the book Primeiras estórias, by Guimarães Rosa, aims at showing a recurrent device used in the author's stories. These plots have, in a general sense, the motif of travel and, in a strict sense, the journey of eternal return. In this path, the traverse is structured through a rite of passage, whose completion occurs at a mythical scenery as a sort of legendary lifting. In order to accomplish this process, the author's starting point is a motif of popular culture, which ends up by being amalgamated to the universe of the erudite tradition, through references to the narrative genre historical traditions and to its mythical codes.<br>

Author(s): Leget C.<br>
Abstract: Beginning with an exemplary case study, this paper diagnoses and analyses some important strategies of evasion and factors of hindrance that are met in the teaching of medical ethics to undergraduate medical students. Some of these inhibitions are inherent to ethical theories; others are connected with the nature of medicine or cultural trends. It is argued that in order to avoid an attitude of evasion in medical ethics teaching, a philosophical theory of emotions is needed that is able to clarify on a conceptual level the ethical importance of emotions. An approach is proposed with the help of the emotion theory Martha Nussbaum works out in her book Upheavals of thought. The paper ends with some practical recommendations.<br>

Publisher: El Colegio de México<br>
Issue: i27738655<br>
Date: 9 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Duque Sonia<br>
Abstract: La autora se interroga acerca del significado de la expresión construir la paz en situaciones posteriores a la comisión de crímenes masivos. Subraya las dificultades específicas que plantea este tipo de circunstancias tanto a los analistas como a los profesionales que participan del proceso, y hace una serie de propuestas metodológicas que atañen al impacto de los crímenes masivos sobre la reconstrucción de las relaciones sociales y políticas en sociedades desgarradas por la guerra. Además, pone énfasis en la importancia de una mejor comprensión de estos procesos, con el fin de destacar los programas de asistencia más eficaces, ya que aquéllos surgen en situaciones sociopolíticas particulares. Al intentar una aproximación a este delicado tema, analistas y profesionales enfrentan dos retos. Primero, deben entender cómo pudo haberse llevado a cabo el crimen masivo. Segundo, deben identificar las posibilidades de paz existentes dentro de la sociedad afectada. Indudablemente, para que las reglas del juego social y político funcionen o, en otras palabras, para que todos los actores se interesen en unirse al juego colectivo, tales posibilidades no pueden ser ignoradas. La construcción de la paz debe incluir métodos locales que, en la mayoría de los casos, se han ido construyendo con el tiempo y han adoptado diferentes métodos provenientes de otras latitudes. /// The author questions the meaning of the expression "peace-building" in circumstances following the perpetration of massive crimes. She stresses the specific difficulties raised by these kind of situations to both analysts and professionals involved in the process, and puts forward a series of methodological proposals concerning the impact of massive crimes on social and political relations' reconstruction within societies torn by war. Also, the author underlines the relevance of having a better understanding of these processes in order to identify which assistance programs may be more effective, as those processes~<br>

Author(s): Zeitlin Larry J.<br>
Abstract: Recent developments in historical sociology emphasize the centrality of temporality to analysis and explanation. Narrative uses temporal order to organize information about events and to foster their understanding but is insufficiently systematic to substitute for sociological explanation. This article illustrates a new interpretative heuristic for the computer- assisted analysis of qualitative narrative sequences, "event-structure analysis,"that infuses narrative with greater rigor and explicitness. Through the analysis of a lynching that took place in Mississippi in 1930, this article shows how event-structure analysis can be used to build replicable and generalizable causal interpretations of events.<br>

Date: 1 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): ESCHER ANTON<br>
Abstract: This article pleads for a pragmatic strategy of transcultural understanding as a dialogic concept of insight in social geographic research in the „Islamic Orient“. Transcultural understanding is interpreted as a process of assimilating different systems of meaning, norms, and values of subjects on the one hand, and discourses on how those systems fit together on the other hand (cf. Schwemmer 1996). Understanding is organized by scientifically working out common connections respecting and recognizing foreign codes. As it were, social geographic research needs to generate theoretical frames on a common basis in order to take the differences between cultures as a theme afterwards. In preparation of the argument, the concept of the „gelebten Raum“ (Baier 1996), and the post-modern understanding of space in social geography respectively (Claval 1999) is shortly presented. Additionally, a differentiation of the „Islamic Orient“ is outlined, as are the problems of understanding everyday life and social scientific problems of understanding agency.<br>

Abstract: Although a very important figure in interdisciplinary social theory, Nietzsche is absent from sociological theory, especially in the United States. Equating rationalization with cultural homogenization and liquidation of particularity, Nietzsche saw "decadence" where modern social theorists saw progress. He held that sociology drapes cultural domination, regimentation, and exhaustion with the appearance of legitimacy. This essay explores his views about the depletion of social resources stressed in modern theory. It elaborates his "antisociology" and then traces the impact of this framework on three divergent currents of social theory. Nietzsche is read against the backdrop of modern theory in order to explore his continuing challenge to this tradition and his relevance to sociology.<br>

Abstract: Sociocultural anthropology and evolutionary biology have reached the point at which it is possible to give a coherent and synthetic account of the origins of human cultural variability. From a sociocultural perspective what must be explained is not just the fact of varying cultures and societies, but also the human capacity to create, maintain and alter social forms over time. From a biological perspective we have to ask, what is the selective advantage of such variability? The answer lies in human sociality. Sociality consists in a package of social intellectual capacities-higher order intentionality, pedagogy, narrativity, crativity, speech-which made possible an increasing division of labour. But as these capacities grew, they gave rise to distinctively human (rather than Darwinian) history, that is to the forms of social, political, economic and cultural causation which create ever new variations on the theme of social existence.<br>

Abstract: Literature discussing rhetoric is mainly concerned with rhetoric per se - its structure, and the categorization of arguments by kind. Rarely do rhetorical studies examine the actual effects on audiences, and auditors' reactions. On the other hand, sociological studies of scientific controversies look at rhetoric - or argumentation - in action, but with few references to rhetorical studies. The purpose of this paper is to integrate rhetorical studies into the sociology of technology in order to integrate the concept of action into discourse analysis. I intend to show how the use of discourse to enroll actors in a health technology is intimately linked to action. I deconstruct the promoters' strategy into two discursive components - the utility component and the fear-reduction component - to show how the rhetoric of expectations (utility) and representations (fear) contingently shape the fate of a technology.<br>

Article Title: Rereading the Book in Henry James's The Ambassadors<br>
Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: i345794<br>
Date: 12 1, 1909<br>
Author(s): James Kevin<br>
Abstract: This essay argues that in Henry James's The Ambassadors (1903) Mrs. Newsome, who appears to be merely a representative of everything un-Jamesian, particularly a lack of moral and aesthetic imagination, should not be so quickly dismissed. Post-structuralist critics do not hesitate to denounce her. They typically identify Mrs. Newsome's "book" of expectations for Strether, her emissary, and for Chad, her successor, with the closed book of logocentric tyranny; both are said to rely on unambiguous reference and to enforce the cold rationality of linear causation. Derridean readers of The Ambassadors unmistakably prefer Madame de Vionnet's Paris, embodying as it apparently does their own essentially skeptical doctrines about representation. James, however, plays a more subtle game of balance and synthesis, suggesting that while Newsome's book is firm against new impressions, expecting experience to submit utterly to preconceived plans and moralistic evaluations, it also successfully asserts against Parisian representational openness and mystery the viability of reasonable explanation. Her book is vindicated insofar as it stands for the persistent relevance of linear causality and for the nonabsolute grounding of speculation in the concrete world of events and consequences. Newsome's extreme rationalism is in fact denied full authority early in the novel, whose true subject is located when extreme skepticism seems to dominate and explanation seems irrelevant. During the course of the story, time's subtle order slowly reemerges, and James the realist steps forward from behind the post-structuralist veil.<br>

Publisher: Irish University Review<br>
Issue: i29777260<br>
Date: 12 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Lin Yu-chen<br>
Abstract: This essay explores the drama of selfhood and the attendant problem of ethics in Brian Friel's Faith Healer. Drawing from the tenets of Freudian psychoanalysis, I scrutinize the protagonist's narrative identity through fissures created by the discrepancy between his story and the other two characters' versions. These crevices register the protagonist's post-traumatic affects for an uncanny home, which, intertwined with his equally uncanny talent to become the place of trauma, compels him to return time and again instead of acknowledging its loss. Symptomatically, in his fixation on an uncanny home in order to disavow its loss, the protagonist sutures his privation, to such an extent that he not only bars memory exchange with other characters, but appropriates them into a master narrative. Given the fact that the three characters' stories are addressed to invisible auditors who converge with the play's actual audience, the healer's final act of authority is limited as long as it is subject to the audience's interpretation of his memory narrative. In its appeal to the audience's decision on ethical justice for the healer's narrative imagination among multiple proposals, this play is an exercise of poetical ethics of memory.<br>

Publisher: University of Wisconsin Press<br>
Issue: i30154135<br>
Date: 12 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Statkiewicz Max<br>
Abstract: The article resituates Ricur's theory of métaphore vive in the contemporary context of the so-called "cognitive revolution." The latter denomination is highly misleading. There is nothing revolutionary about the cognitivist study of metaphor as a general pattern of thought; just like the discipline of rhetoric that was already on the decline in l8th century Europe, it is conservative in its validation of everyday, ideologically charged language as the model for all language, including that of poetry and art. Riceur’s conception of "live metaphor," on the other hand, does justice to the "revolutionary" character of poetic language, its function of breaking the order of "commonplaces we live by"—and are ruled by. A "poem in miniature," metaphor constitutes the model for any "poietic," creative imagination. Resulting from a clash, disturbing the common everyday language, live metaphor (and poetry in general) projects a world in such a way as to render strange and thus question the world we live in.<br>

Publisher: University of Wisconsin Press<br>
Issue: i30161639<br>
Date: 12 1, 1993<br>
Author(s): Wiegmann Reinhilde<br>
Abstract: Hugo Friedrich's use of mostly negative terms for the description of modern lyrics in Die Struktur der modernen Lyrik (1956) results to a large extent from a static concept of metaphor as substitution and from an implicit acceptance of the "given order of things." Though Friedrich asserts that this terminology is descriptive rather than pejorative, it impacts his interpretation of poetry. Based on Paul Ricoeur's Die lebendige Metapher(1986), this article reexamines one of Friedrich's examples, Rimbaud's "Marine." This poem provides in exemplary fashion a depiction of the metaphoric process of creative, poetic metaphors: transformation as a succession of destruction and production in the realm of land and sea. The tension and play between sameness and difference inherent in the metaphoric paradigm reveals in "Marine" a dynamic process rather than a stable order violated as Friedrich's concept of similarity suggests.<br>

Abstract: Clément Rosset explains that the word
cruor, from which crudelis (cruel) and crudus (indigestible) are derived,
designates torn and bloody flesh, that is, the thing itself stripped of all its orna-
ments and ordinary external accoutrements, in this case skin, and thus reduced to
its unique reality.... Thus reality is cruel - and indigestible - as soon as one re-
moves from it everything which is not reality in order to consider it in itself. (76)<br>

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i30224936<br>
Date: 6 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Rubbers Benjamin<br>
Abstract: In order to give an account of the Congolese tragedy since independence, the inhabitants of Haut-Katanga often resort to four different narratives: the abandonment by Belgium; the biblical curse on Africans; the conspiracy of Western capitalism; or the alienation of life powers by Whites. Though these four stories offer different scenarios, they are all constructed with two types of actors - Whites and Congolese people. This article suggests that this racial/national frame finds its origins in colonial and national ideologies, which have left their mark on Haut-Katanga, and that it continues today to structure the narratives through which people remember their post-colonial history. Collective memory and racial/national identity are reciprocally constituted in these stories, but in different terms. They offer, accordingly, different ways of influencing the present.<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur writes, "The idea of category mistake brings us close to our
goal. Can one not say that the strategy of language at work in metaphor consists in obliterating the
logical and established frontiers of language, in order to bring to light new resemblances the previous
classification kept us from seeing? In other words, the power of metaphor would be to break an old
categorization, in order to establish new logical frontiers on the ruins of their forerunners" (p. 197).

Article Title: Links across the Abyss: Language and Logic in International Relations<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i355724<br>
Date: 9 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Zehfuss K. M.<br>
Abstract: Constructivists have distanced themselves from questions of language in order to engage the "positivist" mainstream in dialogue. Yet language has played a central role in one important strand of positivism. Current debates in international relations assume a question about whether language is important. This article asks how or why language is important to the study of IR by exploring two distinct phases of the linguistic turn. The first phase, associated with logical positivism, approaches language as a picture of the logic of reality; the second, at the roots of a range of alternative approaches, approaches language use as analogous to making moves in a game. In constructing a link between two phases of the linguistic turn, the abyss separating "positivists," who aren't concerned with language, and "poststructuralists," who are, is replaced with a spectrum of different approaches to language and logic in international relations. The significance of these differences is illustrated in a variety of theoretical and empirical examples.<br>

Abstract: God is once again afoot in the public sphere. Politics has become a religious obligation. For a new breed of religious nationalist the nation-state is a vehicle of the divine. This essay seeks to accomplish four things. The first is to argue for an institutional approach to religious nationalism in order both to interpret and explain it. Second, I argue that religion and nationalism partake of a common symbolic order and that religious nationalism is therefore not an oxymoron. Third, the essay seeks to explain why religion has become such a potent political force in our time. And fourth-the task that will take up the bulk of the text-it seeks a principle of intelligibility in the semiotic order of religious nationalism that can comprehend its preoccupation with both women's erotic bodies and monies out of national control.<br>

Abstract: Justice is, in part, a form of remembrance: Memory occupies a vital place at the heart of justice and its struggle to keep the victims, crimes, and perpetrators among the unforgotten. I argue that this memory-justice at once informs core judicial practices and ranges beyond them in a manner that leaves judicial closure incomplete. It reminds us of a duty to keep crimes and their victims from the oblivion of forgetting, of a duty to restore, preserve, and acknowledge the just order of the world. Yet, in the shadow of remembrance, other human goods can wither, goods located in the temporal registers of present and future. This latter lesson is important, but it is one with which we are familiar. I emphasize another, with which we are perhaps less at home: the intimacy of memory's bond with justice, not as obsessional or as a syndrome, but as a face of justice itself.<br>

Publisher: Wilfrid Laurier University Press<br>
Issue: i362030<br>
Date: 12 1, 1976<br>
Author(s): Lane Richard<br>
Abstract: Socialism is often defined in terms of "community," or, as Professor John Wilson once put it, as a "society of friends." Thus defined, it is contrasted with the competitive relations of bourgeois society. But in some recent theory and practice, political competition is taken to be a defining feature of a legitimate socialist order. The persistence of political institutions is thus stressed, both by Western socialist theorists and by reformers in Eastern and Central Europe, and the orthodox view that "state" is to be superseded by "community" is sharply rejected. These two critiques differ, however, in one major respect: for Western socialists, the state is to be legitimated by the principles of socialist rationality, while for many reformers of Eastern and Central Europe it is to be legitimated by political life itself. From this second point of view, neither "friendship" nor "rationality" responds to the tensions which a socialist polity, no less than any other, will face: for both these concepts, to the extent that they are taken to set pre-established norms, constrict the "space for political action," and thus remove the necessary conditions for legitimacy. /// Le socialisme est souvent défini en termesde << communauté >> ou, selon l'expression de John Wilson, comme une << société d'amis >>. Cette définition permet d'établir un contraste avec les relations de compétition de la société bourgeoise. Toutefois, d'aprés les développements des faits et de la théorie, la compétition politique devient une caractéristique d'une société socialiste légitime. La persistance des institutions politiques est maintenant soutenue, aussi bien par tes théoriciens socialistes de l'Quest que par les réformateurs du Centre et de l'Est de l'Europe: la vision orthodoxe du remplacement de l'<< Etat >> par la << communauté >> est maintenant rejetée. Les critiques formulées par ces deux courants different principalement sur un aspect: pour les socialistes de l'Ouest, l'Etat est légitimé pa~<br>

Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i371935<br>
Date: 12 1, 1899<br>
Author(s): Zeilinski R. Drew<br>
Abstract: This paper considers the temporal relationship between account and story in the narrative passages of Pindar's odes. Highly selective, each narrative covers a vast extent of story-time, creating rapidly juxtaposed tableaux. The account typically begins near the end of the story, proceeding backwards by stages until it reaches the beginning. Thence it returns through all, some, or none of the intermediary stages until it has reached its starting point, beyond which it may then continue forward in time. Prophecy and foreshadowing provide a counterpoint to this basically analeptic structure. Different story lines, simultaneous events, and alternative possibilities all find their place in the narrative. The length of account-time is generally less than that of story-time and diminishes as the narrative proceeds. Repetition is necessitated by the backward and then forward order of combination as well as serving other purposes. Elaboration, when it occurs, serves to explain events that are improbable or inconsistent with the maxims contained in the non-narrative passages.<br>

Author(s): Wright Dominique<br>
Abstract: Cet article tente de clarifier les concepts de liberté et de contrainte à partir d'une étude de la conception architecturale, activité que les praticiens disent être un espace contraignant tout en parvenant à concevoir des solutions inédites. L'étude vise des résultats factuels et théoriques. Factuels, car il apparaît que les difficultés de l'exercice professionnel ne résultent pas tant des contraintes que de la sur-responsabilisation et de la sous-faisabilité des études qu'elles induisent. Théoriques, car les faits plaident pour une révision fondamentale du rapport négatif par lequel se définissent habituellement la liberté et la contrainte. Ces faits sont par exemple que les interdictions sont moins contraignantes que les prescriptions et que certaines stratégies de " phagocytage " peuvent trouver la voie de la liberté dans le respect à la lettre d'une contrainte. /// This article attempts to clarify the concepts of freedom and constraint through a study of architectural design work, an activity that its practitioners represent as a constraining space, though they in fact manage to find new solutions within it. The study aims at both factual and theoretical results: factual in that the difficulties of exercising this profession seem to be due less to constraints than the excessive degree of responsibility and near impracticability of the studies they induce; theoretical because certain facts suggest that a fundamental revision of the negative relation generally understood to obtain between freedom and constraint is in order. Two examples of such facts: prohibitions are not as constraining as prescriptions, and certain " absorption " strategies can open a path to freedom while following a given constraint " to the letter ". /// Dieser Artikel versucht die Begriffe von Freiheit und Zwang klarzustellen anhand einer Untersuchung von Architekturkonzepten, die die Praktiker als Aktivität in Zwangsräumen beurteilen, in denen trotzdem neue Lösungen möglich sind.

Issue: i276945<br>
Date: 7 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Yeats Paul F.<br>
Abstract: The apex of American legal thought is embodied in two types of writings: the federal appellate opinion and the law review article. In this Article, the author criticizes the whole enterprise of doctrinal constitutional law scholarship, using a recent U.S. Supreme Court case and a Harvard Law Review article as quintessential examples of the dominant genre. In a rhetorical tour de force, the author argues that most of modern constitutional scholarship is really advocacy in the guise of scholarship. Such an approach to legal scholarship may have some merit as a strategic move towards a political end; however, it has little value as scholarship, the goal of which is to seek truth. As a formerly monolithic legal system becomes more culturally heterogeneous, judges and academics no longer share as many assumptions about social truth. Hence, they have an increasing need to mask political judgments in order to avoid the contentious political battles that this increased diversity produces. Legal academia's present obsession with defending constitutional law as something more than an ad hoc rationalization of what are essentially political choices suggests that the present genre of constitutional scholarship may well have outlived its usefulness as a discursive form.<br>

Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i277383<br>
Date: 10 1, 1980<br>
Author(s): Wilden Dave<br>
Abstract: This paper examines a theoretical perspective on the ways in which children progress in learning mathematics. It suggests that there is a difficulty in associating teaching discourses with the mathematics they locate. This can result in an incommensurability between alternative perspectives being offered. The paper resists attempts to privilege any particular account but rather demands an analysis of these discourses and their presuppositions. In developing these themes the paper invokes Ricoeur's analysis of time and narrative as an analytical approach to treating notions such as transition, development and progression in mathematical learning. His notion of semantic innovation is introduced. This embraces both the introduction of a new metaphor into a sentence or the creation of a new narrative which reorganises events into a new 'plot'. The notion is utilised in arguing that the shift in the student's mathematical development from arithmetic to first order linear equations with unknowns reconfigures the contextual parameters governing the understanding of these mathematical forms. It is also utilised in showing how alternative approaches to accounting for such transitions suit different and perhaps conflicting outcomes. For example, demonstrating awareness of generality or performing well in a diagnostic test featuring the solution of linear equations.<br>

Abstract: This article looks at HIV prevention projects in which established stigmatized and stigmatizing roles were actively reversed and manipulated in pursuit of HIV harm reduction. In two Norwegian projects, sex workers and drug users carried out harm-reduction activities with other drug users and sex workers. Although HIV-related harm reduction was the aim of the projects, termination or reduction of drug use or sex work was not. Such changes nevertheless occurred among the sex workers and drug users who took active part in the project. The article considers these changes in order to reflect on the meanings and roles of participation in HIV prevention work. In particular, the discussion theorizes on possible ways in which alteration of roles and subject positions may produce self-reflective effects with transformative potentials.<br>

Abstract: Critical social theory is a multidisciplinary knowledge base with the implicit goal of advancing the emancipatory function of knowledge. It approaches this goal by promoting the role of criticism in the search for quality education. Through critical social theory in education, quality is proportional to the depth of analysis that students have at their disposal. As a critical form of classroom discourse, critical social theory cultivates students' ability to critique institutional as well as conceptual dilemmas, particularly those that lead to domination or oppression. It also promotes a language of transcendence that complements a language of critique in order to forge alternative and less oppressive social arrangements. A critical social theory-based movement in education highlights the relationship between social systems and people, how they produce each other, and ultimately how critical social theory can contribute to the emancipation of both.<br>

Abstract: A distinction is drawn between theatricality and dramaturgy as modes for interpreting social and religious life. By means of theatricality scholars tend to analyze life as "theater," as "playacting" or "role-playing." Theater is viewed as a metaphor for what "actually" occurs in life. By contrast, dramaturgists interpret life as essentially dramatic in its interpersonal and collective aspects, whether the drama is significant or trivial, good or poor, "genuine" or "theatrical." But there are certain elements and conditions which must be present in order to increase the possibility of the deeper levels of drama. Religious, social and moral life do not routinely achieve these levels, but when it happens the participants and persons in the active audience can recognize the moment as extraordinary, perhaps as an event of awesome significance. It is within these moments that new religious and moral paradigms may arise. At such time role-playing and theatricality are eclipsed but do not totally disappear.<br>

Date: 1 1, 1996<br>
Author(s): Winnicott Amal<br>
Abstract: Drawing on two studies of children aged between seven and 10 years this article explores their narratives of themselves, families, sibling and peer relationships. Their narratives were full of push-pull and contradictory processes. The children moved towards knowledge as well as a disavowal of 'reality' about their families and material conditions. Critically they revealed profound wishes for something better alongside the knowledge that 'this is it'. This article focuses on theorizing children's understandings of and relationships to social and material life in order to argue that meanings matter and meanings have matter. Narratives are social in two critical ways: they involve reaching out and connecting with others, and narratives are constructed within and through the social sphere, while simultaneously they are shot through with conscious and unconscious fantasies. Children are moving towards being in a complex - engaged in and inhabiting many relationships.<br>

Abstract: Salvation is neither "individual" nor "social" but concerns insertion into an ecclesial narrative. This conclusion invites a series of metanarrative considerations by which, in turn, the "narrative ecclesiology" of Henri de Lubac is shown to be too apolitical in comparison with that of Augustine, Augustine's too resigned to the permanence of two cities compared with that of Hegel, and He- gel's too suppressive of the salvific viability of a non-coercive order compared with that of PierreSimon Ballanche. In a corrected form, Augustine's philoso- phy of history outlines the basic narrative conditions for salvation, and this, rather than the metanarratives of enlightenment, gives the true possibility of social critique.<br>

Publisher: Scholars Press<br>
Issue: i40000781<br>
Date: 10 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): Lewis Paul<br>
Abstract: Jonathan Edwards's work is notable because he understands emotions to be central to character and agency. As such, he offers an alternative to currently dominant approaches to character ethics, often inspired by Aristotle, which largely ignore emotions or, when they do recognize that emotions are important dimensions of character, treat emotions in a problematic manner. In order to demonstrate Edwards's relevance to contemporary work on character and emotions, I begin by providing some background on character ethics. I then set out relevant features of Edwards's work before relating those features to the constructive work of Stanley Hauerwas and Robert Solomon. Such comparisons illustrate the contributions which Edwards can make to an ethic of character.<br>

Abstract: In order to sketch an account of a moral commitment to persons as such, the essay examines empathy, sympathy, and benevolence as they arise first in special relations and then are reconstructed to include the stranger under the rubric of "extensive benevolence" or "universal love." The account, the author argues, must deal with conceptual empowerment and authorizing reasons, weakness and evil, normative conflict, and the relation of benevolence to justice.<br>

Author(s): Hellweg Joseph<br>
Abstract: This article explores the hunting aesthetics of initiated Jula hunters of Côte d'Ivoire who call themselves dozos. It explains how their hunting aesthetic structures their relationship to Islam and the Ivoirian state. Although many Africans approach Islam in the context of tensions between local ritual traditions and modernizing Muslim reform, dozos approach Islam the way they approach the forests where they hunt, assimilating to both in order to tame them. They organize their hunting activities around an aesthetic centred on notions of sweetness and fullness; their contraries, difficulty and emptiness; and the process of mimetic transformation (shape-shifting) that mediates between these extremes. With these categories dozos assimilate themselves to and appropriate power from the forest to kill game. They also link themselves to pre-Qur'anic Muslim figures to legitimize themselves as Muslims. More recently, they tried to assimilate to the Ivoirian state to become a parallel police force. Stories of their tutelary spirit, Manimory, and the texts of their hunting songs, incantations, and epics encode diverse ways for dozos to relate to Islam, leaving room for dozos to eschew it as well. Their texts reveal a dynamic sense of history that defies classification in terms of tradition, modernity or postmodernity. /// Cet article examine l'esthétique de la chasse chez les chasseurs initiés julas de Côte d'Ivoire, qui se donnent le nom de dozos.

Author(s): Pielhoff Stephen<br>
Abstract: During the German Kaiserreich, urban expansion and social segregation fostered new mechanisms of indirect and delegated gift-exchange in which the mediations between donors and recipients became increasingly important. In urban societies, mediators were in greater demand than ever before to act as System builders in forging connections between civil society, the municipality, and the State, coordinating private philanthropic initiatives and institutionalizing the resources available for patronage. This paper draws on theories of gift exchange and of social recognition in order to overcome the false dichotomy of interest v. morality in philanthropic action. The cases of failed patrons, competing mediators of culture and disregarded outsiders may illustrate why the history of philanthropy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries cannot simply be regarded as a success story of middle-class civil society.<br>

Abstract: El artículo trata de resaltar tanto la especificidad como las dificultades en la comprensión de la comunicación política. Concebida ésta, desde Aristóteles, como singular combinación de racionalidad y emotividad, ha sido blanco de variados ataques. Estos abarcan desde la habitual desconfianza, intelectual y popular, hacia las prácticas políticas hasta la búsqueda, en filosofía y lógica, de un lenguaje puramente referencial o denotativo. Sin embargo, se argumenta aquí, entender el lenguaje político requiere conjugar otros enfoques sobre significado (antropología del lenguaje, pragmática de Austin y continuadores, teoría habermasiana de la acción comunicativa), diferentes entre sí, pero coincidentes en recuperar aspectos clave de la retórica clásica. También se apunta a algunas inevitables carencias de esos enfoques en materias tan complejas como las que tienen que ver con el lenguaje. /// This paper sets out to highlight both the specifíc nature and the difficulties of understanding political communication. Conceived since Aristotle's day as a singular combination of rationality and emotion, it has been the target of varied attacks. These range from the habitual distrust, intellectual and popular, of politics, to the quest, in philosophy and logic, of a purely referential or denotative language. However, the author contends that in order to understand political language, other approaches to its meaning must be taken into account (linguistic anthropology, the pragmatics of Austin and those who followed him, Habermas' theory of commuhicative action), which, while different in themselves, retrieve key aspects of classical rhetoric. The author also singles out certain inevitable shortfalls vis-à-vis these approaches in such complex fíelds as those related to language.<br>

Abstract: El presente artículo expone los principales resultados de una investigación realizada con el objeto de analizar el papel que cumplen las emociones colectivas en el mantenimiento del orden social. En concreto, trata de explicar el hecho de que las noticias más importantes que aparecen en los medios de comunicación sean noticias de horror, es decir, noticias en las que la muerte siempre aparece en el primer plano de la escena. Los informativos de los medios de comunicación expresan y fomentan la cultura del horror característica de nuestras sociedades avanzadas. Ahora bien, para entender esta cultura es preciso determinar previamente la naturaleza emocional del horror, así como establecer una definición sociológica de este sentimiento. El horror es una emoción compleja compuesta por sentimientos de terror, de asco y de conmoción. El horror, sociológicamente, puede entenderse como "la emoción mediante la que un orden social señala sus límites más extremos". El estudio concluye señalando que existen dos modos alternativos de mantener el orden y la cohesión en el seno de un sistema social. El primer modo de legitimación, característico de las sociedades centrípetas, funciona mediante la gran potencia atractiva que ejerce sobre el campo social un núcleo central de valores sociales positivos. El segundo, característico de las sociedades centrífugas, funciona mediante la gran potencia repulsiva que ejercen sobre el campo social las transgresiones flagrantes del orden moral. El modo típico en el que las sociedades centrífugas regulan el orden social explica la cultura del horror característica de nuestras sociedades avanzadas. /// This article sets out the main results obtained from a research study carried out for the purpose of analysing the role that collective emotions play in maintaining social order.

Abstract: This article aims to "unthink" influential philosophical articulations of the crisis of Europe in order to articulate a non-Eurocentric epistemological position that aims to give a consistent expression to the interrelational approach of wprld-systems analysis. This alternative epistemology demands and foments a postimperial Utopia and requires no less than the death of ideals that defend the epistemological superiority of European Man. An analysis and critique of works by Edmund Husserl, Immanuel Wallerstein, and Walter Mignolo lead to the formulation of a positive conception of the crisis of Europe and to weak versions of Utopia and "colonial difference." The alternative articulation of these concepts aims to make more flexible and productive the links between knowledge and location. In this way, this article intends to bridge the gap between Wallerstein's world-systems approach and Mignolo's concern with the limits of Eurocentric critiques of Eurocentrism.<br>

Abstract: In this paper I develop a phenomenology of falling ill by presenting, interpreting and developing the basic model we find in Jean-Paul Sartre's Being and Nothingness (1956). The three steps identified by Sartre in this process are analysed, developed further and brought to a five- step model: (1) pre-reflective experience of discomfort, (2) lived, bodily discomfort, (3) suffered illness, (4) disease pondering, and (5) disease state. To fall ill is to fall victim to a gradual process of alienation, and with each step this alienating process is taken to a new qualitative level. Consequently, the five steps of falling ill have not only a contingent chronological order but also a kind of logical order, in that they typically presuppose each other. I adopt Sartre's focus on embodiment as the core ground of the alienation process, but point out that the alienation of the body in illness is not only the experience of a psychic object, but an experience of the independent life of one's own body. This facticity of the body is the result neither of the gaze of the other person, nor of a reflection adopting the outer perspective of the other in an indirect way, but is a result of the very otherness of one's own body, which addresses and plagues us when we fall ill. I use examples of falling ill and being a patient to show how a phenomenology of falling ill can be helpful in educating health-care personnel (and perhaps also patients) about the ways of the lived body.<br>

Abstract: A filosofia prática de Kant, ou seja, o nuclear da sua ética, juntamente com o "primado da razão prática sobre a especulativa" e a "religião nos limites da simples razão", com seu acento no "mal radical", têm inegáveis afinidades com a - e em certos casos influxo da - tradição cristã. O próprio Kant terá em alguns momentos reconhecido isso mesmo. Segundo o autor do presente texto, subsistem, contudo, inegáveis divergências. O artigo, escrito a partir de uma declarada 'simpatia metódica, pretende precisar no possível o alcance de umas e de outras, fazendo sobre o tema um balanço positivo. O autor propõe ainda uma hipótese de leitura do Opus Postumum, reconhecendo aqui uma tentativa por parte de Kant no sentido de purificar o seu "teísmo moral" numa direcção que tão pouco é alheia a importantes intuições cristãs. /// Aim of the article is to show that the practical philosophy of Kant, or, in other terms, the core of his ethics, as is the case with the "primacy of the practical reason over the speculative one" and the "religion within the limits of pure reason", with its accent set upon the idea of "radical evil", have undeniable affinities with -and in certain cases influxes from - the Christian tradition. Kant himself seems to have recognized that much at certain moments. For the author of the article, however, there are a few divergences to be reckoned with. In fact, the article, which is clearly written from the standpoint of a declared methodic sympathy, does whatever is possible in order to determine the reach of the ones and of the others, but in the end concludes that the result is a positive one. The author also suggests a reading hypothesis for the Opus Postumum, acknowledging here an attempt on the part of Kant directed towards a purification of his "moral theism" in a direction that as such is no less close to some very important Christian intuitions.<br>

Author(s): Do Carmo Silva Carlos Henrique<br>
Abstract: O presente estudo constitui um ensaio crítico de reflexão sobre a questão dos limites da linguagem em Wittgenstein. A perspectiva deste estudo observa, numa primeira parte, o próprio procedimento do método wittgen-steiniano e segue um modelo de discurso plural, a partir de várias perspectivas que, não só permitem desconstruir a aparente unidade da razão, como indagar interiormente do próprio limite da análise wittgensteiniana. Retomando a caracterização da linguagem e do pensamento nos seus traços fundamentais, desde o "Tractatus" até às "Investigações Filosóficas", chama-se a atenção para os pontos de dificuldade, da indefinição e da cons-trutividade do modelo de Wittgenstein. A plena lição do "autómaton" da linguagem face a uma possível diferenciação dos signos e aprofundamento lógico, constitui uma parte desta reflexão que se complementa pela referência aos horizontes de resíduo do não-linguístico, ou até do indizível, numa dupla maneira de estabelecer os limites da linguagem. Enfim, e a título conclusivo, apontam-se, não apenas os contornos do que se entende como uma moral retórica da linguagem em Wittgenstein, mas para perspectivas originais de um reaprofundamento em termos etioló-gicos de diferenciação de escala da lógica e da linguagem, e de recuperação de uma intencionalidade psico-lógico-linguística superando aquela indiferen-ciação do dizer no automático da fala estatuída na "ordinary language". /// La présente étude constitue un essai critique qui réfléchie sur la question des limites du langage dans la philosophie de Wittgenstein. Dans une première partie la perspective de cette réflexion analise les procédés que Wittgenstein lui-même utilise dans sa méthode, et pour cela se sert d'un modèle de discours pluriel, lequel permet non seulement la déconstruction de l'apparente unité de la raison, mais aussi faire une enquête au dedans des limites de l'analyse wittgensteinienne.

Date: 3 1, 1982<br>
Author(s): Lourenço Menuel<br>
Abstract: It is here proposed the elimination of the concept of truth in analytical construction by substituting for it the concept of terminal evidence of an assertion. Terminal evidence is in turn explained in terms of anschauliche non-deterministic sequences and portions of finitist logic generated by these sequences are sketched both for statements without quantifiers and statements with first order quantifiers. Emphasis is given to the nature of negation and existence in the proposed elimination. /// Es wird vorgeschlagen, die Eliminierung des Wahrheitsbegriffes in der analytischen Konstruktion durch die Einsetzung des Begriffes der endgultigen Evidenz einer Aussage durchzufuhren. Bei der Einfuhrung von anschaulichen akausalen Folgen lasst sich der Begriff der endgultigen Evidenz erklaren und Teile der finiten Logik, die solche Folgen erzeugen, werden skizziert sowohl fur Aussagen ohne Quantoren als auch fur solche, bei denen nur Quantoren der ersten Stufe vorkommen. Die Natur der Negation und des Existenz-Begriffes ist insbesondere hervorgehoben. /// É proposto efectuar-se a eliminação do conceito de verdade na construção analitica pela introdução do conceito da evidência terminal de uma asserção. Com a introdução de sucessões não-deterministas é elucidado o conceito de evidência terminal e os fragmentos de lógica finitista que estas sucessões originam são esboçados quer para o caso de asserçães sem quantores quer para aquelas asserções em que só ocorrem quantores de 1.a ordem. A natureza da negação e do conceito da existência são especialmente destacados.<br>

Author(s): Pellegrini Angelo<br>
Abstract: O artigo pretende mostrar os termos na base dos quais se desenvolve na primeira produção piciana (Sonetos - Oratio e, em parte, o Heptaplus) uma forte concepção da autoconsciência humana, e de que modo esta a partir da certeza do próprio limite se torna positivamente consciência do criado. O desenvolvimento necessário de uma tal posição será o forte acento colocado por Giovanni Pico sobre a dignidade ontológica e criatural do ser humano: esta será elaborada primeiro nos termos de uma verdadeira filosofia da liberdade, mostrando-se depois até que ponto a autoconsciência e a própria dignidade humana levam o Conde da Concórdia a esboçar uma verdadeira e autêntica filosofia da responsabilidade, cuja primeira concretização mais forte se encontra no convite a recuperar a a dignidade originária do ser humano com vista à construção da paz. /// The article aims at showing the extent to which in his first writings (Sonetti -Oratio and incidentally Heptaplus,) Giovanni Pico della Mirandola develops a strong conception of human selfconsciousness, which at the same time represents an awareness of the human limits and of the created world. The necessary development of such a conception consists in Pico's underlining of the high, ontologic, dignity of the human being. The article shows how this takes the shape of a philosophy of freedom and, then, on the background of human selfconsciuosness and dignity, how the Count of Concordia outlines something like a philosophy of responsibility realizing itself in a strong invitation for people to rediscover the originary dignity of the human being in order to build peace.<br>

Author(s): Hart Kevin<br>
Abstract: "Mystic Maybe's": the title comes from Augustine Birrill's words on the death of Matthew Arnold. Is it true that Richard Kearney's philosophy of religion, like Arnold's reflections on the Bible, are "mystic maybe's," mere flirtations with possibility? In order to answer this question I seek to understand Kearney's expression "the God who may be" and to see if it fits into a non-metaphysical philosophy of religion. The expression is clarified by way of comparisons with Wolfhart Pannenberg's eschatological understanding of God and Eberhard Jungel's theology of possibility. One weak point in Kearney's philosophy of religion, it is argued, is its avoidance of theology in the name of the philosophy of religion. A sound philosophy of religion needs to engage with theology. /// "Mystic Maybe's" (Possibilidades místicas): Este titulo deriva das palavras de Augustine Birrill acerca da morte de Mathew Arnold. O autor do artigo pergunta até que ponto a filosofia da religião de Richard Kearney não será, tal como as reflexões de Arnold acerca da Bíblia, um mew "místico talvez", um simples namoro com a possibilidaãe. Em ordem a responder à questão, o autor procura compreender o sentido da expressão de Richard Kearney acerca do "Deus que pode ser" de modo a avaliar até que ponto a expressão se adequa a uma filosofia não-metafísica da religião. O artigo clarifica a expressão de Kearney mediante uma comparação quer com a compreensão escatológica de Deus de Wolfhart Pannenberg quer com a teologia da possibilidade de Eberhard Jüngel. Mostra-se, desta forma, que um dospontos maisfracos na filosofia da religião de Richard Kearney consiste na sua tentativa de escapar à teologia em nome da filosofia da religião. Com efeito, argumenta o autor do artigo, uma autêntica filosofia da religião não pode deixar de estar num diálogo eficaz com a teologia.<br>

Abstract: Hobbes julgava ter encontrado na ciência e na sua metodologia, especificamente naquelas ciências que eram consideradas como indubitáveis, o modelo que lhe permitiria construir as bases da nova sociedade. Com isto buscava evadir-se das ambiguidades predominantes no seu tempo, as quais não faziam outra coisa senão manter a sociedade num estado bélico. O presente artigo mostra como Hobbes constrói o seu pensamento político de modo geométrico, como uma ciência demonstrativa, comparando o dever-ser da ciência política com a ordem imperante na matemática. O autor mostra ainda até que ponto Hobbes colocou todos os seus esforços na tarefa de dar um carácter científico à política, já que a sua pretensão era fazer dela uma ciência racional Numa palavra, o artigo mostra de que modo Hobbes pretendeu elevar o carácter da filosofia política ao de uma verdadeira ciência política. /// In science - particularly in those sciences that were considered indubitable -and in its methodology, Hobbes thought that he had found the pattern which would allow him to build the bases of a new society. In doing so he was trying to avoid the prevailing ambiguities of his time, which did not go beyond keeping society in an ongoing state of war. Accordingly, he builds his thought around the geometrical mode, as a demonstrative science. Thus he compares the "ought" of political science to the prevailing order of mathematics. Hobbes took great pains to give politics a scientific character, as he tried to make a rational science out of it. By doing this, Hobbes attempted to raise the nature of political philosophy to political science.<br>

Journal Title: Ethics and the Environment<br>
Article Title: The Narrative Ethics of Leopold's Sand County Almanac<br>
Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
Issue: i40014552<br>
Date: 10 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Liszka James Jakób<br>
Abstract: Although philosophers often focus on the essays of Leopold's Sand County Almanac, especially "The Land Ethic," there is also a normative argument present in the stories that comprise most of the book. In fact the shack stories may be more persuasive, with a subtlety and complexity not available in his prose piece. This paper develops a narrative ethics methodology gleaned from rhetoric theory, and current interest in narrative ethics among literary theorists, in order to discern the normative underpinnings of the stories in Part 1. The narrative ethics approach sidesteps the need to ground the land ethic in ethical theory—which has been a reconstructive and problematic task for the philosophical interpreters of Leopold—and suggests, instead, that it emerges in Leopold's very effort to narrate his, professional, personal, and practical experience with nature. The involves examining the stories in terms of their emotional, logical and performative aspects. The result is an analysis that shows not only how these stories express normative claims, but also justify them. One conclusion of the analyses is that, in the narratives, there is less emphasis on the problematic notion of an over-arching "community" than in the prose pieces, and more emphasis on the metaphor of other living things as "fellow travelers" in the "odyssey of evolution." Second, the narratives take on an ironic attitude toward the ecological order, less discernable in the prose essays. The order itself may not be ethically admirable, but should be preserved since it makes possible any ethical relations within it. Thus, the narrative reading suggests some temperance to the usual holistic interpretation of his land ethic and its concomitant criticisms especially the charge of ecofacism. We should not take the land ethic imperative at its face value, in the sense that the good of the order itself is an intrinsic good. In the narratives, individuals are shown not merely to be means to the ecological whole,~<br>

Abstract: African American quiltmaking began to gain recognition as an expressive form distinct from European American quiltmaking in the countercultural climate of the 1970s. Representations of it since then have served to update the Eurocentric, patriotic image of quiltmaking in the United States with components ofmulticulturalism and cultural critique. These representations in turn caused tensions along the lines of class, race, gender, and scholarly discipline. This study shows the power of words and things when used together, as in museum exhibits, to affirm or challenge the existing social order.<br>

Date: 9 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Maldamé Jean-Michel<br>
Abstract: The article aims at a demonstration of the various problems attached to the concordist project. The study begins with a definition of concordism, precisely in order to show that it is derived from the desire of assuring the unity of the human spirit as it is confronted with the great diversity of scientific knowledge, but also that it ends up contradicting this very intention due to its lack of a true spirit of criticism. The article shows also how during the xx! h century the crucial questions to which the concordism related have to do with those pertaining to the origin of the universe, to the formation of the planet earth and to the notion of original sin. However, due to the fact that this last point is, no doubt, the most delicate and sensible one, the article insists particularly on a more detailed analysis of the notion of original sin in a theological perspective, one namely that is coherent with contemporary scientific knowledge. /// O presente artigo tem por objectivo mostrar os impasses a que conduz a atitude concordista em relação aos dados da Ciência e da Teologia. Nesse sentido, o estudo começa por definir o que se entende por concordismo. Mostra-se até que ponto a intenção do concordismo é a de assegurar a unidade do espírito humano confrontado com a diversidade dos saberes, mas também até que ponto essa mesma intenção é traída pela notável ausência de um verdadeiro espírito crítico. Mostra-se também que ao longo do século XX os pontos mais salientes do concordismo têm a ver com as questões ligadas à origem do universo, à formação da terra e ao pecado original Dado, porém, que este último ponto é, sem dúvida, o mais delicado, o autor do artigo detém-se numa análise mais detalhada e situada da noção de pecado original numa perspectiva teológica renovada por virtude dos conhecimentos derivados das ciências naturais.<br>

Abstract: As alusões implícitas e as referências explícitas ao pensamento de Søren Kierkegaard pontuam toda a obra de Jacques Ellul. Com efeito, segundo o autor do artigo, sempre que trata de temas como a Bíblia, a fé, a esperança, o amor, a oração, a liberdade, a política, a técnica, a não-conformidade ao mundo, ou o sofrimento, Jacques Ellul recorre insistentemente a Kierkegaard em ordem a construir o seu próprio pensamento. Nesse sentido, o artigo pretende mostrar os modos de fidelidade, de retoma e de reinterpretação de uma na outra obra de modo a, de algum modo, também poder esclarecer o significado da expressão "ser kierkegaardiano". /// Implicit allusions and explicit references to Søren Kierkegaard's thought punctuate the entire work of Jacques Ellul. Especially when dealing with topics like the Bible, faith, hope, love, prayer, freedom, politics, technology, nonconformity to the world, or suffering, Ellul calls frequently on Kierkegaard in order to build his own thought. The article shows the different modes of fidelity, resumption and reinterpretation of a work into the other, so that at the end it also clarifies what it means to be kierkegaardian.<br>

Issue: i40020109<br>

Author(s): Hahn Hans Peter<br>
Abstract: Diffusionism is a long-standing theoretical issue in anthropology. The current research on globalization often shows astonishing similarities between the 19th century understanding of diffusion and the most recent interpretations regarding globally circulating cultural phenomena. These parallels indicate the impact of global influences on local cultures. Instead of adopting a macro perspective that promotes a world map outlook, the author proposes a closer examination of local action in the context of global influences in order to avoid the reemergence of the shortcomings that led to the termination of the 19th century approaches. The focus on the local perspective through study of cultural appropriation appears to be an optimal way to understand the working of globalization on local levels.<br>

Abstract: Cet article cherche à identifier les différentes étapes du positionnement de René Rémond par rapport au mouvement de Mai 68, afin d'en repérer les singularités. En 1968, ce célèbre universitaire français est professeur d'histoire contemporaine à la faculté de lettres de Nanterre, berceau et matrice de la révolution étudiante. Il semble adopter trois attitudes successives : la fermeté tant que la contestation reste cantonnée à Nanterre (de mars à mai), la prise de distance quand le mouvement monte en puissance et se diffuse à la France entière (première quinzaine du mois de mai), le dialogue à partir de la seconde quinzaine du mois de mai. Cet itinéraire est diversement interprété. Si certains reprochent à René Rémond un revirement opportuniste, la majorité de ceux l'ayant fréquenté sur cette période estime qu'il a opéré une adaptation stratégique dans le but de protéger l'Université contre les dérives. Cet implication se révélera durable puisqu'il conduira René Rémond à la présidence de la nouvelle Université Paris-X-Nanterre. /// This article deals with and identifies the various stages in René Rémonds positioning with regard to the movement of May 1968. In 1968, this famous French professor was professor of contemporary history at Nanterre, faculty of humanities, cradle and matrice of the student revolution. He seemed to have three successive attitudes: firmness as long as protest remained at Nanterre (from March to May), withdrawal when the movement grew and spread to all of France (May 1-15), and dialogue during the second half of May. This itinerary has been variously interpreted. While some people criticize René Rémond for opportunistically changing sides, most who were involved with him in this period thought he carried out a strategic adaptation in order to protect the University from straying too far. This involvement turned out to be a lasting one as it led René Rémond to be president of the new University Paris-X-Nanterre.<br>

Abstract: Depuis la seconde moitié du xxe siècle, il s'opère un jeu de va-et-vient incessant entre le passé et le présent, entre la transcendance de la tradition ou sa rupture, en même temps qu'il se produit un phénomène d'échanges et de communications de diverses musiques du monde. De ce phénomène résultent aussi bien des chocs de culture, de savoirs que de pensées et de leur ré-interprétation ou transformation, sans oublier leur ré-appropriation par les uns et par les autres. Les musiques des uns et des autres -cultures du monde -, devenant alors le patrimoine de tous, se prêtent aux fantasmes et aux interprétations de ceux qui les reçoivent ou les perçoivent selon leur sensibilité, selon leurs affinités. C'est dans ce cadre que la musique elitiste contemporaine couvre actuellement une hétérogénéité de procédés et de formes, en ce qu'elle associe divers facteurs : écriture-oralité, mémoire collective, acquis culturel, juxtaposition ou enchevêtrement d'expressions musicales d'origines diverses (populaires, variétés, traditionnelles, savantes). Ceci appelle sa relecture à différents niveaux, par conséquent sa ré-interprétation, ainsi que l'examen approfondi de ses conditions historiques et socioculturelles de production. Pour amorcer cette nouvelle réflexion sur l'art musical elitiste contemporain, devenue actuellement plus qu'une nécessité, je propose l'expression World Music savante pour servir ici de béquille à une tentative de questionnement sur l'émergence et la consolidation d'une nouvelle identité culturelle ou tradition musicale elitiste contemporaine, celle cristallisant une réalité multiple et hétérogène. C'est aussi, pour moi, une manière de m'interroger sur la contemporanéité de la musique savante actuelle. Since the second half of the 20th century, there has been a ceaseless interplay between past and present, between transcendence of and break with tradition, together with a phenomenon of exchange and communication with diverse musics of the world, resulting in ~<br>

Abstract: Les apports de Jean-Marie Floch au marketing sont nombreux. Cet article ne prétend nullement en rendre compte de façon exhaustive mais tâche plutôt de montrer combien les voies et pistes de recherche qu 'il a initiées ont été fructueuses pour l'ensemble de la communauté marketing et sont d'un recours très fréquent pour aborder les questions de signification. Comprendre le parcours generatif du sens, permettre l'analyse des récits de marque, inscrire dans le lieu de vente ou l'objet les attentes génériques des consommateurs, voici quelques unes des très précieuses idées développées par ce sémillant sémioticien. The contributions of Jean-Marie Floch to marketing are numerous. This paper does not pretend to cover exhaustively this domain but tries to show how the research avenues developed are fruitful for the entire marketing community and are frequently used in order to deal with questions that have to do with signification. Facilitating the understanding of the process of sense generation, allowing the analysis of brand stories, marketing through sales area designs or products the generic requirements of customers, those are some of the precious ideas developed by Floch.<br>

Article Title: Utopia and history. Some remarks about Nikolai Berdjaev's struggle with history<br>
Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i40027959<br>
Date: 3 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Augustyn Leszek<br>
Abstract: The article deals with the philosophy of Nikolai Berdjaev (1874-1948), which he formulated between The Philosophy of Inequality (written in 1918, but published in 1923) and The New Middle-Ages (1924). Berdjaev's philosophy is analyzed in the context of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and its aftermath. The other point of reference is the crisis of culture and civilisation, which affected the West in the inter-war period. Berdjaev's position has been interpreted in view of the archetypal myth of the struggle of the two principles, the principle of order (cosmos) and the forces of destruction (chaos). This myth is tied to the millenialist world view. Berdjaev took an anti-utopian stance. He juxtaposed the utopianrevolutionary principle with the hierarchical-creative one. From this position he criticized among others democracy, liberalism and socialism. In the midst of the crisis of the 1920s he remarked the possibility of spiritual rejuvenation putting forward the concept of the New Middle-Ages. One can say that at that time Berdjaev's philosophy evolved within the conservative-creative framework, from the utopia of conservatism to the utopia of 'free creativity'.<br>

Publisher: Taylor & Francis<br>
Issue: i40028027<br>
Date: 12 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Armstrong Andrew H.<br>
Abstract: The attempt to write extreme violence, or to reco[r]d[e] traumatic cultural memory - the representation of horror - tests both the representational capacity of language and the rationality of subjecthood. Much narrative endeavour is spent trying to narrativise or 'structure' horror into story. However, because traumatic memories resist the narrative framework of the novel, questions are posed not only about the reliability of the narrator's memory and his/her ability to narrate a credible story, but also about the suitability of the fictional form of the novel to represent historical events such as extreme violence. How does language in narrative, with its insistence on order and sequence, 'capture' the destructuring nature of violence? Where is the subject or the idea of rational subjectivity in these de-structuring acts of violence? I will attempt to address these issues through a critical 'reading' of Moses Isegawa's novels Abyssinian Chronicles (2000) and Snakepit (2004). In these novels, Isegawa recasts and reenacts a period of recent Ugandan history marked by violence and chaos, emanating from the dictatorship of Idi Amin. However, both novels stretch the limits of 'factual' or historical credulity, reminding the reader that they are in fact works of historical fabrication. I am of the view that the narrative endeavour in these two novels is not only to record the chaotic events experienced during the years before and after the fall of Idi Amin, but to recode, through the tropes of language (symbol, imagery, and metaphor), the devastating effects of those years on the literary landscape of Uganda.<br>

Author(s): Gildea Robert<br>
Abstract: This paper is the text of an inaugural lecture given as Professor of Modern History in the University of Oxford on 7 November 2008. It arises from a research project entitled Around 1968: Activism, Networks, Trajectories', which involves a team of historians examining samples of activist networks in fourteen European countries, in order to understand ways of becoming an activist, being an activist and making sense of activism. The key terms of this project are transnationalism – tracing resonances and interactions between activists and activist networks across frontiers – and subjectivity – using oral testimony to understand the phenomenon of activism. The framing and presentation of the project incited a rethink of the methods of oral history, not least because the project originated in Oxford, where scepticism persists about the credibility of oral history as a discipline. To persuade this audience of the power of oral history, the approach was taken to locate it at the confluence of three recent developments which have impacted on the study of history as a whole: the linguistic turn, memory studies, and interest in subjectivity, intersubjectivity and the unconscious. These reflections are then used to illuminate evidence drawn from French activists interviewed in the course of 2007 and 2008.<br>

Abstract: Cet article propose d'utiliser le concept d'utopie rationnelle pour rendre compte des pratiques managérìales et tout particulièrement de la production de réformes répétées dans les organisations. Dans cette perspective, après avoir décrit une décennie de transformations au sein d'une organisation publique, certaines caractéristiques de la « culture manageriale » sont dégagées de sa pratique réformatrice. Dans un second temps, le concept d'utopie rationnelle est construit à partir de textes canoniques et des travaux d' « utopologues ». Dans un troisième temps, utopie rationnelle et culture manageriale sont comparées, afin de préciser l'apport cognitif de cet outil à la compréhension du fonctionnement des organisations. This article proposes to use the concept of utopia to account for the managerial practices and especially to explain the production of repeated organizational transformations. From this point of view, the case of a decade of ceaseless transformations into a public organization is first described. Some of the features of the « managerial culture » are then inferred from this empirical statement. In the second place, the concept of rational utopia is constructed, from canonical texts and works of « utopologists ». Finally, rational Utopia and managerial culture are compared, in order to specify the main cognitive contributions of this tool to the understanding of organizational functioning.<br>

Abstract: Framed in the introduction and conclusion by an analysis of U. S. Congressional hearings about Hurricane Katrina and its socio-political aftermath, this article explores the theo-political significance of narrative in order to give a feminist theological interpretation of political participation and personhood. It attends to and expands on the role of narrative at the intersections of moral philosophy, feminist theory, sociology, and public and women's liberation theologies, retrieving key insights from these sources to highlight some of the heretofore neglected implications of subaltern narratives as an alternative form of political engagement in U. S. public life. Especially when viewed through a richly textured feminist, womanist, and mujerista theological lens, this article provides a theological perspective on narrative as one rhetorical practice of public engagement utilized by marginalized groups for prophetic justice. It concludes by showing how a feminist<br>

Abstract: Ce travail analyse l'usage du mythe bolivarien dans l'histoire du Venezuela dans la longue durée, suivant l'approche de l'histoire des idées et des sensibilités et jusqu'à prendre en compte l'imaginaire politique de la République bolivarienne. Il montre qu'au-delà de la chronologie consacrée par les historiographies de l'indépendance et patriotique surgissent des thèmes et des passions souvent oubliés par l'histoire académique, aujourd'hui récupérés par l'histoire officielle. C'est dire la nécessité de dresser une esquisse « opportune » du héros, en laissant de côté les faits pétrifiés voire sanctifiés. Desde la perspectiva de la historia de las ideas y de la historia de las representaciones, este trabajo intenta analizar el uso del mito bolivariano en la historia de Venezuela, ubicándolo en el tiempo largo hasta llegar al imaginario político de la «República Boüvariana». Muestra cómo, más allá de la consagrada cronología independentista y de la historiografía patria, asoman temas y pasiones muy a menudo olvidados de la historia académica aunque si rescatados por une nueva historia oficial. De ahí la necesidad de llegar a un boceto «oportuno» del héroe, dejando de lado hechos petrificados y hasta santificados. This essays aims to analyze the use of bolivarian myths in Venezuelan history from point of view of the history of ideas and representations. So its focuses on long term interpretation in order to emphasize the political imaginary of Bolivarian Republic. It points out to the fact that, along with Independence consecrated chronology and homeland centered historiography, come up matters and passions frequendy forgotten by academic history but recovered by the new official history.<br>

Abstract: What do historians do when they interpretate the past ? Narrativists hold that they organize factual statements into a meaningful whole, the story, which itself has nothing to do with past reality. Others, like David Carr and Paul Ricoeur, defend a relation between the narrative whole and the experience of time. An altogether different approach to the question of the unity of history is that of Johan Huizinga. Huizinga does not place the meaningful unity of history in the text, but in the aesthetic conception of the past. The past is not like a reservoir of signs, which acquire meaning by being put in a self-invented order, nor is it a story-like structure which can be interpretated and translated like a text. History is a cultural reality which we experience as full of symbolic meaning. Interpretation is the search ofthat meaning. The centre of historical conciousness is not in the story, but in the mental imageswe create when we see historical objects, search through documents or read a historians interpretation. In this article I try to clarify Huizinga's concept of the „historische sensatie“ by relating Huizinga's ideas to those of the Dutch writer Lodewijk van Deyssel. Secondly I try to show how the imagination of the (past) world can be regarded as a fundamental form of truth by confronting Huizinga's ideas with those of the philosopher Martin Heidegger and artists such as Albrecht Dürer and Vincent van Gogh.<br>

Abstract: After the 'death of God', it would be a mistake to continue to think of eros in terms of a longing for possession ofthat which one is lacking, especially in matters of religion. Alongside Plato's Diotima, Kierkegaard, Levinas and even Heidegger, an alternative view of eros is proposed in which eros is gradually letting go of its possessive cravings in order to open itself for the other. In this way, eros is bent in the directionof the unselfish service of the other. The question is then asked which kind of understanding of being is implied by this redirection of eros. The answer is taken from a thinking of the meaning of being in terms of self-givenness and self-outpooring in beings, for beings to be 'there'. Our being at the service of the other can therefore be seen as a following of the call of being in us to become adequate to the meaning of being itself.<br>

Abstract: Cassirer faisait de la connaissance le point culminant du « processus d'objectivation de l'esprit » se révélant ainsi progressivement à soi-même à travers la spécificité de ses diverses configurations symboliques. Nous nous proposons d'élucider ici la loi de constitution propre aux sciences exactes à partir des principales figures de la physique moderne pour nous élever à une philosophie de la culture scientifique et dégager les principaux problèmes que pose sa réalisation comme « Weltbegriff ». Cassirer considered Knowledge as the terminating point of the « process of objectification » of human spirit that leads progressively to its self-consciousness through the differential specificity of symbolic forms. We are mainly concerned here with trying to clear up the constitutive law proper to exact sciences. Our analysis starts from the main figures of modern physics as its starting point in order to set our thought on a philosophy of scientifical culture and to draw the main problems related to its achievement as « Weltbegriff ».<br>

Abstract: Cet article propose d'explorer les enjeux d'une écriture romanesque contemporaine définie comme douleur fantôme de l'histoire et exercice de ses mémoires possibles: deux séries complémentaires d'exemples – liées pour l'une à la réinvention d'une mémoire du bourreau par un narrateur « sosie » de l'historien (Manuel Vázquez Montalbán et Jonathan Littell), et pour l'autre à la saisie de l'historicité des temps présents sous l'angle conjoint de la mélancolie et de l'ironie (David Albahari, Aleksandar Hemon et Dubravka Ugrešić) – permettent d'éclairer l'ambition romanesque de transcription de l'histoire dans l'exercice « à-présent » (ou « au temps-maintenant » , selon l'expression de Walter Benjamin) de ses mémoires possibles. En courant le risque d'une rivalité ou d'une confusion trompeuse entre les statuts du discours historiographique et du récit romanesque, et en s'exposant à la récusation par le lecteur de sa légitimité en la matière, le roman contemporain choisit de s'établir dans les plis du savoir historien et ainsi d'engager ses moyens propres dans l'entreprise d'une écriture en palimpseste du texte virtuel, ou idéal, de l'expérience historique. This article sets out to investigate those aspects of the contemporary novel in which fiction writing delves into the ghost pains of history and experiments with its would-be memories. Two sets of complementary examples will allow us to shed light on this particular novelistic ambition, i.e. transcribing history into a "to-day" (or "now-time", to use a phrase coined by Walter Benjamin) experimentation with its virtual memories. The first set of texts (by Manuel Vázquez Montalbán and Jonathan Littell) illustrates the reinvention of the executioner's memory courtesy of a narrator passing himself for a double of the historian. The second series of novels (by David Albahari, Aleksandar Hemon and Dubravka Ugrešić) features several attempts to grasp the historical quality of present times at the articulation of melancholy and ~<br>

Abstract: Bien que de nombreux auteurs aient fait œuvre à la fois de sociologue et de théologien, il n'existe pas à proprement parler de « sociologie de la théologie ». L'objet de cet article est de proposer une relecture de La topographie légendaire des évangiles en Terre sainte de Maurice Halbwachs afin de montrer que ce livre offre autant une étude de sociologie de la mémoire qu'une esquisse de sociologie de la théologie. Après avoir précisé en quoi on peut parler d'une étude de la « construction sociale de la pensée chrétienne » chez Halbwachs, on revient plus en détails sur la façon dont il analyse le mécanisme de production de l'orthodoxie théologique, puis sur la spécificité du regard que le sociologue porte sur les questions théologiques. Enfin, la conclusion est l'occasion de souligner ce que pourrait apporter la sociologie de la théologie à la sociologie en elle-même. Even if various authors contributed to sociology as well as to theology, nothing like a "sociology of theology" exists. The aim of this article is to offer a rereading of La topographie légendaire des évangiles en Terre sainte by Maurice Halbwachs, in order to show that this book is not only a study of sociology of memory but also an outline of a sociology of theology. After having defined in what extent we can find a study of "the social construction of the Christian thought" in Halbwachs' work, we turn to the way he analyses the production process of the theological orthodoxy, and then to the specificity of the sociological point of view on theological questions. Finally, the conclusion gives us the occasion to underline what the sociology of theology could bring to sociology itself. Aunque varios autores han contribuido tanto a la sociología que a la teología, no se puede decir que existe realmente una "sociología de la teología". Este articulo propone una relectura de La topographie légendaire des évangiles en Terre sainte de Maurice Halbwachs que pretende mostrar que este libro es tanto un estudio~<br>

Abstract: Depuis un demi-siècle d'importantes mutations sont intervenues dans l'exercice du métier d'historien, dues notamment à la pression d'une demande sociale forte, à une médiatisation galopante dans la communication du savoir, à la nécessité de procéder à l'historisation d'une mémoire déferlante. Mais deux pièges épistémologiques guettent : d'un côté, le retour d'une forme de positivisme appauvrissant et simplificateur ; de l'autre, l'abolition, sous l'influence des thèses postmodernistes, de la ligne de partage entre histoire et fiction. Si l'on veut fonder solidement et rationnellement la responsabilité, scientifique, sociale et morale, de l'historien, sans retomber dans une approche moralisante ni verser dans une neutralité abstraite et sans vie, il convient, d'abord, de rappeler en permanence que la première mission de l'historien est une mission de vérité, en second lieu de marquer avec force qu'il existe un lien congénital entre histoire et valeurs. The transformations in the practice of the historian's craft, which are a definite feature of our times, proceed, among other causes, from the pressure of social demand, from the new role taken by the medias in the communications of knowledge, from the need of historicizing critically memory. Today two pitfalls are threatening : on the one hand, a return to a positivist brand, devoid of understanding and meaning ; on the other hand, under the impact of postmodernist theories, the deletion of the dividing line between history and fiction. In order to provide a sound and rationally established basis to the idea of a scientific, social and moral responsibility of the historian, without falling back either into a moralizing approach or an abstract and lifeless neutrality, two conditions are required : first, to recall ceaselessly that in history truth is and remains the first goal ; secondly to stress that a congenital connection unites history with values.<br>

Abstract: En étudiant les récits de vie des paysans roumains du Banat et d'Olténie déportés dans les années cinquante dans la plaine de Bǎrǎgan, nous avons essayé de mettre en évidence de quelle façon le récit de vie peut être un révélateur d'une réalité ethno-historique et anthropologique. Nous avons souligné le problème d'ordre méthodologique qu'une telle étude pose au chercheur. Dans un premier temps, nous avons discuté le statut discursif du récit de vie comme discours de témoignage, et les conséquences qui en dérivent pour son analyse comme texte narratif et argumentatif qui développe une rhétorique spécifique. Une description du contexte historique auquel font référence les textes, ainsi que des circonstances dans lesquelles l'enquête orale a été menée, nous a semblé nécessaire pour dégager l'importance du thème de l'identité et de la différence dans les récits de nos interlocuteurs. En analysant ce thème, nous avons tenu compte des constellations idéologiques et symboliques qui dominent ces développements dans le texte des critères que les paysans utilisent pour se différencier de l'Autre sous ses différents visages. L'analyse de ces facteurs suggère des pistes intéressantes pour déceler certaines mentalités et pratiques culturelles, surtout celles liées au foyer et à la famille et aux pratiques culinaires. Studiind povesteǎ vieţii a 70 de ţǎrani deporţati între anii 1951-1956 în Bǎrǎgan am pus în evidenţǎ problemele de ordin metodologic şi teoretic cu care se confruntǎ cercetǎorul dornic sǎ reconstituie o realitate istoricǎ, etnograficǎ şi antropologicǎ pornind de la mǎrturiile celor ce povestesc evenimentul deportǎrii.

Publisher: Sage Publications<br>

Author(s): Schnell Izhak<br>
Abstract: Within the last 2000 years the land demarcated by the Mediterranean Sea to the west and the Jordan Valley to the east has been one of the most disputed territories in history. World powers have redrawn its boundaries numerous times. Since the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948 within British Mandate Palestine, Palestinians and Israelis have disagreed over the national identity of the land that they both inhabit.The struggles have extended from the battlefields to the classrooms. In the process, different national and ethnic groups have used various sciences, ranging from archeology to history and geography, to prove territorial claims based on their historical presence in the region. But how have various Israeli social and political groups used maps to solidify claims over the territory? In this paper we bring together science studies and critical cartography in order to investigate cartographic representations as socially embedded practices and address how visual rhetoric intersects with knowledge claims in cartography. Before the 1967 war between Israel and its Arab neighbors, the Israeli government and the Jewish National Fund produced maps of Israel that established a Hebrew topography of the land. After 1967, Israel's expanded territorial control made the demarcation of its borders ever more controversial. Consequently, various Israeli interest groups and political parties increasingly used various cartographic techniques to forge territorial spaces, demarcate disputed boundaries, and inscribe particular national, political, and ethnic identities onto the land.<br>

Abstract: Le premier volume d'inédits de Levinas comprend un hommage à Bergson rédigé en 1946. Levinas voit en Bergson celui qui s'est opposé au temps de la science et des machines au nom du temps vécu ; ceci a rendu possible la conception heideggérienne du temps comme être. Levinas souscrit à la grande découverte de Bergson. Il souligne l'intérêt de la critique bergsonienne du néant comme être biffé, mais rejette la critique du désordre qui ne serait qu'un ordre différent ; pour lui, le désordre est le chaos préalable à tout ordre. Surtout, il voit dans la durée un temps fondamental, une diachronie première, qui rend possibles les trois dimensions du temps. Et il note que la durée est une vie que la mort ne limite pas ; le temps n'est pas la marque de notre finitude. Pour Bergson, seule la matière meurt, par manque d'énergie. Bien qu'il n'ait pas suivi la méthode bergsonienne, Levinas reconnaît la supériorité de l'analyse de la durée et la prolonge dans le sens d'un immémorial subjectif. The first volume of Levinas' unpublished texts includes a tribute paid to Bergson in 1946. Levinas considers Bergson as the philosopher who opposed the time of science and machines in the name of time experienced, and this in turn paved the way to Heidegger's concept of time as being. Levinas subscribes to that major insight of Bergson. He underlines the interest of Bergson's criticism of nothingness as « being scratched out », but rejects his criticism of disorder as but a different kind of order. For Levinas, disorder is the chaos preliminary to any kind of order. Above all, he sees in duration a fundamental time, a primary diachrony which makes possible the three dimensions of time. He remarks that duration is life not limited by death: time is not the mark of our finitude. For Bergson, matter alone dies, for lack of energy. While he does not follow Bergson's method, Levinas acknowledges the superiority of his analysis of duration and takes it further in the direction of immemorial subjec~<br>

Abstract: Europe is grounded, from all sides, in traces of old inter-state and ethnic conflicts. Experience has proved that they can still be re-activated in spite of various forms of resolution in the past. History is welcome in the present, and we can observe mobilisation among agents, populations of victims, or despoiled groups, which have been forgotten or forced into silence through post-conflictual issues. Various interest groups, political parties, or states, build up memorial resources that they incorporate in their actions list of historicist strategies, with the aim of 'recycling' the representations of the symbolic pasts into contemporary political games. These mobilisations meet the reconciliation trends coming from society (for example, informal groups, NGOs, and so on), or are taken in charge by national and international institutions – which are becoming more and more routine - especially under the influence of the circulation of 'good' models of the pacification of resentments, containing a highly normative tone. The question is to know whether, in spite of the apparent heterogeneity of this phenomenon, the historicist games do constitute a common indicator of the state of political regimes, especially democracies, and also of the strength of that supranational construction called the EU. This question necessitates the revisiting of the dominant concepts in the field of the political sociology of memory. The international circulation of reconciliation grammars, and the fact that memory issues are being torn out of their national frameworks and exploited in several arenas, both internal and external, in order to increase their yield of political resources, are further evidence that the paradigms heretofore dominant in the social sciences are now at an impasse.<br>

Article Title: Investigations into slum tourism in Mumbai: poverty tourism and the tensions between different constructions of reality<br>
Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i40050932<br>
Date: 1 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Meschkank Julia<br>
Abstract: The paper seeks to contribute to the recent slum tourism-debate. On the basis of an empirical field study conducted in Mumbai in 2009, this article investigates how Indian slums are observed by different actors within the communication context of this (emerging) form of tourism. Taking into consideration that slums are defined in public discourse nearly exclusively by poverty and sordidness, it is interesting to examine how the tour agency's objective of correcting the negative connotations of poverty is achieved. Accordingly, the study aims, by means of a second order observation, to observe how the tourists and the tour agency simultaneously perceive and charge poverty. Following the epistemological premise that reality is an observer-dependent construction, it seeks to outline which different images or realities of the investigated slum, Dharavi, are created by the different observations. The findings will then facilitate a discussion of the extent to which poverty can be defined as the dominant mode of observation of the slum tourism context as a whole.<br>

Abstract: Un análisis del modo en que se produjo la recepción de la obra de Bourdieu en Argentina supone necesariamente tomar en cuenta las características particulares del campo receptor en sus diferentes estadios sucesivos. Para contextualizar el caso argentino, se comienza describiendo las relaciones de Bourdieu con América Latina. Luego se aborda la recepción de los primeros trabajos traducidos en los ámbitos de la sociología y de la antropología social, en el marco de las peculiares condiciones por las que estos atravesaron a partir de su institucionalización en los años 50, así como los difusores iniciales del pensamiento de Bourdieu en Argentina. Finalmente, se describe la influencia de Bourdieu en la sociología y en la antropología social argentinas actuales. An analysis of the way Bourdieu's work has been received in Argentina necessarily involves taking into consideration the particular characteristics of the field of reception in its different successive states. In order to situate the argentine case in the appropriate context, the author starts by describing Bourdieu's relationships with Latin America. Then, the paper focuses on the reception of the first publications translated both in the fields of sociology and social anthropology in the peculiar conditions they endured since their institutionalization in the fifties, and on the first promoters of Bourdieu's thought in Argentina. Finally the author describes the influence of Bourdieu in current argentinian sociology and social anthropology.<br>

Abstract: Theodore Abel belonged before Talcott Parsons to the pioneers of "Weberians"' kind in America. In his Systematic Sociology in Germany the first systematic exposure of Max Weber's ideas in English appeared. Abel was the first to use Verstehen and Verstehende Soziologie in English literature. Abel also pioneered the research on the Nazi phenomenon. The manifestations of nazism and communist totalitarianism in the 20th century put the sociological theory and methodology to a critical test. Examining Abel's work as a case study, it is possible to see more clearly the ethical and methodological problems of the humanistic sociology—the "understanding" or interpretative one. The sense and implications of understanding in sociology still require greater clarity in order to better understand the understanding. Abel's diary sheds light on the methodological problems of his understanding research of nazism. The source of danger and ethical dilemmas of that discipline lies in the tradition of understanding sociology and Weber's method of ideal types connected with the principle of freedom from valuation. Also in that very tradition there are beginnings for development of its rightful cause and vocation. Provided, just like in Znaniecki's concept of humanistic coefficient, not only meanings but also valuations and social sentiments given in people's experience are taken into account. Full understanding cannot imply complete tolerance if meanings and values of individuals and groups are coupled with hate and other hostile feelings. Social feelings—hate and love (altruism)— constitute a sociologist's axiological system of negative and positive reference.<br>

Abstract: Multiculturalism is a term spreading in the West during the 1960s to indicate respect, tolerance and defence of cultural minorities. The idea of multiculturalism has become a collective imaginary ("all different, all equals"). It has generated a political ideology supporting an inclusive citizenship towards "different" cultures. After being adopted as official policy in many Countries, multiculturalism has generated more negative than positive effects (fragmenting the society, separating the minorities and fostering cultural relativism). As a political doctrine, it seems harder and harder to be put into practice. At its place, today we talk of interculturality. But this expression too seems quite vague and uncertain. This essay discusses on the possible alternatives to multiculturalism, asking itself whether the way of interculturality can be a solution or not. The Author's thesis is that the theory of interculturality has the advantage to stress the inter, namely what lies in between different cultures. But it does not possess yet the conceptual and effective means to understand and handle the problems of the public sphere, when the different cultures express cultural values radically conflictual between them. The troubles of interculturality result from two lacks: an insufficient reflexivity inside the single cultures, and the lack of a relational interface between the different cultures (between the carrier subjects). Modern western Reason created a societal structure (lib-lab) promoting neither the first nor the second one. In fact, it neutralizes them, because it faces the dilemmas of values inside the cultural diversities through criteria of ethical indifference. Such criteria set reflexivity to zero, preventing individuals to understand the deepest reasons of the vital experience of the others. Reason is emptied of its meaning and of its understanding capability. To go over the failures of multiculturalism and the fragilities of interculturality, a lay approa~<br>

Abstract: Los estudios sociales sobre alimentación y las autoridades responsables de este campo coinciden en resaltar la situación paradójica del comensal actual: se sabe cómo se debe comer pero no se come como se debe. Enfrentarse con éxito a las paradojas suele requerir un cierto distanciamiento —lingüístico y disciplinar— que ofrezca la suficiente perspectiva. Aquí se propone hacerlo desde la perspectiva histórica que una sociología de la utopía puede aportar al conflicto entre imaginarios alimentarios. Para ello, este artículo revisará los elementos comunes del pensamiento utópico/distópico en orden a extraer las categorías de mayor interés para un análisis sociológico de las políticas y comportamientos alimentarios. Después, recorreremos los modos en que algunas de las utopías clásicas han enfocado —o desenfocado— la cuestión de la comida e intentaremos sacar algunas conclusiones. Social studies on food and nutritional authorities coincide in emphasizing the paradoxical situation of the modern eater: people know how they should eat but do not eat as they should. Dealing with paradoxes successfully usually requires a certain —linguistic and disciplinary— distance to gain sufficient perspective. We suggest this should be done from the historical perspective that a sociology of utopia offers on the conflict between food imaginaries. To this end, we outline the common elements of utopian/dystopian thought in order to extract the categories of major interest for a sociological analysis of food policies and eating behaviours. Subsequently, we trace the ways in which some classical utopias and dystopias have focused on —or blurred— the question of food and we try to draw some conclusions.<br>

Article Title: THE DIALECTICS OF JAMESON'S DIALECTICS<br>
Publisher: Wiley Subscription Services<br>
Issue: i40063720<br>
Date: 2 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Jameson Fredric<br>
Abstract: This review essay attempts to understand the book under review against the background of Jameson's previous writings. Failing to do so would invite misunderstanding since there are few contemporary theorists whose writing forms so much of a unity. Jameson's book can be divided into three parts. The first and most important part deals with dialectics, the second with politics, and the third with philosophy of history. In the first part Jameson argues that dialectics best captures our relationship to the sociocultural and historical world we are living in. The second part makes clear that Jameson is not prepared to water down his own Marxist politics in order to spare the liberal sensibilities of his political opponents. In the third part Jameson develops his own philosophy of history, mainly in a dialogue with Ricoeur. Dialectics is his main weapon in his discussion with Ricoeur, and it becomes clear that the Spinozism of dialectics allows for a better understanding of history and of historical writing than does Ricoeur's phenomenological approach. The book is an impressive testimony to the powers of dialectical thought and to its indispensability for a proper grasp of historical writing.<br>

Abstract: Sammy Baloji, un photographe de Lubumbashi (République démocratique du Congo), exprime dans son art la nécessité pour les jeunes Congolais à reprendre le contrôle de leur avenir. Lorsqu'il photographie les paysages désindustrialisés, il souligne l'absence du travail industriel et des travailleurs. Plus tard, il y superpose des images d'archives. Son travail met en évidence la contribution des Africains à l'ancienne prospérité industrielle de la région, plutôt que l'apport colonial du capital et de la technologie. Restaurant la présence des premiers travailleurs africains (la génération de ses grands-pères), il souligne l'urgence de surmonter la désindustrialisation et l'exclusion ethnique pour maîtriser l'avenir. Through haunting pictures of the Katanga's (Democratic Republic of Congo) postindustrial land-scape, Sammy Baloji expresses the deep feelings of loss. His photographs make us see the absence of African workers. Later, archival images of migrant workers juxtaposed against the ruins of factories and mines evoke the former prosperity stressing African workers' contribution. Baloji suggests that true ancestors of local modernity are African migrant workers rather then colonial capital or technology. In Baloji's view his generation should confront the challenge of deindustrialization and of ethnic exclusion in order to regain control over the future.<br>

Abstract: Tout au long du XIXe siècle, l'autobiographie subit une mutation importante : elle voit apparaître, chez les autobiographes les plus connus comme les plus ordinaires, la narration de l'enfance. Dans ce siècle où naissent et s'imposent les sciences de la mémoire, l'enfance prend une place fondamentale dans la conception de l'individu, et pour tout autobiographe, « se connaître soi-même » signifie retrouver les souvenirs de ce premier âge de la vie. Mais là, il se heurte à une impossibilité : ces souvenirs sont enfouis. Apparemment disparus, ils doivent être sollicités, et lorsqu'ils se manifestent, ils échappent à tout ordre chronologique. Nous voilà donc face à des autobiographes qui croquent les plans de leur maison d'enfance, qui dessinent les lieux de leurs premiers souvenirs : l'ordre de la narration devient topographique. D'où vient cette « méthode » ? L'hypothèse présentée dans cet article nous mène vers les avatars modernes des arts de la mémoire et les fruits inattendus de l'éducation jésuite. Throughout the 19th century, the writing of autobiographies underwent a major change : authors, whether well-known or nor, wrote about their childhood. During this century when the « sciences of memory » came into being, childhood held a key place in the conception of the individual. For autobiographers, « knowing one's self » meant rediscovering memories from the first age of life. They thus encountered an impossibility: these memories are buried. Having apparently vanished, they have to be beckoned ; and when they come, they do not fall into chronological order. Autobiographers drew the layout of the houses where they grew up, or sketched the places to which their first memories were attached : the order of narration was topographical. Where did this come from ? The hypothesis presented herein leads us to look at modern avatars of the « arts of memory » and see it as the unexpected outcome of an education delivered by Jesuits.<br>

Abstract: Alors même qu'ils ne constituent qu'une petite minorité au sein du monde ouvrier et artisanal, les compagnons du Tour de France sont sur-représentés si on les considère du point de vue de la production autobiographique. À partir de ce constat cet article se propose d'examiner les conditions de formation de cette capacité singulière. L'examen de la dizaine d'autobiographies compagnonniques produites depuis le XVIIIe siècle permet ainsi de mettre en relief le fait que le compagnonnage, de par sa formule particulière, met en valeur parmi ses membres ceux qui savent conter, ceux qui savent écrire et ceux qui produisent des chansons. Ces trois types de mises en ordre de la vie et du monde invitent ainsi les compagnons qui en sont les maîtres à penser leur propre existence et, pour quelques-uns, à la mettre en texte. Although forming a tiny minority of workers and craftsmen, the Tour-de-France journeymen are overrepresented in the production of autobiographies. This observation serves as the starting point for examining the conditions underlying this peculiarity. The ten or so autobiographies written since the 18th century are used to show that this apprenticeship, given its specific form, valued those journeymen who knew how to tell stories, write songs or simply write. These three ways of setting life and the world in order led those who master them to conceive of their own existence and, for a few of them, to set it down in writing.<br>

Issue: i40069706<br>
Date: 12 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Fernández Germán Darío<br>
Abstract: I propose a few epistemological and methodological reflexions to account for intercultural daily communication. These reflexions emerged during a sociological research in Mendoza, Argentina, with Huarpes Indigenous students at the University of Cuyo. I observed that Indigenous people became quasi "ethnographers" of diverse environments. To make intelligible their classmates' behavior, and to account for their own behavior, Huarpes follow, in diverse environments and interactions, public rules of meaning. The objective of this paper is twofold: (a) to stress the methodological scope of ordinary communication and ordinary reasoning in order to study understanding between people from different groups and categories, and (b) to contest a kind of "pessimist" standpoint in social sciences and philosophy according to which the use of ordinary language reduces possibilities for understanding. Interviews, participant observation in natural situations, and a review of literature about language and understanding are the basis of this paper.<br>

Author(s): Adams Julia<br>
Abstract: How did cultural dynamics help bring about the societies we now recognize as modern? This article constructs seven distinct models for how structures of signification and social meaning participated in the transitions to modernity in the West and, in some of the models, across the globe. Our models address: (1) the spread, via imitation, of modern institutions around the world (memetic replication); (2) the construal, by socio-cultural forces and by state organizations, of the modern citizensubject (social subjectification); (3) the continual search for new meanings to replace traditional religious meaning-systems (compensatory reenchantment); (4) repeated attempts, in modern revolutions, to remake society completely, according to a Utopian vision (ideological totalization); (5) the cultural origins and social consequences of scientific and humanistic worldviews (epistemic rift); (6) the gendered politics of state formation (patriarchal supercession); (7) the invention and production of race in the colonial encounter (racial recognition). We explicate the models in reverse chronological order, because in our synthesis, we argue that the original modern break results from a dynamic combination of racial recognition, patriarchal supercession, and epistemic rift; these changes set the stage for the four other processes we theorize. In addition to our synthesis, we also consider, from a more neutral perspective, the kinds of causal arguments upon which these models tend to rely, and thus explicate the analytical undergirding for the application of any of these models to empirical research on transitions to modernity. Throughout the article, we consider how these models might, and might not, mesh with other families of explanation, such as the politico-economic.<br>

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i40072402<br>
Date: 8 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Ally Shireen<br>
Abstract: Despite its manifest, if largely undocumented, histories of menacing violence and perilous politics, the thrust of popular memory in the former apartheid bantustan of KaNgwane insists that it was a peaceful, even apolitical, place. In a contemporary South African memorial culture that idealizes memories of victimization by (and resistance to) apartheid and its political violence, why would some in KaNgwane persistently narrate the past through tropes of peaceful order and disavowals of the political? Are these mnemonic effacements in KaNgwane best conceived of as forms of forgetting? This article challenges such a proposition. First, it recovers the hitherto unrecognized politics and violence in KaNgwane, in part (and paradoxically) out of the very same narratives that deny such histories. Second, it explores the dialectical co-implication of remembering and forgetting, and of memory and history, in KaNgwane's supposed anamnesis. And third, it proposes that the occlusions and assurances of memory in KaNgwane are structured by a localized semiotics in which politics is retrospectively signified by order and restraint, and negated by disorder and revolt. In this ' memory work', KaNgwane's past is anaesthetized of violence, and heroism is recovered not from rehearsals of victimization and resistance, but from memories of pacified civility instead. Malgré son passé manifeste (bien que non documenté pour l'essentiel) de violence menaçante et de politique périlleuse, la mémoire populaire de l'ancien bantoustan de KaNgwane sous le régime de l'apartheid insiste, dans ses grandes lignes, sur le caractère paisible et apolitique du lieu. Dans une culture de mémoire sud-africaine contemporaine qui idéalise les mémoires de victimisation par (et de résistance à) l'apartheid et sa violence politique, pourquoi certains à KaNgwane persistent-ils à narrer le passé à travers des tropes d'ordre paisible et de désaveu du politique? Faut-il concevoir ces effacements mnémoniques au KaNgwa~<br>

Abstract: Focusing on the instrumental ensemble genre of nanguan, as played in contemporary Taiwan, I first discuss the experiences of ten musicians in entering this tradition to show changes in the learning environment over the past three generations. Second, I examine how beginners study singing prior to the acquisition of instrumental experience, looking also at the roles of memorization, enculturation and socialization. Meanwhile, in order to balance generalization and individuality, I use my personal experience as a case study to illustrate how learning processes develop from the day-to-day interactions of musicians.<br>

Abstract: The construction of a meta-discourse in order to describe interior monologues (IM) cuts across narratologic and linguistic approaches. It varies according to whether the purpose is to establish a typology based on their wider representation or to provide a linguistic analysis restricted to reported speech. The paper highlights the persistent under-rating of a phenomenon close to the IM, and related to the "unspeakable sentence", that of "the point of view". The represented "point of view" and the free indirect speech have coexisted since the second half of the 19th. However, unlike as in the IM, these forms are not clearly differentiated as dual forms of the expression of the inner speech. Consequently, inner speech (at least as a theory issued from literary experience) is reduced to the relatively homogeneous form of the "interior speech" or "flow of consciousness". But this representation is under the influence of enormous tensions as literary manifestations of inner speech are more varied than the phrase IM gives to understand.<br>

Abstract: O artigo é uma leitura do debate epistemológico sobre as condições de conhecimento na antropologia. Partindo das críticas que o próprío C. Geertz faz a seus seguidores, a autora se propõe a avaliar o potencial crítico da hermenêutica. Recupera seu questionamento acerca da oposiçâo sujeito/objeto e propõe a busca de uma objetividade negociada interpares e situada historicamente. A partir desse debate questiona-se uma ciência pura e sem implicações práticas e morais. O percurso que faz avaliando vários autores lhe permite concluir que o excesso de relativismo ou de subjetivismo transforma toda possibilidade de ciência em ficção. Para dar conta em sua etnografia dos sistemas simbólicos não lingüísticos, a autora busca um diálogo entre a teoría antropológica e as teorias nativas e afirma que é na experiência vivida em campo que está a fertilidade das perguntas e reformulações de conceitos da antropologia. This article is an attempt to interpret the epistemological debate concerning conditions of knoledge in antropology. Discussing the criticism which C. Geertz has made in regard to the work of his followers, the autor proposes to evaluate the critical potential of hermeneutics. A critique of the subject-object split opens the way for proposing a form of objectivity wich is historically located and negotiated among equals. This debate constitutes a point os departure for questioning the notion of a pure science devoid of moral and practical implications. In the course of discussing a number of authors, the conclusion may well be that excessive relativism and subjectivism transform all possibilities of science into fiction. In order to deal with nonlinguistic symbolic systems in etnography, the author sees the importance of dialogue between anthropological theory and native theory. Fertile grounds for raising questions and reformulating anthropological concepts are found in fieldword experience.<br>

Abstract: This study examines how deadlines and time limits for conference talks organize the discourse of consensus among collaborating experimental and theoretical physicists in a university laboratory. Six months of videotaped observations, including two cycles of conference talk preparation, indicate that, as the date of an upcoming conference nears, several things happen. (a) Co-authoring physicists usually have not achieved agreement on all aspects of the findings. (b) They nevertheless direct their energies to constructing a hybrid presentation rhetoric that satisfies the co-authors and fits the talk to the official conference talk time limit. (c) In the process of working through matters of rhetoric -- what to say, what to display visually, what to leave out, and in what order the information should be presented -- the physicists construct a working consensus on matters of physics: theory and experimental data explaining the properties and dynamics of the physical universe.<br>

Abstract: Butor's book corresponds to a transitory phase in the history of books, in which appear both a reflection on the nature of the book as object and a desire to introduce "fracture" and "mobility" within narrative. Three aspects are of principle interest: the relationship between the "mobile" text and its medium, the "book" as deconstructed by its writing; the importance of the text's visual aspect in a Mallarmean tradition which also resonates with the work of Calder and Pollock; the displacement of narrative towards litany and spatial forms which undo the usual métonymie links of the text. In toto, the book qua book appears as the locus for a conflict between destruction and re-creation, spatialisation and linearity, order and disorder, which prefigures computer hypertextuality.<br>

Abstract: Le long sillon tracé par Jean-Claude Coquet pour labourer le champ d'une sémiotique phénoménologique (qu'elle soit nommée « subjectale », « du continu », « continuiste », ou encore « des instances ») ne pouvait qu'être... sensible au sensible. À travers plusieurs interventions des dernières années (de l'ouvrage de 2007 sur le jeu de phusis et de logos jusqu'à une communication vénitienne de 2010), on cherche à discerner quelques vertus d'une telle approche : ce qu'elle permet d'entrevoir pour traiter la question de l'empêtrement, ce qu'elle autorise à penser de la problématique du kairos, et, dans le prolongement, ce qu'elle appelle à approfondir pour lire certain tableau de plate peinture. Jean-Claude Coquet has long dug furrows in order to prepare the field for a phenomenological semiotics (a semiotics variously dubbed "subjectal", "of continuity", "continuistic", or yet "grounded in its ' instances'"), and his endeavour could only be... sensitive to the sensible universe. Through a number of recent works (from the 2007 work on the play of Phusis and Logos to a talk in Venice in 2010), the virtues of such an approach are articulated: what it enables us to catch a glimpse of pertaining to certain issues regarding the question of entanglement (empêtrement), what it allows us to think about other issues pertinent to the problematic of kairos, and, going forward, what needs to be thought through in order to read a given work of plain painting.<br>

Abstract: Comment les études littéraires peuvent-elles utiliser les archives d'écrivains ? Si celles-ci peuvent constituer une source d'information sur la fabrique des œuvres, dans une perspective génétique, elles doivent aussi être considérées comme des documents que Ã on peut interroger pour mieux cerner à la fois le rapport de ces écrivains à leur mémoire, et, en filigrane, le fonctionnement de l'institution littéraire elle-même. À partir d'un travail sur les archives de l'Oulipo, il apparaît que les travaux issus de l'historiographie peuvent être réinvestis, dans le but de repérer comment certains écrivains transforment, plus ou moins volontairement, leurs documents en autant de monuments pour la postérité. How can literary criticism use writers' archives? If these need to be considered in a genetic perspective as a source of information regarding the processes of creation, they also need to be considered as documents containing clues regarding the relationship of writers to their memory and, in a minor key, to the literary institution itself. Work on the Oulipo archives shows that it is possible to revisit historiographical studies in order to work out how certain writers transform, more or less voluntarily, their documents into as many monuments for posterity.<br>

Author(s): SANTOS LAURA<br>
Abstract: Enquadrar de um modo filosófico, educacional e político a questão do "Testamento Vital" (ou "Diretivas Antecipadas de Tratamento") pressupõe não haver dúvidas sobre o seu conteúdo. Por isso, este artigo pretende, numa primeira parte, e atendendo às dúvidas existentes em Portugal, explicitar de que falamos quando falamos de "Testamento Vital". Só então seräo abordadas temáticas mais complexas que nos alertam para o facto de o "Testamento Vital" não ser um mero instrumento de regulação de vontades em relação ao fim de vida, mas remeter para economías específicas de verdade, valor e poder que pressupõem respostas distintas a perguntas fundamentais que o ser humano faz sobre si próprio: a sua suposta "natureza", a liberdade ou não de determinar o seu destino, o significado da tolerãncia ou o que é fazer e respeitar o "bem" dos outros. Finalmente, um último ponto tratará de uma problemática muito específica dentro do questionamento geral em torno do "Testamento Vital", que é a da autonomia prospetiva, pois esse "Testamento" visa determinar agora o que pretendemos que nos façam no futuro em termos de cuidados de saúde, caso estejamos na altura incapazes de decidir. Este último ponto será elaborado com base em reflexōes de Ronald Dworkin. In order to frame in a philosophical, educational and political way the issue of the living wilb (or Advance Directives of Treatment) we should assume that there are no doubts about their meaning. As this is not the case in Portugal, the first part of this article will address this question. Only then will we be confronted with more complex subjects, in order to develop the idea that living wilh are not just a mere instrument that regulate end-of-life issues, but involve specific economies of truth, value and power that imply different answers to fundamental questions that human beings put to themselves: their supposed "nature", their freedom to determine or not their destiny, the meaning of tolerance or what it means to do and to respect~<br>

Abstract: No encontro intercultural e inter-religioso não se converte cada interlocutor à cultura e religiosidade alheia, mas abrem-se ambos à escuta (anamnesis originária) do Mistério que garante a autenticidade da própria vivência espiritual. O resultado deste processo é a transformação das duas religiosidades que se fecundam mutuamente, passando por um caminho de autocrítica, diálogo e práxis em comum. A teologia católica deveria estar preparada para aproveitar este desafio do pluralismo religioso interactivo e deixar-se transformar; mas, para isso, teria que avançar mais na linha de renovação e revisão hermenêutica levada a cabo na segunda metade do século passado. In the inter-cultural and inter-religious encounter, each partner does not make a conversion into the other culture and religiosity. What happens is an opening (original anamnesis) by both of them toward the Mystery that guarantees the authenticity of their own spiritual experience. The result of this process is the transformation of both styles of religiosity that fertilize each other through an interchange of dialogue, self-criticism and common praxis. Catholic theology should be ready to make the most out of this challenge from the interactive religious pluralism and let oneself be transformed. In order to be able to achieve such transformation, Catholic theology should keep improving the hermeneutical turn achieved during the second half of the last century.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i40085908<br>
Date: 9 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Pestre Dominique<br>
Abstract: What I consider in this paper are various forms of government, various technologies and discursive regimes of government that are in common use today. What interests me are the categories and tools, practical dispositifs and languages that developed over the last decades 'to constitute, define, organize, and instrumentalize the strategies that individuals, acting freely, may use to deal with one another' (Foucault). The paper considers first the neo-liberal wish to reassert the individual as alone in responsibility for his/her own life after the unfortunate digression into Welfare Statism and Keynesian economics, source of all ills. It then focuses on some material and social technologies that encourage people to accept full and complete 'self-sovereignty'. This section leads to a discussion on the new demands (and resistance) society imposed on this liberal normative ideal. It notably considers the growing demands to 'participate' in decision processes and to be environmentally friendly. In section "Les Mots et Les Choses: A New Discursive Regime", it considers the discursive regime that progressively took shape and which currently permeates international governance bodies of all stripes—from the World Bank to the Conference of Parties for Climate Change. In the final section, it comes back to the initial question and considers what these changes actually mean for the democratic order as constituted over the past 250 years.<br>

Author(s): Visvanathan Susan<br>
Abstract: This paper attempts to compare two lives, that of Ramana Maharshi, the beloved cereberal sage of South India, and Sigmund Freud, the founding father of psychoanalysis. Much has been written on both these individuals, so what this paper does is to focus on affliction as a source of insight about life, detachment, pain, existentialism and coping. By taking narratives which delineate a historical plane on which illness can be coded, I try to understand the anthromorphic nature of suffering and its consequences in these two great lives. Individuals reflect the culture of which they are a part, so what we receive through the narratives which tell us about them is significant in terms of their similarities and their differences. Who authors narratives which we analyse is of utmost significance, and both feminism and narrative analyses looks at social anthropology as benefiting from the question of the writing subject. The Nirvana principle works in Ramana Maharshi's case to create a comfort zone for helping us to think of death as dream, in Freud it works as a comfort zone to cope with existence. Human beings work with ideas in order to evaluate the nature of life and survival, or with death as an attribute which too is natural and part of the order of reality. Paul Ricoeur's work helps me to build a bridge between the two thinkers, Ramana Maharshi and Freud, in terms of the application of the concepts of Eros, Thanatos and Ananke.<br>

Abstract: This essay examines the manner in which Peter Singer exceeds the boundaries of ethical reasoning in arguing his position on life ethics. Specifically, it probes a narrative aesthetic that functions as rhetorical proof in his work. Attention is given to demonstrating the presence of ironic aesthetics in this narrative. Thereafter two conceptual structures—consubstantiality and ironic catharsis—are elaborated in order to show how Singer uses irony in an attempt to shape audience attitudes toward the traditional life ethics position.<br>

Abstract: In the context of globalization, cultural anthropology gained a new momentum by highlighting the self-conscious persistence of cultural differences. Against the background of an ever increasing intensity of societal and economic entanglements, the vital claim of cultural differences must be a reflexive process associated with the idea that one's own culture is creative and adaptive to innovations. Anthropologists have defined a set of tools in order to describe these processes of cultural changes. These tools have the names of hybridization, creolization and domestication, but, in particular also of cultural appropriation. Historically cultural appropriation was mainly relevant in contexts of unequal power relations. Appropriation thereby became a strategy of the powerless, who used appropriation in order to undermine the structures defined by the powerful. Cultural appropriation can also be practised through mimesis, and thereby negates the authority of powerful actors. Cultural appropriation requires moments of negotiations and does not aim at definitive results, but merely at the transgression of boundaries. Well defined fields of cultural appropriation within anthropology are media studies and consumption. Empirical approaches to a more detailed documentation of appropriation can be the following: (1) Naming, (2) Contextualization, (3) Incorporation and (4) material transformation.<br>

Abstract: Norbert Elias never presented his views regarding collective memory in a systematic manner. However, his approach may be reconstructed on the basis of such works as The Civilizing Process, Time: An Essay and The Symbol Theory. The most important tenet of Elias is that human memory can only be explained by the symbol theory. Human ability to use socially created symbols in communication is applied in activities in which symbols are used (speaking, thinking, knowing and remembering), which makes memory a part of general process of symbolic communication. Memory research needs to account for the interactive and communicational origins of both individual and collective remembering. One of the crucial issues related to remembering is collective forgetting. According to Elias it operates by three main mechanisms: (1) elimination and creation of fantastic notions (fantasy being a substitute and subsidiary for experience), (2) modification of social canons of reference as a result of power struggle in social figurations, and (3) delegitimization of alternative imageries by means of marginalization or elimination of groups acting as their social vehicles. I discuss these mechanisms and the dynamics of memory they entail in the broader conceptual framework of the theory of civilizing processes referring to Central and Eastern European examples in order to demonstrate the productivity of Elias's interdisciplinary and multidimensional analysis in social memory studies focusing this region.<br>

Abstract: Re-reading Plato’s Ion as the first text in the hermeneutics tradition, the author finds two main streams. The first, based on reflection (rationality, logic, knowledge) stems from ocrates; the second, consisting in an affective approach (myth, art), stems from Ion. Both Socrates and Ion delimit this field of hermeneutics (legein peri or ‘speaking abouť) staying beyond its frontiers. Next, the author exploits the Socrates: Ion binary in order to interpret some key figures, trends, and schools within the whole tradition (rabbis, St Augustine, Pietism, Schleiermacher, Nietzsche, Dilthey, explication de texte, Heidegger, Gadamer, Peter Szondi, the Nitra School, and Ricoeur). Writers tend towards either the Socratic (explication de texte) or lonic wing (Nietzsche). There are, however, also writers who attempted to find the middle ground, a position offering both reflexion and intuition (Schleiermacher, Gadamer, and Ricoeur). The author concludes that the main challenge issuing from his interpretation is to remain close to a text, and resist any temptation to go beyond it.<br>

Abstract: The Republic of Korea and Japan share a tumultuous history, but arguably no period has caused greater trauma in bilateral relations than the twentieth century. After Japan's four-decade long colonial occupation of Korea, the two countries took two decades just to establish diplomatic relations. Subsequent interactions have remained seriously compromised by the memory of colonialism. This article reviews the tensions behind the tempestuous bilateral relationship, focusing on the depiction of Japan's wartime past in school textbooks. We advance three suggestions for reconciliation: viewing reconciliation not as the restoration of a harmonious pre-conflict order, but as an ongoing, incomplete process; expanding promising bilateral dialogues; and accepting that there will always be differences between Korea and Japan, most notably with regard to representations of the past. Rather than being an inevitable source of conflict, these differences should contribute to an ongoing process of negotiation between the two neighbors.<br>

Abstract: The article analyses the idea of Europe elaborated by the German philosopher Karl Jaspers. During the Twenties and the Thirties Jaspers criticized the supremacy of modern technology on society. After the Second World War he was interested in studying the development of European civilization and the foundation of a world order based on peace, freedom, democracy and mutual respect. With the partition of the world between Us and Russia, during the Cold War Jaspers proposed to build a confederation of the West against Russian totalitarianism. Making a first step toward an universal order, Europe had the important role of giving the fundamental values to it. L'article analyse l'idée d'Europe élaborée par le philosophe allemand Karl Jaspers. Au centre des réflexions politiques de Jaspers dans les années Vingt et Trente il y avait la crise de l'Europe et la critique de l'ère de la technique. À partir de l'après-guerre la pensée politique du philosophe s'était tournée vers l'étude de la civilisation européenne et la recherche d'un ordre mondial basé sur la paix, la liberté, la démocratie et le respect mutuel. Après le partage du monde entre l'Amérique et la Russie lors de la guerre froide Jaspers a proposé la confédération de l'Occident libre contre la menace totalitaire russe comme premier pas vers un ordre universel. Dans un tel processus l'Europe avait un rôle décisif: caractérisée par la rationalité et la liberté dialectique, la civilisation européenne était porteuse de valeurs fondamentales pour un futur ordre mondial.<br>

Abstract: After a popular uprising which led to the toppling of the authoritarian regime of Ben Ali, Tunisia has entered a period of transition towards democracy. But this period proves to be thorny, difficult and not bereft of huge challenges. But this is almost common to all transitions. This paper seeks to analyze other historical experiences of transitions towards democracy (in Latin America, Southern European countries, Eastern and Central European countries). The purpose is not to look for models to be reproduced in Arab countries, but to draw lessons from past experiences in order to avoid unforeseen traps, to shorten the period of transition, and to lessen the social and economic cost of uncertainty. Après un soulèvement populaire qui a permis de mettre un terme au régime autoritaire de Ben Ali, la Tunisie est entrée dans une phase de transition vers la démocratie. Cette phase s'avère épineuse, difficile et pleine de défis. Mais c'est le propre de toutes les transitions. Ce texte essaye dès lors d'analyser d'autres expériences historiques (en Amérique Latine, Europe du Sud, Europe centrale et orientale) de transition vers la démocratie, non pas pour rechercher des modèles à copier mais pour y puiser des leçons utiles susceptibles de faire éviter aux pays du printemps arabe les pièges imprévus, raccourcir la période de transition et diminuer le coût social et économique de l'incertitude.<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i40109964<br>

Author(s): Corradi Consuelo<br>
Abstract: A lively concern for new instruments of knowledge has led sociology, among other disciplines, to collect life stories in order to explore social phenomena. Dialogue and interpersonal communication thus become crucial tools, as well as loci of knowledge. This paper investigates the epistemological suppositions of 'the biographical approach': the quest for identity in the narrative, the dialogical relationship between the narrating self and the researcher, the fixation of speech into text and more. The overall effort of the investigation is to reach criteria of analysis which are not simply borrowed from other areas, but are the outcome of reflection upon the constituent features of life stories. This investigation, however, does not widen the gap between 'qualitative' and 'quantitative' sociology, but rather it contributes to put this division into question.<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i40110313<br>
Date: 1 1, 1992<br>
Author(s): Taylor Carolyn<br>
Abstract: This study suggests that political order within families is manifested in and constructed through family narrative activity. The study is based on a corpus of 100 family dinner narratives of two-parent American families. Our findings show that narrative roles (introducer, protagonist, primary recipient, problematizer of protagonists or other co-narrators, problematizee) differ in the control they exert and in their distribution across family members. Parents, especially mothers, tended to introduce narratives, thereby controlling narrative topic and timing. Children were the most frequent protagonists yet they rarely introduced narratives about themselves and were rarely ratified as preferred recipients of others' narratives. Fathers tended to be primary recipients, often orchestrated through mothers' introductions. Not coincidentally, fathers were also the dominant problematizers of family-member protagonists/co-narrators, assuming a panopticon-like role. Children sometimes resisted family narrative activity, suggesting a certain awareness of the politics of narrative and its potential to expose them as objects of scrutiny.<br>

Author(s): Frunzâ Sandu<br>
Abstract: Primo Levi's If This Is a Man is a central work in understanding the way in which the subjective memory of a Holocaust survival receives a general meaning. This requires a context in which the duty to prevent the repetition of the tragic events endured by European Jews becomes a universal responsibility we must assume. This text examines the process of dehumanization and total degradation of a human being in the conditions of the death camp, and examines the antidote that Levi proposes for escaping the state of existential pathology. Particular emphasis is placed on the way in which Levi, who embraces secular humanist values, uses religious background and religious symbolic structures in order to provide additional understanding of the fact that in the absence of God, the world itself becomes void of humanity.<br>

Abstract: This essay returns to the Dixie Chicks "incident" in order to reexamine the backlash against them. Their critics claim that patriotism and their contract with country music are at stake; I argue that the backlash is old-fashioned misogyny. My examination considers the concepts of prayer, patriotism, and the American Pledge of Allegiance. These words, though used loosely, are part of the central criticism of the Dixie Chicks actions. To accomplish my task, I turn, on the one hand, to Levinas and Heschel, and on the other to Hegel's reading of Antigone.<br>

Author(s): Raney Roslyn<br>
Abstract: Can fixed images tell a story; do autonomous visual stories exist? In order to answer this question, two categories of narrative images are considered: series like tapestries, which constitute together one narration, and on the other hand single paintings. Historical paintings representing a collectivity can suggest temporal evolution (like Poussin's Manna in the Desert) while those which represent one central hero must choose the "pregnant moment" of peripeteia (like Rembrandt's The Feast of Balthazar). The conclusion is that autonomous visual stories cannot be developed alongside existing verbal (literary) stories.<br>

Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113403<br>
Date: 4 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Ronen Ruth<br>
Abstract: Temporal concepts such as "order," "chronology," "narrative present," and "exposition" are extensively used in narrative theory. Accepted notions of time can contribute to our understanding of these concepts and can allow us to question their "temporal" meaning in the context of fictional narrative. Fictional time may be thought of as a system of relations unique to the fictional world after real time. Theories of narrative tend to adopt an essentialist interpretation of temporal concepts and to ignore the ontological divergence between time in fiction and time in reality. As a result, concepts such as "exposition" or "present" appear which appear to carry a direct "temporal" meaning, actually function in a way that indicates the nature of time in fiction. In fiction, temporal divisions and time segmentations do not just construct a temporal structure; they also mark degrees of factuality in the fictional world.<br>

Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113412<br>
Date: 10 1, 1992<br>
Author(s): Stampfl Barry<br>
Abstract: Narratology may be thought of as a complicated system of conceptual filters that enact a severe formalist reduction upon the corpus of what may be thought and said about storytelling. According to Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan, this reductiveness needs to be expanded in order to attend more to language. One way of answering to her reformist prescription is a turn to the study of linguistic surface structure organized as a meditation on the metaphor of the filter. For Seymour Chatman this metaphor designates a character through whom a narrator elects to tell a story. For Max Black, "filter" is a trope for metaphoric process. Examining these senses of the filter in Henry James's short story "The Beast in the Jungle" leads to emphasis upon negations and belief qualifiers. In James's story, both turn out to be invaded by the logic of Freudian negation, itself a type of intrapsychic filtration.<br>

Author(s): West Russell<br>
Abstract: This article seeks to give an account of the emergence of late modern subjectivity as it can be glimpsed in the workings of Wordsworth's long autobiographical poem The Prelude. The theoretical instruments of Luhmann's systems theory are implemented in order to analyze the historical emergence of modern individual subjectivity. Using the insights of systems theory, Wordsworth's text can be seen to elaborate a notion of 'bounded', 'autopoetic' subjectivity, whose aporia are the very basis for its self-perpetuation. It can be plausibly claimed that such aporia continue to further the systemic self-maintenance of individual subjectivity and its social narratives in their present-day manifestations.<br>

Publisher: Beauchesne<br>
Issue: i40117551<br>
Date: 6 1, 1986<br>
Author(s): RAULET Gérard<br>
Abstract: L'interprétation des derniers écrits de Horkheimer a suscité des controverses parfois violentes ; ils semblent en effet traduire la résignation, voire le désespoir, et marquer un retour à la théologie. Leur signification peut cependant être reconsidérée si l'on conçoit l'évolution de Horkheimer à la lumière du statut de la vérité dans la Théorie critique. La résignation, le pessimisme et la théologie provoquent-ils un changement de statut de la vérité qui autoriserait à distinguer deux Théories critiques ou ne peut-on voir dans la permanence de thèmes comme celui d'une vérité utopique et non représentable, de la nostalgie, de la dette envers l'humanité et dans l'usage du pessimisme les signes d'une continuité ? Il se pourrait alors que l'économie interne de la Théorie critique ait changé, mais sans rupture, et que ces thèmes aient constitué dès le départ un ressort essentiel du caractère critique de la Théorie critique. The interpretation of the last essays of Horkheimer has raised controversies and even polemics in so far as hopelesness, resignation and the turn back to religion seem to predominate in them. In order to reconsider this problem, Horkheimer's evolution will be interpreted here in the light of the definition of truth in Critical Theory. Do resignation, pessimism and theology involve a new definition of truth — so that one could speak of a second Critical Theory, or can themes like the utopical, nonrepresentable nature of truth, the nostalgy, the debt to humanity and the use of pessimism be understood as signs of a continuity in which the economy of Critical Theory may have changed but without any rupture between its early phase and the late works of Horkheimer and Adorno ? If this is the case one has then to show how Critical Theory could preserve its critical properties in a changed political and social situation.<br>

Author(s): LETH PALLE<br>
Abstract: Le texte récuse l'opinion selon laquelle la métaphore ne se paraphrase pas. La paraphrase est censée ne rendre que la référence, non le sens d'une expression. Afin de montrer que la paraphrase peut bien intervenir au sens d'une métaphore, le personnage fictif est invoqué comme paradigme pour la constitution du sens. L'entité de sens qu'est un personnage fictif ç est pas réductible à une expression unique, mais dépend de l'interaction au sein d'un réseau d'expressions différentes. Si le sens de la métaphore se constitue de manière analogue, force est de conclure que la reformulation ne relève ni de l'aplatissement ni de la distorsion, mais qu'elle est constitutive du sens. The paper argues against the common assumption that metaphors cannot be paraphrased. Paraphrase is assumed to capture only the reference not the meaning of an expression. In order to show that a paraphrase may well concern the meaning of a metaphor, the case of fictive persons is considered as a paradigm for meaning constitution. The meaning entity that a fictive person constitutes is not reducible to a single expression but depends upon the interaction within a network of different expressions. If the meaning of metaphors is constituted in an analogous way, it must be asserted that reformulations neither trivialize nor distort their meaning but constitute it.<br>

Abstract: On a souvent voulu voir dans l'herméneutique pré-heideggérienne une méthodologie des sciences humaines. Si l'idée remonte bien à la fin du xixe siècle, cette méthodologie herméneutique des sciences humaines n'a vraiment été élaborée de façon systématique qu'après Heidegger et en réaction à sa conception ontologique de l'interprétation, par le juriste italien Emilio Beiti (1890-1968). Sa pensée étant peu connue en France on présentera, à l'occasion de son centenaire, les idées directrices, mais aussi les limites, de sa théorie herméneutique. La symétrie des herméneutiques de Betti et de Gadamer sera soulignée : tandis que le juriste Betti trouve son paradigme de la compréhension dans l'activité contemplative du philologue, Gadamer, dont la formation est philologique, s'inspire du modèle juridique pour développer son herméneutique universelle de l'application. Preheideggerian hermeneutics has often being seen as an attempt to develop a methodology of the human sciences. If this project goes back to the later xixth century, this hermeneutic methodology of the human sciences was carried through for the first time after Heidegger, and against his ontological conception of interpretation, in the work of the Italian jurist Emilio Betti (1890-1968). This paper will present, on the occasion of his centenary, the main tenets as well as the limits of his hermeneutic theory. The symetry of Betti's and Gadamer's hermeneutics will be stressed : whereas the jurist Betti finds his paradigm of understanding in the contemplative activity of the philologist, Gadamer, whose formation was mainly philological, takes his inspiration from the juridical model in order to put forward his universal hermeneutics of application.<br>

Abstract: Objectivistic philosophy and reductionist theories have contributed to a malaise in society and the church. On the one hand, the fruits of modernity and deconstructive postmodernism have led to a situtation where the observable and the empirical are considered the true index of reality. There is a loss of purpose and meaning in life. The church finds itself in a situation of crisis, and needs to admit its own shortcomings in order to be a leaven for society. At the same time, there is an 'outbreak' of interest in issues of spirituality and mysticism throughout the world as the end of the millennium draws near. Mysticism, particularly scriptural mysticism, is an ecclesial charism, and when understood and appropriated can be a source of renewal for the church and society.<br>

Abstract: Since the early 1990s, the concept of historical consciousness has been central to didactic research in Sweden. It has mostly been used as a theoretical framework on a macro-level or as an attempt to identify students' historical consciousness. This article applies the theoretical concept of historical consciousness to tangible source material:history textbooks from the twentieth century. It focuses on whether Swedish history textbooks for lower secondary school have articulated contexts that may be conducive to developing historical consciousness. The article employs a number of theoretical concepts—narratives, multichronology, identity, and values—in order to analyze perspectives that can be utilized to trigger historical consciousness.<br>

Abstract: The author of the article in question reports on a study analysing how 15 year-old French lycée pupils interpret school texts about the representation of the Norman kings of Sicily in the 12th century, the latter of whom allowed themselves to be portrayed both as Byzantine emperors and as Muslim caliphs. Ever since Moscovic's theory of social representation, we know that people make sense of specialized knowledge (in this case, historical knowledge) by converting it into "naïve", everyday knowledge. As pupils generally cannot explain the political intentions of the kings of Sicily, the lycée pupils were asked – as part of the study – to deal with the assertions of a paper (written by another pupil) that compared the Norman kingdom of Sicily and the situation of Maghrebine immigrants in presentday France. The study takes a closer look at how the learners, in the course of the "spiral-shaped" learning process, first acquired a "naïve" picture of the kings of Sicily, only later to distance themselves from their original thoughts in order to be able to make sense of their school texts. Der Autor des vorliegenden Artikels berichtet über eine Untersuchung, die analysiert, wie 15-jährige französische Gymnasiasten Schulmaterialen über die Repräsentationen der normannischen Könige von Sizilien im 12. Jahrhundert interpretieren. Letztere ließen sich sowohl als byzantinische Kaiser wie auch als muslimische Kalifen darstellen. Seit Moscovicis Theorie der sozialen Repräsentationen wissen wir, dass Menschen Fachwissen (hier historischem Wissen) einen Sinn geben, indem sie es in ein „naives" Alltagswissen verwandeln. Da Schüler im Allgemeinen die politischen Intentionen der Könige von Sizilien nicht erklären können, wurden im Rahmen dieser Untersuchung Gymnasiasten aufgefordert, sich mit einer schriftlichen Schülerarbeit zu befassen, die das normannische Königreich von Sizilien und die Situation maghrebinischer Einwanderer im heutigen Frankreich vergleicht.

Abstract: The use of metaphor, transposed from small to large units of speech is analogical to the structuralist transfer of the laws of language organisation from units of levels below the sentence to units of an order above or equal to the sentence. The metaphor can be defined as a word in counterdetermining context. The unconventional contextual use of the metaphoric term creates a tension which can be explained in terms of the interaction view of metaphor. The metaphor functions as a contextual filter which selects, emphasises, suppresses and organises features of the principal subject by implying statements about it that normally apply to the subsidiary subject. The contextualisation of a text can be defined as a text in counter-determining context. The tension between text and contemporary context or discourse is reminiscent of the tension between vehicle and frame in the metaphor. The contextualisation functions as contextual filter of the text which selects, emphasises, suppresses and organises features of the context or discourse by implying statements about it that normally apply to the text in its conventional or original context or discourse. As an activity, the metaphor, as well as the contextualisation has socio-political significance since it is determined by the discourse of the reader or contextualiser.<br>

Abstract: Giuseppe Capograssi (1889-1956) was an important legal philosopher and had a lively influence on the development of legal studies. The centre of his reflections lay in his many investigations into the concept of experience, which aimed to supersede the prevalent orientation in Italy, focussed on vertexes, emphasizing instead the importance of practices, both on the theoretical level and in the analysis of legal activity and political reality. Capograssi therefore paid great attention to the relationship between state and society viewed in a dynamic and pluralist perspective. No less illuminating are Capograssi's investigations into the value of the constitution and the principle of legality. During the Fascist period, Capograssi upheld the values of individual liberty and democratic principles, seeing as indispensable the continual involvement of citizens in the development of political action. This perspective played a further, particularly important role in the "ideas of Capograssi", after the war and the advent of the republican legal order. According to Capograssi, more space needed to be given to social life and to the spiritual links on which political community is based. In this sense, Capograssi found the teachings of Catholicism fundamental. His Catholicism placed great emphasis on freedom and solidarity and contained a lively, underlying sense of the cultural and spiritual, inspired by the ideal of "charity".<br>

Abstract: L'article identifie une tension dans la représentation hayékienne des règles de droit. Alors qu'elles jouent une fonction essentielle dans la coordination au sein de l'ordre spontané en définissant les attentes légitimes des agents, Hayek ne développe pas réellement les mécanismes par lesquels émerge une interprétation partagée des règles. D'abord, les fonctions des règles de droit au sein de l'ordre spontané sont présentées. Puis nous montrons que les règles sont constituées par les attentes que les agents forment à leur propos. Enfin, nous montrons qu'aucun des deux mécanismes proposés par Hayek -le sens de la justice et le juge -n'est capable de garantir la résolution des conflits d'interprétation entre les individus. De tels conflits mettent en question l'efficacité et la justice de l'ordre spontané. The article focuses on a tension in the Hayekian representation of legal rules. While rules perform an essential function of coordination by providing common interpretation about the legitimate expectations, Hayek does not really develop the mechanisms by which common interpretations may emerge. Firstly, the functions of coordination of rules are presented. We show then that rules are constituted by individual meanings. Finally we show none of the two mechanisms producing shared interpretations, the sense of justice and the judge, is able to guarantee the resolution of conflicts of interpretation between individuals. Such a conflict questions therefore spontaneous order's efficiency and justice.<br>

Abstract: Cette contribution examine l'incertitude et le bouleversement des temps sociaux, à l'aune de l'unification des deux polices de Berlin, depuis la chute du mur, le 9 novembre 1989, jusqu'à l'unification allemande, au 3 octobre 1990. Berlin, à la fois communauté urbaine et Lana politico-administratif, a subitement vu deux polices sur son sol. Deux polices, deux histoires distinctes construites 40 ans durant, en opposition réciproque. Le temps fut décisif dans l'unification de ces deux polices, la seule qui ait contraint les agents à travailler effectivement ensemble, dans l'intimité des mêmes postes et des mêmes patrouilles. Le passé des institutions, appelé en résistance contre l'avenir, le présent des configurations politiques locales, mais aussi l'anticipation de l'avenir par les agents individuels et la temporalité propre de la police, son imbrication dans le quotidien, dans la routine de l'ordre public, toutes ces dimensions du temps ont absorbé la puissance de l'événement pour rendre l'impensable possible. This contribution examines the uncertainty and the social changes through the question of the Berlin two police forces'unification, from the fall of the Wall, November 9,1989, to the German unification at October 3, 1990. Berlin, at the same time urban community and political-administrative Land, suddenly saw two police forces on its ground. Two police forces : two distinct stories built 40 years during, in reciprocal opposition. Time was decisive in the unification of these two police forces, the only one which has constrained the agents to work indeed together, in the intimacy of the same stations and the same patrols. Past of the institutions, called in resistance against the future, present of the local political configurations, but also the anticipation of the future by the individual agents and the police force's own temporality, its overlap in the everyday life, the routine of the public order, all these dimensions of time absorbed the power of the event~<br>

Abstract: O plural e conflituoso entendimento da legitimação da pena no Direito, tem origem nas diversas intencionalidades que lhe conferem sentido. Neste artigo são analisadas as intencionalidades mais relevantes, destacando os seus modelos justificativos: retribuição, reparação, prevenção, expiação, reabilitação e restauração (precedidas pela vingança, extrajudiríca). Para melhor análise destes são também consideradas a variável da temporalidade (passado, presente, futuro) e a variável dos sujeitos, que protagonizam a dinâmica do castigo (infractor, víctima, Estado, sociedade). Depois, num momento comparativo, destacam-se criticamente as confluencias e as oposições. Assim será possível concluir que a intencionalidade restauradora e a sua firme relativização do castigo é aquela que melhor consegue articular as variáveis de sentido-com os seus valores-, a temporalidade e os sujeitos, pelo que se mostra ser a referência mais positiva para a legitimização. Contudo, dada a sua precaridade, devido ao seu surgimento recente, impõe-se reforçá-la reflexivamente e prácticamente. The plural and conflictual understanding of the legitimacy of penalty in law stems from diverse intentionalities that constitute their respective meanings. This article analyzes the most relevant intentionalities. It seeks to highlight the models that justifies them: retribution, reparation, prevention, atonement, rehabilitation and restoration (preceded by vengeance, extrajudirical). To better analyze these models, the variable of temporality (past, present, future) and the variable of the subjects are also considered in view of the fact that they operate in the dynamics of punishment (offender, victim, State, society). Then, establishing comparisons, the confluences and oppositions are critically highlighted. In order to conclude that the restorative intentionality and its strong relativization of punishment is the one who can best articulate the variables of meaning -with their values, involving temporalit~<br>

Abstract: In Britain, as in France, 'mainstream' anthropologists were hesitant to acknowledge studies within their own country as proper subjects for anthropological enquiry. British social anthropology defined itself as the study of 'other cultures' and became entrenched in a tradition in which Otherness was confused with manifest difference. This naivete, elevated into a scientific principle, precluded the recognition of 'self as anything other than a scientific instrument; but also led to the invention of a generalisable Other, and thereby ignored the complexity of variation within the cultures it studied. By the same token, it blinded anthropologists to heterogeneity within their 'own' local cultures as well, and was finally changed only by a series of related paradigm leaps. Our understanding of culture changed from a set of prescriptive influences which integrated society, to a ragged and non-systemic array of interpretive tools which aggregated society. Consequent upon this change, symbols were acknowledged as vehicles of expression and of negotiable meaning rather than as having stipulated and invariant referents. The demise of modernist theories liberated anthropology from its scientific illusions and positivistic pretensions, enabling it to acknowledge the personal and speculative nature of the enterprise. This admission of the subjective, of the anthropologist's self, was necessary in order to see Otherness as inhering in 'person' rather than in an abstraction such as 'culture' and, therefore, to be enabled to recognise diversity within cultures rather than merely between them. This enhanced perception of internal heterogeneity clearly places the Self of the anthropologist at the centre of the stage and has led to the contemporary debates about the nature of ethnographic writing and the status of ethnographic 'authority'. It has also had obvious consequences for anthropological research, including the raising anew of the relationship of individual to society; and t~<br>

Abstract: The article explores the implications of communist representations of history as it relates to representation and evidence in historical theory. It investigates the attempts of the party historians to establish a historical connection between the "counterrevolutions" of 1919 and 1956: as they argued, the counterrevolution that had been born in 1919 and ruled the country until 1945 and, subsequently, been forced "underground" by the Soviet Red Army and the new communist power, was able to "resurrect itself" once again in 1956. It examines how they attempted to authenticate this historical abstraction through various historical, mostly visual, records: photography, film and exhibitions. The article argues that an unusual attitude towards evidence prevailed in these historical works. Although communist historians boasted of referring to an abundance of original source material, their narrative frames of representation proved to be fictitious: sources were selected not in order to draw conclusions regarding historical processes, but instead to illustrate various pre-figured abstract constructions of history. The aim of this method was to maintain the separation of the empirical source base and the philosophical-theological imagination surrounding the meanings of history in order to unbind the latter from evidence and tie it to political ideologies and commitments.<br>

Abstract: A religião é uma enorme projeção de significações humanas. Estas projeções convertem-se, para os seus produtores, na forma de uma realidade de ordem transcendente. De acordo com Peter L. Berger a alienaçāo religiosa é antropologicamente necessária. A partir da fenomenologia da religiāo, cosmos sacralizado em que se constitui toda e qualquer concepçāo do mundo, faz da religiāo um âmbito de estudo para elucidar os mecanismos complexos de sentido e significado da vida humana. Rudolf Otto e Mircea Eliade sāo os fenomenólogos que mais influenciaram o pensamento de Peter L. Berger. Religion is largely a projection of human meanings. These projections are converted in the form of a reality of transcendent order back to their very authors. According to Peter L. Berger religious alienation is anthropologically necessary. From the Phenomenology of Religion, the sacralized cosmos in which any conception of the world is formed makes religion a field study to elucidate the complex mechanisms of sense and meaning of the human life. Rudolf Otto and Mircea Eliade are the phenomenologists that most influenced the thought of Peter L. Berger.<br>

Abstract: Tamburlaine's insistence on making his audience see his sovereign power is a means by which he can organize and control alterity by fixing himself in specular relation to his objects. As the palpable reflections of his identity, Tamburlaine's sights of power produce effects of dramatic literalization by which he can maintain his unified and stable position as sole emperor: the play orders its field of vision by constructing an imaginary subject in fixed relation to its objects. The play, to the extent that it posits stable links between a subject and its images, and between signifiers and signifieds generally, creates a delusional space in which absolute sovereignty becomes possible. The effects of sovereignty, however, continue to define not only the theatrical space of the play, but the space of interpretation as well: critics have tried to account for the contest between aspiration and limitation in Tamburlaine by invoking concepts of theme, genre, character, and author in order to make sense of and therefore stabilize the play's conflicting gestures. Like Tamburlaine, the critic constructs an imaginary space by creating objects in relation to which he can confirm his own unity and power. Tamburlaine thus becomes a figure for the claims of sovereignty that mark all acts of interpretation.<br>

Abstract: Examining the coverage in seven major Japanese and Taiwanese daily newspapers of a selection of events involving both societies in the first decade of the twenty-first century, this paper investigates the phenomenon of rhetorical instrumentalization of the past for present ideological purposes. The concerns of this study are the processes of dehistorization in Japanese and Taiwanese news and public debate, and through a critical thematic reading of the sources I argue that a motif of Taiwanese repetition and imitation of Japan runs through all the studied cases as a basic narrative formula. Analyzed cases include news presentations of Taiwanese politicians visiting Japan, controversial statements on Taiwan by a Japanese cabinet minister, infrastructure developments in present-day Taiwan and the controversy surrounding a Japanese guidebook to Taiwanese prostitution. Throughout the material, Taiwan is pictured as ideally progressing along a trajectory marked out by Japan and the two are cast in fixed roles that recall their relative positions in the half-century of Japanese colonization of Taiwan: Japan teaches Taiwan order, unity and modern development and Taiwan studies Japan's past to overcome the challenges of its own present. Or Taiwan spontaneously imitates Japanese precedence as a consequence of its own development. This paper fundamentally challenges the rationale underlying strategic instrumentalization of the past and draws critical attention to the paradoxical fact that the use of the repetition formula positions the covered news events in a thematic field of time-lag and retrospection.<br>

Abstract: La 'démonstration' présentée dans Rhet. Her. 4,68 est le point de départ pour une étude qui vise à souligner comme traits qui lui sont propres la complémentarité de ενάργεια et de ενέργεια. À ce propos on prend en considération l'une après l'autre ces deux notions et les textes des auteurs anciens où l'on peut mieux comprendre leur nature et leur fonction à l'intérieur d'un discours. Après avoir mentionné les définitions de Γένάργεια données par l'Anonyme de Seguière et par Denys d'Halicarnasse et après avoir souligné la différence entre ενάργεια et σαφήνεια on s'attache à examiner quelles sont les conditions qui permettent au locuteur de 'mettre sous les yeux' des auditeurs ce qu'il dit. À l'importance des détails mentionnée par les différents auteurs s'ajoute en fait l'effet suggestif de ce que les Grecs appelaient φαντασίαι et les Latins visiones. On se penche donc sur les textes de Quintilien et de l'auteur du Sublime qui en traitent longuement et on met en relief le rôle joué à ce propos par Γένέργεία des faits, c'est-à-dire par leur façon d'être 'en acte'. Une fois cette notion éclaircie à l'aide de la Métaphysique et de la Rhétorique d'Aristote on conclut cette brève recherche par la mention du niveau le plus haut que l'évidence rhétorique peut atteindre : l'effet émotionnel du couple ενέργεια - ενάργεια qui pousse les auditeurs à se voir, eux-mêmes, sur la scène. The "demonstration" presented in Rhet. Her. 4,68, is the starting point of a study which aims at underscoring as specific features of the demonstration the complementarity of enargeia and energeia. In order to suit our purpose, we have examined one after the other those two notions and the texts of ancient writers in which we can better apprehend their nature and function within a discourse. After mentioning the definitions of enargeia given by the Anonym of Seguière and Denys of Helicarnassus, and after having underscored the difference between enargeia and energeia. we go on to examine the conditi~<br>

Abstract: Selon un débat ouvert dès le Ve siècle avant notre ère et cristallisé par les réflexions d'Aristote dans la Poétique, l'enquête historique serait tenue de rapporter ce qui a lieu ou a eu lieu, dans le temps sans limite et indéfini des hommes, accumulant des faits particuliers. Le projet des historiens serait-il de s'épuiser à dresser ainsi un infini et impossible "inventaire du monde" ? Dans le contexte des cités, la prose historique et le périple géographique correspondent à de nouvelles formes d'enquête et proposent des mises en ordre du savoir inédites. Leurs auteurs s'interrogent sur leurs capacités démonstratives et sur les moyens de parvenir à une "vue d'ensemble" (Polybe) des "événements qui surviennent du fait des hommes" (Hérodote), que l'objet d'étude porte sur une très courte période, comme chez Thucydide ou concerne l'ensemble du "monde habité", dans la Géographie de Strabon. Cette étude analyse, notamment à partir des termes άνθρωποι et οικουμένη, comment ces auteurs répondent à un des défis de la narration historique et de la description géographique qui consiste à inscrire la généralisation dans le cadre du particulier. According to the debate opened up as early as the Vth century before our era and condensed by Aristotle's reflections in the Poetics, historical enquiry would be bound to account for what does or did take place in men's limitless and indefinite time, thus piling up particular facts. Would the historians' goal be to exhaust themselves in thus drawing up an endless and impossible "inventory of the world" ? In the context of the cities, historical prose and geographic circumnavigation correspond to new forms of enquiry and propound unheard of ways of setting knowledge into order. Their authors inquire into their demonstrative abilities and the means to obtain "a general view" (Polybius) "of the events that happen through men's agency" (Herodotus), whether the subject under study bears on a very short period, as with Thucydides, or concern~<br>

Abstract: Ethnomethodology captures ordinary events in ways that retain their dynamic and collaborative character. Ethnomethodologists identify people's methods for developing a practical objectivity that can render their local affairs meaningful and orderly, and they closely scrutinize the local details of mundane affairs in order to describe how a local cohort of cooperating parties concert themselves in providing an intelligibility for their social interaction, local work that is naturally occurring and depends upon the reflexive character of any emerging sense.<br>

Abstract: La revue Christianisme social (1896-1971) était l'organe de la Fédération française du Christianisme social, mouvement protestant d'action sociale orienté vers un socialisme chrétien. De 1954 à 1962, elle a vigoureusement pris parti contre la poursuite de la guerre d'Algérie et pour le rétablissement de la paix au moyen d'une négociation avec le F.L.N. Elle a joué le rôle d'une avant-garde par rapport à l'opinion publique protestante, mais sans oser se transformer en parti de la gauche protestante afin de sauvegarder son unité. Son engagement combinait des motivations fondamentalement morales et spirituelles (refus de la torture pratiquée par la police et l'armée françaises) et une analyse politique attribuant au colonialisme français la responsabilité du conflit. Rejetant le principe révolutionnaire du « la fin justifie les moyens », ses rédacteurs appartenaient aux catégories d'opposants à la guerre que Pierre Vidal-Naquet a qualifiés de « dreyfusards » et de « tiers-mondistes ». Mais une étude historique rétrospective doit constater que l'objectivité de leur vision de la guerre d'Algérie a été en partie biaisée par leur parti-pris. Christianisme social (1896-1971) was the main press organ for the Fédération française du Christianisme social, a protestant social action movement leaning toward Christian socialism. From 1954 to 1962, this magazine strongly condemned the pursuit of the Algerian war and called for establishing peace by negociating with the F.L.N. It played an avant garde role for Protestant public opinion without daring setting itself up as the Protestant left party in order to maintain its' unity. This magazines mission combined basically moral and spiritual motivations (refusing torture practised by the French police and army) and a political analysis placing responsability for the conflict on French colonialism. Having rejected the revolutionary principle "The end justifies the means", its' writers belonged to the war opponents that Pierre Vidal-Na~<br>

Publisher: Taylor & Francis<br>
Issue: i40150967<br>
Date: 1 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): MOORE ALLAN F.<br>
Abstract: This article develops a theoretic base for the hermeneutics of spatialization in recorded popular song, drawing from work in ecological perception, cognitive linguistics, proxemics and some music semiotics. It uses this base in order specifically to observe a range of uses of the deictic expression 'here' in the lyrics of popular songs, and from this observation to construct a typology. It draws from a very wide range of Anglophone genres, stretching across most of the previous century and beyond, exploring the varying extents to which the music that encompasses such lyrics helps to fix a type of location indexed by 'here'. Such an exercise forms part of a larger programme to establish a grounding that permits a reasoned response to Ricoeur's call to interpret the text by means of disclosing a 'possible way of looking at things'.<br>

Abstract: Au lieu de soi marque un Haut Lieu du soi. Dans cette perspective, la hauteur du sujet s'acquiert par la verticalité (transcendance), et non pas uniquement par l'horizontalité (immanence). Interrogeant l'ambition d'une approche de saint Augustin du point de vue de saint Augustin lui-même, on montrera d'abord le mérite d'un tel renouvellement dans le cadre de la philosophie comme telle : la question de l'homme, le poids du soi, et le statut de l'èros. Une noble « disputatio théologique et phénoménologique » cependant naîtra dans la confrontation avec d'autres ouvrages (en particulier Dieu, la chair et l'autre. D'Irénée à Duns Scot [PUF, « Épiméthée » , 2008]) : doit-on nécessairement « dépasser » la métaphysique dans un tiers ordre, ou ne convient-il pas plutôt de la « transformer de l'intérieur » dans le geste que semble avoir accompli le Docteur d'Hippone lui-même ? Il en va ici du statut de la philosophie dans son rapport ci la métaphysique et à la théologie, mais aussi de la possibilité d'une « nouvelle pratique phénoménologique de la philosophie médiévale », pour aujourd'hui comme pour demain. In Place of the Self marks what we might call a « high point of the self ». From this exalted perspective the measure of the subject is taken in its verticality (transcendence) and not simply its horizontality (immanence). Jean-Luc Marion approaches St. Augustine from the point of view of St. Augustine himself, and in this article I show first the merit of such an approach within a philosophical framework, its relevance to topics such as the question of man, the burden of the self and the status of eros. A significant « theological and phenomenological disputatio » does, however, arise when In Place of the Self is put up against other works (in particular against God, the Flesh and the Other : from Irenaeus to Duns Scotus [PUF, « Épiméthée » , 2008]). Do we have to « overcome » metaphysics by moving to another order of analysis ? Is it not better to work from the inside, i~<br>

Abstract: Based on the concrete example of Atarjea (Guanajuato), here I discuss the link between memory and history, including experience, subjective burdens, and future projections made by the subjects themselves as part of this link. I argue that for local campesinos, this implies a moral position that transcends the politically utilitarian selection of certain recollections, involving aspirations to order and conservatism opposed to the agrarian and environmentalist projects currently promoted by the Mexican government.<br>

Abstract: Une réflexion générale sur les concepts linguistiques de diachronie et de synchronie pourrait permettre de porter un nouvel éclairage sur l'herméneutique des textes bibliques. La première partie de cet article décrit donc la genèse et l'évolution de la fameuse dichotomie saussurienne, et son incidence dans l'interprétation des textes. Dans une deuxième étape, les deux catégories de Saussure sont confrontées à d'autres perspectives qui permettent de dépasser la tension entre synchronie et diachronie textuelles, notamment l'approche de Guillaume (endochronie), celle de l'herméneutique antique (métachronie) et celle de la pragmatique (autochronie). Cette comparaison débouche sur une réévaluation de la perspective saussurienne en vue de l'étude du signifié, et notamment de celui des textes bibliques. A consideration of the linguistic concepts of diachrony and synchrony could lead to a greater understanding of Biblical hermeneutics. The first part of this article discusses the origin and the evolution of the well known Saussurian dichotomy, as well as its influence on textual interpretation. In the second part the two Saussurian perspectives are compared with other categories allowing us to go beyond synchronie and diachronie textual opposition: those applied by Guillaume (endochrony), by the first to comment on literary texts (metachrony) and by a pragmatic approach (autochrony). Such a comparison permits us to make a new appraisal of the two Saussurian perspectives in order to achieve a better analysis of the signified, especially with respect to Biblical texts.<br>

Abstract: Sacred music has always been a source of controversy throughout history since it is an integral part of the liturgy. Contemporary Christian music (CCM) has reached a pinnacle of controversy as its realm of consumption expands globally and inter-denominationally. This study was inspired by the idea of Ricoeur's phenomenology of religion to examine the contemporary practice of liturgy and sacred music. This brings into discussion the historical controversy and cultural milieu of adopting popular culture into youth ministry. Korean case is important because Korea represents one of the strongest Christian populations in the world and at the same time challenges - a drop in the number of young members and a huge generational gap in its church congregations. In order to scrutinize the concrete process of youth culture in the Christian community, an empirical study of youth ministry in seven mega churches in Seoul in South Korean was conducted as a case study. Sakralna glazba oduvijek je tijekom povijesti bila izvor kontroverzi jer predstavlja integrálni dio liturgije, a povijest glazbe je iz nje izrasla. Suvremena kršèanska glazba dostigla je vrhunac kontroverzije kad se njezino potrošaèko podruèje proširilo globalno i medukonfesionalno. Ovaj je članak nastao na temelju Ricoeurove fenomenologije religije i nastoji ispitati suvremenu praksu u liturgiji i sakralnoj glazbi u svjetlu nasljeda povijesne kontroverze i kultúrne sredine u prihvaćanju populárne kultúre u mladenačkoj službi božjoj. Teologija glazbe, o kojoj su raspravljali u 16. stoljeèu Luther, Zwingli i Calvin, osobito je korisna za konzultiranje pri suvremenom prilagodavanju na populárnu kulturu u crkvi. Štoviše, humanizam usaden u liturgijsku reformaciju u razdoblju renesanse otvára filozofijsko pitanje čovjekova identiteta pred licem božanskoga, o èemu se raspravljalo tijekom moderne i postmoderne povijesti sve do danas. Kako bi se pažljivo ispitao konkrétni proces mladenačke kulture u kršćanskoj zajednici, pr~<br>

Abstract: If nations are "imagined communities" as many theorists like to define them, then they need an ideology to create a cohesive imagination. In modern times, the project of writing "history" has been an important instrument in the service of this ideological purpose of justifying and reproducing the modern nation-state as the predestined and legitimate container of collective consciousness. School textbooks, at least in South Asia, have long been among the most exploited media for the presentation of the history of the national collective. This essay is a study of school textbooks in Bangladesh. It looks at narrative representations of selected episodes from the past, both pre- and postindependence, in order to reflect on how they construct "history". Through this work I endeavor to relate textual images to issues of community relations and identity by identifying and sharing the ways in which the audience for nationalist discourse is created, nurtured, and secured through symbolic means.<br>

Abstract: Dans la philosophie d'Emmanuel Lévinas, la réflexion éthique s'appuie en grande partie sur une analyse du temps. Ainsi la rencontre d'autrui se vit comme une rupture radicale, qui s'exprime temporellement par le surgissement d'une dimension eschatologique au cœur de l'histoire, brisant la continuité de celle-ci. C'est le développement de ce motif eschatologique dans l'œuvre d'Emmanuel Lévinas que la présente étude entend retracer, afin d'en dégager toute la portée et l'originalité. Rompant avec toute forme de téléologie, c'est la notion même de sens que Lévinas renouvelle. Il s'agira cependant d'évoquer également certains problèmes posés par une telle conception. Peut-on retrancher de l'eschatologie toute dimension d'utopie? In the philosohy of Emmanuel Lévinas, ethical reflection is largely based on an analysis of time. Encounter with others then is a radical break, expressed temporally by the springing up of an eschatological dimension at the heart of history, interrupting is continuity. The present study intends to trace the development of this eschatological motif in the work of Emmanuel Lévinas, in order to show all its scope and originality. Breaking with all forms of teleology, Lévinas renews the very notion of meaning. Certain problems raised by such a conception, however, must also be mentioned. Can all of the utopian dimension be cut off from eschatology?<br>

Abstract: Nous montrons ici que le rejet de l'identité par Wittgenstein s'appuie sur la contestation du principe de causalité, doublé d'une conception pragmatique de la personne. Dans son rejet de la causalité la position de Wittgenstein ressemble fortement à celle de David Hume. Pour parvenir à une conception pragmatique de la personne on analysera l'usage linguistique et grammatical qui régit l'identité personnelle. Chez Wittgenstein le concept de personne se définit par rapport au contexte actionnel. Here we show that Wittgentstein's dismissal of identity is dependent on the disputing of the principle of causality, reinforced by a pragmatic concept of personhood. In his rejection of causality, the position of Wittgenstein resembles that of David Hume. In order to get to a pragmatic idea of personhood, linguistic and grammatical usage of the terms defining personal identity is analysed. For Wittgenstein, the idea of personhood is defined in relation to the actual context.<br>

Abstract: Dans cette étude je poursuis deux objectifs: d'une part, je tente d'établir d'un point de vue théorique les tenants et aboutissants de la question de savoir si le pardon entre deux communautés est possible; d'autre part, j'examine les obstacles et les dangers d'un tel pardon. En ce qui concerne le premier objectif, je fais appel à Hannah Arendt qui nous a donné dans La condition de l'homme modeme une définition du pardon que j'applique aux relations entre communautés. Afin d'examiner les problèmes d'un pardon inter-communautaire, je usage du roman de J. M. Coetzee, Disgrâce, qui offre à mon sens une illustration de ce qu'un tel pardon entraînerait. La situation que décrit Coetzee, et a laquelle je me réfère également, est celle de l'Afrique du Sud après l'apartheid. In this study, I have two aims: one, from a theoretical viewpoint, I try to establish the ins and outs of the question whether pardon between two communities is possible; secondly, I examine the obstacles and dangers of such a pardon. For the first, I refer to Hannah Arendt, who gives us, in The Human Condition, a definition of pardon, which apply to the relations between communities. In order to examine the problems of intercommunal pardon, I use the novel by J. M. Coetzee, Disgrace, which offers, according to me, an illustration of what such a pardon entails. The situation described by Coetzee, and to which I also refer, is that of South Africa after apartheid.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricœur construit la philosophie comme une hétérotopie, en la soumettant à l'ordre, juridique et théologique, d'un «aveu». En soustrayant la pensée à la compétence première de la philosophie pour l'accorder à l'ordre d'un récit, Ricoeur fait de l'exercice de la philosophie une «empirique de la volonté serve». Ce primat donné à un ordre de médiation, par le biais d'un récit, dépouille ainsi la philosophie de toute tâche inaugurale. Dans ses Valences of the Dialectic, le philosophe américain Jameson est revenu de façon critique sur ce montage, soulignant le paradoxe qui oblige Ricœur à ôter la pensée du temps des tâches premières de la phénoménologie. Cet article vise à en exposer les conséquences (notamment le basculement vers une herméneutique), pour interroger les effets théologico-politiques de ce vaste projet. Paul Ricoeur constructs philosophy as a heterotopia, in subjecting it in the order of a juridical and theological «confession». By subtracting thought from the primordial competency of philosophy in order to link it to a story, Ricoeur displays the primacy of a third party. In his Valences of the Dialectic, the American philosopher Jameson has reviewed this assemblage, underlining the paradox which thus obliges Ricoeur to pull out an idea from the time of the first tasks of phenomenology. This article tries to lay out the consequences (notably the swinging towards hermeneutics), so as to question the theological-political effects of this vast project.<br>

Abstract: Tout au long de son œuvre, Henri Bergson s'est penché sur le temps du vécu qu'il nomme «durée», une notion qu'il a, des années durant, cherché à cerner. Du point de vue de l'énonciation de sa pensée surgit une difficulté: comment mettre des mots sur une notion qui a pour caractéristique d'échapper aux schèmes de penser habituels, de se soustraire aux filets du logos ? Si, comme il le souligne, «[l] a pensée demeure incommensurable avec le langage», il se doit d'ouvrir une nouvelle voie pour formuler malgré tout sa pensée en faisant appel à des ressources langagières proprement inhabituelles, voire étrangères à la philosophie. Pour dire le temps, le philosophe se doit de briser les cadres de la pensée conceptuelle. Ainsi, l'emploi de la métaphore, habituellement ressource du langage poétique, devient sous la plume du philosophe français un outil privilégié du philosopher, transcendant les concepts pour atteindre qu'il nomme l'intuition de la durée immanente à chacun de nous. In all his writings, Henri Bergson sought to define worked the notion of time lived, which he called duration. In the enunciation of his thought, emerges a difficulty: how to put words to a notion which characteristically escapes habitual schemas of thought and logical traps? If, as he claims, «thought remains immeasurable by language», we need, nevertheless, a new way to formulate his thought by calling upon unusual or even un-philosophical linguistic resources. In order to speak of time, the philosopher must expand the framework of conceptual thought. Thus, the use of metaphor, normally a poetical resource, becomes in the writing of the French philosopher an excellent tool for philosophy, going beyond the concepts in order to reach what he calls the immanent intuition of duration which each one of us has.<br>

Abstract: A quelles conditions la théologie peut-elle se fonder comme théologie interprétative selon le vœu de Claude Geffré (La théologie au risque de l'interprétation) et d'Eberhard, Jüngel (Dieu mystère du monde) ? Réponse: elle doit demander concepts et méthode à une philosophie de l'interprétation. Pour surmonter la « crise de la métaphysique » (Nietzsche, Heidegger) ; ensuite pour fixer les principes de l'interprétation, garantissant l'historicité, la transcendance personnalisée et l'Amour de Dieu. Si une herméneutique (de Dilthey à Gadamer et à Ricœur) n'y suffit point, l'A. renvoie à sa proposition philosophique de « l'Inlégralisme » (cf. J. Granier, Le discours du monde), avec sa théorie de l'Intégral et du transréel, son analytique de la praxis sociale et son anthropologie « égotiste ». Under what kind of conditions can a theology be founded as an interpretative one, as suggested by Claude Geffré (La Théologie au risque de l'interprétation) and Eberhard Jüngel (Dieu mystère du monde) ? Answer: it is obliged to demand concepts and method from a philosophy of the interpretation. In order to overcome the "crisis of metaphysics" (Nietzsche, Heidegger) ; in order to determine the principles of the interpretation, which are able to guarantee the historicity, the personalized transcendency and the Love of God. If a hermeneutics (from Dilthey to Gadamer and Ricœur) is not enough, the author refers to his philosophical proposition of "integralism" (cf. J. Granier, Le discours du mondes), with its theory of the Integral and of Transreal, its analytics of the social praxis and its "egotistic" anthropology.<br>

Abstract: Le symbole opère en signifiant et signifie en opérant. Pour fonder plus tard ce propos philosophique, il convient de revenir sur trois débats qui ont contribué à résoudre le sens du symbole dans l'éthique : la scission du symbole d'avec le signe, sa reprise dans le langage, son expulsion du sacré. Si l'on est conduit à redéfinir les droits, mais aussi les conditions et les modes d'une ontologie du symbole, on ne saurait négliger ce qui rend celui-ci possible : la culture. Identifiée à la structure signifiante et opérante du symbole, la culture s'entremet entre les capacités de symbolisation du vécu sensible et l'actualisation cognitive et pratique des symboles effectifs. The symbol operates by signifying and signifies by operating. In order to justify this philosophical affirmation, it is convenient to look back at three debates which have contributed to determining the sense of the symbol in ethics: the distinction between the symbol and the sign, the symbol's reintegration in language, and its expulsion from the domain of the sacred. If one is led to redefine not only the rights, but also the conditions and modes of an ontology of the symbol, then one may not neglect the thing which makes this possible: culture. Identified with the significant and operative structure of the symbol, culture places itself between the capacities for symbolisation of sensitive living, and the cognitive and practical actualisation of existing symbols.<br>

Abstract: On donne des exemples de difficultés rencontrées par la théologie classique quand elle se réapproprie certaines catégories d'ordre philosophique. Après avoir étendu la notion de category-mistake à la logique du questionnement, on illustre par une étude de cas certains glissements, dérives, accaparements qui posent des « problèmes catégoriaux ». Une approche interrogative et textologique permet de les analyser selon un partenariat entre théologie fondamentale et une certaine philosophie (critique) de la religion. Les prémisses de cette approche qui inaugure un nouveau type de théologien et de philosophe non retranché, sans ancillarité ni sous-traitance, ont été exposées dans un article antérieur sur « la pensée expressément religieuse » (chère à Balthasar) et sa catégorisation spécifique. On prépare ici un travail ultérieur consacré aux conditions de légitimité de la reprise problématique d'un ordre à l'autre. Examples are given of the difficulties that arise when classical theology apropriates certain categories of a philosophical order. After taking the notion of category-mistake over into the logic of the questioning the study of certain cases illustrates how certain slips, spoliations, or a certain going astray, lead to « categorial problems. » An interrogative and textological approach allows their analysis via a partnership between fundamental theology and a certain (critical) philosophy of Religion. The premises of this approach which heralds a new type of unentrenched theologian and philosopher, free from subordination or belittlement, were the subject of a previous exposé on « expressly religious thought » (dear to Balthasar) and its specific categorisation. This article prepares a further work on the conditions of legitimate transfer of problematic from one order to another.<br>

Abstract: Rompant avec la quasi-unanimité de la philosophie occidentale, de Platon à Marx, laquelle a conçu le pouvoir en termes de pouvoir-sur, de domination de l'homme sur l'homme, H. A. propose de le penser autrement, comme expression de l'aptitude d'un groupe à agir en condition de pluralité de façon concertée, et donc comme pouvoir-en-commun. L'A. différencie soigneusement le pouvoir, qui trouve en lui-même sa propre fin, d'avec la violence, d'ordre instrumental, qui n'est jamais légitime, et d'avec l'autorité, qui présuppose la reconnaissance inconditionnelle et le respect. Elle se demande finalement si tout pouvoir peut se passer du facteur de durabilité qu'est l'autorité d'une fondation. In breaking with the near unanimity of Western Philosophy which, from Plato to Marx, had conceived of power in terms of "power over," of a domination of humans over humans, H. A. proposes instead to think of power as an expression of a group's aptitude to act in a pluralistic environment and in concert, thus as power in common. The A. takes care to distinguish power as an end in itself from violence of an instrumental order which is never legitimate, and from Authority which presupposes unconditional recognition and respect, wondering in the end if all power can do without the durability factor that is the authority of a foundation<br>

Abstract: La conception de la contemplation et de la vie contemplative connaît une évolution intéressante dans un ordre contemplatif par excellence, celui des Chartreux entre ses débuts et la fin du XIIIe siècle. Cet article tente d'explorer ce tournant à partir de l'analyse de trois auteurs: Guigues II, Hugues de Balma, Guigues du Pont. Héritier de la tradition monastique de la lectio divina, le premier met en place l'échelle des moines montant de la lecture à la méditation, à la prière et à la contemplation. Mais le second en scie les barreaux : concevant une théologie mystique, union affective à Dieu sans connaissance antécédente ou concomitante, il conduit au paradoxe d'une vie contemplative sans contemplation. Les distinctions subtiles du dernier rendent à la théologie mystique une contemplation anagogique et font place à ses côtés à une contemplation spéculative des philosophes, des théologiens, des mystiques. The understanding of contemplation and the contemplative life sees an interesting evolution in an order contemplative par excellence, the Carthusians, between its beginnings and the end of the XIIIth century. On the basis of the analyses of three authors, Guigues II, Hugh of Balma, and Guigues Du Pont, this article endeavors to explore this turn. Heir to the monastic tradition of lectio divina, the first sets in place the ladder for monks ascending from reading to meditation, from prayer to contemplation. Yet the second saws apart the rungs. Conceiving of a mystical theology, an affective union with God without preceding or concomitant knowledge, he shows the way to the paradox of a contemplative life without contemplation. The subtle distinctions of the last bestow upon mystical theology an anagogic contemplation and clear the away around it for a speculative contemplation of the philosophers, theologians and mystics.<br>

Abstract: Alors que le Quatrième Évangile rapportait dialogues et symboles à la communication de la Révélation, la théologie contemporaine les renvoie souvent à une altérité constitutive de toute éthique. Partant de cet écart, irréductible à un simple renversement, l'article cherche à montrer comment le dialogisme et le symbolisme, grâce à leur dissemblance, demeurent aussi essentiels l'un que l'autre à l'accueil de l'Évangile, de la Révélation, du Salut. L'identification du croyant passe aussi bien par un dialogue né d'une séparation que par un symbole ordonné à un rassemblement. Pour parvenir à cette conclusion, l'article doit d'abord définir les conditions requises pour que chacune des deux formations signifiantes ouvre à la fois à un monde et à une communauté : un être et un agir nouveaux. While the Fourth Gospel draws upon dialogues and symbols for the communication of revelation, contemporary theology often relegates them to an otherness constitutive of any ethic. Beginning with this rupture, irreducible to a simple reversal, this paper seeks to show how dialogue and symbolism, thanks to their dissimilarity, remain so essential to each other for the reception of the Gospel, of revelation, of salvation. The identification of the believer passes just as well through a dialogue born of a separation as by a symbol ordered to a gathering. In order to arrive at this conclusion, this paper assumes the task of defining the conditions necessary for each of the two significant formations to open upon a world and a community: a new being and act.<br>

Abstract: En vue de se laisser enseigner par les lettres philosophiques, l'auteur s'applique à reconnaître, depuis Platon jusqu'à Nietzsche, l'insistance et l'existence des questions relatives au mal. La nature (quid), l'origine (unde) et la justification (cur) sollicitent toujours et autrement la pensée du mal. Au commencement, de Plotin à Leibniz, le moment ontologique retravaille la question de la nature à partir de la question de l'origine, mais pour résoudre le mal de la volonté dans le non-être du mal. Il faut que s'affirme avec Kant la préséance du vouloir sur l'être, l'auto-position de la volonté libre, pour que le moment éthique associe l'essence positive du mal à la recherche de son origine. Lorsqu'enfin dans la perspective de Nietzsche s'impose le moment généalogique, la question de la théodicée se transforme en question du langage. Là où se dit la justification de la volonté, c'est une volonté de justification qui parle. L'article se conclut en préparant une pensée du mal qui réunirait l'horizon de l'attente à celui de la genèse. The author, with the aim of being taught by philosophical letters, applies himself to acknowledge from Plato to Nietzsche the persistence and existence of the questions relating to evil. The nature (quid), the origin (unde) and the justification (cur) always and in different ways urge the thought of evil. In the beginning, from Plotin to Leibniz, the metaphysical instance works again at the question of nature starting from the question of origin, but in order to solve the evil of the will power in the non existing of evil. It will need Kant's assertion of the precedency of the will over the being, the auto-position of the free will in order that the ethical moment may associats the positive essence of evil to the search for its origin. When "in fine" the genealogical moment forces itself upon Nietzsche's prospect, the question of theodicy is transformed into one of language. Where the question is a justification of the will, it is the wil~<br>

Abstract: L'expérience et l'empathie définissent deux grandes quêtes de la phénoménologie contemporaine, l'une chez Edmond Husserl et l'autre chez Max Scheler. Dans un tout autre ordre et selon une tout autre perspective, Bernard de Clairvaux fait néanmoins ici figure de pionnier : dans sa conceptualisation de l'experientia d'une part et sa réflexion autour de la compassio d'autre part. Loin de toujours dénoncer négativement la métaphysique, on s'attachera ici à montrer en quoi, positivement cette fois, la mystique ouvre vers un autre « type de discours » et déploie des « possibles » à réinterroger pour aujourd'hui. Appuyés sur une relecture des Sermons sur le Cantique et du Traité de l'amour de Dieu, la mise en œuvre du « champ de l'expérience », la nouveauté du « langage de l'affect », et « l'empathie amoureuse » de l'homme à Dieu, constituent ainsi les différents temps d'une possible redécouverte philosophique de la mystique cistercienne pour notre temps. Experience and empathy define two great quests of contemporary phenomenology, one in the thought of Edmond Husserl the other in the thought of Max Scheler. In an altogether different order and according to an altogether different perspective, Bernard of Clairvaux appears here as the pioneer: in his conceptualization of experientia on the one hand and his reflection upon compassio on the other. Far from pursuing a negative denunciation of metaphysics, we will attempt to show here how, positively in this instance, metaphysics opens upon another « type of discourse » and displays the « possibles » to be reexamined today. Supported by a rereading of the Sermons on the Canticle and the Treatise on the Love of God, the application of the « field of experience », the novelty of « language of affect », and man's amorous empathy » with God, thus constitute the different moments of a possible philosophical rediscovery of Cistercian mysticism for our time.<br>

Abstract: This introduction of the HSR Special Issue on "Critique and Social Change: Historical, Cultural, and Institutional Perspectives" addresses the question of how critique and social change are interrelated. Conflicts and disputes are considered to be a major source of critique. We distinguish three types of conflicts: (1) Value conflicts result from the ongoing process of rationalization and the differentiation of relatively autonomous "value spheres" (Weber) such as politics, economy, science, law, etc. (2) The growth and expansion of these value spheres, e.g. the growth of capitalism, in turn produce new forms of inequalities and leads to distributional conflicts. (3) As questions of distribution and inclusion are closely linked, critique also originates from identity conflicts, which address the social recognition of individuals and collectivities. In order to understand how critique is related to social change, we suggest that critique can be studied either as a condition for or as an effect from social change. Based on this distinction we provide an overview over the contributions of this volume.<br>

Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219828<br>
Date: 10 1, 1965<br>
Author(s): Watkins John<br>
Abstract: Milton scholarship has long regarded chaos in Paradise Lost as hostile to God and creation. This judgment identifies Milton with traditional Western attitudes toward matter and material disorder-evident as early as the Babylonian creation epic, the Enuma elish. In contrast to such attitudes, modern science conceives of chaos as dynamically productive of order, and postmodern cultural studies sees chaos as a relevant principle of ironic indeterminacy. Milton anticipates the postmodern endorsement of chaos in his theology of matter and in the symbolic reflections and allegorical representations of chaos in Paradise Lost. Appreciation of chaotic disorder and of indeterminacy and disapproval of the tyrannical suppression of these qualities distinguish Milton's idiosyncratic theology, political theory, and aesthetics. Even Milton's God contains the potency of chaotic matter, a womblike virtue essential to God's creative power.<br>

Abstract: This paper challenges the common assumption that the attention which modern literary theory pays to the textual aspects of literature is achieved at the expense of humanistic and moral concerns. It starts by outlining how modern literary theory differs epistemologically from the traditional critical approaches to literature. Traditional critical theory was developed in the defense of poetry against Plato's accusations, real or imagined, and this informed both its critical practice and its concept of man. It established its epistemology on an aesthetic, moral, social, philosophical or scientific basis in a manner that encumbered literature with the concepts of man inherent in them. In contrast, modern literary theory started from a different premise: instead of seeking to justify literature and its moral relevance, it strove to identify its literariness and the dynamics of its structure by using the disciplines of semiotics and linguistics. It posited the text as an autonomous entity and a complete structure aware of its existence in a society of texts with which it conducts a profoundly intertextual dialogue. As an autonomous structure, the literary work is independent of other social or philosophical constructs and thus capable of conducting a meaningful dialogue with them. The paper elaborates the various conceptual frameworks of Russian formalism, intertextuality, structuralism and deconstruction in order to examine their implicit assumptions about man. It shows how the autonomous and dialogical nature of the literary work in its Bakhtinian sense are relevant to the concept of man inherent in modern literary theory. In its elaboration of this concept, the paper shows how it was developed in conflict with the hierarchical nature of traditional, ethical and philosophical values. It illustrates also the relevance of autonomy, self-regulation, free-play and fair representation inherent in many concepts of modern literary theory to the question of human rights. The qu~<br>

Abstract: This article develops parallels between how individuals make sense of both lived experience and narrative performance in order to suggest how the process of following a narrative can give rise to affectively engaging states of mind or flows of thought that I term experiential meanings. Although potentiated through the artistry of performance, these meanings result from listeners' own interpretational processes and therefore become experiential resources available for use in their lives.<br>

Article Title: Strangers to Themselves: How Interactants Are other than They Are<br>
Publisher: Routledge Journals for the London School of Economics and Political Science<br>
Issue: i225019<br>
Date: 12 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Travers Andrew<br>
Abstract: Analysis of a sequence of literary frames suggests that a heightened experience of interactional reality is also anomically constructive of the frame. In each of 16 frames, Durkheimian anomie neither destroys the frame's integrity nor renders its routine grounds unintelligible, as Goffman and Garfinkel would claim it must. Paradoxically, anomie ritually intensifies the frame. The selves in the paper's sequence of highly ritualized frames are not routine selves, however. They are 'strangers to themselves'. The analysis shows how Mead's 'I' can re-emerge from Goffman's ritual thinking - where the 'I' is collapsed into an interactionally-bound 'me' - as an original manifestation of great importance to interactants, and therefore to society as well. (Parenthetically it is also argued that selves need an element of rituality in order to be selflike and that it is interactional rituality which guarantees the evolution of social life beyond given frames, corpora, cultural repertoires, and collective representations.) The idea that interactants can be strangers to themselves is an advance on Goffman's and Garfinkel's accounts of interactional selfhood, but one that problematizes the prosecution of the interaction sociology that Goffman and Garfinkel pioneer, since strangers to themselves disappear in normal sociological appearances.<br>

Date: 12 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): Traverso Regina M.<br>
Abstract: This article investigates the exchanges of letters of 1987 between the historians Martin Broszat and Saul Friedlander through the interpretive framework of "dialogue." It is suggested that dialogue does not have a dyadic structure, but involves ever shifting Thirds that function as mediators in dialogue, i.e., God, conscience, reason, or tradition. On one hand, Thirds provide a seemingly stable, external reference point; on the other hand, they open up space for the play of power and desire. Four categories of Thirds are identified and their place and role in the dialogue between Broszat and Friedlander analyzed. The psychoanalytically inspired notions of "acting-out" and "working-through" are employed in order to interpret the varying degrees of critical control Broszat and Friedlander were able to apply to these interfering Thirds. Finally, I give an overall interpretation of Broszat's and Friedlander's positions in the dialogue, guided by the concepts of acting-out and working-through.<br>

Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i226338<br>
Date: 11 1, 1974<br>
Author(s): Thompson Paul<br>
Abstract: In any field of experience anthropologists are confronted by spates of signs, many of which they fail to perceive. By way of an analysis of the mundane activities associated with riding a Songhay bush taxi in the Republic of Niger, this article probes the reflexive process through which anthropologist and ethnographic other learn to interpret the signs that comprise the discourse of social action. Having been confronted repeatedly with the signs of the other's universe, anthropologists may not only gain a new awareness of the sociocultural systems they seek to uncover but may also realize the limitations of their knowledge. Through what Dilthey called the hermeneutic, anthropologists will be more able to proceed profoundly and accurately toward an understanding of those signs that give substance and order to the complexities of social universes.

Author(s): el Zein Michael<br>
Abstract: The relationships among texts, readers, and moral community are explored in order to understand the dissonance and interplay of personal and textual authority in local Islamic practice (Sunni, Shaf'i branch) among Malagasy-speaking villagers of Mayotte (Comoro Islands, East Africa). A political economy of knowledge approach is linked to an analysis of recitation as a ritual activity in which illocutionary force exceeds referential meaning. The discussion has relevance for the understanding of the relationship between religious knowledge, power, and action in Islamic societies as well as of the interface between the oral and the written more generally.

Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i227583<br>
Date: 3 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): Wolf Aletta<br>
Abstract: An earlier ecological anthropology defined its project within the compass of the idealism v. materialism debate. Culture was an adaptive tool, instrumental rather than formal; it was intelligible with respect to its material effects, not - as the idealists would maintain - in terms of itself, as an autonomous, self-determining order of reality. This argument was mounted with respect to bounded, stable, self-regulating, local, or at best regional entities and the environment they inhabited. All of the premises of the earlier ecology have since been challenged, and today's ecologies - symbolic, historical, and political - radically depart from the reductions and elisions of the ecological anthropology of the past. In particular, the new ecologies override the dichotomies that informed and enlivened the debates of the past - nature/culture, idealism/materialism - and they are informed by the literature on transnationalist flows and local-global articulations. This introduction positions Rappaport's work within this historical shift from a polarized field of mutually exclusive frameworks to today's synthetic new ecologies and their antireductive materialism. Rappaport's work, produced over three decades, serves, in and through its own transformations, as a bridge between the reductive materialism of the past and a new-materialist ecology.<br>

Abstract: This essay proposes that sociology can learn from social theory developed in the humanities. In the face of recent challenges to sociological explanations of social outcomes (from rational choice and economic theory, cognitive psychological theories of intelligence, and communitarian social philosophy), social theory should specify the constitutive force of social signification. After identifying a key weakness in theoretical approaches currently available in sociology, the inadequacy of various conceptions of the social, I analyze three significant new works in cultural studies in order to sketch out alternative ways of defining and measuring the force of social signification. The essay concludes with an attempt to establish the basis of a dialogue between cultural studies and sociology.<br>

Abstract: This study presents an interpretation of the configuration of the poetic subject in the books of poems El Primer Libro (1985) and Albricia (1988) by Soledad Fariña (1943), which understand a self in a continuous process of gestation and birth. This process serves the purpose of recomposing a disarticulated subjectivity lost in the framework of the political and cultural conditions imposed by the military dictatorship that ruled Chile in the 1970s and 1980s. By using a metaphor of a journey and searching for a new language, the subject attempts to access a primitive stage andfind its maternal self in order to confront the dominant power, by codifying and configuring herself through an otherness in a feminine body-text. However, this process of maturation and discovery is intervened and left incomplete by the impulse of modernity, thereby creating a deformed, dissociated and off-centered self, which aims at growing opposed to logos. This conflict turns the upcoming of the new self into a painful event, like giving birth, that stems from the subject's wounded and fractured body, intending to re-establish de selffrom its fragments, traces and memories.<br>

Abstract: יצוין שריקר פועל על בסיס מעגל הרמנויטי המתואר כך: ‘we must understand in order to believe but we must believe in order to understand’,
         
                  . פירוש הדבר שההרמנויטיקה פועלת מתוך הבנה ראשונית של אותו הדבר שהיא מבקשת להבין באמצעות הפרשנות. נראה לי שיש בכך כדי לתאר את גישתו של החסיד — שהווייתו שרויה במסורת דתית טקסטואלית — לדרשה החסידית. הדברים רלוונטיים במיוחד להבנת גישתו של הקורא החסידי לדרשה החסידית, וכמובן להבנת גישתו של הדרשן החסידי לטקסטים. אציין רק שכחלק מהמסורת של הפילוסופיה ההרמנויטית, יש כאן העמדת אלטרנטיבה רדיקלית לסובייקט היודע את עצמו מתוך עצמו מבית מדרשו של דקרט, וכן יש כאן כר פורה להשוואת גישתו של ריקר עם מושגים בהגות החסידית, כמו 'ביטול האני'.

Abstract: The article focuses on a selection of chronicles in which José Donoso provides a denaturalized image of the city of Santiago in the 1980s. By stressing a poetics of transformation, the author narrates a city that confronts the silence pervading its urban practices and neighbourhoods. Under this guise, Donoso’s writing tactically articulates a voice for the city that challenges both the homogeneity imposed by traditional renditions and the order of a contemporary oligarchy.<br>

Abstract: This article examines the connection between state order and selfunderstandings in everyday life through a case study of the “Boarding School for Gifted Disadvantaged” in Israel. It includes content analysis of governmental protocols that documented the establishment of the boarding school (governmental constitution of a new self-concept) and interviews with sixty of its graduates (self-understandings in everyday life). The findings reveal how the new cultural order invented a new selfhood, “gifted disadvantaged,” previously unknown in Israel. This category is based on structural distinctions between being “naturally” gifted versus the governmental constitution of gifted status. Interviews with graduates indicate that they experience selfhood as a philanthropic gift bestowed on them by the state of Israel and voice their gratitude toward the state. The concluding discussion suggests that the graduates experience their selfhood as “public property.” The self, perceived as having been constructed from outside, is in a continuous dialectic between the presence and the absence of certain personal qualities.<br>

Abstract: Recently in environmental ethics some theorists have advocated narrative accounts of value, according to which the value of environmental goods is given by the role that they play in our narratives. I first sketch the basic theoretical features of a narrative accounts of value and then go on to raise some problems for such views. I claim that they require an evaluative standard in order to distinguish the valuable from the merely valued and that the project of constructing such a standard faces significant problems. I conclude by questioning whether narrative accounts of value really offer advantages over other pluralistic and context-sensitive accounts of value.<br>

Abstract: Historians are dumb witnesses to a culture wrangling with itself about its criminal past if they only narrate the sequence of historical controversies such as those that have dotted the German public landscape since the Holocaust. They need to be alive to the subterranean biblical themes flowing beneath the surface froth of events, linking past and present through the continuity of German political emotions that are necessarily collective and therefore sensitive to anxieties about accusations of collective, inherited sin. This article argues that the guilt/shame couplet so common both in public German and academic discourses about postwar Germany cannot account for the intergenerational transmission of moral pollution signified by Holocaust memory. In order to understand the dynamics of German political emotions, it is more useful to employ an alternative couplet: stigma and sacrifice.<br>

Abstract: This article analyzes the social construction of silence in early-nineteenth-century Europe, focusing on France and the Netherlands. In both countries, the newly installed Restoration monarchies propagated a “politics of forgetting” of the problematic recent past of the revolution and the Napoleonic era as an essential part of attempts to build a stable and legitimate political order. This official forgetting was contested in both countries. On the basis of the “letters of adhesion,” the article examines the close interaction between the individual reconstruction of the personal past and social forgetting. Finally, it relates the rise of a historicizing culture in the early nineteenth century to the culture of silence in Restoration Europe.<br>

Abstract: This paper scrutinizes the fundamental assumption governing Gunther Teubner's theory of societal constitutionalism, namely that societal constitutions are ultimately about the regulation of inclusion and exclusion in global function systems. While endorsing the central role of inclusion/exclusion in constitutions, societal or otherwise, I argue that inclusion and exclusion are primordial categories of collective action, rather than functional categories. As a result, the self-closure which gives rise to a legal collective is spatial as much as it is temporal, and subjective no less than material. Inasmuch as legal orders must establish who ought to do what, where, and when, this entails, or so I argue, that any legal order we could imagine—including a global legal order such as cyberlaw—is necessarily bounded in space, time, content, and membership. This impinges directly on the inclusion/exclusion difference: that there can be no inclusion without exclusion entails, most fundamentally, that there can be no (il)legality without alegality, i.e. comportment that contests, sometimes radically, how a legal order draws the distinction between legality and illegality. In this fundamental sense, all legal orders have an outside—literally. Building on this insight, I suggest that the functional cosmopolitanism advocated by a theory of societal constitutionalism retains a residue of the logic of totalization it seeks to overcome. I conclude by exploring how a first-person plural theory of law both supports and transforms the insight that constitutions regulate the inclusion/exclusion difference by putting into place constitutive and limitative rules.<br>

Abstract: Is the most important function of education to provide students with basic skills and useful knowledge in order to eventually become employable? In many parts of the world knowledge league tables and policy documents inform us this is the case. As the question of what should form the educational content seems to be answered, teachers can concentrate on how they should teach, and researchers can concentrate on what method is the most effective. In the current rhetoric, however, many vital pedagogical issues have been placed in the background and the aesthetic subjects are downgraded. These tendencies worried Frede V. Nielsen who stated that didactic studies and philosophical inquiries yet again are needed to explore and give substance to the content dimension. Nielsen's writings on didactics form the basis for this essay, where we highlight which perspectives and dilemmas could be placed on a critical, philosophical didactic study agenda. The starting point is the field of tension between the what and the why of education.<br>

Abstract: For both Levinas and Derrida, the practice of philosophy, understood as commentary by the former and deconstruction by the latter, was founded on borrowing terms from other languages and finding their equivalents in French. This argument is developed through a discussion of two texts, Levinas's early Talmudic reading, “The Temptation of Temptation,” and Derrida's deconstruction of
         The Merchant of Venicein “What Is a ‘Relevant’ Translation?” This essay shows how translated terms are interwoven into these texts. It also shows that translation is essential to Levinas's and Derrida's creative conceptualization, and to the performativity of their philosophies, meaning that Levinas and Derrida open their language to other languages in order to create concepts. It finally argues that in both Derrida and Levinas the question of the limits of translation, namely, of the moment in which translation becomes conversion, is left open.<br>

Abstract: The literary field in Africa came into emergence as a result of a collective yearning for lesser dependency on the symbolic constraints the Western center is forcing on its margins. Granted that a work sets itself up by setting up its own context, and that the African context stands out as one where oral literature is still alive in society, the manifestation of expressive forms associated with traditional literature in a novel must carry heavy weight in an interpretation of African works. For that reason, this essay will argue that, through her “smuggling” of narrative forms drawn from oral literature, Aminata Sow Fall's fiction testifies to an oral discursivity at work in the novel. The archi-textual approach focuses on various strategies the Senegalese woman writer resorts to in order to inscribe, deep within her creative work in French, a traditional universe hitherto conveyed through oral forms of expression.<br>

Abstract: This article reviews recent methodological interventions in the field of literary study, many of which take nineteenth-century critics, readers, or writers as models for their less interpretive reading practices. In seeking out nineteenth-century models for twenty-first-century critical practice, these critics imagine a world in which English literature never became a discipline. Some see these new methods as formalist, yet we argue that they actually emerge from historicist self-critique. Specifically, these contemporary critics view the historicist projects of the 1980s as overly influenced by disciplinary models of textual interpretation—models that first arose, we show through our reading of the Jolly Bargemen scene in Charles Dickens's
         Great Expectations(1860– 61), in the second half of the nineteenth century. In closing, we look more closely at the work of a few recent critics who sound out the metonymic, adjacent, and referential relations between readers, texts, and historical worlds in order sustain historicism's power to restore eroded meanings rather than reveal latent ones.<br>

Abstract: Citation is particularly potent for bridging. Even as it connects, it always recalls its displaced status. “Quotation is a constant reminder that writing is a form of displacement,” observes Said. “For although quotation can take many forms, in every one the quoted passage symbolizes other writing as encroachment…. As a rhetorical device, quotation can serve to accommodate, to incorporate, to falsify (when wrongly or even rightly paraphrased), to accumulate, to defend, or to conquer—but always, even when in the form of a passing allusion, it is a reminder that other writing serves to displace present writing.”
         
               Quotation is a “vigorous mechanism of displacement,” Antoine Compagnon agrees. “It's even more powerful than surgery.”75
            
               Contemporary descriptions of citation and the displacement it effects in experimental poetry are vivid and dynamic. In addition to the aforementioned uncreative writing (Goldsmith), there is Tan Lin's “plagiarism,” Sergio Waisman's “creative plagiarism,”76
            
               Haryette Mullen's “recyclopedia,”77
            
               and various critical descriptions of “syncretic poetics,”78
            
               “fragmentary collages that channel surf,”79
            
               and the “apotheosis of ‘contaminated language.’”80
            
               Some definitions stress the racial, political dimensions of self-fashioning and the “hunger for new forms,” as Kevin Young calls it. Young writes of “counterfeit culture,” which he defines as “the ways in which black writers create their own authority in order to craft their own, alternative system of literary currency and value, so to speak, functioning both within and without the dominant, supposed gold-standard system of American culture…. For the black author, and even the ex-slave narrator, creativity has often lain with the lie—81
            forgingan identity, ‘making’ one, but ‘lying’ about one too.”

Abstract: Apter's book ranges widely across the landscape of contemporary literary studies, philosophy, art, and politics. As she says, rather than offering a comprehensive or programmatic narrative, the volume provides “an array of loosely affiliated topoi—oneworldedness, literary world-systems, terrestrial humanism, checkpoints, theologies of translation, the translational interdiction, pedagogy, authorial deownership, possessive collectivism” (16). If the book eschews any progressively developed argument, it does have a distinct point of origin, in Apter's work as coeditor of a paradoxical project: an English translation—or untranslation—of the
      Vocabulaire européen des philosophies: Dictionnaire des intraduisibles(2006), edited by the Parisian philosopher Barbara Cassin. Focused on the vexed translation history of philosophical terms, theVocabulaire's essays proved to need extensive reworking to become legible for an American audience. Six of Apter's eighteen chapters take up and build on aspects of Cassin's project. Like Cassin, Apter takes a post-Heideggerian approach to language, building on Derrida to argue against Heidegger's linguistic ontology in order to counter a too easy evocation of a world of open communication and the free play of the imagination, speciously unified via a Euro-universalism projected onto the globe at large.<br>

Abstract: Fitzgerald's nostalgic style, though, set an example of how a nostalgic narrative could be structured, and in its aftermath it was used by such different authors as Evelyn Waugh in
      Brideshead Revisited(1945), Anthony Burgess inA Clockwork Orange(1962) and the works of Kazuo Ishiguro. The author's own later work employs it as well. The technique of using the reader's textual memory in order to evoke a phenomenological nostalgic experience is very evident in both versions ofTender Is the Night(the 1934 original, and Malcolm Cowley's 1951 restructuring). In the 1951 version, the structure of the narrative closely follows the pattern of happiness and reflection. An early description of a Swiss valley communicates an awe of life and nature: “The sun swam out into a blue sea of sky and suddenly it was a Swiss valley at its best—pleasant sounds and murmurs and a good fresh smell of health and cheer” (9). In the transitory third book, “Casualties: 1925,” the tone has changed from appreciative to melancholic, as in this description of the small town of Amiens: “In the day-time one is deflated by such towns, with their little trolley cars of twenty years ago crossing the great grey cobble-stoned squares in front of the cathedral, and the very weather seems to have a quality of the past, faded weather like that of old photographs” (138). At the end of the novel both Dick and Nicole Diver become obsessed with youth and the past as well as with time: “for Nicole the years slipped away by clock and calendar and birthday, with the added poignance of her perishable beauty” (228). Toward the end of the novel, Nicole's last sight of Dick—“her eyes followed his figure until it became a dot and mingled with the other dots in the summer crowd” (386)—forces the reader to reflect in a reversed movement. Instead of vanishing like Dick, this image suggests a backward recollection of what was a Swiss valley “at its best.”<br>

Abstract: The title of Jabbeh Wesley's fourth collection of poetry,
         Where the Road Turns, is a subtle allusion to Wole Soyinka's1965play,The Road, and Ben Okri's1991Booker Prize–winning novel,The Famished Road. These two books explore the riches of Yoruba mythology in order to shed light on the African condition. The characters in Soyinka's play live on the road and make their living from what the road has to offer. Critics have pointed out the absurdist elements in Soyinka's conception of the road as a metaphor for Africa's instability, especially in the play's parallel with Samuel Beckett'sWaiting for Godot. What is said ofThe Roadapplies to Jabbeh Wesley'sWhere the Road Turns. Aided by the picture of the winding dirt road on the cover and at the beginning of each of the book's four sections, Jabbeh Wesley reminds us of the twisting road of Africa's existential journeys. The eponymous poem itself is representative of the poetry of attention:
               The detailed description of the place where a lonely speaker waits enables us to see what the speaker sees: a crumbling world. We are even more troubled by the fact that the speaker sees a parallel between him or her and the road: “Potholes have taken over my life” just as they have taken over the road. This self-identification with the road is to be understood as a lamentation for the conditions of the speaker's life and not as romanticizing the rural life of Africa. But little romanticizing is possible given that the speaker waits in the manner that reminds one of Samuel Beckett's remarkable characters, Pozzo and Lucky, inI'm right here on the road, in the open

Abstract: In the previous section of this paper I have attempted to raise some of the theoretical issues involved in any important discussion when Africa is introduced to the academy. V. Y. Mudimbe raised issues of this kind and extended their range and depth in his book
         The Invention of Africa.
               If, indeed, the study of Africa has aided in the critique and redefinition of the disciplines as the editors of the volume18
            Africa and the Disciplinessuggest, Mudimbe gives us an insight into what the discipline of philosophy or better, “the order of knowledge,” might look like if one paid serious attention to Africa. Mudimbe, in his preparatory and diagnostic text on African philosophy, speaks of an African gnosis. He acknowledges his debt to Johannes Fabian's usage of this term in Fabian's description of a charismatic movement in Africa. Scholars of religion will recognize the term as belonging to esoteric texts and movements in early Christianity. In any case, this term seemed to Mudimbe an apt way of introducing his text:

I have in various places defined religion asGnosis means seeking to know, inquiry, methods of knowing, investigation and even acquaintance with someone. Often the word is used in a more specialized sense, that of higher and esoteric knowledge, and thus it refers to a structured, common, and conventional knowledge but one strictly under the control of specific procedures for the rise as well as its transmission.

Article Title: American Continental Philosophy in the Making:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Yet in all of this, Wild also echoed the attitude of our forebears. They were, after all, Continental Europeans—which meant they were thoroughly trained in the very tradition they wished to criticize, and they knew that one must engage with this tradition in order to overcome or transform it. Unlike many analytic philosophers, they did not think they could decide all by themselves what contemporary philosophy should be and thus leave the mere history of philosophy to be picked over by “humanists.” Displays of this kind of foolish arrogance were not typical of either our European forebears or our founding American pioneers; nor were we encouraged to think of philosophical practice as something only “we” did. Hence, I grew up simply assuming that philosophy is necessarily pluralistic, dialogical, and historically determinate all the way down—an assumption that was confirmed for me not only every fall at SPEP but also every spring at Straus's Lexington conferences, “Phenomenology: Pure and Applied.”
      
            To stick just to examples from the first fifteen years of SPEP, in addition to hearing from many speakers now easily identified as “Continental” philosophers, I also heard presentations by J. N. Findlay, Wilfrid Sellars, Charles Taylor, Marjorie Green, John Searle, Dagfinn Føllesdal, Bas van Fraassen, Stanley Rosen, and Jaakko Hintikka.4<br>

Abstract: Our plight, then, is not simply that we are all in the same boat, let alone on the same ocean. Yet we are still bound by the responsbility of inhabiting the same planet. What would it mean, then, to share the earth with all its inhabitants, not just in terms of occupying the same planet but also in terms of caring and looking after each other in the anachronistic sense of the word
   dutyas plight? Can we risk pledging to solemnly avow our own investments in the very things we so self-rightousely protest against, not in order to stop protesting in the name of justice but, rather, in the hopes of turning the killing machine back against itself and taking another step toward “hunting down” and abolishing death penalities wherever they may be hiding, even in our own disowned fears and desires?<br>

Abstract: While in a few cases, the origins of these new technologies go back prior to my 1976 watershed date, only those interested in actual technol- ogies and innovation were familiar with these early forms. Heidegger, eschewing particular technologies and largely ignorant of technological history, was not one of these. Heidegger did mention the atomic bomb, nuclear physics, and television—to which in late life he accommodated in order to watch soccer games—but little else. He did pause to condemn the typewriter and praise the handheld pen—the first almost ready to become a relic, the second already a relic.<br>

Abstract: Nonetheless, while I think that “correlationism” is a phony rap, there is something to Meillassoux's critique of “fideism,” because there is a version of Continental theory that sees it as a way to limit science in order to create a gap that can only be filled with faith in God. The real meaning of fideism is found in the God of the gaps. In my view, Continental theory is more “realistic” than Meillassoux allows, and it is also capable of a more critical reading of religion than the Kantian version of postmodern theory allows, which I think is indeed a version of fideism.

Article Title: Is a Hermeneutic Phenomenology Wide Enough? A Ricoeurian Reply to Janicaud's<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.28.3.issue-3<br>
Date: 7 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Davidson Scott<br>
Abstract: It seems to me that, at this point, Janicaud's argument still remains incomplete. He has suggested that phenomenology can and should be transformed in order to accommodate Deleuzian insights. But why wouldn't hermeneutics be the discourse by which this passage from Deleuze to phenomenology is made? If the worry has to do with Deleuze's suspicions of its priestly residues, why couldn't one perform a transformation of the hermeneutical project similar to Janicaud's transformation of the phenomenological project?
         
               In light of these questions, I want to construct what I would imagine to be, if not Ricoeur's own view, at least a Ricoeurian reply whose aim is to show that hermeneutics provides the resources needed for carrying out Janicaud's minimal phenomenology.20<br>

Article Title: Recovering Hyperbole:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.45.4.issue-4<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Derrida states that hyperbole is “the uneconomic expenditure,” which both can and cannot exceed economy. His statement has the structure of error without being an error. He speaks the language of extremity and of exceeding economy in order to emphasize the repetitive necessity of making the attempt to “throw beyond.” Through hyperbolic errancy, the repetition of the attempt-to-say-the-demonic-hyperbole, the signifier exceeds the signified that is already in excess. The attempt will never be completed but is always necessary. Thus, Derrida engages in a hyperbolic mode of thought regarding hyperbole itself in order to reveal that the radical attempt to throw beyond the economy of writing is an impossible possibility that must always be attempted but will never arrive.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.46.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 1998<br>
Abstract: This framework also enhances our ability to answer two other questions. First, how is it that human action both imitates the past and mobilizes it as a resource for innovation? I follow Ricoeur and others in working to open what has often been thought of as a closed hermeneutic circle. Although they labored to unpack it, thinkers as formidable as Martin Heidegger and later Hans-Georg Gadamer nevertheless expressed concern that this circle was in fact the philosophical equivalent of a death spiral (Gadamer
         1998, 190–92, 265–66, 293–94; Heidegger1996, 142–43). Ricoeur hopefully proposed that the hermeneutic circle be considered “not a vicious but a healthy circle” (1984, 1:3). Ricoeur perceived the many latent possibilities in humanity's abilities to create and deploy news stories about an old past. But his work needs to be infused with a rhetorical sensibility in order to make this a convincing view. I believe that rhetorical scholars would be well served by returning to Ricoeur to explore how the rhetorical interest in judgment and action might contribute to our understanding of this “healthy” spiral.<br>

Abstract: As Michel Pharand's bibliography in this issue of SHAW reminds us, Shaw's wellness practices and his engagement with health debates, medical theory and institutional practice, and quackery in all of its forms over the course of his lifetime have been documented extensively by biographers, scholars, reporters, critics, friends, and of course GBS himself. In order to avoid mere reiteration of Shaw's own views and of that earlier work on the topic, “health” was conceived for this issue of
      SHAWin deliberately broad terms, and its elasticity as an organizing conceit has enabled us to collect essays that employ a variety of critical approaches and provide insight on sometimes unexpected topics. The mixture of senior, midlevel, and emerging scholars among the contributors underscores the ongoing salubriousness of Shaw's corpus and all extend the scholarly conversation in productive directions, discovering new pockets of biographical and historical inquiry and continuing to develop innovative contexts within which his creative work speaks in new ways. Considering the steady proliferation of Shaviana and the continued myriad revivals of his plays on international stages, Shaw studies is in fine fettle.<br>

Abstract: Furthermore, like Ricoeur, Shaw rejects the Pauline concepts of original sin and vicarious atonement. We enter the world spotless, Shaw believes, and no gentleman—Shaw's shorthand for the virtuous person, male or female—would ever allow an innocent other to pay for her misdeeds. The crux is not to ignorantly transgress to the heart's content and then brazenly appeal to a sacrificial scapegoat to wash away the dirt with unblemished blood and tears. Rather, as Jesus proclaims, the recalcitrant should have a change of heart and sin no more. For Shaw, “Christ stands in the world for that intuition of the highest humanity that we, being members of one another, must not complain, must not scold, must not strike, nor revile nor persecute nor revenge nor punish.”
         
               What most intrigues and inspires Shaw about Jesus is not his purported special status in the cosmic order among adherents of traditional Christianity, but the type of person he embodies in the flesh. Thus, he is, as Ricoeur views him, a paradigmatic metaphor, a timeless “intuition” in the Shavian lexicon, of precisely the kind of exemplary individual Shaw believes every child has the capacity to become in its maturity: a reverent adult who heeds Micah's (6:8)44
            
               admonition to do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with your God.45
            
               In Shaw's (as well as Ricoeur's) eyes, there is no means of remedying the world's ills other than discovering practical and compassionate ways of implementing politically the core of Jesus's message, which he takes to be the basic principles of Fabian socialism.46

Author(s): Matz Jesse<br>
Abstract: Mauriceis a novel that waits for the future (for completion, publication, and audience) but also looks nostagically to the past. This strange temporal location reflects a temporality basic to Forster's narrative structures and sexual identity: like philosophers who presently ascribe to the “tenseless theory of time,” Forster dispels identity among a tenseless order of moments, in a narrative structure that seeks likewise to trade “becoming” for a better order. InMaurice, such tactics as iterative seriality, overdetermined prolepsis, nonephiphany, and other modes of “detensing” give form to a version of homosexuality that would escape “identity,” with unusual implications for moderist temporality and narratological criticism. Forster's modernist time is eccentric for its interest in logical order; and the narratological criticism which would attend to his “tenseless” homosexual form must remember that it is often the combination of subversion and order that encourages the best narratological advances.<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: An obvious criticism of Burke's idea of rhetorical transcendence is that it is utopian in the unrealistic sense. It seems so abstract in its focus on generalized terminology and images that it may have no possible concrete object. Burke realized this utopian quality reminiscent of the lack of actualized topos in More's utopian “no-place.” As rhetorician James Zappen explains, “These acts of pure persuasion are devoid of partisan advantage-seeking but also devoid of persuasive purpose. As such, they might not even exist.”
      
               The important thing to take away from Burke's ramblings, though, is the humanistic sense that the search for perfection is inherent in human nature and that understanding this utopian impulse can only help us to live and to seek happiness in a world of competing power and advantage: “Let us observe, all about us, forever goading us, though it be in fragments, the motive that attains its ultimate identification in the thought, not of the universal holocaust, but of the universal order…. [E]ach kind strives toward the perfection of its kind, and so toward the kind next above it, while the strivings of the entire series head in God as the beloved cynosure and ninecure, the end of all desire.”35
            
               By36
            GodBurke means an ultimate ideal transcending all other symbols and fulfilling all desire—the kind of nirvana that would eliminate the need for further utopia-making altogether. This, of course, is not achievable in the course of history, but the mythic experience of it would activate a downward movement in the process, bringing the transcendent ideals back into the pragmatic world of discourse and human affairs. This would be the function of utopia in Burkean terms, and it would result in a habit of mind that would amount to a large-scale educational scheme—dare I say, the education of desires. If the young were informed of the dialectical-rhetorical process of transcendence from the beginning, ~<br>

Issue: utopianstudies.23.2.issue-2<br>

Abstract: Leopold Bloom, in
         Ulysses, expansively describes the Utopian as affording “no known method from the known to the unknown.”
               Utopia is a place that is impossible to arrive at by any known route, in that it is not really a place at all. It is therefore essential that, in order to reach Utopia, one takes an unknown and unknowable route, a path determined by its indeterminacy, a passage that deconstructs its own rationalistic epistemological foundations. It is only in its paradoxical nature that such a route, beyond sense (which forbids entry into the unreal), might discover the reality of that unreality. For, in the end, despite its fantastical absurdities—its self-conscious nowhereness—Joyce's Dublin, like Butler's Erewhon, is the opposite of nowhere: it is somewhere. It is by inscribing the material (the somewhere) within the dream (the nowhere) that the dream might be sustained; and it is also by inscribing the dream within the real that material existence can continue.166<br>

Article Title: The Problematic of Architecture and Utopia<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: One way to ensure a verifiable utopian dimension to works of architecture and urbanism (in addition to keeping the four elements introduced earlier in mind) would be to stay close to German sociologist Karl Mannheim's (1893–1947) definition of Utopia. Doing so provides claims to Utopia for architecture and urbanism with terms of criticism by which they could be analyzed more closely and carefully. In this way, the incongruence of such claims with Mannheim's definition of Utopia (and those of others) might be more readily ascertained: “However, we should not regard utopia as every state of mind which is incongruous with and transcends the immediate situation (and in this sense, ‘departs from reality’). Only those orientations transcending reality will be referred to by us as utopian which, when they pass over into conduct, tend to shatter, either partially or wholly, the order which prevails at the time.”
         
               Divergence from Mannheim's definition is most explicitly observable in the degree to which most so-called utopian movements in architecture and urbanism collapse under the burden of their own ideological hollowness, confirmed by their inability, in Mannheim's words, “to shatter, either partially or wholly, the order which [prevailed] at the time … as [they pass] into conduct.”14
            
               As Manfredo Tafuri (1935–1994) observed, the reproduction function of architecture is all but inevitable, captured as it is within the cultural norms of the building industry in particular but more generally within the prevailing sociopolitical and economic conditions of capitalism, which led German philosopher of hope Ernst Bloch (1885–1977) to believe that to be “true,” as he called it, architecture would have to wait for radically transformed conditions to be renewed. In fact, when considered in this way, the utopian prospect of modern architecture was all but nonexistent; more so, it was rarely if ever the issue.15<br>

Abstract: In a period of immanent crisis when comprehensive historical narratives are no longer possible—nor is utopia—dystopia, or rather uchronia tinged with dystopia, seems to be a rather effective means to construct a sweeping historical narration. Through the “timeless time” of uchronia in which—as Ricoeur explains in
         Time and Narrative(vol. III)—“we are torn between two fleeing horizons” so that “our present sees itself in crisis,” Roth looks back at a counterfactual past in order to better investigate historical causality and to embrace past and present into a postmodern problematic perspective on the temporal dimension.<br>
