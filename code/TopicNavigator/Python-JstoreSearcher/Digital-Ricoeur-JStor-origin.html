  Book Title: Mimetic Theory and World Religions-  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Schenk Richard<br>
  Abstract: Those who anticipated the demise of religion and the advent of a peaceful, secularized global village have seen the last two decades confound their predictions. René Girard's mimetic theory is a key to understanding the new challenges posed by our world of resurgent violence and pluralistic cultures and traditions. Girard sought to explain how the Judeo-Christian narrative exposes a founding murder at the origin of human civilization and demystifies the bloody sacrifices of archaic religions. Meanwhile, his book
      Sacrifice, a reading of conflict and sacrificial resolution in the Vedic Brahmanas, suggests that mimetic theory's insights also resonate with several non-Western religious and spiritual traditions. This volume collects engagements with Girard by scholars of Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism and situates them within contemporary theology, philosophy, and religious studies.<br>

  Author(s) Alison James<br>
  Abstract: Let me begin with a warning. It might also be read as a plea for excuse: I am neither a true believer in mimetic theory/theology nor a connoisseur of Girardian methodology and its recent developments (if there are any).¹ My reading of René Girard’s oeuvre has been rather sporadic and even somewhat naive. I always took (and after consideration, I still take) the Girardian approach for a general (but also generic) suspicion; I don’t read his theory as a specific (scientific) hypothesis. In the end René Girard’s “big” and iconoclastic thesis—about the scapegoat mechanism as the very origin and<br>

  Book Title: For René Girard-Essays in Friendship and in Truth<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Williams James G.<br>
  Abstract: In his explorations of the relations between the sacred and violence, René Girard has hit upon the origin of culture-the way culture began, the way it continues to organize itself. The way communities of human beings structure themselves in a manner that is different from that of other species on the planet.Like Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, Émile Durkheim, Martin Buber, or others who have changed the way we think in the humanities or in the human sciences, Girard has put forth a set of ideas that have altered our perceptions of the world in which we function. We will never be able to think the same way again about mimetic desire, about the scapegoat mechanism, and about the role of Jewish and Christian scripture in explaining sacrifice, violence, and the crises from which our culture has been born.The contributions fall into roughly four areas of interpretive work: religion and religious study; literary study; the philosophy of social science; and psychological studies.The essays presented here are offered as "essays" in the older French sense of attempts (essayer) or trials of ideas, as indeed Girard has tried out ideas with us. With a conscious echo of Montaigne, then, this hommage volume is titled

  Book Title: Alef, Mem, Tau-Kabbalistic Musings on Time, Truth, and Death<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Wolfson Elliot R.<br>
  Abstract: This highly original, provocative, and poetic work explores the nexus of time, truth, and death in the symbolic world of medieval kabbalah. Demonstrating that the historical and theoretical relationship between kabbalah and western philosophy is far more intimate and extensive than any previous scholar has ever suggested, Elliot R. Wolfson draws an extraordinary range of thinkers such as Frederic Jameson, Martin Heidegger, Franz Rosenzweig, William Blake, Julia Kristeva, Friedrich Schelling, and a host of kabbalistic figures into deep conversation with one another.
      Alef, Mem, Taualso discusses Islamic mysticism and Buddhist thought in relation to the Jewish esoteric tradition as it opens the possibility of a temporal triumph of temporality and the conquering of time through time. The framework for Wolfson's examination is the rabbinic teaching that the wordemet,"truth," comprises the first, middle, and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet,alef, mem,andtau,which serve, in turn, as semiotic signposts for the three tenses of time-past, present, and future. By heeding the letters ofemetwe discern the truth of time manifestly concealed in the time of truth, the beginning that cannot begin if it is to be the beginning, the middle that re/marks the place of origin and destiny, and the end that is the figuration of the impossible disclosing the impossibility of figuration, the finitude of death that facilitates the possibility of rebirth. The time of death does not mark the death of time, but time immortal, the moment of truth that bestows on the truth of the moment an endless beginning of a beginningless end, the truth of death encountered incessantly in retracing steps of time yet to be taken-between, before, beyond.<br>

  Abstract: Our exploration of the complex relationship between literature and space began with a legendary account of the origin of Sanskrit literature and a literary-theoretical discourse on Sanskrit styles and their regional dimensions. Both perspectives are conditioned by a conceptual matrix fundamental to Sanskrit thought for ordering and explaining the diverse phenomena of culture and society as elements in a transregional network closely related to Sanskrit’s own nonlocalized mode of existence. But there are other, literary linkages between literature and space. Narrative has an internal spatial logic, a “semiotic domain around which a plot coalesces and self-organizes,” as one scholar puts<br>

  Book Title: Imagining Karma-Ethical Transformation in Amerindian, Buddhist, and Greek Rebirth<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): OBEYESEKERE GANANATH<br>
  Abstract: With
      Imagining Karma,Gananath Obeyesekere embarks on the very first comparison of rebirth concepts across a wide range of cultures. Exploring in rich detail the beliefs of small-scale societies of West Africa, Melanesia, traditional Siberia, Canada, and the northwest coast of North America, Obeyesekere compares their ideas with those of the ancient and modern Indic civilizations and with the Greek rebirth theories of Pythagoras, Empedocles, Pindar, and Plato. His groundbreaking and authoritative discussion decenters the popular notion that India was the origin and locus of ideas of rebirth. As Obeyesekere compares responses to the most fundamental questions of human existence, he challenges readers to reexamine accepted ideas about death, cosmology, morality, and eschatology. Obeyesekere's comprehensive inquiry shows that diverse societies have come through independent invention or borrowing to believe in reincarnation as an integral part of their larger cosmological systems. The author brings together into a coherent methodological framework the thought of such diverse thinkers as Weber, Wittgenstein, and Nietzsche. In a contemporary intellectual context that celebrates difference and cultural relativism, this book makes a case for disciplined comparison, a humane view of human nature, and a theoretical understanding of "family resemblances" and differences across great cultural divides.<br>

  Abstract: Renaissance Florence has long been considered the origin in European history of a concern with politics as an autonomous study. Faced with the problems of governing a turbulent but independent republic, anxious to insure her survival in a precarious world that seemed to be ruled only by power, and nourished by the rediscovered political culture of antiquity, thoughtful Florentines, in a process that reached a climax with Machiavclli and Guicciardini, began to articulate realistic principles of political effectiveness and to define its limits.

  Abstract: Georges Bataille and Maurice Blanchot's mutual interest in the Lascaux cave paintings signals their common concern to construct a discourse of origin in relation to art. Both writers consider origin in terms of the anxiety-filled questioning surrounding the ontological and historical aporias that have plagued Western thought, including those that appear under the banner of the Modern and the Postmodern. Both ask: what kind of discourse presides over the disconcerting doubling of reality performed by the first artists? For Bataille, origin is bound up with the ritual significance of eroticism and death as these underpin all forms of artistic endeavour;<br>

Of course, the field has many sources (some modern, some ancient), but ‘the Weimar origins of political theory’ is a key topos. Thus, in 1988, John Gunnell, perhaps the most relentless scholar on this issue, could write that ‘the contemporary estrangement of political theory from political science is in large measure the product of a quarrel that originated in the challenge to the values of US political science<br>

Genealogy, for Foucault, was no longer naïve, in that it no longer searched for the pure origin of things but rather showed how such origins were constituted out of incoherent fragments, accidents, errors, and failings.

  Abstract: In one of his last studies on colonial cinema, Marcel Oms inquires into the question of the genre’s aims and limits.¹ Pertinently, he highlights the near-absence of allusions to military conquest, from Algeria to sub-Saharan Africa to Indochina.

  Abstract: “How does one become the kind of ethical subject Levinas describes?” This question typically emerges in response to discussions about Levinas’s ethical project. In other words, the discussion frequently shifts from the description of the ethical subject to the question of origin: Is Levinas simply describing an ethical subjectivity that already exists or is he describing a subjectivity that is “not yet”? Implicit in these questions is an underlying concern that there is a normative dimension to this ethical subject. And of course, one response to this type of question is simply to say that it is the wrong question<br>

There are many ways of writing the history of anthropology, just as there may exist, in any given society, competing versions of national history or origin myths, promoted by groups or individuals with diverging interests.

  Abstract: The decisive role Thomas Müntzer played during the German Peasants’ War of 1525 and his prophetic statement about the people being free later did encourage Friedrich Engels to see him as a precursor of all later revolutionaries. Engels’s interpretation is deeply influenced by the Left Hegelian historian Wilhelm Zimmermann, himself a politically radical scholar who first identified Thomas Müntzer as a revolutionary figure.¹ Engels sees the incidents during the revolution of 1525 and the following counterrevolution as paradigmatic for the historical dynamic of revolutions in general. Indeed, this also allows him to relocate the historical origin of the communist revolution<br>

  Author(s): HACKETT W. CHRIS<br>
  Abstract: Quiet Powers of the Possible offers an excellent introduction to contemporary French phenomenology through a series of interviews with its most prominent figures. Guided by rigorous questions that push into the most important aspects of the latest phenomenological research, the book gives readers a comprehensive sense of each thinker's intellectual history, motivations, and philosophical commitments. The book introduces readers to debates that have not previously been accessible to the English-speaking world, such as the growing interest in the phenomenological concept of life in its affective and even vital dimensions, the emerging dialogue with the analytic philosophy of mind and language, and reassessments of the so-called theological turn. The diversity of approaches collected here has its origin in a deeper debate about the conceptual and historical foundations of phenomenology itself. In this way the book offers the most accessible and wide-ranging introduction to French phenomenology to have appeared in the English-speaking world to date.<br>

  Abstract: Accomplishing oneself and accomplishing things is a concrete historical process of knowing the world and knowing oneself and reforming the world and refining oneself, which simultaneously generates meaning and produces a world of meaning. The world in-itself cannot pose for itself the question of meaning, which is to say that there is no way to dissociate meaning from one’s own being. Humans question the meaning of the world and the meaning of their own being; therefore, the genesis of meaning owes its origin to the “being” of humans.

  Book Title: Re-treating Religion: Deconstructing Christianity with Jean-Luc Nancy-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Nancy Jean-Luc<br>
  Abstract: One of the most complicated and ambiguous tendencies in contemporary western societies is the phenomenon referred to as the turn to religion.In philosophy, one of the most original thinkers critically questioning this turnis Jean-Luc Nancy. Re-treating Religion is the first volume to analyze his long-term project The Deconstruction of Christianity,especially his major statement of it in Dis-Enclosure.Nancy conceives monotheistic religion and secularization not as opposite worldviews that succeed each other in time but rather as springing from the same history. This history consists in a paradoxical tendency to contest one's own foundations-whether God, truth, origin, humanity, or rationality-as well as to found itself on the void of this contestation. Nancy calls this unique combination of self-contestation and self-foundation the self-deconstructionof the Western world.The book includes discussion with Nancy himself, who contributes a substantial Preambleand a concluding dialogue with the volume editors. The contributions follow Nancy in tracing the complexities of Western culture back to the persistent legacy of monotheism, in order to illuminate the tensions and uncertainties we face in the twenty-first century.<br>

  Abstract: Whereas Part III deals with how the self-deconstruction of monotheism and Christianity entails a poetic mode of language and sense, this part examines how this self-deconstructive moment plays out in art and the image. Nancy suggests that art does not merely illustrate religion. Instead, the two are involved in the same self-deconstructive movement or in a process of a mutual dis-enclosure. Whereas art provides the sensible articulation of the internal destabilization of the religious mode, the unstable core in religion—an origin in its displacement—forms an integral part of the condition of art.<br>

  Book Title: Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the Ethical Self-Christology, Ethics, and Formation<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Elliston Clark J.<br>
  Abstract: Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s work has persistently challenged Christian consciousness due to both his death at the hands of the Nazis and his provocative prison musings about Christian faithfulness in late modernity. Although understandable given the popularity of both narrative trajectories, such selective focus obscures the depth and fecundity of his overall corpus. Bonhoeffer’s early work, and particularly his Christocentric anthropology, grounds his later expressed commitments to responsibility and faithfulness in a “world come of age." While much debate accompanies claims regarding the continuity of Bonhoeffer’s thought, there are central motifs which pervade his work from his doctoral dissertation to the prison writings. This book suggests that a concern for otherness permeates all of Bonhoeffer’s work. Furthermore, Clark Elliston articulates, drawing on Bonhoeffer, a Christian self-defined by its orientation towards otherness. Taking Bonhoeffer as both the origin and point of return, the text engages Emmanuel Levinas and Simone Weil as dialogue partners who likewise stress the role of the other for self-understanding, albeit in diverse ways. By reading Bonhoeffer “through" their voices, one enhances Bonhoeffer’s already fertile understanding of responsibility.<br>

In dialogue with ancient and modern philosophers and theologians, López offers a synthetic, rather than systematic, account of the unity proper to being, the human person, God, and the relations among them. The book shows how contemplation of the triune God of love through Jesus Christ in the Holy Spirit allows us to discover the eternal communion that being is and to which finite being is called. It also illustrates the sense in which God’s gratuitousness unexpectedly offers the human person the possibility to recognize and embrace his origin and destiny, and thus he is given to see and taste in God’s light the ever-fruitful, dramatic, and mysterious positivity of being.<br>

  Abstract: The ultimate, eternal origin of the gift, God the Father, offers the path for understanding the meaning of gift and the unity it posits: eternal communion. Mindful that the Father always remains an evergreater mystery and that even the eyes of faith cannot bear his eternal light (“You cannot bear it now,” John 16: 12; “It has not appeared as yet what we will be,” 1 John 3: 2), this chapter sets out to consider divine fatherhood by reflecting on the meaning of begetting, the constitutive personal property of the first hypostasis of the Trinity.

  Abstract: Biblical texts are not the only ancient texts with a significant interpretative afterlife. Western culture has also had a lengthy relationship of rereading with the literature of ancient Greece and Rome—this is the origin of the “Western philosophical tradition,” which I contrasted with the Jewish tradition of biblical interpretation in chapter one. In this chapter, I will turn to a brief examination of Sophocles’

  Abstract: As the above excerpts indicate, writers of the South Asian diaspora self-consciously foreground their multiply positioned identities. In evoking their “many selves,” South Asian diasporic writers call upon a diverse range of literary fields, at least as they are defined in cultural and national terms. For instance, Cyril Dabydeen, Ottawa’s former poet laureate (1984–87) of Indo-Guyanese origin, can just as readily fall under the rubric of Canadian literature as that of English, Guyanese, Caribbean, Indo-Caribbean, South American, and South Asian literature.

Since knowledge derived from experience can never claim necessity, Kant concludes that such knowledge must be transcendental in origin. His account of how such knowledge is possible focusses on transcendental apperception and the order that it imposes upon the experience.

While scholars have tended to assume with varying degrees of certainty that none of the Evangelist’s words go back to the historical Jesus, the presence of this Semitic material nonetheless requires an accounting for its origin.

Przedstawiona w 1859 r. koncepcja doboru naturalnego jawiła się najpierw jako hipotetyczna alternatywa w stosunku do arystotelesowskiej koncepcji niezmiennych gatunków. Z upływem dalszych badań stawała się ona teorią o wysokim stopniu empirycznego potwierdzenia w dziedzinach tak odległych od siebie, jak anatomia, paleontologia czy genetyka. Współcześnie szeroko pojęty ewolucjonizm traktuje się jako paradygmat metanaukowy, tym sensie, iż teorie przyrodnicze negujące występowanie procesów ewolucyjnych uważane są za wytwory aktywności paranaukowej albo nawet jawnie pseudonaukowej, gdzie ignoruje się<br>

  Abstract: In most public and private universities, students are placed in one or another writing course based on scores from the ACT, SAT or another standardized assessment, such as Accuplacer. As it stands, most writing assessments used to place students measure primarily students’ capacity to demonstrate knowledge of middle-class “Standard Written English” of the essayist bent. We know students of low-income families are likely to achieve lower scores on these aptitude tests. Not surprisingly, a high percentage of students of working-class origin fill basic writing (BW) and first-semester first-year writing (FYW) classrooms. At worst, many of these courses, as well as<br>

  Abstract: As already observed, the void is the place of force’s deployment and, as such, of the implacable conflict that divides and locates men in their opposition. However—and this is the analytical shift that moves in a direction unexplored by Alain—the fact that force deploys in an originary void is not the same as saying that it is the origin of the universe. If things were so, that is, if origin were once again self-coincidental on the side of force, then its plenitude alone would exist rather than the emptiness throughout which it extends.

  Abstract: Introductions to books and collections about Alexander Pushkin tend to begin, especially when their origin is not Russian,
                  with de rigueurnods to the poet’s massive presence in, and seminal influence on, the native culture. Such expository scaffolding falls under the category of preemptive advertising for a figure who, outside his context and more importantly outside his language, has difficulty translating. Thus, from the operas of Glinka, Tchaikovsky, Musorgsky and Rimsky-Korsakov to the stylish illustrations and set designs of Benois, Bilibin, and Dobuzhinsky; from endlessly anthologized paintings by Kiprensky and Repin to ghosts of allusion in better known works by<br>

  Abstract: In this conclusion, I would like to provide an overview that situates Nabokov vis-à-vis the Russian and Western traditions of translation, and to bring together in this context the central issues of Nabokov’s ambivalent relationship to translation. These issues include his origin—his own “secret stem,” leading back to Russian Romanticism—as well as translation as a vehicle for expressing Nabokov’s own strongly held ideas about art. While Nabokov’s practice of translation undergoes significant changes in the course of his career, his adherence to the idea of some “true,” “metaphysical” language—ever elusive and ever present—remains surprisingly constant.<br>

  Abstract: The origin and nature of language as an object of human curiosity is entering its third millenium of study in the Western world. Discussion of this premier semiotic system, language, has ever been suspended in a tension between historiographically so-called Analogists and Anomalists (cf. Colson 1919), be they from among, e.g., the Greek Ancients or from among, e.g., the contemporary Cognitivists. Whether to understand the nature of language as natural or conventional, rule driven or usage bound, regular or irregular and the myriad proximate and distal implications deriving from these Western metaphysical bifurcations remains thus an unabated subliminal, if not<br>

For another, beyond the fact of placing the starting point in life, the central question of his early work illuminates at the same time how “factical life-experience belongs in a wholly originary sense to the problematic of philosophy,”¹ in that<br>

The anthropological turn of modernity, for the sake of pursuing more pressing matters or more deceivingly fundamental issues, presumed that severing the question of God from the inquiry into the human being’s own identity would give wings to the quest for knowledge. Instead, as postmodernity witnesses, this too-often rated “successful” revolution has yielded a radical dissolution of any unifying principle and thus, of man himself.<br>

  Book Title: Rhetorical Invention and Religious Inquiry-New Perspectives<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): OLMSTED WENDY<br>
  Abstract: This exceptional collection of writings offers for the first time a discussion among leading thinkers about the points at which rhetoric and religion illuminate and challenge each other. The contributors to the volume are eminent theorists and critics in rhetoric, theology, and religion, and they address a variety of problems and periods.Together these writings shed light on religion as a human quest and rhetoric as the origin and sustainer of that quest. They show that when pursued with intelligence and sensitivity, rhetorical approaches to religion are capable of revitalizing both language and experience. Rhetorical figures, for example, constitute forms of language that say what cannot be said in any other way, and that move individuals toward religious truths that cannot be known in any other way. When firmly placed within religious, social, and literary history, the convergence of rhetoric and religion brings into focus crucial issues in several fields-including philosophy, psychology, history, and art-and interprets relations among self, language, and world that are central to both past and present cultures.<br>

  Book Title: Homo Narrans-The Poetics and Anthropology of Oral Literature<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Niles John D.<br>
  Abstract: It would be difficult to imagine what human life would be like without stories-from myths recited by Pueblo Indian healers in the kiva, ballads sung in Slovenian market squares, folktales and legends told by the fireside in Italy, to jokes told at a dinner table in Des Moines-for it is chiefly through storytelling that people possess a past. In
      Homo NarransJohn D. Niles explores how human beings shape their world through the stories they tell. The book vividly weaves together the study of Anglo-Saxon literature and culture with the author's own engagements in the field with some of the greatest twentieth-century singers and storytellers in the Scottish tradition. Niles ponders the nature of the storytelling impulse, the social function of narrative, and the role of individual talent in oral tradition. His investigation of the poetics of oral narrative encompasses literary works, such as the epic poems and hymns of early Greece and the Anglo-SaxonBeowulf, texts that we know only through written versions but that are grounded in oral technique. That all forms of narrative, even the most sophisticated genres of contemporary fiction, have their ultimate origin in storytelling is a point that scarcely needs to be argued. Niles's claims here are more ambitious: that oral narrative is and has long been the chief basis of culture itself, that the need to tell stories is what distinguishes humans from all other living creatures.<br>

  Book Title: The Reparative in Narratives-Works of Mourning in Progress<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROSELLO MIREILLE<br>
  Abstract: The authors studied in this book can be visualized as the islands that constitute an unknown, fragile and trembling literary and cultural Francophone archipelago. The archipelago does not appear on any map, in the middle of an ocean whose name we already know. No Francophone anthology would put these authors together as a matter of course because what connects them is a narrative grammar rather than a national origin or even a language. Yet, their writing techniques and their apprehension of the real (the ways in which they know and name the world) both reflect and actively participate in our evolving perception of what Gayatri Spivak calls the “planet”. The Reparative in Narratives argues that argue that they repair trauma through writing. One description of these awe-inspiring, tender and sometimes horrifying tales is that their narrators are survivors who have experienced and sometimes inflicted unspeakable acts of violence. And yet, ultimately, despair, nihilism, cynicism or silence are never the consequences of their encounter with what some quickly call evil. The traumatic event has not killed them and has not killed their desire to write or perform, although the decidedly altered life that they live in the aftermath of the disaster forces them to become different types of storytellers. They are the first-person narrators of their story, and their narration reinvents them as speaking subjects. In turn, this requires that we accept new reading pacts. That pact is a temporal and geographical signature: the reparative narrative needs readers prepared to accept that healing belongs to the realm of possibilities and that exposure and denunciation do not exhaust the victim’s range of possibilities. Rosello contends that this context-specific yet repeating pattern constitutes a response to the contemporary figuration of both globalized and extremely localized types of traumatic memories.<br>

Perhaps, then, it is the utter proximity of these two thoughts, the

  Abstract: G. F. Handel’s oratorios were a development of the later years of his career, being written during the period 1732–1752. Most of the oratorios were “sacred dramas,” that is, operatic versions of Old Testament narratives, and they often had political as well as theological resonances. The oratorios were a chance development, having their origin in a piece written initially by Handel in 1718 or thereabouts for private performance at Cannons, the country seat of James Brydges (later duke of Chandos). The piece in question was

  Book Title: Migrating Texts and Traditions-  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>
  Author(s): Sweet William<br>
  Abstract: There can be little dispute that culture influences philosophy: we see this in the way that classical Greek culture influenced Greek philosophy, that Christianity influenced mediaeval western philosophy, that French culture influenced a range of philosophies in France from Cartesianism to post-modernism, and so on. Yet many philosophical texts and traditions have also been introduced into very different cultures and philosophical traditions than their cultures of origin – through war and colonialization, but also through religion and art, and through commercial relations and globalization. And this raises questions such as: What is it to do French philosophy in Africa, or Analytic philosophy in India, or Buddhist philosophy in North America? This volume examines the phenomenon of the ‘migration’ of philosophical texts and traditions into other cultures, identifies places where it may have succeeded, but also where it has not, and discusses what is presupposed in introducing a text or a tradition into another intellectual culture.<br>

  Book Title: Custodians of the Sacred Mountains-Culture and Society in the Highlands of Bali<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Reuter Thomas A.<br>
  Abstract: Custodians of the Sacred Mountains is the first comprehensive ethnography of the Bali Aga, a large ethnic minority that occupies the island's central highlands. The Bali Aga are popularly viewed as the indigenous counterparts to other Balinese who trace their origin to invaders from the Javanese kingdom of Majapait, who have ruled Bali from the fourteenth century A.D. Although Bali remains one of the most intensely researched localities in the world, the Bali Aga have long been overshadowed by the more exotic courtly culture of the south. A closer analysis of the changing position of the Bali Aga within Balinese society provides a key to understanding the politics and social process of cultural representation in Bali and beyond. The process is marked by a blend of representational competition and cooperation among the Bali Aga themselves, among the Bali Aga and southern Balinese, and later among the island's aristocratic elites and foreign colonizers or scholars, and state authorities. The study of this process raises important issues about the establishment and maintenance of status and power structures at regional, national, and global levels. Custodians of the Sacred Mountains explores the marginalization of the Bali Aga in light of a critical theory of cultural representation and calls for a morally engaged approach to ethnographic research. It proposes an intersubjective and communicative model of human interaction as the foundation for understanding the relative significance of cooperation and competition in the cultural production of knowledge.<br>

In this chapter I examine how a Francophone African woman autobiographer appropriates masculine attributes in order to create a counterdiscourse aimed at criticizing a male-dominated society.

  Abstract: In this powerful work, Susan Friedman moves feminist theory out of paralyzing debates about us and them, white and other, first and third world, and victimizers and victims. Throughout, Friedman adapts current cultural theory from global and transnational studies, anthropology, and geography to challenge modes of thought that exaggerate the boundaries of gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, class, and national origin. The author promotes a transnational and heterogeneous feminism, which, she maintains, can replace the proliferation of feminisms based on difference. She argues for a feminist geopolitical literacy that goes beyond fundamentalist identity politics and absolutist poststructuralist theory, and she continually focuses the reader's attention on those locations where differences are negotiated and transformed.<br>

This is so even despite the fact that throughout urban, enclaved, and economically deprived working-class housing areas in Northern Ireland, young people, and particularly young men, are reported as consistently participating in “low-level” violent activities. While no formal definition of this notion of “low-level” violence exists, its use in the Northern Irish context is widespread. Thoughts vary on the origin of the expression<br>

  Abstract: In the eyes of most scientists, and of educated laypeople, understanding is a central goal of science. In the past centuries scientific research has enormously increased our understanding of the world. Indeed, it seems a commonplace to state that the desire for understanding is a chief motivation for doing science. But despite the prima facie plausibility of these claims, it is not so clear what their precise content is. What do we mean when we say that scientists understand, for example, global climate change?

To reverse Platonism means that we value this world in itself, immanently, and no longer value it in relation to transcendent forms such as the Platonic idea of the good. In other words, the revaluation of existence means that existence is measured neither in terms of an origin from which existence might be said to have fallen nor in terms of an end toward which existence might be said to be advancing.

  Book Title: Material Inscriptions-Rhetorical Reading in Practice and Theory<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Warminski Andrzej<br>
  Abstract: This monograph provides readings of literary and philosophical texts that work through the rhetoric of tropes to the material inscription at the origin of these texts. The book focuses on the practice and pedagogical value of rhetorical reading. Its readings follow an itinerary from poetic texts (such as those by Wordsworth and Keats) through theoretical or philosophical texts (by Descartes and Nietzsche) to narrative fiction (by Henry James). The book also contains two essays on Paul de Man and literary theory and an interview on the topic of "Deconstruction at Yale." All three of these latter texts are explicitly about the inescapable function and importance of the rhetoric of tropes for any critical reading or literary study worthy of the name. As Andrzej Warminski demonstrates, ‘rhetorical reading’ is a species of ‘deconstructive reading’—in the full ‘de Manian’ sense—but one that, rather than harkening back to a past over and done with, would open the texts to a different future. Key Features: New readings of texts by Wordsworth, Keats, Descartes, Nietzsche, and Henry James Essays and an interview on Paul de Man and ‘Deconstruction at Yale’ Reflects on and exemplifies the pedagogical value of ‘de Manian’ rhetorical reading Attempts to open a future for 'deconstructive' or 'de Manian' reading<br>

  Book Title: Post-beur Cinema-North African Émigré and Maghrebi-French Filmmaking in France since 2000<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Higbee Will<br>
  Abstract: Since the early 1980s and the arrival of Beur cinema filmmakers of Maghrebi origin have made a key contribution French cinema's representation of issues such as immigration, integration and national identity. However, they have done so mostly from a position on the margins of the industry. In contrast, since the early 2000s, Maghrebi-French and North African émigré filmmakers have occupied an increasingly prominent position on both sides of the camera, announcing their presence on French screens in a wider range of genres and styles than ever before. This greater visibility and move to the mainstream has not, however, automatically meant that these films have lost any of the social or political relevance. Indeed in the 2000s many of these films have increasingly questioned the boundaries between national, transnational and diasporic cinema, whilst simultaneously demanding, either implicitly or explicitly, a reconsideration of the very difference that has traditionally been seen as a barrier to the successful integration of North African immigrants and their descendants into French society. Through a detailed study of this transformative decade for Maghrebi-French and North African émigré filmmaking in France, this book argues for the emergence of a 'Post-Beur' cinema in the 2000s that is simultaneously global and local in its outlook. Its key features include: A comprehensive overview of the key developments in Maghrebi-French and North African émigré filmmaking in France since the 2000s: counter-heritage cinema and the memorialisation of France’s colonial past; journey narratives and the myth of return; the ‘mainstreaming’ of Maghrebi-French directors and stars; representations of Islam. Detailed case studies of key films from the 2000s that have yet to receive scholarly attention, such as Hors-la-loi, Dernier maquis and Vénus noire.

As a matter of fact,Humanitätis Herder’s all-encompassing concept. All his thinking, writing, and actions were centered around it. In short: Herder was the philosopher ofHumanität.Not only has Herder often been called “the philosopher of humanity”; he has also been accused of being the proponent of a vague “philanthropy.”¹ The fact that scholars<br>

  Abstract: Although an author’s name rarely becomes famous enough to give rise to its own adjective, this honor comes with a price. The phrase is now subject to vague and broad usage that sheds light on neither its object nor its origin. The expression “Kafkaesque” is a case in point. As Rainer Nägele observes, Duden’s definition (“in the manner of Kafka’s description; uncanny and threatening in an enigmatic fashion”) manages to combine tautology with awkwardness.¹ In the English-speaking world the term also denotes the mysterious and unsettling qualities associated with Kafka’s texts, whether manifested in Gregor Samsa’s transformation in

Its action is propelled by a man’s desire to escape from selfhood into love. Faust does not end in a Liebestod, like Romeo and Juliet or Aida. Yet what is at stake is the continuation of Faust’s self-identity in time versus his dissolution, his Entgrenzung, in a timeless moment of bliss. The escape from selfhood into union with another, whether a lover, the world, or God, would be a Liebestod, and there are many echoes of the love-death theme in Faust,<br>

Abstract: Neal‘s account of the origin and early history of the Quakers in
      The History of the Puritanssignals another set of boundaries within the ranks of eighteenth‐century Dssent. Fox’s father is described as a “poor weaver,” which he was not. It is implied that Fox abandoned his apprenticeship to a shoemaker, though in fact he completed it. The account of Fox’s subsequent actions makes no explicit judgment against him, but in its chill distance it adopts the perspective of the powers that be. “It cannot be expected that such an unsettled People should have an uniform System of rational Principles,” Neal haughtily pronounces, and represents the early Quakers as uneducated, devoid of coherent principles, antisocial in their public behavior, and inculcating no secure set of moral values.52Neal’s concluding remarks even endorse the punitive measures of the commonwealth authorities against his fellow Dissenters. He is also icily patronizing about contemporary Quakers: “the Disturbances they gave to the publick Religion for a Course of many Years was so insufferable, that the Magistrates could not avoid punishing them as Disturbers of the Peace; though of late Years they are become a more sober and inoffensive People; and by the Wisdom of their Managers, have formed themselves into a Sort of Body politick.”53<br>

Lane, 1924–66,” inVenice and History: The Collected Papers of Frederic C. Lane(Baltimore, 1966), pp. v–xiii, xv–xviii, 543–49. Lane began graduate work at Harvard in 1925 and completed his Ph.D. in 1930 under the direction of Roland P. Usher. He was a member of the informal East Coast Institute of Entrepreneurial History that preceded the Harvard Research Center in 1947–48, as noted in “The Origin of the Harvard Research Center,”Explorations in Entrepreneurial History1 (January 1949): 2; much later he published one article with the Entrepreneurial History group, “Investment and Usury in Medieval Venice,”Explorations in Entrepreneurial History,2d ser., 2 (1964): 3–15.

Abstract: A clue to that failure can be detected in the very dismay with which defenders of the old rhetoric contemplated a new kind of speech whose norms derived from a new kind of writing. In 1879, for example, at the very moment in which the new managers were turning away from the old rhetoric, a noted belletrist critic, William Mathews, published an elegiac tome called
         Oratory and Orators,in which he complained explicitly about the coincidence of rhetoric’s decline with the emergence of scientific and commercial culture. In a chapter entitled “Is Oratory a Lost Art?” he laments the absence of demand for oratory, even in the political sphere: “The great majority of the questions that now come up for decision by our political assemblies turn on masses of fact, antecedents in blue‐books, tabulated statistics, which all necessitate not only elaborate inquiries, but differences of opinion after the inquiries. The Demosthenic vehemence is, therefore, out of place.” It only remains to summon this vehemence for lamenting the decline of rhetoric, done in by the modern lawyer with his crabbed technicalities, “who has no time to gather the flowers of Parnassus,” and the even more crabbed “man of business, who crams down the throat of his audience a heap of statistical facts.”28Mathews is repelled by something he cannot name exactly, not simply facts or statistics, but thesermoor discourse that has been irrevocably altered by the reign of the document, by genres of writing. This new style of communication is founded on the same act of oblivion Yates sees at the origin of the memo.29<br>

Abstract: The effectiveness of doctrine in forming communities appears to depend, however, on a partial or complete concealment of this sociopolitical function. The outward form of religious doctrines as descriptive statements of objective reality gives the impression that the association of a doctrine with a particular social group is merely accidental. The formation of a religious community appears to be merely symptomatic of the recognition of the propositional truth of a given set of doctrines. This concealment of the community‐forming intent of religious doctrines can perhaps be regarded as an instance of the broader social phenomenon Peter Berger terms “reification,” that is, the apprehension of social reality as grounded in the very nature of things rather than as a product of human activity.
         40Understood in this way, the surface grammar of doctrine conceals the human origin of doctrinal formulations—and therefore that of the institutional processes they regulate—by suggesting that these reflect the very nature of reality. The understanding of doctrines primarily as performative expressions of communal identity implies that classical doctrines have a mythological aspect, in the sense that their appearance as simple representations of objective reality conceals the more complex expressive and regulative dimensions of their meaning.<br>

Abstract: The second, more focused collection of essays, written by Chartier, Alain Boureau, and Cécile Dauphin, demonstrates well the complexity of the field as it is generally practiced in France. A small portion of a much larger collection of work, which appeared originally in French in 1991, this book mines the historical possibilities of one source in particular: letter‐writing manuals. These introductions to literate culture are examined in depth, from the first instances in the late eleventh century (studied by Boureau), through their appropriation by the publishers of the
      bibliothèque bleuein the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (examined by Chartier), to the modern how‐to guides for the socially inexperienced and insecure lower middle classes in the nineteenth century (surveyed by Dauphin). The implications extend far beyond the history of reading, but they center on the obvious disjunction between, on the one hand, the intention and content of the texts, often of ecclesiastical, courtly, and aristocratic origin, and, on the other, the multiple interests and uses of their consumers, the recently literate, urban, middle classes seeking some sense of the cultural norms among the social elite. Revealed throughout the essays is more than the tension between text and reading; it is also the tension between “strategies of domination, whether physical or symbolic, and the inventiveness of appropriation that governs the practices of everyday life” (p. 3).<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur gets the relation of critique and reason right, in Bourgeois’s eyes, as a philosopher who sees imagination tied to thinking at the boundary (not limit) of reason. In a chapter examining Derrida’s views on “sign, time, and trace” (chap. 7), Bourgeois elaborates Derrida’s view that Edmund Husserl’s distinction between meaningful expression and sign depends on a stable borderline between primary and secondary memory (or retention and recollection) in his theory of “the living present” (or duration), which, Derrida asserts, is phenomenologically unavailable. In light of this analysis, Bourgeois draws an interesting contrast between Derrida’s insistence on a discrete closure of meaning and Ricoeur’s theory of language and imagination based in a view of the living present of meaning and experience that refuses such discrete closure. Once more, however, Bourgeois overreaches when he attempts to identify these accurately drawn contrasts with the limit/boundary distinction. In Bourgeois’s reading of Ricoeur, imagination does not produce reason from below (as in Heidegger); rather, “reason itself limits knowledge to experience from above, putting the imagination in a central position both in knowledge and thinking” (p. 131). A productive imagination of living metaphor takes place at the boundary of reason, allowing the living present in meaning and action to escape deconstruction’s critique while still incorporating a positive relation to alterity. Nevertheless, Bourgeois may be drawing the wrong conclusion about these contrasts, for it seems possible to read both Ricoeur and Derrida as seeking to work at the boundary (not limit) of reason and to think somehow the presentation of the Idea in the Kantian sense. Whereas Ricoeur’s theory of metaphor and narrative allows him to present the semantic content of the Ideas of Reason positively, these remain for Derrida (as for Kant) unrepresentable, or “the impossible.” This problem has been Derrida’s enduring concern since h~<br>

Abstract: Here I would argue in similar fashion to Aijaz Ahmed ([
         1987] 1992) that many texts by women of color are not about access to the power to signify or about subverting either the central origin myths of Western culture or myths of original innocence. Texts like Jade Snow Wong’sFifth Chinese Daughter([1950] 1989), Le Ly Hayslip’sWhen Heaven and Earth Changed Places(1989), and Bharati Mukherjee’sJasmine(1989), for instance, affirm to an extent the binaries of Western rationality, modernity, and progress and Eastern irrationality, prejudice, and backwardness. Furthermore, the very assumption that texts by U.S. women of color are centrallyaboutsubverting Western myths suggests that minority texts are significant only insofar as they relate to the center. Many texts by U.S. women of color—Toni Morrison’sBeloved(1987) and Fae Myenne Ng’sBone(1993) are powerful examples—are not fundamentally about subverting Western myths. And simply to suggest that writings about women of color are “repeatedly about writing” is simply to reiterate the discursive postmodern truism that all fiction is metafiction. Moreover, the very distinction between women of color and feminist science fiction writers begs the obvious question: Is Butler (who is included in the category of feminist science fiction) not a woman of color?<br>

Abstract: At the beginning of this essay, we saw that, in the opening part of
      Commentary, Tesauro states that “in the beginning” are imageless concepts and not images. Concepts then metamorphose into figures and finally, by “flying up” beyond the “spheres” of the interlocutor’s (or reader’s) mind, return to their original conceptual nature. In the second panegyricSympathy, Tesauro contends that figurative expression is in fact a manifestation of compassion and grief, of emotional participation. Quoting from Seneca’s fortieth epistle to Lucilius and from the book of Wisdom, Tesauro reminds us that images spring from a “distant and impatient longing.”92If Seneca speaks of “pictures of absent friends,” the biblical author foreshadows Christ’s death on the cross and the shroud. The book of Wisdom describes a “tender father who, when death stole his beloved son away, he stole him back from death by forming a very similar simulacrum (similissimo simulacro).”93At the origin of language thus lies the Father’s mournful longing for the Son, as if the sacrifice and death of the Son were the actual core of the divine.94“Who was the inventor of images,” Tesauro asks himself, “but the ingenious love of a tender father” who formed a picture of his son?95We have seen that, for Tesauro, in the beginning was the Word as metaphor of the Father.<br>

Abstract: The crux of the equality clause is a prohibition of direct and indirect discrimination on grounds of race, gender, sex, pregnancy, marital status, ethnic or social origin, color, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture, language, and birth. Indirect discrimination is discrimination that is neither conscious nor intended and may not even be discernible on the surface, for instance, when something is taken for granted but still has a discriminatory impact and leads to discriminatory effects. Significantly, those who discriminate have what is known as the “onus of proof”: they have to show that they are not discriminating, instead of those who feel discriminated against having to prove their case. This is what makes the equality clause so important: it articulates the principle that all people have equal worth on the basis of their human dignity.<br>

Abstract: But we may at least ask whether Augustine is right to separate imitation and morality so categorically. Augustine’s own cleansing (in effect) of Christian ethics of the
         imitatio Deirests, in the end, on a deep and problematic Platonic assumption: namely, that images as such can imitate only visible appearances in the world. The plausible alternative that Christianity appears largely to have abandoned is that it is possible also to “imitate” the invisible image of God still deep within ourselves, to turn inward toward our own primordial capabilities for mirroring or reflecting our own Creator. If this origin is lost—this origin of origination, if you will—it may still speak to us from within our own mythological human depths. We may still be able to hear the inner command for fruitfulness and multiplication.<br>

Abstract: In applying their social‐contract argument, Frické, Mathiesen, and Fallis point out that the fifth article states that access is not to be decided on the basis of origin, age, background, or views. Again, they argue that the fundamental thrust of the LBR is well intentioned but that the absolutism presents difficulties for praxis. They maintain that the LBR’s literal meaning could be construed as removing moral responsibilities for the welfare of, say, children. It is evident that their argument, consciously or not, meets with approval in many libraries. A recent survey asked a sample of librarians if they favor restricting access to pornographic Web sites in the library (if technology made this possible). A total of 37.3 percent of the respondents were somewhat or strongly in favor of that kind of restriction [
         23, p. 370]. Perhaps the most common example of restriction at this time is the existence of acceptable‐use policies in libraries. For the most part, but not exclusively, these policies refer to electronic resources, such as Internet searching and use. Many types of libraries adopt acceptable‐use policies, but they are most commonly applied in public libraries and school library media centers.

Other purposes extend beyond law and move into the realm of more discretionary information resources.

Author(s): Popkin Jeremy D. <br>
Abstract: This posited, Popkin furnishes a wealth of information on the origins of the historian’s autobiography (Hume, Gibbon, Vico), its nineteenth‐century expressions (Dilthey, Henry Adams), and especially its sociological and literary characteristics during the second half of the twentieth century. Most authors have been white males, from middle‐class backgrounds, nearing the end of distinguished careers. Still, women, minorities (especially Jews), historians of working‐class origin, and middle‐aged authors have made inroads since the 1980s. This produces significant differences: women, for instance, are less likely than men to link their vocation to their teenage interest in history or to depict a nurturing community of scholars. Popkin minimizes, however, the impact of sociology. Commonalities predominate in his analysis. Most historian‐autobiographers, for one, frame their life stories as bildungsroman narratives, in which the author’s personality takes shape through the choice of a vocation. Like Friedrich Meinecke, they tell tales of self‐discovery, free will, and success. Their chronological accounts usually begin with warm childhoods in families that encouraged reading, education, and a thoughtful path toward a meaningful career. They then describe the pivotal apprenticeship and university years, the key mentors, and the decision‐making process through which the authors exercised their will and defined themselves. Theirs is invariably a process of choice rather than conflict or sudden illumination, even if world events captured the imaginations of many budding historians.<br>

Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: Yet, since the Christian model of responsibility rests on a deepened interiority and is the gift of a self‐less other who remains inscrutable, this new model has a definite place for secrecy, for the
      mysterium, for the mystical, unlike the Greco‐Roman version, which is superseded so radically as to break entirely with its memory. Christian responsibility has its origin in a gift, in a “gift that is not a present,” and it is from the outset tied with secrecy for essential reasons. Indeed, as Derrida points out, “a gift that could be recognized as such in the light of day, a gift destined for recognition, would immediately annul itself. The gift is the secret itself.… Secrecy is the last word of the gift which is the last word of the secret” (GD,pp. 29–30). Originating in the elusive event of such a gift, even the transition from Platonism and neo‐Platonism to Christianity remains obscure; it cannot be simply accounted for in positive terms. But since the gift of responsibility is a gift from a self‐effacing Goodness (who holds the human being in its hands from within) to the individual in all his or her creatural singularity, it is “the gift of something that remains inaccessible, unpresentable, and as a consequence secret” (GD,p. 29). The donee is exclusively responsible to the donator, and hence, as Derrida’s discussion of the Abrahamic story of the sacrifice of Isaac in the second half ofThe Gift of Deathdemonstrates, he or she is relieved of the necessity of explaining his or her deeds to others. Indeed, being the unique addressee of the gift, the responsible individual must, at the limit, relate to others in an irresponsible fashion. How he responds to the divine Law remains secret—that is, unaccounted for—and ultimately secret to him‐ or herself as well, for such responsible decision making must, in principle, be unaccountable.<br>

Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: What, then, is Adam and Eve’s contribution to this myth of the origin of evil in the world? The JST account of God’s response to Adam and Eve’s choice to eat the forbidden fruit is consistent in relevant detail to the KJV story. They are driven from the garden that brought forth its fruit spontaneously into a world that requires their labor to sustain them and the new life they will engender. At this point, however, the JST introduces sixteen verses to the KJV text. These verses emphasize that their exile was not only from ease and painlessness but also from God’s presence. Now, instead of God calling upon them, they “called upon the name of the Lord and they heard the voice of the Lord, from the way toward the garden of Eden, speaking unto them. … And he gave unto them commandments.” Here is the next major turn away from the KJV in the JST narrative, resulting in an addition of 600 words to the text. Exile from God’s presence does not put them out of reach of his voice. In Smith’s account, Adam and Eve are taught by heavenly messengers to worship God, offer sacrifice, “repent, and call upon God in the name of the Son for evermore.” They are further told “as thou hast fallen, thou mayest be redeemed, and all mankind, even as many as will.”

Abstract: Vetter,

This he does by setting forth name and form [nāmarūpe]—that about which one cannot say either that it is identical [with brahman] or that it is different [from him;tattvānyatvābhyām anirvacanīya]—as the actual origin of things).<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 527832<br>
Date: 01 2008<br>
Author(s): Scimeca Ross<br>
Abstract: This unique notion of truth for librarianship that we are proposing is derived from what has been called historicism. Historicism is not really a theory of truth as much as it is a theory of knowledge in which the question of objective truth is eliminated. This elimination of objective truth implicit in historicism has been attacked from many quarters. The origin of this theory is J. G. Herder’s
         Reflections on the Philosophy of the History of Man[71]. With regard to the question of truth, historicism interprets both human consciousness and the propositions expressing the nature of humans themselves and all of reality as historically conditioned, even current knowledge [71, pp. 96–104]. Herder looked at the supposed teleological progression of reason and found it often wanting. Nevertheless, he believed that reason and goodness would eventually triumph over irrationalism and human folly [71, pp. 115–18]. Consider the following example that illustrates the difference between historicism and the three theories of truth discussed above. For the historicist, the proposition that the world is the center of the universe was true for the medieval mind. For the correspondence theorist, that proposition is simply false, although the additional fact that the medieval mind accepted this proposition to be true would be conceded. The coherence theorist would say that, although the medieval mind accepted the Aristotelian‐Ptolemaic view of the universe, which in itself is a coherent system of propositions, this coherent system would eventually be supplanted by Copernicus’s view. This revolutionary change in knowledge is often expressed as a paradigm by Thomas Kuhn and other philosophers of science. The historicist would point out that such paradigms of knowledge usually have a localized point of origin and gradually expand to the other areas of scholarship, finally entering the public consciousness, where they are accepted or rejected [67, pp. 160–73]. The historicist ackn~<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Article Title: Dickens and the Narratography of Closure<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 589491<br>
2008<br>
Author(s): Stewart Garrett<br>
Abstract: For the protagonist to become his own lack, of course, is only a felt castration if he feels he has something to lose. And, thanks to Amy, Arthur doesn't realize that anything has been lost, that there has been any story to compare with hers, any love like it, or even one as strong in another and more fundamental way. Yes, in giving up the name Dorrit just before the close of her namesake novel, Amy has become her own antithesis in Mrs. Clennam, agent in turn of the same suppression, with the result that the most insidious role reversal yet, the real identity transfer, is that of Arthur for his own silenced maternal origin. Unprocessed mourning cannibalizes the other whose absence it cannot accept, whose very recognition the narrative has blocked in order to transmute it. As narratography (rather than narratology) is scaled to register along the lexical, syntactic, and figurative terrain of fictional prose itself, the arc of Dickensian plotting cannot afford in full view to lament its founding victim, nor let its hero elegize her, nor let the heroine acknowledge her let alone (and because of) the place she holds in her stead. And not being able to love the mother, or mourn her,
         the son has become her.Here lies the keenest if quietest violence of the novel: the double silencing of male as well as female energy even in their most defining of adult relations and the foisting of all connubial desire onto a life of communal duty instead.<br>

Abstract: Ibid., 8, 49, 61, 77–79, 82, 85, 125. Regarding Edelman’s hypothesis that an order of implication or reflection (rather than of traditional causality) links propositional mental activity to its source in neuroactivity, it is interesting that Paul Ricoeur, without explicit mention of Edelman, traces the origin of the trope of reflection back to Plato’s
            Theaetetus, where Socrates establishes the complex connection between theeidolon, which corresponds in neuroscience to the perceived occurrence in the world, theeikon, which corresponds to the neuroactivity triggered by perception of theeidolon, and thetupos, which corresponds to the mnemonic preservation of the original perception in themnemeof affective remembrance or in theanamnesisof intentional recall.

Abstract: The origin of humanism is often traced back to the second century CE in the West and the concern for good Latin usage.
         Humanitasis also sometimes linked to Greek ideas aboutpaideia, or education, and training in the arts. Yet the idea of humanizing religion, as I have coined it, aims to reclaim insights of ancient thinkers, Hellenistic and biblical, that are lost if we just focus on the history of the idea of humanism.<br>

Author(s): Zimmerman Virginia<br>
Abstract: This interesting work presents fragments and traces from geological and archaeological practices in nineteenth-century Britain and considers their connections with and influence on Victorian literature.
      Excavating Victoriansis not exactly history of science but, rather, a work of literary criticism that draws very heavily on the history of science. Virginia Zimmerman underscores the disjunction between scientific and literary writing as an artifact of our view from the twenty-first century, drawing on Gillian Beer'sDarwin's Plots(Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1983) for useful context and analysis. She identifies the writings of Charles Lyell and Charles Dickens, along with those of their contemporaries, as part of a single body of literature, written in response to the newly discovered vastness of time and to emphasize the authority of the individual to interpret (and thus reclaim) the past. Zimmerman uses the notion of the “trace,” as defined by Paul Ricoeur, to indicate “an object's origin in the past but also its duration into the present” (p. 8); the strategies the Victorians used to cope with this confused temporality is the major resonating theme, along with the continual conjunction of construction and destruction. This juxtaposition of preservation and decay is emphasized throughout: in geology, with the fossil remains of long-extinct species; in archaeology, with the action of Vesuvius that at once destroyed Pompeii and forever preserved its remains (which would otherwise have been lost); and in Victorian London, with the continual building projects that uncovered the traces of Roman occupation.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 603531<br>
Date: 10 2009<br>
Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: This passage establishes a pattern that I feel can clarify Coleridge’s handling of the language of prayer. It is one also familiar in its structure from our torn relationship to the moral law: we are constituted as responsible wills because of our relationship to God, but our violation of the law means that we are fallen and finite, necessarily separate from God’s will. Similarly, according to the
         Opus, we are constituted as rational beings by the light of reason given to us by God, but we possess individual, finite rationality precisely because we are necessarily separate from God’s reason. Now, Coleridge definitely believed language was imbued with Logos and even lent it a divine origin given that it, like morality and rationality, marks us off from the animals: “The very conditions and materials of convention, a society of communicants, presupposes a language. … [It is] inconceivable that language should have been given to a mind that did not contain in itself the grounds and principles of language.”51However, just as our fallen individuality demands a necessary separation from God’s will and God’s reason, our speech would logically mark the same separation. When speaking of God or trying to orient ourselves to God, it is not surprising that human language fails to overcome its own determination by the fallen, alienated world from which it proximately springs—even if it may ultimately come from or reflect or echo the divine Word.<br>

Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: The importance of literature as a political tool is revealed most clearly when we differentiate it from what Jean-Luc Nancy and Phillipe Lacoue-Labarthe, influenced by Blanchot, come to define as myth. They configure myth as “a fiction, in the strong, active sense of ‘fashioning,' . . . whose role is to propose, if not to impose, models or types . . . , types in imitation of which an individual, or a city, or an entire people, can grasp themselves and identify themselves.” Myth creates community by providing a narrative of origin and installs the nexus for the political subject's identification with that community. Myth is thus the mechanism by which social fusion is created. It serves its function when it produces, as Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy write, “a total belief, an immediate, unreserved adhesion to the dreamed figure. . . . It is both the model of identity
         andits present, effective,formedreality.”33In contrast, literature, as Blanchot defines it, would be that mode of speech that mocks any mythic claim to fusion by expressing disjunction. Most importantly it disallows the act of identification that is a form of self-presencing. From its very beginnings, Blanchot's theory of literature zeros in on the capacity of figurative language to disrupt identification.<br>

Issue: 659348<br>
Date: 4 2011<br>
Author(s): Landy Joshua<br>
Abstract: It is true, of course, that we have a much harder time postulating an author for
            Adaptation—that is, working out what an “ideal” Kaufman would have wanted the overall effect of his film to be—than postulating an author for the average Hollywood movie. Still, it is surely not the case thatAdaptation“undermines the concept of the author as a unifying origin and legitimation,” as Karen Diehl claims (Karen Diehl, “Once upon an Adaptation: Traces of the Authorial on Film,” inBooks in Motion: Adaptation, Intertextuality, Authorship, ed. Mireia Aragay [Amsterdam, 2005], p. 100). It may be harder to know what Kaufman is up to than what James Cameron (say) is up to, but Kaufman is clearly up tosomething, and the film bears if anything a more powerful stamp of an original vision than that average movie we find easier to read. In fact,Adaptationhas only solidified Kaufman's reputation as a filmmaker with an idiosyncratic and internally consistent way of seeing the world. (Although cinema is a collaborative enterprise, it is reasonable to imagine Spike Jonze and company collectively seeking to realize Kaufman's design.) Far from putting inherited notions of authorship into question, then, it has comfortably positioned Kaufman as the “unifying origin” of his various works.<br>

Author(s): Csordas Thomas<br>
Abstract: Among the multiple dimensions of social and cultural imagination, morality occupies a blurred place across social domains, being Religion, on the one hand, and Law, on the other, the traditional loci of the moral in classical anthropology. Tom Csordas’s article helps us think beyond tradition, pointing out a little addressed topic in the emerging subfield of the anthropology of morality: the notion of
         evil, which, by the way, was and still is of central concern in shamanic and witchcraft studies, and also in certain currents of contemporary philosophy. This article interrogates us about the possibility of defining morality “as a cultural system,” in Clifford Geertz’s sense. In doing so, the author seems to discard finally the idea of morality as a “cultural system” for a less systematic, dispersed set of moral meanings that traverse social life. In this undertaking he does not leave the central Geertzian concern on symbols and meaning. Ultimately, human action is mediated by symbols that condense and produce meaning. Here, meaning seems to be the master concept related to the anthropological study of morality. Among the cultural meanings that shape moralities, Csordas finds appropriate introducing cross-cultural notions of evil to enrich any anthropological approach to morality. In the multifarious realms of morality, evil appears as a complex idiom or code through which moral notions are expressed. And among cultural practices, witchcraft and sorcery are of central concern to understand how many societies build their moral frameworks. Regarded both as a human and a cosmological (or nonhuman) phenomenon, evil in Csordas’s view as a cross-cultural analytical category, might enlighten studies about what I may call the “moral installation in the world.” The latter is related with the existential approach to morality proposed in this article. But I consider that, in conceptual terms, morality is always hierarchically included in ontology (what is the nature of ~<br>

Abstract: Janet Adelman sees in Lear’s actions “the rage of an abandoned infant.” G. Wilson Knight remarks that the king’s “tremendous soul” is “incongruously geared to a puerile intellect.” According to Knight, “Lear is mentally a child; in passion, a Titan.” For Jan Kott, both Lear and Gloucester are “too ridiculous” to be tragic: they are “clowns who do not yet know they are clowns.” Nowhere is this more apparent than in Gloucester’s attempt to end his life. The attempted suicide, Kott writes, “is merely a circus somersault on an empty stage…the classic expression of buffoonery.” See Janet Adelman,

Article Title: Historicizing Religion: Varro’s<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 674410<br>
Date: 02 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Rüpke Jörg<br>
Abstract: Varro’s
         Antiquitates rerum divinarum, the sixteen books of “Antiquities of things divine,” offers a full-blown systematization of religion at the end of the Roman republic. The work was dedicated in 46 BC to Julius Caesar.
               Its historical component is not to be found in its etiological stories, for instance, the origins of the Sibylline books at Rome (frag. 56).39
            Etiologyis a very special type of dealing with the past. It concentrates on a moment of origin that is thought to sufficiently explain the presence of an institution or monument, be it fully in use or just a dimly noticed survival. Such narratives, etiological myths, make good stories, but they tend to remain isolated. A dozen etiological myths do not make a history. Varro clearly did more than collect such stories. How far he overstepped the bounds of that lesser ambition is difficult to tell. The work’s sixteen volumes survive exclusively in the form of quotations by later, frequently polemical authors, Augustine of Hippo taking pride of place and Tertullian being second.
               What is more, those quotations are often isolated from each other, and Augustine and Tertullian do not deign to indicate the book from whence they quote. My argument is therefore based on the assumptions that their citations from Varro’s work and the ordering of the fragments that they suggest and which modern scholars have reconstructed are reliable. These assumptions are likewise the basis of Burkhard Cardauns’s edition, on which I gratefully rely.40

Article Title: Milton’s “Unoriginal” Voice: Quotation Marks in<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 673750<br>
Date: 08 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Hequembourg Stephen<br>
Abstract: The two lines of inquiry with which I began—the serious question of the origin of human sin and the more academic or editorial one of quotation marks—are finally inextricable. Editors understand how much is at stake in the way we punctuate Milton. In his Norton edition of
         Paradise LostTeskey explains how “the stricter logic of modern punctuation can have a flattening effect on Milton’s verse at some moments, forcing the sense in one direction alone when two possibilities should be held in suspense for a time.”
               I believe that Teskey’s general argument about punctuation should be extended to include quotation marks, particularly in the case of reported speech. While they may be helpful to readers, these subtle typographic marks can mislead us into attributing a radical alterity to words that are, in some sense at least, the speakers’ own—words whose status as “quoted speech” is precisely what Milton urges us to interrogate.42<br>

Abstract: The main thesis of Gottfried Semper's theory states that architecture could be understood in terms of the four primordial and irreducible elements: frame, enclosure, mound, and hearth. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when the exterior walls usually supported the loads from the upper floors and ceiling, Semper's concept that fabric was the origin of the wall constituted the most provocative aspect of his argument. It meant that rather than load-bearing structural element, the wall should be conceived as a skin independent of the frame supporting the roof. See Gottfried Semper,

Abstract: At a time when immanent abandonment of plural marriage was sorely testing the faithful's confidence, rituals commemorating Joseph Smith's birth established three aspects of his legacy as the core of L.D.S self-conception: restored church order, divine authority, and continuing revelation. These three claims, inscribed on the Vermont monument, were given particular force by the church's new Progressive-Era uses of the autobiographical narrative of Joseph Smith's early life. Specifically, during this period the narrative of Smith's original theophany achieved the primacy once accorded plural marriage, allowing the Latter-day Saints to forget as a practical matter, the once-definitive marriage practice. This essay uses theories of narrative and myths of origin to show how uses of Smith's theophany allowed the Latter-day Saints to jettison plural marriage without destroying their identity, much less their confidence in Joseph Smith as church founder.<br>

Article Title: Study Drawings in Architectural Design: Their Properties as a Graphic Medium<br>
Publisher: Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture, Inc.<br>
Issue: i262141<br>
Date: 1 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Tyler Daniel M.<br>
Abstract: This paper proposes a theoretical foundation for extending our understanding of study drawings by bringing forward concepts from a number of disciplines that are concerned with the structure of knowledge. Study drawings are defined as the informal, private drawings that architectural designers use as a medium for graphic thinking in the exploratory stages of their work. Drawings from the work of Paxton through Picasso are analyzed to confirm the familiar characteristics of study drawings and to identify the properties which account for their role in the working process of design, including their use as a means of inquiry. This epistemological function is compared with certain features of written language in order to propose an internal structure for study drawings. The paper concludes that much of the origin and nature of knowledge in design can be explained in terms of the properties and processes of study drawings and that these terms should be used to evaluate proposals for new media in design.<br>

Issue: i263719<br>

Author(s): Whitehead Charles E.<br>
Abstract: The focus of contemporary studies in religion on methodology can be explored as the recognition of a fundamental epistemological problem. This paper is first an acknowledgment that we do not have an adequate conceptuality to render intelligible inward turning and then an experiment with the meaning of intelligibility. The dispossession of consciousness as the sole place and origin of meaning constituting an intellectual aporia is presented as an experience of the subversion of the subject by the discovery of the unconscious in depth psychologies and the discovery of the transcendence of the subject in foundational theologies. Taking account of this duplex expression of what lingers in disguise behind the scripts of ordinary life is defined as a fundamental exigency in the further development of human understanding and theological reflection.<br>

Article Title: The First Evil Will Must Be Incomprehensible: A Critique of Augustine<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263713<br>
Date: 9 1, 1970<br>
Author(s): Teselle Robert F.<br>
Abstract: The thesis of this paper is that an absolute origin of evil, arising from the free will of a creature, must be incomprehensible. Although Augustine occasionally acknowledges this point, nevertheless in a number of better-known passages (chiefly in The City of God) he attempts to give a causal account of the fall of Adam and/or Satan. Much of the subsequent Christian tradition has unfortunately followed his lead, and major recent commentators routinely ignore or passively approve of his conceptual error. Augustine offers three unacceptable explanations of the fall, which conflict variously with his own doctrines of divine omnipotence, the goodness of creation, and creaturely free will and responsibility, as well as violating the canons of sound argumentation and explanation. First, his contention that free creatures made "out of nothing" inevitably fall makes the fall seem ontologically necessary (unfree) and thereby lays the ultimate responsibility for it on the Creator. Second, the appeal to pride as an explanation is a spurious causal account, for "pride" is only a synonym for "fallenness" itself and not a possible antecedent condition in a being created good and not yet fallen. Finally, his assertion that the first sin is intrinsically comprehensible, but not comprehensible to us because we are fallen, is an obfuscation masquerading as an explanation, for we have no warrant for supposing that this assertion is true or even meaningful. Instead of seeking causal explanation Augustine should have stayed with his own wiser observation that an evil will has no efficient cause. Theology of the Augustinian sort (which comprises much of the Christian tradition) ought to concede that the fall as a work of genuine freedom is an absurd "fact," an incomprehensible given which steadfastly and in principle resists causal explanation. The concluding section of the paper draws upon Ricoeur's insights to tell why the narrative structure of the "Adamic myth" (which has important p~<br>

Author(s): Whitehead Madeleine<br>
Abstract: Creativity is seen as inherent in the developmental potential of the individual and of society as well. This "yen for becoming" is felt at all ages, and is in fact recognized as associated with the realization of the profoundest aspirations of man. Its origin is detected in early childhood. It is deeply rooted in the associative trend of thought and action, a trend which tends to perpetuate itself in the direction of unending abundance and novelty. The process assumes passage from awareness to memory, and even to the subconscious. The thought of the moment dips into the past, awakens memories, even those seemingly forgotten, reactivates all that is pertinent for the creation of new structures. It is believed that this tendency is essentially dynamic, endowed with energy which drives toward endless realizations. Nothing dies in the subconscious, as Freud pointed out. Each past experience is apt to return into consciousness and engage in a double process of homogenization and heterogenization, of convergent and divergent currents. Here the combinations, or commutations and permutations, are indefinite, an array which defies any computer. Creativity calls into play all energized experiences, present and stored, cognitive and affective, perceptual and conceptual, sensory and motoric, verbal and non-verbal, taxonomic and functional, real and symbolic; it constantly provokes new patterns. The richer the content of experience, the greater the possibility of innovation. The creative construction starts with the activation of readily available knowledge, the elements of which trigger related material in the memory and the subconscious. The movement is derived from active associations that continue to connect the units, and is oriented toward specific goals, leading to eventual syntheses, which may be expressed in either action or discourse. Here we face an unfurling, which coincides with interpretation, the unlocking of the new meaning built from the past upon the first mean~<br>

Author(s): Cohen-Cheminet Geneviève<br>
Abstract: This paper suggests Charles Reznikoff's poetry should be assessed in its relation to the Jewish hermeneutical tradition. Philosopher Paul Ricœur's quotation in the title, "the very deciphering of life in the mirror of the text," sums up Reznikoff's poetical strategy. He decontextualizes his writing by displacing it towards its hypotextual origin, Jewish and non-Jewish. Reading destabilizes the reader who embraces the poetical text in the mirror of its hypotexts. This move metaphorically takes reading and writing away from their familiar American grounds and paves the way for an ethics of perambulation.<br>

Abstract: Depois de clarificar e distinguir os conceitos de autonomia em Kant e John Stuart Mill, que normalmente se considera estarem na origem do Princípio da Autonomia utilizado em Bioética, os autores mostram que o Princípio de Autonomia da Bioética de inspiração anglo-saxónica tem origem no conceito de autonomia de Mill que, contrariamente ao que se tende a pensar, é uma autonomia limitada por várias razões apontadas pelo autor. Depois de mostrarem o modo de articular autonomia e dignidade na Bioética europeia, distinguem entre autonomia e capacidade de exercício de autonomia, para sublinharem as dificuldades da vivência do princípio. Na parte final, mostram a importância das virtudes para a vivência da autonomia na actividade clínica. After clarifying and distinguishing the concepts of autonomy in Kant and John Stuart Mill, who usually are considered to be the origin of the Principle of Autonomy in Bioethics, the authors show that the Principle of Autonomy in Anglo-Saxon Bioethics stems from the autonomy concept of Mill that, contrary to what we tend to think, is a limited autonomy for several reasons cited by the author. After showing how to articulate autonomy and dignity in European Bioethics, they distinguish between autonomy and ability to exercise autonomy, to underline the difficulties of living the principle. In the final part, they show the importance of the virtues to the experience of autonomy in clinical activity.<br>

Abstract: Cet article analyse les expériences de mobilité interne de femmes atteintes par le VIH résidant au moment des enquêtes ethnographiques dans la ville de Gondar, dans le nord-ouest de l'Éthiopie. Les expériences biographiques de cinq femmes séropositives, vivant dans des conditions de marginalité sociale et originaires de zones rurales, seront étudiées plus largement dans les principales configurations que la mobilité féminine interne prend en fonction de l'âge et de l'origine sociale des sujets migrants. L'article mettra au jour le caractère multiforme et la condition permanente d'instabilité de ces parcours migratoires. Initiés depuis un premier projet de départ, ils se sont poursuivis au fil des opportunités et des contraintes que les femmes migrantes ont rencontrées tout au long de leur parcours de migration dans une tension constante vers un avenir que les expériences biographiques cristallisent comme le temps du changement. Nous démontrerons que l'état de séropositivité au VIH, avec ses manifestations et ses conséquences, apparaît comme un facteur de conditionnement prééminent sans pour autant constituer une « rupture biographique ». Il participe au processus d'« assujettissement » d'individus se situant en marge de la société et des espaces d'action des pouvoirs établis. Plus particulièrement, l'analyse de la relation subjective de ces femmes aux normes et aux catégories du discours dominant présidant à la construction de leur « identité sociale virtuelle », mettra en exergue que le VIH représente à la fois une opportunité et une contrainte dans la détermination de leur relation subjective à l'avenir. This article analyses the experiences of internal mobility of HIV-positive women who at the moment of the ethnographic surveys lived in the city of Gondar, in North Western Ethiopia. The "biographical experiences" of five women who migrated from rural areas and used to live in conditions of social marginality will be placed in the context of a wider analysis of th~<br>

Abstract: 1 deliberately refrain here from saying "the neutrinos as investigated by the physicist." To move
automatically from the former to the latter is the origin of the penchant for idealism in much of con-
temporary history and philosophy of science, for the "as" lifts the neutrino from the level of reality
to that of the scientist's language.<br>

Abstract: This study is based on 150 interviews carried out in three countries among individuals of working class origin who have experienced very rapid social advancement. My approach consists of three stages. First, I establish a typology of the many forms taken by attempts to rehabilitate their working class origins among those interviewed. Second, I draw upon this typology to open up avenues for reflecting on what makes it possible to present working class origins as a resource. In this respect, it would seem that the narrative skill with which this experience is recounted – a matter of genuine social competence – constitutes a decisive factor. The conception of working class origins as a resource is above all permitted by a process of mystification which seeks to obscure the fact that this value is the product of an effort of self-narration. Third, I take a comparative approach to show that such individual strategies of narration remain extremely contingent on the cultural specificities of the countries in which they take place.<br>

Publisher: Brill<br>
Issue: i24707971<br>

Author(s): Morton Herbert Donald<br>
Abstract: In the conception of Dooyeweerd the 'cosmonomic idea' (Dutch: wetsidee) is a limiting
concept within philosophy regarding the coherence, unity and origin of all reality. It refers
by way of philosophical approximation to three boundary problems: the mysteries of the
world, of man, and of God (A New Critique, vol. 1, p. 101). In my view it is not so much
religion (as ultimate commitment) as it is the worldview that can shed light on these mys-
teries, since in the worldview a view of man and a view of God are always inevitably in-
cluded. See A. Kuyper, Lectures and Calvinism, p. 19.<br>

Abstract: Although Dooyeweerd says that "all human acts have their origin in the soul," and
therefore beyond time, he holds that they function only within the temporal structure of the
human body (TM, XX; cf XIV). For this reason he opposes the phenomenology of Husserl and
Scheler, which regards acts as "incorporeal (onlichamelijk), (pure 'psychonomic') intentional
experiences" (TM, XV).<br>

of the plants and the animals, and relative to the history of culture.<br>

Abstract: L'œuvre de François Laplanche prend délibérément pour objet la longue durée : l'exégèse biblique entretient un rapport constant au Texte originel et l'historien ne peut s'exonérer de connaître les interprétations patristiques et médiévales de la Bible. L'histoire d'une pratique de lecture savante est ici réintégrée à l'intérieur de l'ensemble de la culture, de la société et des événements d'une période donnée. Prenant pour centre d'analyse les théologiens calvinistes de Saumur vers 1620-1670, François Laplanche montre que, tandis que leur système demeure arrimé à l'orthodoxie réformée, ils la minent et conduisent à une désacralisation de l'Écriture par un double éloignement : éloignement de l'origine puisque la disqualification de l'Ancien Testament le transforme en objet d'histoire; éloignement de la fin des temps par la récusation catégorique du prophétisme et du millénarisme. The work of François Laplanche deliberately deals with long duration: biblical exegesis maintains a constant relationship to the original Text and the historian cannot exempt himself from knowing the patristic and medieval interpretations of the Bible. The history of scholarly reading is here reinstated within the culture, society and events of a given period. Taking as the center of his analysis the Calvinist theologians of Saumur around 1620-1670, François Laplanche shows that, while their system remains linked to reformed orthodoxy, they are undermining it and go towards a desecration of Scripture via a double remoteness: remoteness from the origin since the disqualification of the Old Testament transforms it into an historical object; remoteness from the end of time via the adamant disqualification of prophecy and millenarianism. La obra de François Laplanche toma deliberadamente como objeto la larga duración: la exégesis bíblica establece una relación constante con el Texto original y el historiador no puede eximirse de conocer las interpretaciones patrísticas y medievales de la Biblia.~<br>

Abstract: In From Beast to the Blonde, Marina Warner studies the status of fairy tales as historical documents which
give an account of women's daily experiences, as they illustrate their particular rites of passage and the relevance
of maternal figures in their lives. The resonance of Mother Goose is taken by Warner "either as a historical source,
or a fantasy of origin" which she can trace into ancient traditions, like the Islamic or the Christian, and which
adds credibility to the stories (1994, xxiii).<br>

Abstract: Societies, like individuals, strive to have positive self-concepts. They endow stories of their origin and associate their course through history with ethical principles that attest to who they are and how they want to be seen. Such principles define the society for its members and for the world at large. But all societies must at some time confront evidence of actions undertaken in their name that violate their fundamental principles and conflict with their desired self-image. Following a glance at the basic elements of the politics of history and identity, the author suggests two sources of the tensions between "bad acts" and positive self-concepts. Both relate to shifts in developmental time. First, actions not considered wrong when they were undertaken in the past are inconsistent with current expectation. Second, transsocietal differences in normative frameworks lead to cross-boundary criticisms of behavior in which the critics' societies likely engaged at an earlier time. Accusations or criticisms generally meet with defensive, often hostile responses. Hypocrisy tends to rule in most cases, with little or no normative learning.<br>

Abstract: From the beginning of his career, sixteenth-century playwright Angelo Beolco (also known as Ruzante, the name of the peasant character he created and played) declared his anguish at the worsening of the peasants' economic and political position. Illegitimate child of the authoritarian patriarch of a minor noble family beginning its decline and (probably) a household servant likely of peasant origin, he appears to have identified with the peasants' exclusion from governing institutions and the blocking of their access to wealth. At first, the Evangelical reform movement, with its emphasis on justice for the poor, appealed to him as an effective instrument for persuading the powerful to correct the situation. That hope having proved illusory, Beolco passed through a rapid evolution of beliefs that calls into question Lucien Febvre's theory of the parameters of religious experience in the Renaissance. The present article explores this evolution.<br>

Abstract: Kearney thus summarizes Kant's "Copernican Revolution": "Being would henceforth
be conceived not as the transcendent origin of meaning, but as a representation of the human
subject—or, more precisely, as a production of the human imagination. This is what Kant had
in mind when he affirmed that 'being is not a real predicate . . . but only the positing of a
thing'" (Wake 157-58<br>

Abstract: First of all an overview is presented of the development in the social sciences that led to postmodernism. The starting point for this is the modernity that was under the influence of Parsons after the second World War. It extended to the Third World mainly in the context of development research. Since the end of the 1970s the contributions of two German scientists, Niklas Luhmann and Jürgen Habermas, have received international recognition. During this time the first critical voices concerning the modernist theories were heard. Among ideas opposing these theories the approaches should be named first, which the author calls "post industrial". To these he counts primarily the analysis of the modern socio-economic system by Daniel Bell and the studies of the "post-material personality" by Ronald Inglehart. Research on the change of values in modern societies should be named in the same context. However, "post-industrial" should not be confused with "post-modern". The origin of the latter term from the "culture scene" is explained. The language of the post-modernists can be viewed as their characteristic, as well as the attempts of deconstruction imprinted by Derrida. Ever since Lyotard the strong bond between the name and the named object within the language has been questioned. Therefore, Jean Baudrillard is correct in noting a loss in the sense of orientation of the modern human being. For example, the works of two post-modernists, Anthony Giddens and Ulrich Beck, are discussed in detail, after which the author concludes: "That is the most important meaning of postmodernity: as a symbol for the weakened autonomy of the sciences and arts, as a lack for the support of sciences in culture and politics". Nevertheless one can observe a return to rationality in recent years.<br>

Abstract: French-speaking academic literature makes abundant use of the notions of anchoring and rootedness when dealing with dwelling and residential practices. Though the metaphoric origin of these notions can be evoked, and even exploited by the authors, it is generally glossed over. This article seeks to revive the metaphorical dimension of these terms by adding two others – mooring and docking. Our goal is twofold. First, we demonstrate that by taking the terms seriously, it is possible to have them designate different types of relationships to place, which directly use underlying images. Second, we discuss how these images participate in the poetics of knowledge that distills the effects of truth, whose motivations must be sought out in the major epistemological options that have been adopted.<br>

Abstract: Garifuna religion is derived from a confluence of Amerindian, African and European antecedents. For the Garifuna in Central America, the spatial focus of authentic religious practice has for over two centuries been that of their former homeland and site of ethnogenesis, the island of St Vincent. It is from St Vincent that the ancestors return, through spirit possession, to join with their living descendants in ritual events. During the last generation, about a third of the population migrated to the US, especially to New York City. This departure created a new diasporic horizon, as the Central American villages left behind now acquired their own aura of ancestral fidelity and religious power. Yet New-York-based Garifuna are now giving attention to the African components of their story of origin, to a degree that has not occurred in homeland villages of Honduras. This essay considers the notion of 'leaving' and 'joining' the African diaspora by examining religious components of Garifuna social formation on St Vincent, the deportation to Central America, and contemporary processes of Africanization being initiated in New York.<br>

Article Title:  Histoire et mémoire chez Péguy <br>
Publisher: Presses de la Fondation nationale des sciences politiques<br>
Issue: i290825<br>
Date: 3 1, 1898<br>
Author(s): Michelet François<br>
Abstract: Pour dépasser les termes du dialogue contemporain sur le "couple mémoire/histoire", pour prolonger aussi la méditation sur le travail de Paul Ricœur qu'il vient de publier dans la Revue historique (n° 619, juillet-septembre 2001), François Bédarida met ses pas dans ceux de Péguy. Un Péguy pour qui "l'histoire et la mémoire forment un angle droit". Tout l'article montre pourtant que Péguy-Janus, fidèle à Bergson, a aussi promis la réconciliation de Mnémosyne et Clio, comme il se doit entre mère et fille. Dans un passage célèbre de Clio, Péguy, on le sait, a soutenu que "l'histoire et la mémoire forment un angle droit". L'article dit l'origine de cette distinction, à l'heure du retournement historiographique conduit par la nouvelle Sorbonne, par Laville, Langlois et Seignobos, ennemis juré du patron des Cahiers de la Quinzaine, grand pourfendeur du "parti intellectuel" et de "l'histoire historisante". Il signale aussi, et très fortement, que Péguy, en bon et fidèle bergsonien, a constamment tenté de dépasser les fausses oppositions entre histoire et mémoire au nom de l'affrontement fécond entre Clio et Chronos, entre le passé et la vie, et qu'il n'a pas cessé de rappeler la haute responsabilité de l'historien dans la compréhension du monde. /// It is well known that in a famous passage in Clio, Péguy said "history and memory form a right angle." The article details the origin of this distinction during the historiographic reversal led by the new Sorbonne, Laville, Langlois and Seignobos, sworn enemies of the director of the Cahiers de la Quinzaine, great destroyer of the "intellectual party" and "historicizing history". It also says that Péguy, the good and faithful Bergsonian, constantly tried to overcome the false oppositions between history and memory in the name of the productive clash between Clio and Chronos, between the past and life, and he never stopped recalling the historian's enormous responsibility in the comprehension of the world.<br>

Author(s): Renaud Michel<br>
Abstract: Vale a pena voltar a analisar a relação entre o mal e a religião em Kant. Mas este artigo aborda a problemática prévia a esta questão, isto é, a própria questão do mal tal como Kant a apresenta na primeira parte do livro de 1793, A religião nos limites da simples razão. Depois da introdução que elucida o espanto dos primeiros leitores deste livro, procura-se, na base da análise hermenêutica dos textos, verificar a articulação entre a disposição originária para o bem e a propensão para o mal. Encontra-se em seguida a aporia da relação entre o desejo e a realidade do mal: de onde provém o desejo do mal moral? Será preciso, no itinerário desta resposta, elucidar o conceito de natureza, bem como a relação com a interpretação kantiana do pecado original. A conclusão volta a introduzir a questão da liberdade na compreensão do mal, numa espécie de tensão pós-kantiana entre moral e metafísica. ///Il convient de réanalyser la relation entre le mal et la religion chez Kant. Le présent article aborde cependant une problématique préalable á celle-ci, á savoir la question meme du mal telle que Kant la présente dans la première partie du livre de 1793, La religion dans les limites de la simple raison. Après l'ntroduction qui rappelle 1'étonnement des premiers lecteurs de ce livre, on essaie, sur la base d'une analyse herméneutique des textes. de discerner l'articulation entre la disposition originaire pour le bien et la propension au mal. On rencontre ensuite l'aporie entre le désir et la rélité du mal: d'où vient le mal? Sur l'itinéraire de cette réponse il faudra éclaircir le concept de nature, ainsi que l'interprétation kantienne du péché originel. La conclusion réintroduit la question de la liberté dans la compréhension du mal, en une sorte de tension post-kantienne entre morale et metaphysique. /// The relation between evil and religion in the philosophy of Kant deserves e renewed analysis. The approach this article takes, however, is to begin by treating a prior problematic~<br>

Author(s): Maldamé Jean-Michel<br>
Abstract: The article aims at a demonstration of the various problems attached to the concordist project. The study begins with a definition of concordism, precisely in order to show that it is derived from the desire of assuring the unity of the human spirit as it is confronted with the great diversity of scientific knowledge, but also that it ends up contradicting this very intention due to its lack of a true spirit of criticism. The article shows also how during the xx! h century the crucial questions to which the concordism related have to do with those pertaining to the origin of the universe, to the formation of the planet earth and to the notion of original sin. However, due to the fact that this last point is, no doubt, the most delicate and sensible one, the article insists particularly on a more detailed analysis of the notion of original sin in a theological perspective, one namely that is coherent with contemporary scientific knowledge. /// O presente artigo tem por objectivo mostrar os impasses a que conduz a atitude concordista em relação aos dados da Ciência e da Teologia. Nesse sentido, o estudo começa por definir o que se entende por concordismo. Mostra-se até que ponto a intenção do concordismo é a de assegurar a unidade do espírito humano confrontado com a diversidade dos saberes, mas também até que ponto essa mesma intenção é traída pela notável ausência de um verdadeiro espírito crítico. Mostra-se também que ao longo do século XX os pontos mais salientes do concordismo têm a ver com as questões ligadas à origem do universo, à formação da terra e ao pecado original Dado, porém, que este último ponto é, sem dúvida, o mais delicado, o autor do artigo detém-se numa análise mais detalhada e situada da noção de pecado original numa perspectiva teológica renovada por virtude dos conhecimentos derivados das ciências naturais.<br>

Abstract: Nous nous proposons ici de réfléchir à la question suivante : Comment expliquer le fait que les fondateurs du « programme fort », Barry Bames et David Bloor, insistent depuis quelques années pour dire qu'ils n'ont jamais nié l'influence de la « réalité » sur la formation des connaissances scientifiques et qu'en fait ils ont été mal compris de leurs lecteurs ? Alors que Bloor tente d'expliquer les malentendus en les situant complètement du côté du récepteur, en invoquant une loi psychologique dite de « conventionalisation » proposée par Frederic Charles Bartlett, nous voulons esquisser ici une explication complémentaire qui se situe du côté de l'émetteur et prend au sérieux la structure argumentaire des textes. We propose in this paper to answer the following question : How can we explain the fact that the founders of the « Strong Program », Barry Bames and David Bloor, insisted, over the last couple of years, to say that they have never denied the role played by « reality » in the construction of scientific knowledge, and thus have been misunderstood by their readers ? Whereas Bloor explains these misunderstandings by invoking a psychological law of « conventionalization » due to Frederic Charles Bartlett, thus locating the source of the problem on the receiver's (reader's) side, we suggest here a complementary explanation taking into account the argumentative structure of the text itself, hence situating the origin of the confusion on the writer's side.<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Abstract: To see, to speak, to think : these are the three main topics of Merleau-Ponty's philosophy, tragically interrupted in 1961. He intended to write two works on The Origin of Truth. To understand the relationship between Merleau-Ponty I and Merleau-Ponty II it is a good lead to pay attention to the relationship between seeing, speaking and thinking. In a central passage of Phenomenology of Perception (p. 451) this relationship is called Fundierung. Merleau-Ponty conceives it as a two way relationship, which excludes every possibility of reducing one term (thinking, reason) to another (perception, language). Yet, at that time he is not able to point out clearly the originality of thinking. L'Oeil et l'Esprit and Le Visible et l'Invisible provide a first outline of l'Origine de la Vérité. The 'second' Merleau-Ponty wants to 'reassume' his whole philosophy in what he calls : fundamental thinking. Painting opens the way to the mystery of seeing : something visible begins to see. Subject and object are no longer opposed to one another ; not even related by intentionality. The new key-word is Ineinander (interrelatedness, to be in one another, chiasm). 'La chair' (the flesh) is a new notion, broader and more fundamental than the body. The sensible reflects upon itself. This 're-flection' (reflexivity or reversibility) is a work of Being. The visible can be seen in principle. Philosophy should accompany the coming-to-see of the visible. In this perspective the transition to thinking (or ideality) must be seen as a new case of 'reversibilité'. The generality of the visible opens up to the 'invisible', that which in principle cannot be seen, but is 'the other side' of the visible. The basic phenomenon of expression is central here. Language is not an absolute starting point. Language is rather a new and more subtile form of coporeity, a new instance of the same basic reversibility, which already contains the seeds of ideality (logos endiathetor). The idea is of the word (logos ~<br>

Abstract: In this paper a distinction is made between two conceptions of the ego in freudian metapsychology. According to the first conception, a conception which Freud never gave up, the ego is conceived as a specific function on the surface of the living organism ; it is the result of a progressive differentiation of the Id ('Es') under the driving power of internal stimuli and external reality. Fitted with specific neutral, i.e. non-conflictual functions as perception, memory, control of the bodily motions and consciousness, the ego has to defend the individual as a biological living organism against the threats from without and within. In this conception the ego is treated as an instance that doesn't take part in the different psychic conflicts. We analyse the philosophical presuppositions and show the metapsychological disadvantages of this hypothesis that has been worked out especially in the American ego-psychology. According to the second conception, that takes into account important clinical pheno mena as identification, idealisation, narcissism, ideal of the ego, the ego is conceived as a metaphorical effect of a specific psychic act. With Lacan, we try to analyse and to interpret this specific act as an act that causes an infinite splitting in the ego : the ego is constituted as a subject that from its origin is separated from itself. Instead of being a biological function that lives in the immediate metonymical prolongiation of the living organism, it rather has to defend a certain representation of himself. This point of view doesn't exclude a purely functional description of the ego ; but the different functions have now to be interpreted differently because the ego is the effect of conflicts in which it takes part (consciousness is interlaced with unconsciousness, perception with denying...). In the last part of our study we show how Freud makes the philosophically important distinction between the ego as an object of the Id and the ego as a subject that has to~<br>

Abstract: L'attachement au pays d'origine est bien analysé pour les diasporas contemporaines afin de démontrer leur dimension transnationale et décrire leurs rapports avec l'État-nation. Pour les XVIe-XVIIIe siècles, en revanche, cette question pourtant fondamentale est minorée au profit des liens entre communautés. Souhaitant sortir des perspectives mono-confessionnelles qui limitent l'historiographie des diasporas modernes, ce travail s'appuie sur l'étude de quatre groupes dispersés : les séfarades, les catholiques britanniques, les huguenots et les morisques. La terre d'origine, qui grave son empreinte culturelle sur la diaspora, constitue un liant structurant fondamental : lieu de l'événement-déclencheur de dispersion et du martyre, elle apparaît comme le front de la résistance qui légitime l'existence de « l'arrière » , la diaspora. Territoire matriciel, souvent mythifié et mobilisé dans les visions messianiques, elle est indissociable de la notion de retour. The attachment to the country of origin is well analyzed for contemporary diasporas to demonstrate their transnational dimension and to describe their relationship with the nation-state. For the sixteenth to the eighteenth century, however, the historiography has emphasized the relationship between communities, overlooking this important issue. Putting aside mono-denominational perspectives, this article offers a new approach to early-modern diasporas by confronting four groups: the Sephardim, the British Catholics, the Huguenots and the Moriscos. The cultural imprint of the homeland was a core structure of diasporas. The locus of both martyrdom and the trigger-event of dispersion, the homeland appeared as the front line of resistance, legitimizing the existence of the "rear", i.e. the Diaspora. Often mythologized and mobilized in messianic visions, this crucial territory was inseparable from the notion of return.<br>

Abstract: Looking at the trajectories of people of Muslim origin in Egypt who express religious doubts, I argue in this article that doubt and nonreligiosity are not necessarily a child of a Christian genealogy of the secular and definitely not alien to Muslims. Instead, we have to understand them as an intimate moral discontent with the contemporary age of Islamic revival, even if their shape and some of their positive claims are borrowed from notions of Western origin and global currency—most notably, human rights and feminism. There are reasons and ways to become a nonbeliever in a society profoundly affected by a religious revival, and these reasons and ways can be telling about the nature of doubt and certainty in general. They also offer a perspective on the problematic of secularism that focuses on issues of belief and existential trust rather than governmentality and discursive power.<br>

Abstract: The analysis of narrative processes and metaphorical language are the topics generally focused on by business ethics researchers interested in the work of Paul Ricœur. Yet his work on political questions also applies to the ethical issues associated with organizations. Ricœur's ethical enterprise can be expressed as a triad composed of ideological, deontological, and sapiential levels, associating ostensibly opposing positions of Aristotelian and Kantian origin. In this study, I examine politics, economics, and ethics in their dialectic relation as established by Ricœur. Against a vertical, mechanistic, and axiologically neutral vision of management, he opposes the two conceptual pairs of conviction/imagination and ideology/utopia as well as a superior definition of justice associating reciprocal indebtedness and mutual disinterestedness. Through this analysis, it becomes clear that the vertical, hierarchical nature of politics tends to undermine the horizontal interactions necessary to procure just institutions in society. And any business ethic that does not acknowledge political tensions will be mute. What is needed instead is practical wisdom that is developed through interaction, and often through conflict, involving all the different players.<br>

Abstract: In the quest for a more sustainable environment, there appears to be a need to confront issues of tradition vs. modernity and culture vs. technology in a world where boundaries once dividing these issues are collapsing, and differences once separating them are disappearing. This study demonstrates, through examination of a series of built examples, the successful integration of tradition and modernity as they are reflected in Muslim cultures. In practice, the notion of culture and technology is addressed through the built context, ultimately establishing the identity of a society through its architecture. This paper argues for the preservation of a culture through understanding the level of symbolism established in its built environment: the higher the level of symbolism, the further detached an artifact becomes from its place of origin. This research focuses on possible scenarios involving the conscious application of past and present typologies of form and technology in search of a recognizable cultural identity.<br>

Author(s): Christoff Daniel<br>
Abstract: La signe comme expression (Husserl) consiste selon F. de Saussure dans le rapport immotivé signifíant-signifíé, sa valeur signifiante étant déterminée par la place du signifiant dans le système réel de la langue tandis que le signifié-concept (de Saussure) est noème, irréel (Husserl). Inerte tant qu'aucun acte d'expression ou de compréhension ne l'anime (ré-anime), il porte, exprime et induit l'intentionnalité de ces actes; il est conscience hors de soi, intentionnalité sans sujet, visée du signifié différenciée par son signifiant (objet d'une science de faits, la linguistique). Aussi les problèmes du «sujet», de l' «origine», de la «suffisance» du signe adéquat, de l'«insuffisance» du signe qui, en son ouverture, exprime au-delà de lui-même, exigent-ils l'élucidation du champ de signification, notamment des figures métonymiques ou métaphoriques qui y apparaissent. According to F. de Saussure a sign or an expression (Husserl) is constituted by the unmotivated relation between the signifier and the signified, the value of the signifier is determined by the position it occupies in the real system of language, while the signified concept (de Saussure) is a noema, i.e. unreal (Husserl). Inactive, as long as there is no act of expression or understanding to (re) activate it, the concept carries the intentionality of these acts, conveys it and leads us to it. It constitutes a consciousness outside of the self, an intentionality without a subject, a target of the signified, as differentiated by the signifier (the object of a science, the linguistics). In this sense the solution to the problems concerning the «subject», the «origin», the «sufficiency» of an adequate sign, the «insufficiency» of a sign, when it signifies things other than itself, requires the clarification of the idea of a field of meaning, especially the meaning of occurring metonymies and metaphors. Das Zeichen als Ausdruck (Husserl) besteht nach F. de Saussure in der unmotivierten Beziehung Bezeichnendes-~<br>

Abstract: Deux tendances radicalement différentes semblent se partager la production historiographique médiévale. L'une, inaugurée par l'Histoire ecclésiastique d'Eusèbe et dominée par les réflexions que lui a consacrées saint Augustin (et de loin la plus importante), s'attache à retracer le destin des hommes appelés à se rassembler au sein de l'Église afin d'être portés vers un avenir qui doit leur permettre de sortir de l'histoire et de se retrouver à la fin des temps au sein de la Cité de Dieu. L'autre, renouant avec la tradition antique rejetée par l'historiographie chrétienne, se consacre à une communauté définie qu'elle pourvoit d'une origine et d'un passé qui fondent son identité et son existence présente, mais qui semblent en même temps constamment menacées par la fiction. Après avoir rappelé le point de vue de saint Augustin, et afin de mettre en lumière cette double orientation, cette étude s'appuie principalement sur l'historiographie des îles britanniques : à l'Histoire ecclésiastique du peuple anglais de Bède répond en effet l'Histoire des rois de Bretagne de Geoffroy de Monmouth. La critique adressée à ce dernier par Guillaume de Newburgh au seuil de son Histoire des choses anglaises, s'en prenant au caractère fictif des événements attribués au roi Arthur et aux prophéties de Merlin, éclaire de manière exemplaire le sens de l'opposition entre une histoire devant aboutir au ciel et celle qui trouve son assise sur la terre. Two conceptions, radically different, seem to share the medieval historiography. The first (and far most important) one, initiated by Eusebius' Ecclesiastical History and dominated by the reflections saint Augustine has devoted to it, recalls the destiny of human beings who should put themselves together under the conduct of the Church, in the expectation of a future which will allow them to get out of History and find themselves at the End of Times inside the City of God. The other one, linked to the tradition produced in Antiquity but rejecte~<br>

Abstract: Cet article offre une vision globale de l'œuvre de Ricœur, l'auteur proposant d'y lire une logique de développement en spirale, parce que dans les ouvrages les plus tardifs du philosophe nous trouvons un retour de la recherche sur la volonté — inscrite dans le cadre d'une anthropologie philosophique — qui avait inspiré son projet de jeunesse. Mouvement en spirale, et non retour circulaire aux origines, car entre le début et la fin il n'y a pas coïncidence mais enrichissement après un long détour à travers l'univers du langage. Ce détour — selon l'hypothèse de travail de l'auteur — progresse à travers trois paradigmes: symbole, texte et traduction. Dans la traduction travaillent le propre et l'étranger, le soi et l'autre, l'autre que nous retrouvons en nous et qui ne se réduit pas à l'altérité de l'autre homme. Un concept pluriel d'humanité — qui est pourtant une — y est à l'oeuvre. Le travail jamais accompli de la traduction suggère enfin l'idée d'une herméneutique de l'inachèvement. This article offers a global vision of Ricœur's work, in which the author suggests the existence of a spiral development, insofar as in the most recent works we find a return to the same research on the will — within the context of a philosophical anthropology — that inspired the project of Ricœur's youthful years. Spiral movement and not circular return to the origin, because the beginning and the end do not coincide but rather enrich one another, after a long detour of many decades through the universe of language. This detour — according to author's working hypothesis — has progressively developed through three paradigms: symbol, text and translation. In translation, what is at work is the familiar and the foreign, the self and the other, the other that we find in ourselves and that cannot be reduced to the otherness of the other man. In translation we find a plural concept of humanity, which is nevertheless one. The never complete work of translation suggests ultimately the idea of ~<br>

Abstract: This contribution is an attempt to continue a dialogue on the issue of reference in biblical text which has its origin in an interchange with Willem Vorster and which is partly documented in the publication Text and reality. In the first section, the continuing relevance of reference is illustrated by a discussion of a number of contemporary Afrikaans historical novels, where the relationship between (historical) narrative and (historical) 'reality' is treated in a very innovative way. In a second section the dynamic nature of reference is discussed in the light of three aspects developed by Ricoeur, namely reference as self-transcendence, as redescription and as an integrative process. In a final section, the inevitable return to reality is explained. It is argued that a better understanding of the function of reference in all its facets holds the key to unlock the transformative potential of these texts in contemporary situations.<br>

Abstract: The term intellectuals(s) has been in use for scarcely more than one century. What is its definition? What conditions of possibility govern the emergence of the Modern intellectual? How many of these conditions can be traced to the past? The typological approach used here sets the origin of the intellectual's role and status in the new paradigm of power established in Carolingian times (781-804), which displayed a peculiar axiom: the idea that all Power is intrinsically divisible. This view was already five centuriesold when Petrarch claimed the autonomous position of cultural critic—not the Modern intellectual's status, but some of his authority, though on different grounds.<br>

La description de ce passé antérieur est tantôt celle de l'état présocial ou de la genèse de l'état social de l'homme, tantôt celle des premiers temps des sociétés grecques, alors tournées vers le « développement » (αύξηθῆναι) et préoccupées de leur « puissance » (δύναμις). L'Archéologie entretient avec le présent une relation de distance et d'interférence. De distance, parce que le recours constant à l'expression τὰπαλαιά pour désigner ce moment marque une intention d'objectivation ; d'interférence, parce que les modèles d'intelligibilité élaborés par Thucydide tout au long de son exposé sont, par leur origine, empruntés au présent. Il montre que les concepts se sont forgés, sedimentes, complexifies au cours de cette forme de préhistoire. L'« Archéologie » décrit à la fois les temps anciens et le présent, le présent dans les temps anciens ; elle recourt à des concepts tirés du présent, mais validés parce qu'ils sont opératoires dans les temps des origines. In the «Archeolog», Thucydides brings into play the modalities and consequences of an omnipresence of the polis, as a total social phenomenon, since the origins, then all along the «former past» (ta palaia), to the present (nun). The description of that former past is sometimes that of a presocial state or of the genesis of man's social condition, sometimes that of the early days of Greek societies then bent on «development» (auxethenai) and concerned by their power (dynamis). The Archeology entertains with the present a relation of distance and interference. One of distance since the permanent resort to the expression ta palaia to designate that moment underscores an objectivying purpose; one of interference, since the patterns of intelligibility worked out ~<br>

Abstract: C'est d'abord s'étonner de la place qu'occupe dans l'œuvre novatrice de Freud la culture antique. Retracer l'itinéraire de la rencontre avec Œdipe, c'est faire comme un état des lieux. L'Interprétation des Rêves, Totem et Tabou, L'Homme Moïse et la religion monothéiste, mais aussi des articles moins connus, des extraits de sa correspondance, contiennent des analyses inattendues, sur l'origine de la tragédie grecque, son évolution, sa fonction, sur la catharsis, le plaisir tragique, etc... Le but n'est pas d'apprécier la pertinence des réponses, mais de dégager l'originalité d'une démarche qui lie fiction et réalité, structure et histoire, passé et présent. And our first response will be to marvel at the importance of the culture of antiquity in Freud’s innovating work. Tracing up the stages of his encounter with Œdipus is tantamount to an inventory of fixtures. The Interpretation of Dreams, Totem and Taboo, The Man Moses and monotheistic religion, but also less known articles and extracts from his correspondence contain unexpected analyses on the origin of Greek tragedy, its evolution, its function, on catharsis, tragic pleasure, etc. Our aim is not to assess the relevance of the answers but to bring out the originality of a procedure that links up fiction and fact, structure and history, past and present<br>

Abstract: La question posée par Pilate à Jésus s'éclaire par l'usage de l'adverbe interrogatif en grec profane et biblique, par le contexte de l'entrevue et surtout par les douze autres emplois de pothen dans l'évangile de Jean. Au-delà de l'origine galiléenne de Jésus de Nazareth est suggérée une autre origine, chez « le Père », « celui qui l'a envoyé ». Cette double origine de Jésus rejoint l'intention principale du quatrième évangile. The question that Pilate puts to Jesus become clear with help of the context and still more in the light of twelve other uses of pothen in the Fourth Gospel, all related to Jesus. Over and above his Galilean origin another origin is suggested, from "the Father", "who has sent him". Such an allusion to Jesus' double origin is at the heart of the Gospel of St. John.<br>

Abstract: Une réflexion générale sur les concepts linguistiques de diachronie et de synchronie pourrait permettre de porter un nouvel éclairage sur l'herméneutique des textes bibliques. La première partie de cet article décrit donc la genèse et l'évolution de la fameuse dichotomie saussurienne, et son incidence dans l'interprétation des textes. Dans une deuxième étape, les deux catégories de Saussure sont confrontées à d'autres perspectives qui permettent de dépasser la tension entre synchronie et diachronie textuelles, notamment l'approche de Guillaume (endochronie), celle de l'herméneutique antique (métachronie) et celle de la pragmatique (autochronie). Cette comparaison débouche sur une réévaluation de la perspective saussurienne en vue de l'étude du signifié, et notamment de celui des textes bibliques. A consideration of the linguistic concepts of diachrony and synchrony could lead to a greater understanding of Biblical hermeneutics. The first part of this article discusses the origin and the evolution of the well known Saussurian dichotomy, as well as its influence on textual interpretation. In the second part the two Saussurian perspectives are compared with other categories allowing us to go beyond synchronie and diachronie textual opposition: those applied by Guillaume (endochrony), by the first to comment on literary texts (metachrony) and by a pragmatic approach (autochrony). Such a comparison permits us to make a new appraisal of the two Saussurian perspectives in order to achieve a better analysis of the signified, especially with respect to Biblical texts.<br>

Abstract: Appliquée au monothéisme trinitaire, cette étude de théologie spéculative se donne un double fondement Elle reçoit la relation de réciprocité entre Jésus-Christ et l'Esprii Saint, telle qu'elle est élaborée par diverses théologies contemporaines de la Révélation et du Salut Elle confirme une autre relation de réciprocité, entre une vérité de manifestation et une vérité de communication, telle qu'elle a pu être éprouvée à travers une réflexion conduite précédemment sur le langage. De cet entrecroisement suit la détermination de l'Esprii comme le Don incréé-indicible, et du Christ comme l'Icône-Parole incréée. Recueillant le Discours du Calvaire et la Parole de Pâques le dédoublement du nom christologique contribue à distinguer la médiation divine du milieu divin. Si la réciprocité du Christ et de l'Esprit rapporte ainsi le Mystère de Dieu à l'unité du Père et de la Révélation, il conviendra de revenir sur les anciens concepts de relation et d'origine, l'un et l'autre étant désormais respectivement accordés à la communication et à la manifestation. Applied to trinitarian monotheism, this study of speculative theology is based on a double foundation. It takes the relationship of reciprocity between Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit as elaborated by various contemporary theologies of revelation and salvation. It confirms another reciprocal relationship, that which exists between a truth of manifestation and a truth of communication as it has been previously established through a reflection on language. From this it follows that the Holy Spirit is the inexpressible, uncreated Gift while Christ is the uncreated Word-Image. Combining the discourse of Calvary and the Message of Easter, the double christological name helps to distinguish the divine mediation from the divine milieu. If the reciprocity of Christ and the Spirit thus relate the mystery of God to the unity of the Father and revelation, then it would be fitting to go back to the ancient concepts of relation and ori~<br>

Abstract: En partant de l'histoire intellectuelle dont nous provenons, puis en retraçant en elle les tensions majeures de l'expérience et du sens, on soutient d'abord ici que le christianisme peut et doit être pour nous un lieu décisif de réflexion philosophique. Cette conviction se confirme à travers le parcours de trois pensées phénoménologiques d'importance – celles de M. Henry, de J. L. Marion et de P. Ricœur – qui abordent selon leur style propre la question du rapport à la « révélation » biblique et évangélique. On débouche ainsi finalement sur un espace à la fois commun et hétérogène : celui de notre monde, soulerrainemenl et diversement travaillé par l'inscription en lui d'une « kénose » d'origine chrétienne qui n'interroge pas moins les constructions philosophiques que théologiques. Beginning with the intellectual history from which we come, then in retracing in it the major tensions of experience and sense, this paper first maintains that Christianity can and must he for us a decisive place for philosophical reflection. This conviction is confirmed through the overview of three important phenomenological lines of thought, those of M. Henry, J. L. Marion and P. Ricœur – who take up, each according to his own style, the question of biblical and evangelical « revelation ». One is thus finally led into a space at once common and heterogeneous: that of our world, clandestinely and variously crafted by the inscription into it of a « kenosis » of Christian origin that questions philosophical constructions no less than theological ones.<br>

Author(s): Labbé Yves<br>
Abstract: En vue de se laisser enseigner par les lettres philosophiques, l'auteur s'applique à reconnaître, depuis Platon jusqu'à Nietzsche, l'insistance et l'existence des questions relatives au mal. La nature (quid), l'origine (unde) et la justification (cur) sollicitent toujours et autrement la pensée du mal. Au commencement, de Plotin à Leibniz, le moment ontologique retravaille la question de la nature à partir de la question de l'origine, mais pour résoudre le mal de la volonté dans le non-être du mal. Il faut que s'affirme avec Kant la préséance du vouloir sur l'être, l'auto-position de la volonté libre, pour que le moment éthique associe l'essence positive du mal à la recherche de son origine. Lorsqu'enfin dans la perspective de Nietzsche s'impose le moment généalogique, la question de la théodicée se transforme en question du langage. Là où se dit la justification de la volonté, c'est une volonté de justification qui parle. L'article se conclut en préparant une pensée du mal qui réunirait l'horizon de l'attente à celui de la genèse. The author, with the aim of being taught by philosophical letters, applies himself to acknowledge from Plato to Nietzsche the persistence and existence of the questions relating to evil. The nature (quid), the origin (unde) and the justification (cur) always and in different ways urge the thought of evil. In the beginning, from Plotin to Leibniz, the metaphysical instance works again at the question of nature starting from the question of origin, but in order to solve the evil of the will power in the non existing of evil. It will need Kant's assertion of the precedency of the will over the being, the auto-position of the free will in order that the ethical moment may associats the positive essence of evil to the search for its origin. When "in fine" the genealogical moment forces itself upon Nietzsche's prospect, the question of theodicy is transformed into one of language. Where the question is a justification of the will, it is the wil~<br>

Date: 3 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Bogel Dianne F.<br>
Abstract: Little Dorrit is both a narrative about authority and an examination of the authority of narrative. The novel links vocation with sonhood and storytelling with fatherhood and self-generation. Little Dorrit, however, tells a double story, of a daughter as well as of a son. If the son's story relates the search to replace the father and to discover paternal authority, the daughter's story details the horrors and consolations of incestuous desire and generational collapse. Storytelling that seeks the father as origin reveals paternal deception and inauthenticity; incestuous structures of desire attempt to collapse genealogy on the hero and heroine, making paternal origin unknowable and creating an overdetermined narrative ending. Dickens' double story, then, identifies yet questions genealogy and the patriarchal family as metaphors for narrative structure.<br>

Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219749<br>
Date: 5 1, 1973<br>
Author(s): White Wayne<br>
Abstract: Literary historians have persistently regarded The Education of Henry Adams as a "paradigmatic" text. While "historical explanations" stress the book's historical achievement, "critical explications" portray it as a failure of historical consciousness that achieves its success in the ahistorical arenas of aesthetic integration and imaginative projection. To relate the products of "explication" with the aims of "historical explanation," I regard the work's true "paradigm achievement" as an inquiry into "historical being." For Adams this achievement embodies disciplinary formulation and professional commitment and thus coordinates historical speculation and self-cultivation. One must assess the ethical density and cultural significance of the text before explaining its historical identity. The Education, despite its origin in epistemological chaos, makes the past eternally relevant to the present; for it is a personal and theoretical discovery of how the narrative structures of history and selfhood create the possibilities of individual and social life.<br>

Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219783<br>
Date: 1 1, 1979<br>
Author(s): Webber John S.<br>
Abstract: Paradise Lost traces evil through three inceptions-Satanic, Adamic, and historical. Each origin seems to envision a different etiology: Satanic evil springs exclusively from the self in an instant of radical "Pelagian" freedom. Adamic evil emerges from the ambiguous interplay between self and seductive environment. Historical evil contaminates the whole race by means of necessary "Augustinian" inheritance. Ricoeur's analysis of the "Adamic Myth" and original sin clarifies etiological traditions Milton assimilates from Christian symbol, myth, and dogma. Through Ricoeur, we can identify the contrasting modalities of evil (inherited and imitative, physical and moral, ontological and existential, necessary and free, communal and individual) fused in Paradise Lost. Ricoeur's work reveals Milton's text to be a subtly inclusive etiological myth, one whose complex genesis of evil recovers Scripture's fullness of meaning in a new mythopoesis.<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: complitstudies.51.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: Tropes for poetic relationality proliferate and concatenate. And there is so much more to say. The topic of poetic copia is indeed so abundant as to suggest myriad forking paths of contemplation and investigation. Hidden within the present reflections are dozens of doors leading to other rooms of thought that this article unfortunately does not have the luxury to open. The poets of the Latin American neobaroque—including Argentines Néstor Perlongher, Osvaldo Lamborghini, and Arturo Carrera, Uruguyans Roberto Echavarren and Eduardo Milán, Cuban American José Kozer, and Peruvian Argentine Reynaldo Jimenez—are in deep dialogue with cannibalistic poetics, as De Campos argues in his analysis of “anthropophagous reason” (which he defines as a “ludic space of polyphony and of language in convulsion”).
         
               In the twentieth and twenty-first century there is also a suggestive plethora of poetic frauds, hoaxes, and impersonations—the Ern Malley hoax and Christopher Reid's143
            Katerina Brac, to name just two. Multilingual poetics, with its play on shifting linguistic identities, interlanguage, and polyphony, presents another avenue that would be fruitful for exploration; as does new media poetics that makes use of digital technology. As cultural processes that mingle past and present texts, such cannibalistic poetry participates in a form of cultural philosophy
               that unseats dualistic notions of genius and non-genius, source and derivative, and argues implicitly or explicitly against the metaphysics of origin.144<br>

Abstract: Apter's book ranges widely across the landscape of contemporary literary studies, philosophy, art, and politics. As she says, rather than offering a comprehensive or programmatic narrative, the volume provides “an array of loosely affiliated topoi—oneworldedness, literary world-systems, terrestrial humanism, checkpoints, theologies of translation, the translational interdiction, pedagogy, authorial deownership, possessive collectivism” (16). If the book eschews any progressively developed argument, it does have a distinct point of origin, in Apter's work as coeditor of a paradoxical project: an English translation—or untranslation—of the
      Vocabulaire européen des philosophies: Dictionnaire des intraduisibles(2006), edited by the Parisian philosopher Barbara Cassin. Focused on the vexed translation history of philosophical terms, theVocabulaire's essays proved to need extensive reworking to become legible for an American audience. Six of Apter's eighteen chapters take up and build on aspects of Cassin's project. Like Cassin, Apter takes a post-Heideggerian approach to language, building on Derrida to argue against Heidegger's linguistic ontology in order to counter a too easy evocation of a world of open communication and the free play of the imagination, speciously unified via a Euro-universalism projected onto the globe at large.<br>

Article Title: What Is Africa to Me?<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jafrireli.1.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 1 1, 2013<br>
Abstract: In their important volume on the history of the geography of continents cited above, Martin Lewis and Karen Wigen devote an entire chapter to the Eurocentric/Afrocentric controversy. Some new light is shed on this debate within this context. Europe, simply as a geographical designation, is already an ambiguous, if not spurious, notion. Its legitimacy is claimed through the invention of its past, and its projection of its meaning within the world is created by navigation of the Atlantic Ocean. The ideology of Europe is not put forward as a limited cultural meaning of thought, truth, or value. Rather, European cultural meanings are assumed to be the correlates of universal values and norms. It is precisely this view of Europe that is being rejected by the Afrocentric camp. In many respects, however, the Afrocentric proponents share many of the structural characteristics of their opponents in their desire to locate and specify the origin of normative human value. For the Afrocentric position, the locus of this value is the continent of Africa. As a matter of fact, the two camps often claim the same personages as members of their respective traditions.

Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Second, this way of characterizing Heidegger is similar to what I would offer, still with sharp differences, regarding Jacques Derrida. I find Derrida's project governed from beginning to end by the nonability of phenomenology (or of any other intellectual undertaking) to
            reachan ultimate of origin. Placing his 1953–54mémoireand two of his books, one large,De la grammatologie(1967; trans. Baltimore, 1974), and one small,Positions(1972; trans. Chicago, 1981), together with the fact that the transformation of the field of philosophic concern was worked entirely in the play of wordings, in the play ofmeaning differentiation and collusion, exhibits the four characteristics I have proposed. For Derrida regularly showed—afterOn GrammatologyandPositions, usually without saying so—how the absolute nonfeasibility of finding origins would undermine any assertion of canonic status and stability for conceptualities. Instead, the very meaningfulness of canonic terminology (a) demanded a freer play of meaning for understanding any such purported paradigmatic sense, (b) showed the nonvalidity of any absolute priority-granting properness to their usage, and (c) exhibited instead their fundamentalrelativity. No other person in phenomenology came close to the effectiveness Derrida showed in this, and very few, so far as I know, recognize the phenomenology-necessitated character of these efforts.<br>

Article Title: Critical Theory<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Critical theory is a metaphor for a certain kind of theoretical orientation which owes its origin to Kant, Hegel and Marx, its systematization to Horkheimer and his associates at the Institute for Social Research in Frankfurt, and its development to successors, particularly to a group led by Jürgen Habermas, who have sustained it under various renditions to the present day. As a term, critical theory is both general and specific. In general it refers to that critical element in German philosophy, which began with Hegel's critique of Kant. More specifically it is associated with a certain orientation toward philosophy, which found its twentieth-century expression in Frankfurt.

Abstract: I believe that in its twenty-fifth year SPEP brought to fruition a movement of incremental postmodern developments and made a full turn out of the modern orientation of its origin. That turn opened a new era for SPEP. Its origin had given SPEP life and vision and played a large role in transforming professional philosophy in the United States as it also transformed into a society that no one could have imagined in 1961.<br>

Journal Title: Shaw<br>
Article Title: Dilemmas and Delusions<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: shaw.34.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 10 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Wixson Christopher<br>
Abstract: Along the same lines, in the preface to
      Man and Superman, he draws a distinction between two states of corporeal infirmity. The first, what he calls “the true joy of life,” results from “the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; the being thoroughly worn out before you are thrown on the scrap heap, the being a force of nature.” The second is engendered by a failure of will and perspective, producing “a feverish selfish little clod of ailments and grievances, complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy.”
            Scholars and biographers have taken both views of Shaw. Countless testimonies of friends and acquaintances as well as innumerable pronouncements by GBS himself laud the extraordinary vibrancy of the “active young revolutionist” following his typical schedule of prolific writing and speech giving.22
         
            At the same time, Shaw's private diaries are replete with meticulous physiological self-examination, documenting his crippling headaches as well as myriad illnesses, injuries, changes in weight and appetite, and suspected symptoms. Robert Brustein attributes “a kind of Swiftian disgust at the human body and its functions” to the playwright, while Sally Peters pathologizes his interest in health, arguing its origin in latent psychosis, specifically an obsessive fear of contagion.23
         
            His commitment to vegetarianism, teetotalism, and Jaegerism, she argues, was founded as much upon hygienic paranoia as moral principle: “Fueled by a “desperate revulsion from body and biology[,] … Shaw's was an ever-lasting defense against dirt, poison, and contamination[,] whatever symbolized to him the form-destroying potencies of existence.”24
         
            In any case, the vexed body, on its way to evolutionary elimination, assiduously preoccupied Shaw, and matters of personal and public wellness remained an idée fixe until the end of his life.25<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: In this light, preaching can be seen as one way to resolve an unfinished “deliberative narrative,” symbolically projecting man's political turmoil, and either his destruction or his cure, into the future. The addition of oppression and liberation to the initial brutish and uncouth condition of mankind in the classical myth transforms the story from a golden age explanation of the civilizing uses of persuasive reasoning into a progressive story of throwing off old orders for the sake of social change. Blair's underlying story of rhetoric blends the classical civilizing myth with the new concepts of taste as inherent to human nature, which seems appropriate to his belletristic approach. This gives him a judgmental or critical function similar to that of the classical forensic rhetorician. Campbell's story of the Crusades and Christian Reformation rhetoric combines an emblematic historical narrative with the original myth, blending in a generalized story of social reform that would be important not only to Protestant demographics in Europe and America but also to historical themes of reform in politics and economics—for instance, in the American jeremiad tradition, a preacherly form of political rhetoric that contributed to Puritan utopian rhetoric and to American protest and campaign rhetoric in general. While the classical origin myth is not future-oriented, the role of the belletristic preacher-orator is, and the combination gives this practice of rhetoric the function of utopian reform rather than an older and simpler model of Golden Age utopianism.<br>
