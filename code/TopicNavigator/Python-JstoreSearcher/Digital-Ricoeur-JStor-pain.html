  Abstract: Traumatic violence has caught Oedipus in an ongoing repetition of mimetic rivalry, rooting him in an eternal present. Compellingly demonstrated not only in
                  Oedipus the Kingbut also inOedipus at Colonus, his trauma is visceral. For Oedipus’s suffering is written on his body: his unsightly face, expressed pain, and profound exhaustion offer graphic testimony.¹ Others reflect back to Oedipus their horror: Oedipusisa polluting presence.² Attentive to Oedipus’s distress, in this chapter I examine the representation of trauma as well as actions that promise to break open constraints on Oedipus, permitting the transformation of Oedipus’s memories.³ InOedipus<br>

  Abstract: Ms. A is a seventy-five-year-old woman with multiple chronic medical problems related to her long history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and smoking. She had two myocardial infarctions that resulted in congestive heart failure. She also has a history of chronic renal failure, emphysema, chronic foot pain, and mild dementia that probably was the result of several small strokes. A working class, Protestant widow, Ms. A had lived in a retirement home for the past few years, where she required some assistance with her activities of daily living.

  Abstract: There is a time of forgiveness. Such a time may arise when the acuteness of the pain stemming from a personal or moral injury has abated, when a relationship that is dear outweighs the hurt of an offense, or when a decision is made to put an end to the cycles of violence and revenge. In a grammatical analogy, forgiveness may be said to be like a period, marking an end—an end to feelings of rancor and resentment toward another. This pointed end gives way to a new beginning, and ideally, this new beginning allows for extraordinarily simple that<br>

  Book Title: Muscially Sublime: Indeterminacy, Infinity, Irresolvability-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wurth Kiene Brillenburg<br>
  Abstract: Musically Sublime rewrites musically the history and philosophy of the sublime. Music enables us to reconsider the traditional course of sublime feeling on a track from pain to pleasure. Resisting the notion that there is a single format for sublime feeling, Wurth shows how, from the mid eighteenth century onward, sublime feeling is, instead, constantly rearticulated in a complex interaction with musicality. Wurth takes as her point of departure Immanuel Kant's Critique of Judgment and Jean-Francois Lyotard's aesthetic writings of the 1980s and 1990s. Kant framed the sublime narratively as an epic of self-transcendence. By contrast, Lyotard sought to substitute open immanence for Kantian transcendence, yet he failed to deconstruct the Kantian epic. The book performs this deconstruction by juxtaposing eighteenth- and nineteenth-century conceptions of the infinite, Sehnsucht, the divided self, and unconscious drives with contemporary readings of instrumental music. Critically assessing Edmund Burke, James Usher, E.T.A. Hoffmann, Novalis, Friedrich Holderlin, Arthur Schopenhauer, Richard Wagner, and Friedrich Nietzsche, this book re-presents the sublime as a feeling that defers resolution and hangs suspended between pain and pleasure. Musically Sublime rewrites the mathematical sublime as differance, while it redresses the dynamical sublime as trauma: unending, undetermined, unresolved. Whereas most musicological studies in this area have focused on traces of the Kantian sublime in Handel, Haydn, and Beethoven, this book calls on the nineteenth-century theorist Arthur Seidl to analyze the sublime of, rather than in, music. It does so by invoking Seidl's concept of formwidrigkeit ("form-contrariness") in juxtaposition with Romantic piano music, (post)modernist musical minimalisms, and Lyotard's postmodern sublime. It presents a sublime of matter, rather than form-performative rather than representational. In doing so, Musically Sublime shows that the binary distinction ~<br>

  Abstract: The sublime is not only duplicitous in its paradox of pleasure and pain, but also in its “double mode” of a quieter and a more violent sublime: what John Baillie called the sedate sublime and the sublime mixed with pathos—and what Kant, of course, called the mathematical and the dynamical sublime.¹ Usually, critics interpret these two varieties of the Kantian sublime experience as pertaining to theoretical or speculative and practical reason respectively. They can, however, also be elucidated by pointing to the eighteenth-century cult of the sublime as being a cult of empty and vast but also of wild<br>

In a book, perhaps, we can measure ourselves and the needs of our era—exposing, feeling, and thinking through the injuries and pain created by structural violence, “fingering its jagged grain,” as Ralph Ellison is oft-quoted to have said of the blues’ musical impulse.¹ That impulse will be needed if we are<br>

  Abstract: Exodus 14, the text of Israel’s deliverance at the Sea of Reeds is very different from either Genesis 12 or Genesis 17. The different genres of Genesis 12 (speech, journey, anecdote) are not present. The sustained divine monologue of Genesis 17 does not recur. Instead, the text is in the form of a report of what happened when the fleeing Israelites were delivered from the pursuing Egyptian force. The paradox has not escaped later rabbis: deliverance for the Israelites means destruction for the Egyptians. In the midst of disturbance, deliverance brings joy; in times of tranquillity, destruction brings pain.<br>

                  Ethics,in which death is portrayed as a saddening thought, one which, moreover, depletes our potential to work and to think. The refusal to think about death, and specifically its association with sadness and pain for those left behind, is a constant theme in the history of philosophy.

  Abstract: In anthropology, the sacred has long been viewed as a unique register of human existence that is at times intimately associated with human suffering in its various forms and manifestations. Often enfolded within such orientations to the potential sacredness of human suffering are associated moral experiences and ethical concerns. Whether understood in the context of painful rituals of initiation, in the light of pain-induced transformations in consciousness, in the context of particular salvational orientations to loss, illness, human finitude, and death, or in the tendency to view suffering as a means of sacrificing one’s own desires for the benefit of<br>

  Abstract: The question of suffering played a prominent part in philosophical reflections until the end of the nineteenth century. In contemporary philosophy, this question is almost entirely forgotten. Of course, one could object to such a claim and suggest that nowadays philosophers address suffering
                  indirectlywhen they turn to the question of pain—an issue by no means uncommon in contemporary philosophical discussions. And yet in these analyses pain is addressed as a phenomenon that falls into the larger class of sensations known as bodily sensations, such as itches, tingles, and tickles.¹ It is highly doubtful whether such a framework can<br>

Building on “a field that defines itself by a neologism (ecocriticism), based on another neologism (ecology)” (7), as Middlebury Shakespearean ecocritic Dan Brayton has recently described ecocriticism, material ecocriticisms seek both to further complicate and to further define what it is that ecocriticism pursues and how.<br>

By ‘evil’ is meant the fact of pain and suffering and the ‘problem’ that it poses for religious belief is not hard to see. How can evil exist in a world created by an omnipotent and omni-benevolent God? For the positive atheist this question exposes an insuperable inconsistency within religious belief, thereby invalidating the claim that any God exists.

  Abstract: In this chapter I suggest that the form-critically identified laments of the Hebrew Bible can be understood via the performance concept of “framing.” In art, drama, and literature the frame lifts the work or event to a heightened consciousness and provides a context for practitioners and audiences to interact. My interest is in the link between frame (form) and content. I argue that the lament form provides a literary framework for the expression of anguish by empowering those who are suffering to name their pain, despite the constraints of the form that generally culminate in a leaning towards hope.

  Abstract: This chapter analyzes a variety of narrative modes that describe, reveal, picture, or convey the experience of pain, especially that of the female body, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Focusing on the discourses of pain popularized by the anti–footbinding movement, I explore the novel conditions that allowed female pain to be narrated, by women or others on their behalf, and the terms of this narration. My main argument is that these conditions and terms bespeak the difficulties involved in the formation of the female “voice” and female “agency”—attributes of the modern female subject—in late<br>

Yet one may be struck how it actually names the principalities and powers (not to mention their main methods of operation) in a personal and presumably private word of comfort. What gives?

Songhay bards study history by "eating the words of the ancestors," and sorcerers learn their art by ingesting particular substances, by testing their flesh with knives, by mastering pain and illness. In

Stoller argues that this attitude is in itself Eurocentric and is particularly inappropriate for anthropologists, who often work in societies in which the notion of text, and textual interpretation, is foreign. ThroughoutSensuous ScholarshipStoller argues for the importance of understanding the "sensuous epistemologies" of many non-Western societies so that we can better understand the societies themselves and what their epistemologies have to teach us about human experience in general.<br>

  Book Title: Poetry as Survival-  Publisher: University of Georgia Press<br>
  Author(s): ORR GREGORY<br>
  Abstract: Intended for general readers and for students and scholars of poetry, Poetry as Survival is a complex and lucid analysis of the powerful role poetry can play in confronting, surviving, and transcending pain and suffering. Gregory Orr draws from a generous array of sources. He weaves discussions of work by Keats, Dickinson, and Whitman with quotes from three-thousand-year-old Egyptian poems, Inuit songs, and Japanese love poems to show that writing personal lyric has helped poets throughout history to process emotional and experiential turmoil, from individual stress to collective grief. More specifically, he considers how the acts of writing, reading, and listening to lyric bring ordering powers to the chaos that surrounds us. Moving into more contemporary work, Orr looks at the poetry of Sylvia Plath, Stanley Kunitz, and Theodore Roethke, poets who relied on their own work to get through painful psychological experiences. As a poet who has experienced considerable trauma--especially as a child--Orr refers to the damaging experiences of his past and to the role poetry played in his ability to recover and survive. His personal narrative makes all the more poignant and vivid Orr's claims for lyric poetry's power as a tool for healing. Poetry as Survival is a memorable and inspiring introduction to lyric poetry's capacity to help us find safety and comfort in a threatening world.<br>

Adorno’s original dictum in 1949 about the supposed barbarity of writing poetry “after Auschwitz,” debates over the ethics of literary representation of the Holocaust have revolved around the problems inherent in depicting, in particular, the suffering of the victims and survivors. Adorno later linked his misgivings about poetry after the Holocaust to his objection to the aesthetic pleasure the reader (or spectator) experiences upon contemplating works of art that portray physical suffering: “the so-called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people being beaten to the ground by rifle-butts contains, however remotely, the power to elicit<br>

  Book Title: Illness as Narrative-  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Jurecic Ann<br>
  Abstract: For most of literary history, personal confessions about illness were considered too intimate to share publicly. By the mid-twentieth century, however, a series of events set the stage for the emergence of the illness narrative. The increase of chronic disease, the transformation of medicine into big business, the women's health movement, the AIDS/HIV pandemic, the advent of inexpensive paperbacks, and the rise of self-publishing all contributed to the proliferation of narratives about encounters with medicine and mortality.While the illness narrative is now a staple of the publishing industry, the genre itself has posed a problem for literary studies. What is the role of criticism in relation to personal accounts of suffering? Can these narratives be judged on aesthetic grounds? Are they a collective expression of the lost intimacy of the patient-doctor relationship? Is their function thus instrumental-to elicit the reader's empathy?To answer these questions, Ann Jurecic turns to major works on pain and suffering by Susan Sontag, Elaine Scarry, and Eve Sedgwick and reads these alongside illness narratives by Jean-Dominique Bauby, Reynolds Price, and Anne Fadiman, among others. In the process, she defines the subgenres of risk and pain narratives and explores a range of critical responses guided, alternately, by narrative empathy, the hermeneutics of suspicion, and the practice of reparative reading.
      Illness as Narrativeseeks to draw wider attention to this form of life writing and to argue for new approaches to both literary criticism and teaching narrative. Jurecic calls for a practice that's both compassionate and critical. She asks that we consider why writers compose stories of illness, how readers receive them, and how both use these narratives to make meaning of human fragility and mortality.<br>

For understandable reasons, however, prime ministers, premiers, and others in high political office have been inclined to view the business of bestowing discretionary rewards — that is, the dispensing of patronage — in a less altruistic light, and their power over it as less of a blessing than, as Brian Mulroney put it, “a pain in the neck” (Simpson, 1988:355).<br>

  Abstract: The use of anesthesia in surgery spread quickly once it had been discovered.¹ Nineteenth-century doctors who adopted anesthesia selected which patients needed it and which deserved it; they thought some people’s pain more serious than others; some people were thought to be hardy enough to withstand pain. Both the medical literature and actual medical practices during the nineteenth century distinguished people’s need for painkillers on the basis of race, gender, ethnicity, age, temperament, personal habits, and economic class. Women, for example, were thought to need painkillers more than men; the rich and educated more than the poor and uneducated. How<br>

  Abstract: In Swedish folklore in Finland the devil was regarded as a helper when a woman was in pain giving birth to her child. Alternatively, he helped a mother to make her unwanted baby disappear. In this paper I shall consider the folklore texts as complements to the creation myth in Genesis. My inspiration comes from theories on intertextuality. I combine these thoughts with studies of tricksters and culture heroes. Although the Finland-Swedish folklore records do not refer to the Bible 
                     expressis verbis, I find it possible to understand them as inverted extensions of the Judeo-Christian creation myth.<br>

Abstract: Later exegesis endowed the body of the blessed with the qualities of impassibility, brightness, agility, and subtility. All resurrected bodies will be incorruptible; but only those of the blessed will be impassible, feeling no pain or discomfort. Brightness will be their proper “glory,” and it will be proportionate to merit.
         51Agility, the capacity of moving with total freedom and celerity, represents the opposite of the terrestrial body’s weakness; it is consistent with the resurrected Christ’s capacity to pass through material objects. Subtility expresses the peculiar spirituality of a body governed by the soul but incapable, in turn, to affect it.<br>

Abstract: A study of emotion work at the Buffalo Club could benefit from attention to culture in interaction, too. Such a study might start by observing that many Buffaloes came to the club from jobs as data entry clerks, mall cashiers, maintenance personnel, and short‐distance truck drivers. The researcher could say that the club’s emotion rules offered a necessary antidote to their dehumanizing work lives. Here, if nowhere else, they could appreciate each other for just being human. This analysis would make sense, but it would make the emotion work seem more inevitably, causally related to inequality than it is. Members of other nonelite groups have tried to inoculate themselves against the pain of dehumanizing work differently—by complaining to each other, or rebelling, or cultivating a skill together, or trying to be just like their bosses, or turning to God and prayer and song, for some possibilities. The insults of dreary, low‐status work loomed large, but the workplaces did not say to Buffaloes, “Tease each other, as the only realistic vaccination against the insults we give you all day!”<br>

Abstract: By unfolding itself and making itself visible through the machine, Hawking’s flesh‐and‐blood body calls into question that which constitutes the primacy of the body itself, distinguishing it definitively from other objects. The body can’t be “a mere object of which he is conscious as he is of every other ‘thing’ in the world.” If so, he would have “embraced the position of the ‘pure subject’ who is a
         spectatorbefore the world and also before his own body which he considers as part of the world of objects.”55Because “in so far as it sees or touches the world, my body can therefore be neither seen nor touched. What prevents its ever being an object, ever being ‘completely constituted’ is that it is that by which there are objects. It is neither tangible nor visible in so far as it is that which sees and touches.”56Indeed, “I am not in front of my body, I am in it, or rather I am it.”57In other words, the perceiving body is always behind the perceived object, which is why my body “offers itself obstinately ‘from the same side’ without my being able to go around it.”58In a way we can say that Hawking’s flesh‐and‐blood body is registering in the same text as his speech; they both appear on the screen in front of him. Without this work of objectification of the body, Hawking cannot be his body. The body is felt but also represented as an exterior thing before it can do anything. With him the distinction between body‐object and body‐subject disappears. The human body conceived as a body‐object, that is, which “allows between its parts or between itself and other objects only external or mechanical relations” has become his own body or the body‐subject, that is, “‘his’ body as the center of ‘his’ existence, as the power both to act and to perceive and as a means for the subject to be part of the world.”59We thus see the movement of a certain form of absence‐presence that characterizes the body as Leder described it, but in another form. For Leder, the body is alway~<br>

Abstract: For instance, when I find myself in a medicalized situation (e.g., admittance to the hospital, removal of clothing, transfer to surgery, the reading of test results, submission to treatment), I become a medical object. Or more precisely, the hospital technology’s inevitable hold of power over me eliminates in me anything that will not reduce to a medical object. Under the gaze of medical personnel, and very soon under my own gaze, the treatment of my sick body will lead to its interpretation according to the parameters of physical bodies (size, quantification, measurements, etc.), with the result that my living flesh will disappear. Soon I will no longer feel the fact that I feel myself: anesthesia will not only deliver me from my pain, but also from my suffering self, and thus from my self’s self‐suffering. Next, every nonobjective function will disappear from this self (me), and my flesh, or that which is animated within me, will become an animal‐machine. This medical definition of my body as an object will also allow for the distinction of health from sickness in terms of norms. Thus is opened the fearful region in which man can make decisions about the normality, and thus the life and death, of other human beings—because these human beings have become simple human objects.<br>

Abstract: Balliani, “Ragionamento I,” in
            Ragionamenti, 39–40. A similar concept is treated in “Ragionamento IX” (Ragionamenti, 337), where Balliani reminds us that God ordered Moses to place a vase full of water at the entrance of the tabernacle where the high priests could wash their hands. Moses also put some mirrors in which the priests could check if they had any stains to wash off (Exodus 38). In the powerful “Ode in honor della Sacratissima Sindone” (published at the end of Agaffino Solaro’sSindone evangelica, historica, theologica[Turin: Cavalleris, 1627], n.p.), Guido Casoni expands the metaphor of the shroud as “divine mirror of eternal beauties” (verse 15), in which “the loving soul contemplates and sees / glory in torments and mercy in pain” (verses 31–32). Two short quotations from Casoni’s poem on the shroud had already been published in Quarantotto’sLa Sacra Sindone, 13, 19. Let us remember that the image of Christ as a mirror reflecting our own humanity is the core of St. Clare of Assisi’s mysticism. InThe Fourth Letter to Agnes of Prague, Clare suggests that Agnes “look daily into this mirror and continually study [her] face in it” (St. Clare of Assisi, “The Fourth Letter,” inFranciscan Christology, trans. Eric Doyle, 37). In “The Third Letter,” Clare speaks of the “mirror of eternity” (speculo eternitatis; 33).<br>

Abstract: While giggles erupted from all corners of the room, I couldn’t help wondering if the constant assertion of God’s control over events didn’t in some way diminish these students’ sense of moral obligation to act in the world. After all, if all events follow God’s plan, regardless of what one chooses to do, why then act in ways that risk one’s safety?
            16Why “follow God’s law” if you can experience God’s history, and live and die within God’s embrace, feeling less pain than those who are not saved? If you’re saved through belief, then what propels ethical action? Mrs. Barrett herself had said that the Al Qaeda attackers had “seized the power that should have been given to God and didn’t allow God to work through the situation.” Was the Holocaust a situation that God “ought to work through” or one where people ought to intervene? Only one student, Kira, eventually volunteered that she would hide Jews, that she would choose God’s laws over the Gestapo’s, regardless of the risks to herself and her family.<br>

Abstract: Richard Kearney has recently developed a poetic phenomenology in which moral life is understood as narrative in a similarly radical sense. Kearney argues that human relations call for constant narrative undoing and retelling because they are inherently fragile, finite, and in need of disruption by others. “Our very existence is narrative, for the task of every finite being is to make some sense of what surpasses its limits—that strange, transcendent otherness which haunts and obsesses us, from without and from within.”
         27Ethical narration expresses a core human capability for making coherent meaning within the actual limits, strangers, mysteries, and possibilities of one’s surrounding world. “The challenge,” according to Kearney, “is to envisage the existence of a narrative self prepared to work through the pain of the past in dialogue with its Others … [forming] a narrative identity woven from its own histories and those of others.”28(Note here the somewhat Freudian language again of “working through.”) The moral task involves an endless narrative “interlacing of alterities” into new and more fully shared narratives of an ever more radically loving and hopeful kind.29<br>

Abstract: The chapter “Nobody's Weakness” closes with Arthur ruminating gloomily (and rather opaquely) about how “it might be better to flow away monotonously, like the river, and to compound for its insensibility to happiness with its insensibility to pain” (
            LD,p. 200). Though “flow away” seems at first only a metaphor, so abstract and disembodied is the reverie that there is a kind of phantasmal grammatical alternative trickling into the melancholic drift of the prose. In this way that second infinitive of compensation or complementation may also faintly evoke a sense that Arthur indeed wishes to mix materially with the lethal waters, literally (and more idiomatically) to “compound … with” them.<br>

Abstract: Marcel understands that no preconceived notion of life and death, either materialistic or spiritualistic, may help him recover his “mutual predestination” with the soul of his grandmother. All he has to start from is “the originality of his pain”; he must “respect [it]” and follow therefore the logic, which death substituted to the cohesion of his and his grandmother’s souls, “of the mutual grafting in [him] of survival and nothingness.” This logic is bound to remain “incomprehensible” both to his “intelligence” and to his “faint‐heartedness” (which in this specific instance stands for an indolent facet of personal will). But it would be wrong to domesticate, as “intelligence and will” are eager to do, this incomprehensible logic by attributing the consolation of a life‐after‐death to his grandmother. His grandmother’s soul may only be resurrected via the resurrection of Marcel’s lost self, the self that was his soul at the time when his grandmother and he shared a “mutual predestination.” In order to attain the “resurrection” of his own self, Marcel evades the control of intelligence and volition by taking refuge in the world of sleep; and in “the organic depth … of his own viscera,” which stands here for the symbol of his own mortality, he finds the self that his grandmother’s death took away from him. “World of sleep in which our inner awareness, subordinated to the troubles of our organs, speeds up our heartbeat or our respiration, because the same dose of fright, of sadness, of remorse acts with a power a hundred times greater when thus injected into our veins; as soon as we start cruising on the black streams of our own blood as if on the sixfold coils of an inner Lethe, to travel the arteries of the buried city, tall solemn figures appear to us, approach us and then walk away, leaving us in tears.”

Abstract: Viewing grief and indignation as potentially virtuous seems odd given the tendency to construe virtue in positive terms, as ennobling or self‐enhancing. We typically associate the virtues with a good and genuinely happy life, and surely those positive features characterize the virtues.
         49But that fact should not prevent us from seeing how responses to loss and disconnection can also be expressions of moral excellence. Virtue, Aristotle writes, means feeling pleasure and pain in the right way. Schooled in the virtues, we should feel “at the right times, with reference to the right objects, towards the right people, with the right motive, and in the right way,” as he says of strong and noble character.50Casting similar ideas in Christian terms, Augustine writes, “Citizens of the Holy City of God, as they live by God’s standards in the pilgrimage of this present life, feel fear and desire, pain and gladness in conformity with the holy Scriptures and sound doctrine; and because their love is right, all these feelings are right in them.”51<br>

Abstract: It is utterly clear that Faustus's inner life is tortured. The longing and the sense of exile invoked by his cries (“see, see where Christ's blood streams…one drop would save my soul…ah my Christ”) are utterly palpable yet horribly answered by sharp internal pain, as if an invisible claw slashed at Faustus's heart for its very longing (“Ah, rend not my heart for naming of Christ”). And by this rending sharpness Faustus becomes all the more alienated from mercy, as if he were confronted with the hallucination of Christ's blood disappearing (“Where is it now? ’Tis gone”), or as if God himself looked down in the sternest, most unforgiving judgment (“see where God / Stretcheth out his arm, and bends his ireful brows!”). But what makes God seem entirely confounding is not merely that he seems to all too ready to squash Faustus, as if Marlowe's hero were nothing more than a scurrying, terrified bug, but also that Faustus himself finally seems horrified by damnation yet remains utterly exiled and bereft of any chance for his soul to find rest because he manifests the very same habit of mind he displayed in his opening soliloquy. He still feels that he can live only in his body, addressing the earth as if it could hide him from God by hiding his body (“Then will I headlong run into the earth: Earth gape! O no, it will not harbor me” [5.2.87]). He still feels like salvation is an annihilation worse than death, and for that very reason he cannot help but prefer either to be in endless pain in hell or to have no soul at all (“O no end is limited to damned souls! / Why wert thou not a creature wanting soul?” [5.2.104–5]). And he still thinks that his soul is flesh and that his flesh will endure forever in hell (“Now body, turn to air, / Or Lucifer will bear thee quick to hell / O soul, be changed into little water drops, / And fall into the ocean, ne'er to be found” [5.2.116–19]). Thus he can do nothing but call on God in a gasping panic (“My God, My God!” he cries, just before~<br>

Abstract: As an analytic category, evil needs to be understood in terms of qualitative distinctions between victims and perpetrators, social actors targeted as “motive” or “consequence” of the actions of others, active infliction of pain or passive suffering of afflictions. However, as the cases of child witchcraft considered by Csordas demonstrate, the practical logic of evil may blur or twist the clear positioning of “victim” and “perpetrator” when the “sign of affliction” is transposed into a “sign of evil.” Do witchcraft and sorcery thus provide a kind of key for theorizing the role of evil as situated human activity more generally, as Csordas suggests? Or is the practical logic of evil also discernible in violent human encounters framed in other moral terms? Such as, for example, in the recent revelations about the activities of a Neo-Nazi group in Germany responsible for the brutal killings of nine men with a Turkish immigrant background, all of them owners of a family business, over the last decade? One of the reasons for the apparent incapacity of the German police to solve the case for years does indeed seem to depend on the twisted logic turning the signs of affliction into signs of (potential) evil. The police categorically excluded the possibility of right-wing xenophobic motives from the start and assumed instead that the murders must be either motivated by cultural sentiments (honor killings) or by crimes attributed predominantly to “foreigners” (drug and human trafficking). A book written by the daughter of one of the victims vividly describes the destructive effects of how being suspected as a perpetrator when one experiences loss, damage, and suffering because of—in this instance—racial hatred generate illness on a personal level, suspicion and distrust on the collective one, as well as an overall feeling of injustice. The case is, of course, more complex than I could allude to it here.<br>

Abstract: As audience members, we may want to give ourselves entirely to Cordelia, but a part of us will always be attentive to the actor: to her skill in simulating loss (How believable this is!), to her success in evoking our wonder (What a remarkable performance!)—even to her safety in the final scene (Is the actor playing Lear going to be able to carry her safely?). The artificiality of the event intrudes. It divides our attention and makes us see double. Knowing that this is a simulation, we cannot fully commit ourselves to the characters on the stage. We may feel their grief and pain, but our experience of it is diminished by the knowledge that it is dissembled. Thus, at the same time that
      King Leardemands our response, it also constrains it. The play preaches the importance of an ethical openness it does not altogether allow.<br>

Abstract: Michael Schoenfeldt has recently argued that such communal or social interaction was imagined as having analgesic effects in the early modern period and particularly in the work of Shakespeare. He suggests that moralizing about the pain of others, as in a tragedy, could be seen as an attempt to “inoculate ourselves against its frighteningly random patterns and its even more terrifying excesses” (“Shakespearean Pain,” in
         Shakespearean Sensations: Experiencing Literature in Early Modern England, ed. Katharine A. Craik and Tanya Pollard [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013], 195, 201).<br>

Article Title: 'Getting out and Getting Away': Women's Narratives of Class Mobility<br>
Publisher: Taylor & Francis Group<br>
Issue: i260667<br>
Date: 10 1, 1931<br>
Author(s): Woolf Steph<br>
Abstract: This article is concerned with the ways in which women narrate a move from a 'working-class' position to a position marked (in however fragmentary and complex a way) as 'middle class'. While such a move might be seen in terms of a straightforward escape from a disadvantaged social position, I argue here that what has to be analysed is the pain and the sense of estrangement associated with this class movement. Drawing on the class narratives of a group of seven white British women, the article uses Bourdieu's concepts of symbolic capital and habitus to explore the cultural and symbolic configurations of class. These configurations may be inscribed into the self, so that the self, itself, is class marked. Since working-class selves are frequently marked in pathological terms, this raises particular difficulties for the idea of an 'escape' from such a position. Class in this sense is embedded in people's history and so cannot be so easily 'escaped'. The usual conventions of life-narratives - in which the self remains the same entity from birth to death and later events are a culmination of earlier ones - are also disrupted in this case. But if a working-class position is marked as pathological, so too is taking on the markers of middle-class existence. to do so is not only to risk 'getting it wrong', but it is also to risk the scorn attached to 'pretentiousness'. There is a particular jeopardy here for women, since it is women who have been especially associated with desires for artefacts associated with bourgeois existence. The article argues for a focus for classed desires and class envy, not in pathological terms, but in terms of a coherent response to political and social exclusions.<br>

Author(s): Throop C. Jason<br>
Abstract: Drawing from research conducted on the personal, cultural, and moral significance of pain on the island of Yap (Waqab), Federated States of Micronesia, I argue in this article that one possible root to reincorporating empathy within the context of contemporary culture theory is to uncover the cultural and phenomenological ways that understandings of empathy and what constitutes authentic empathetic acts are shaped. After briefly examining foundational philosophical definitions of empathy, the article advances a number of differing cultural phenomenological orientations implicated in the experience and expression of empathy. These orientations are understood to help to foreground the place of empathy in what may otherwise be viewed as a general reluctance to engage in empathetic attunement in Yapese society.<br>

Abstract: In this article I examine Christopher Reeve's memoir Still Me, in which Reeve explores the painful and traumatic shift from his previous able-body to his present disabled body. I explore not only the way in which Reeve struggles with his public image as Superman, but also the way in which Reeve's narrative continually fast forwards through episodes of pain and suffering, in order to keep the strong and powerful image of the Super-Crip intact.<br>

Abstract: Finke, pp. 41-42: "In the Middle Ages, torture was not regarded simply as a form of
punishment. It was, as Foucault has shown, a technique and a ritual, a semiotic system which 'must
mark the victim.' Torture inscribed on the victim's body the 'signs' of the ruler's power. It was
one of the most visible displays of that power, an art, 'an entire poetic' that competed with other
visual displays of theocratic rule. The marking of the victim's body signifies the power that
punishes. "In the 'excesses' of torture, a whole economy of power is invested". In her excesses,
the mystic becomes at once both torturer and victim. This, it seems to me, is the whole point. The
mystic's pain - her inflicting of wounds upon herself — grants her the authority to speak and be
heard."<br>

Abstract: This article presents critical psychology in some new light. First, it presents the history of US critical psychology in terms of the overall foundation of its critique (identity-based, ideologically-based, and epistemologically-based). Second, it broadens the population that can be called critical psychologists. The argument is made to include: (1) philosophers of language, science, and mind critical of psychology's foundational assumptions, conceptions, and methods of inquiry; and (2) non-professional, ordinary people who live their lives critical of psychology by eschewing mainstream approaches and taking alternative routes to getting help with their emotional and physical pain, or the education of their children. Third, the article discusses ontology-based critique through the example of the practical-critical theory/practice of social therapy.<br>

Abstract: Il avait publié en 1967 Dieu est mort en Jésus-Christ, un livre de référence pour une géné-
ration de chrétiens de gauche d'orientation marxiste (Bordeaux, éditions Ducros). Il y défend
l'idée que le message et la mort de Jésus critiquent radicalement l'idée de Dieu « Père tout-
puissant», et même l'idée de Dieu tout court. Cardonnel paraphrase ici le verset d'Isaïe 58,6:
« Ne savez-vous pas quel est le jeûne que je préfère? Rompre les chaînes injustes, renvoyer
libres tous les opprimés, briser tous les jougs, partager ton pain avec l'affamé... »<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i24484208<br>
Date: 8 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): da Silva António Barbosa<br>
Abstract: The purpose of this theoretical article is to discuss the existential and universal feature of suffering—as illustrated by Job's suffering in the Book of Job in the Bible and by the survivors of the 2004 Asian tsunami catastrophe—and to highlight its significance for health care. Further, the study is aiming at contributing to health professionals' understanding of patients' suffering. The sources are narratives, comprising Job's book, TV interviews 1 year after the tsunami catastrophe and the survivors' autobiographies. The methodological approach is a philosophical analysis. The existential, universal, ontological and epistemological aspects of suffering are carefully scrutinized to unveil the universal and existential versus culture-specific features of suffering. Based on the results, the authors' recommendations are (1) a holistic concept of the patient and health care has to seriously consider suffering in all its complexity because when a person is in pain, it is not his/her body but the whole person as a unity of body, psyche and spirit that suffers and (2) suffering should be seen as the most central concept of health care, which should provide treatment for physical pain and all dimensions of suffering: physical, social, mental and spiritual aspects.<br>

Abstract: "Members of our species are peculiarly
festooned with prepositions, with relational and functional connectives. If we are,
visibly, islands, we are genetically and culturally linked by ties of love and hate, by the
pleasure bond, by the pain bond, by the duty chain, by noblesse oblige, or by innate
or induced needs for dominance or submission. We are for, against, with, toward,
above, below, against, within, outside, or without one another. If we could make a
psychosomatogram of a member of our species, it would not be smoothly nude but
sprouting with prepositional lines and plugs, and pitted with prepositional holes" (p.

Abstract: This review explores the most significant dimensions and findings of phenomenological approaches in anthropology. We spell out the motives and implications inherent in such approaches, chronicle their historical dimensions and precursors, and address the ways in which they have contributed to analytic perspectives employed in anthropology. This article canvasses phenomenologically oriented research in anthropology on a number of topics, including political relations and violence; language and discourse; neurophenomenology; emotion; embodiment and bodiliness; illness and healing; pain and suffering; aging, dying, and death; sensory perception and experience; subjectivity; intersubjectivity and sociality; empathy; morality; religious experience; art, aesthetics, and creativity; narrative and storytelling; time and temporality; and senses of place. We examine, and propose salient responses to, the main critiques of phenomenological approaches in anthropology, and we also take note of some of the most pressing and generative avenues of research and thought in phenomenologically oriented anthropology.<br>

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i40059165<br>

Author(s): Larkin Craig<br>
Abstract: This article seeks to address how Lebanese youth are dealing with the legacy of civil war (1975-90), given the national backdrop of official silence, persisting injustice, and competing memory discourses. Drawing on Marianne Hirsch's concept of postmemory, it explores the memory of a generation of Lebanese who have grown up dominated not by traumatic events but by narrative accounts of events that preceded their birth. This residual form of memory carries and connects with the pain of others, suffusing temporal frames and liminal positions. The article examines how postmemory is mediated and transformed through the mnemonic lenses of visual landscapes and oral narratives. Consideration is given to the dynamic production of "memoryscapes"—memories of violence localized in particular sites—and to narrative constructions of the past implicated in the ongoing search for meaning, historical truth, and identity. This article seeks to challenge pervasive notions of Lebanese postwar amnesia and of a generational detachment from the residual effects and future implications of war recollections.<br>

Abstract: This paper attempts to compare two lives, that of Ramana Maharshi, the beloved cereberal sage of South India, and Sigmund Freud, the founding father of psychoanalysis. Much has been written on both these individuals, so what this paper does is to focus on affliction as a source of insight about life, detachment, pain, existentialism and coping. By taking narratives which delineate a historical plane on which illness can be coded, I try to understand the anthromorphic nature of suffering and its consequences in these two great lives. Individuals reflect the culture of which they are a part, so what we receive through the narratives which tell us about them is significant in terms of their similarities and their differences. Who authors narratives which we analyse is of utmost significance, and both feminism and narrative analyses looks at social anthropology as benefiting from the question of the writing subject. The Nirvana principle works in Ramana Maharshi's case to create a comfort zone for helping us to think of death as dream, in Freud it works as a comfort zone to cope with existence. Human beings work with ideas in order to evaluate the nature of life and survival, or with death as an attribute which too is natural and part of the order of reality. Paul Ricoeur's work helps me to build a bridge between the two thinkers, Ramana Maharshi and Freud, in terms of the application of the concepts of Eros, Thanatos and Ananke.<br>

Abstract: From the Balfour declaration of 1917 to the birth of Israel in 1948 a great catastrophe (Nakba) crashed down on Palestine which afterwards got worse with the exodus of the major part of Palestinian population and reached an highest point with the arab defeat of 1967 (Naksa,). During the following period (Nahda) the Palestinians pursued an increasing visibility through military resistance, Intifadah, political initiative and cultural mobilization. The Author stigmatizes the mistakes of Palestinian leaders as well as the colonial policy carried on by Israel. Recollecting the experience of the South-African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, he thinks that a true reconciliation between Palestinians and Israelis will be impossible if they don't enter in a different mood, forgiving about Nakba and Shoah respectively and trying to convert their common pain and sorrow into hope and confidence in a shared future. Depuis la déclaration Balfour de 1917 jusqu'á la résolution du partage-découpage de la Palestine en 1947 et á la création d'Israël en 1948 la Palestine fit l'expérience d'une grande catastrophe (Nakba), qui devint tragique dans les années suivantes lorsqu'on assista á un véritable éclatement du corps social palestinien et culmina dans la défaite de 1967 (Naksaj. L'aprés-guerre de 1967 marqua un tournant majeur dans la mesure où les Palestiniens accédérent á la visibilité par la resistance militaire, par le soulévement dans les territoires occupés (Intifadah), par l'inititaive politique et par la mobilisation culturelle (Nahda). L'Auteur stigmatise soit les erreurs commis par les directions palestiniennes soit la politique coloniale pratiquée par Israël. Il voit dans l'obsession du Nakba pour les uns et de la Shoah pour les autres des obstacles qu'ilfaut dépasser pour ouvrir la voie d'une réconciliation véritable entre Palestiniens et Israéliens.<br>

Publisher: Universitätsverlag WINTER GmbH<br>
Issue: i40138275<br>
Date: 1 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): de Marco Alessandra<br>
Abstract: The present paper investigates Don DeLillo's 1972 End Zone, arguing that football is a metaphor for war and that DeLillo's analysis of football and its culture effectively constitutes a critique of the war mentality undergirding American society. In this novel DeLillo meditates on the historical process that historian Michael S. Sherry calls the "militarization" (xi) of the USA and that, since the 1930s, turned the country into a military and economic superpower allowing a war mentality to enter deep into the grain of American culture. The essay will read DeLillo's focus on language against Nicholas Abraham and Maria Torok's psychoanalytical theories on demetaphorization as the linguistic counterpart of melancholia and against Herbert Marcuse's notion of functional language as a linguistic behavior that facilitates the annihilation of critical thinking. Both functional language and demetaphorization allow militarization to enforce its own discourse. Suffering from melancholia, the novel's protagonists fall prey to incorporation, a process whereby they disavow death as the product of war and, with it, pain, suffering, and destruction. As a result, the novel offers a cautionary tale about the consequences arising from an excessive exaltation of war as a means through which a nation seeks to affirm its "apotheosis" (End Zone 162).<br>

Abstract: Neste ensaio, entrelaço fios de vidas das mulheres negras que estáo atadas óï fio da minha vida. Com os fios soltos das canções de Zezé Motta e dos escritos da filósofa Hannah Arendt, teço este texto-existência. Na leitura dos ensaios e poemas de Marlene Nourbese Philip, escritora afro-caribenha, me inspiro não só para resistir às amarras culturais hegemônicas, mas também para transcendê-las, criando possibilidades de escrita que vincule a dinâmica da fala com a dinámica da ocóo, compondo um texto que se movimenta ora como dança, através do espaço, ora como urna canção, ritmada pelo tempo, pois criar e dançar uma coreografia é uma forma de fazer historia. Como investiga Selma Treviños, trata-se de urna ferramenta para animar o passado ou uma "escrita" acerca de algo que já foi feito, se concordamos que cada corpo carrega sua pròpria história e individualidade, memòria, sentimentos e emoções. Na busca do entendimento desta minha breve existência, danço, escrevo, teço palavras com fios desfiados da flor do útero das minhas ancestrais. Vasculho minhas lembranças e, na memória corporal, decifro a dor, encontró a raiz da violência, observo o medo, destilo a alegría, enfeito a doçura, mergulho na paz e conheço a liberdade. In that essay I interweave threads of the black women's lives that are tied to the thread of my life. With the free threads of Zezé Motta's songs and of philosopher Hannah Arendfs writings, I weave this text-existence. In the reading of the essay and poems of Marlene NourbeSe Philip, writer Afro-Caribbean, I am inspired not only to resist the hegemonic cultural ties, but also transcend them, creating possibilities of writing that links the dynamics of the speech with the dynamics of the action, to compose a text that is moved some times as a dance through the space, other times as a song, with its rhythm determinedby time, because creating and dancing a choreography is a form of making history. As investigates Selma Treviños it is a tool to encourage th~<br>

Abstract: Pour expliquer le suicide des agriculteurs, les médias se limitent généralement au seul facteur économique. Une approche comprehensive de cette question révèle d'autres conditions objectives de production de ce qu'on peut appeler la « souffrance sociale ». Le déséquilibre structurel entre l'organisation prescrite et l'organisation réelle du travail génère chez les agriculteurs un sentiment de pénibilité mentale. Tenus de répondre à des impératifs d'autonomie et de réalisation de soi, ces derniers ne disposent pas tous des mêmes ressources sociales pour parvenir à une image positive d'eux-mêmes. Pour se développer, la souffrance suicidaire s'appuie en effet sur la distribution inégale du capital économique, culturel et d'autochtonie. When explaining suicide among farmers, the media tend to focus exclusively on economic factors. This paper argues that adopting a more comprehensive approach to the issue highlights other conditions of production of what might be termed "social suffering". It is suggested that the structural imbalance between the prescribed and actual organization of work causes mental pain among farmers. The paper argues that amid increasing pressure to demonstrate greater autonomy and self-realization, farmers may not have the same social resources for developing a positive self-image. Research shows that an unequal distribution of economic and cultural capital and capital of autochtony leads to increased suicidal thoughts.<br>

Publisher: SAGE<br>
Issue: i40178171<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Johnson Nuala C<br>
Abstract: Drawing on the theoretical insights of Paul Ricoeur this paper investigates the geographies of public remembrance in a post-conflict society. In Northern Ireland, where political divisions have found expression through acts of extreme violence over the past 30 years, questions of memory and an amnesty for forgetting have particular resonance both at the individual and societal level, and render Ricoeur's framework particularly prescient. Since the signing of the Belfast Agreement in 1998, initiating the Peace Process through consociational structures, discovering a nomenclature and set of practices which would aid in the rapprochement of a deeply divided society has presented a complex array of issues. In this paper I examine the various practices of public remembrance of the 1998 bombing of Omagh as a means of understanding how memory-spaces evolve in a post-conflict context. In Omagh there were a variety of commemorative practices instituted and each, in turn, adopted a different contour towards achieving reconciliation with the violence and grief of the bombing. In particular the Garden of Light project is analysed as a collective monument which, with light as its metaphysical centre, invited the populace to reflect backward on the pain of the bombing while at the same time enabling the society to look forward toward a peaceful future where a politics of hope might eclipse a politics of despair.<br>

Abstract: Violent appropriation of sovereignty and the articulation of the experience of oppression are also at issue in M. NourbeSe Philip's
         She Tries Her Tongue, Her Silence Softly Breaks. Philip, a Canadian poet born in Moriah, Trinidad and Tobago, addresses the silencing and sexual assault of women in conjunction with colonial history in the Americas. The Ovidian figure of Philomela, who was raped and had her tongue torn out so that she could not relate what had happened to her, is central toShe Tries Her Tongue. Persephone's search for Ceres is another major theme. Philip foregrounds the problem of “the mother tongue” as she reworks Ovidian myths with excerpts from invented didactic texts (such as language tests, which are akin to those of Theresa Hak Kyung Cha'sDicteeor Myung-Mi Kim'sCommons, both of which also problematize language acquisition as an engine of hegemony). Some invented texts offer recommendations for the treatment of slaves: “Edict II: Every slave caught speaking his native language shall be severely punished. Where necessary, removal of the tongue is recommended. The offending organ, when removed, should be hung on high in a central place, so that all may see and tremble” (“Discourse on the Logic of Language”).
               Philip destabilizes the notion of a linguistically unified Caribbean history by mixing genres and weaving the demotic with Latin citations, as McMorris notes: “It's difficult to tell at first glance whether or not the poet has invented her ‘quoted’ texts, and this keeps things unsettled, shadowy, and undecided. In the later poems of the book, where the imitation of other genres takes place, we hover between belief and doubt, unable without a quantity of research to separate the fabrication from the real. It's as if Philip wants to contaminate the library of Western disciplines—founded in the Latin language—by destroying our confidence in the truth of its texts.”125

Abstract: The nostalgic strategies that Fitzgerald used in
         Gatsbyare then part of a more general nostalgic inclination in modernist writing. Jay Gatsby's peculiar and pathetic gesture, stretching “out his hand desperately” (153) toward the past, illustrates both modern nostalgia's teleological concern and entropic vision of modernity, and the melancholia and pain involved in this retrospection. However, Fitzgerald's particular use of narrative aesthetics integrated in a grander nostalgic scheme of creating a phenomenological experience of nostalgia, a nostalgic novel rather than a novel about nostalgia, is only rivalled, in his own time, by Virginia Woolf. InTo The Lighthouse(1927) she uses a similar structure. The death of Mrs. Ramsay, as well as the whole middle chapter in which it occurs, titled “Time Passes,” becomes a structural break in the narrative, clearly dividing the story tobeforeandafterthe war. Although not entirely uncritical of the Victorian manners of pre-war Britain, what remains is still an idyllic “airy sunny garden” (141) that is constantly revoked by the surviving characters in the last chapter, “The Lighthouse.”<br>

Abstract: Dekuah is a spirit child whose goal is to punish its birthing family, as it is bound to slip into the birthing mother's womb again, only to die again after birth. It is to be assumed that Dekuah is a gratuitously malignant spirit that delights in the pain of the persons who gave it life. Some children, according to this mythology, succeed in being born up to three times. There is an obvious influence of Wole Soyinka's poem “Abiku” on Jabbeh Wesley's uses of Dekuah in her poetry. In “Abiku,” the spirit child boasts in the first stanza that there is nothing his birthing family can do to keep him in the land of the living:
         
               
         In vain your bangles cast
               Charmed circles at my feet

Abstract: Without sovereignty and without ownership, we are responsible for what we cannot and do not control, for our unconscious fears and desires and their effects on others. The fragile hope is that by acknowledging the death drive within ourselves, we can begin to prevent killing and never give up trying to find ways to abolish death penalties in all their forms. The death drive is not the Kantian notion of death as the great equalizer but, rather, the tension in life itself, both destructive and creative, always conjoined with both pleasure and pain, joy and sorrow, and the ambiguities of life that not only exceed but also expose the fantasy of death as an absolute end point or final resting place. Far from the Perpetual Peace of the Dutch innkeeper's sign, with which Kant ironically opens his essay, the death drive is the force that fuels the fantasy of the end of life as everlasting peace.<br>

Abstract: The point here is that whoever I am in terms of my personal identity and my capacity or incapacity to identify myself through sortal terms as a being in the world with others, I will have no doubt who is in pain or who will have the pain. Here, again, is a sense of “I” in which I can be aware of myself and refer to myself without it being necessary to employ any nonindexical or third-personal referents.<br>

Abstract: Nonetheless, the cost of what increasingly felt like a quixotic struggle for a mere critic was high. In a November 1897 review titled “On Pleasure Bent,” Shaw views his job as corporeal trauma, concluding that “trials [as a theater critic] have injured my brain.”
      
            He relates that he has lately “suffered … from seeing Shakespeare butchered to make a cockney's holiday” and determined to have a “real experience of some kind, under conditions, especially as regards fresh air, as unlike those of the stalls as possible” (378, 372). To remedy the toxic, stuffy artificiality of the theater, he heads “into the country, [selects] a dangerous hill, and [rides] down it on a bicycle at full speed in the darkest part of the night” (373, 372–73). When the doctor apologizes for the pain attendant upon stitching up the resulting “excessive openness of [his] countenance,” Shaw proclaims that “to him who has endured points made by actors for nearly three years, the point of a surgeon's darning needle comes as delicious relief” (373). In his review, GBS is unable to resist an opportunity to contrast implicitly the modern urban doctor and health system predicated on the profit motive with the care delivered by an Irish rustic physician possessing an “unperverted consciousness of [a] benevolent and sensible life” (375). He also is concerned that his treatment will irrevocably alter his relationship to his job as a critic:13
         
            When the physician refuses to charge for the services rendered (allegedly when he detects the playwright's ethnicity through his accent), Shaw acknowledges that his seat in the theater is also providedI doubt if I shall ever see a play again without longing for the comparative luxury of that quiet country surgery, with the stillness without broken only by the distant song and throbbing drumbeat of some remote Salvation Army corps, and the needle, with its delicate realism, touching my sensibilities, stitch, stitch, stitch, with ~<br>

Abstract: Tragic optimism is an oxymoron entirely consonant with Shaw's customary mode of analysis: dialectical (both/and) thinking. Shaw was well aware that the historical record revealed precious little to demonstrate that humankind had made substantive progress in reducing unwarranted pain, suffering, and injustice. As his urbane Devil so eloquently puts it in
         Man and Superman, if the race excels at one particular thing it is in perfecting ever more efficient means of wreaking destruction on a massive scale and not in honing the executive skills necessary for peacefully achieving the humane society. Moreover, without a vibrant socialism to vitiate the dark side of capitalism, an eventuality that with every passing day seemed to him more and more remote, Shaw saw few if any signs that the desperate conditions of the victimized, whose numbers were growing at an alarming rate, were likely to improve. Even his flirtations with the ruling dictators of the period failed to produce the consummation he devoutly desired. In the main, humans generally struck him as simply too immature, selfish, and shortsighted to manage their affairs wisely. Hence, it is not surprising that the Shavian corpus, for all its sparkling wit and polemical precision, includes a palpable strain of simmering pessimism. At the same time, however, Shaw was not one iota less optimistic that life, in strictly biological terms, would continue to evolve unabated, one species supplanting another through the eons. As Lilith—Shaw's embodiment of the Life Force—declares in her statement that concludesBack to Methuselah, “Of life only is there no end.”
               Barring a cataclysm of biblical proportions, Shaw believed that life was indestructible. Therefore, to his way of thinking, the best use of human energy and talent lies in doing everything possible to assist the forward movement of evolution as it wends its way through the generations. In the Shavian universe, the operative principle is that livi~<br>
