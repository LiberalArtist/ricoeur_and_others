  Claire: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1c6v89n">Mourning Animals</a><br>
  Author(s) SCHLOSSER JULIA<br>
  Abstract: Claire came to live with me in 2009. I made the decision to euthanize her on July 5, 2011, because she suffered from osteomyelitis, a painful bone infection. I’ve lived with animals since I was four. In my adult life, I have loved, nursed, and mourned the loss of beloved animal companions. But when I reflect on Claire’s life, I am haunted by questions that I never had to ask when those other animals died. Would she have rather I left her where I met her, living in a cardboard box in a windowless bathroom? Or would she have made<br>

  CHAPTER 3  The Journey Home Is through the World from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt4qt">Intimate Domain</a><br>
  Abstract: The narrator of
                  In Search of Lost Timeis beset by trauma. By his own admission, he locates suffering in two maternally marked experiences in his past. The event he cites first is that fateful evening when his “mother abdicated her authority,” in the young Marcel’s bedroom at Combray; the second encompasses the many months during which the narrator observed the slow death of his grandmother.¹ The narrator is anguished: not only did he inflict pain on his mother when he “traced in her soul a first wrinkle and caused a first white hair to appear,” but also he wounded<br>

  CHAPTER 6  Antigone and the Ethics of Intimacy from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt4qt">Intimate Domain</a><br>
  Abstract: Traumatic violence has caught Oedipus in an ongoing repetition of mimetic rivalry, rooting him in an eternal present. Compellingly demonstrated not only in
                  Oedipus the Kingbut also inOedipus at Colonus, his trauma is visceral. For Oedipus’s suffering is written on his body: his unsightly face, expressed pain, and profound exhaustion offer graphic testimony.¹ Others reflect back to Oedipus their horror: Oedipusisa polluting presence.² Attentive to Oedipus’s distress, in this chapter I examine the representation of trauma as well as actions that promise to break open constraints on Oedipus, permitting the transformation of Oedipus’s memories.³ InOedipus<br>

  E. H. Carr: from:

  Author(s) Jones Charles<br>
  Abstract: T
                  he Twenty Years’ Crisisis the of the work of E. H. Carr most familiar to students of international relations. In this book Carr took great pains to situate himself precisely half way between utopianism and realism.¹ Yet the strategy has generally been regarded as little more than a flourish. Carr has consistently been taken for a political realist. A lecture not long ago by William Fox, subtle and knowledgeable in its treatment of Carr, unhesitatingly referred to “Carr’s realist vision” and his “version of realist doctrine,” and Carr certainly exhibited many of the characteristic marks of the realist school.²<br>

  Abstract: La mancornadorais a theme in Mexican music that depicts a heavy existential experience between men and women. The songs are filled with graphic and painful metaphors. The outcome is often tragic and violent, and often involves the killing of women. The termmancornarrepresents power and control, and the animal horn is its symbol. It is a difficult subject to broach, but its presence in a number of songs and in social life suggests certain commonalities that are worth exploring. It is important to locate these themes within a broader frame, which includes ideas from Norman Denzin, Ernest Becker,<br>

  1  FIRST (1961) from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt19633fp">Memory Work</a><br>
  Abstract: In 1961, Anne Truitt made a sculpture, about fifty-four inches tall, called First (plate 1). Truitt’s title signaled a critical shift in which the artist broke away from the highly wrought sculptural experimentation characteristic of her style in the late 1950s and began to concentrate on formal simplicity. These concerns are articulated clearly in First, which is pared down to basics: three vertical, white, painted wooden planks cut to resemble the pickets of an iconic American picket fence. The simplicity of design and construction suggest that Truitt was forging connections to minimalism. Yet if we are to properly historicize First<br>

  Abstract: After his visit to Anne Truitt’s Twining Court studio in 1962, the critic Clement Greenberg made a bold assessment: “Now there will be three in Washington.”¹ His comment counted her in importance alongside the DC-based color field painters Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland, who were prominently the subjects of his criticism, held in high esteem as the standard bearers of formalist modernism. Truitt, Louis, and Noland were also well known to one another in the tightly knit group of artists surrounding Washington’s Institute for Contemporary Art. Truitt rented the Twining Court studio, a coldwater carriage house, from Noland when he<br>

  Abstract: In 1840 Josef Danhauser painted a famous picture of Liszt at the piano that now hangs in the Alte Nationalgalerie Berlin. Liszt’s audience consists primarily of famous composers (Paganini, Rossini) and authors (Sand, Hugo, de Musset); he also has a silent auditor in a large bust of Beethoven that sits in the window at the upper right. The bust is prominent enough to suggest that it is Beethoven’s music that Liszt is playing, a suggestion that also makes good historical sense. If so, the picture is also a puzzle.

  Author(s) Good Byron J.<br>
  Abstract: Artists—painters, playwrights, musicians—imagined and re-imaged the state and Indonesian society as Suharto’s New Order regime unraveled after thirty-three years of autocratic rule. At the heart of this chapter are the work and reflections of three contemporary Indonesian painters and their efforts to constitute a space and visual language for critical engagement with their society. The chapter draws on our conversations about their subjective experiences of producing art and describes their ongoing efforts to carve out distinctive modes of subjectivity as artists and intellectuals during the period of

  Abstract: My Lai villagers vividly recalled the periodic lamentations of the village ghosts that they said echoed from the killing sites. A number of residents in Khe Thuan subhamlet claimed that they had seen old women ghosts licking and sucking the arms and legs of small child ghosts, and they interpreted the scene as an effort by the elderly victims to ease the pain of the wounded children. Some in Khe Dong subhamlet also graphically described several young women ghosts, each walking with a small child held in her arms and lamenting over the child’s lifeless body.

                  Berliner Tageblattwith the composer’s notes in the margin. “I am rising higher and higher,” Willette was reported to have said on his deathbed with an expression of profound happiness. “Now I am ascending straight up, always up, continuously without stopping, quick as an arrow—straight to Paradise.”¹ Willette had a peaceful exit from the world, strikingly dissimilar from the violent departure of Richard Gerstl, whose death remained an open wound for Schoenberg, his one-time friend and disciple.² Willette’s death, in contrast,<br>

  Abstract: The 1802 portrait by French artist Nicolas-Martin Petit (1777-1804) of a young woman from Bruny Island (Figure 5.1), Tasmania — or Van Diemen's land, as it was known at the time — is the subject of the following discussion. Petit's portrait³ of Arra-Maïda, as she was called, which he painted during the 1800-04 French expedition to Australia (
                     Terra AustralisorLes Terres australes) under the command of Post-Captain Nicolas Baudin⁴, gives fascinating insights into these first encounters of expedition members with Indigenous Tasmanians before colonisation and the subsequent decimation of the group.<br>

  Author(s) Hogarth Christopher<br>
  Abstract: Michel Beaujour states his dissatisfaction with the term 'autoportrait' to encapsulate adequately literary endeavours at self-representation.¹ The connection between self-portraiture and painting is evident, and the slippage of the term across mediums leads, in Beaujour's opinion, to deny the specificity of literary works. Yet, referring to works such as Michel de Montaigne's
                  Essais, Michel Leiris'sL'âge d'hommeand Jean-Jacques Rousseau'sRêveries, Beaujour highlights its usefulness as a tool that distinguishes it from autobiographical texts for two fundamental reasons. First, self-portraiture insists upon an absence of continuity, thus defying any clearly arranged order of events that contribute to a personality created<br>

  Abstract: Upon losing their homeland at the end of the Algerian War of Independence in 1962, the community of Pieds-Noirs, or former French citizens of Algeria, set out to protect their fragile memories through literature, photography and film. Every year the communities gather together in France to commemorate their exodus, and each reunion is guided by images of colonial Algeria. As the ageing Pieds-Noirs assemble, so do fragments of their past: school photos endlessly emerge from Pieds-Noirs seeking to identify lost or forgotten classmates, and iconic Algerian monuments reappear in slide presentations, films, photodocumentaries, paintings and websites.

  Author(s) Poiana Peter<br>
  Abstract: Georges Bataille and Maurice Blanchot's mutual interest in the Lascaux cave paintings signals their common concern to construct a discourse of origin in relation to art. Both writers consider origin in terms of the anxiety-filled questioning surrounding the ontological and historical aporias that have plagued Western thought, including those that appear under the banner of the Modern and the Postmodern. Both ask: what kind of discourse presides over the disconcerting doubling of reality performed by the first artists? For Bataille, origin is bound up with the ritual significance of eroticism and death as these underpin all forms of artistic endeavour;<br>

  Abstract: When scientists in our day meddle with the humanities, the outcomes are not always uplifting. Sometimes they are, as when art historians and chemists supplement each other’s expertise quite nicely in establishing or disproving the authenticity of some famous painting. In my own discipline, the history of science, the contributions scientists make are rarely so productive, unless (as, for instance, with Thomas Kuhn) they turn themselves into professional historians. Professional scientists with a layman’s interest in history certainly tend to display a deep-seated emotional involvement in past manifestations of their own present-day concerns.

  Abstract: When trying to grasp the complex relationships between dance and moving images, during the emergence of the cinematic medium, one can hardly avoid noticing the necessity of investigate, once again, the films dedicated to the famous number of “serpentine” dance developed and started in 1892 by music-hall performer Loïe Fuller. The phenomenal craze created by this original stage spectacle ended up imposing it as one of the motifs characterizing artistic expression at the turn of the twentieth century.

  Abstract: Although each of these poets has developed an individual style, their work has certain common characteristics: use of the everyday language and images of contemporary Spain, development of language codes and intertextual references, and, most strikingly, metaphoric transformations and surprising reversals of the reader's expectations.

  Abstract: Beginning in the late 1950s and extending through the 1960s, there appeared in Spain several young poets whose work reveals a high degree of originality, coupled with significant value. Because they were writing in a seemingly direct language and dealing with themes that had also been dealt with by earlier writers, these poets were at first considered mere continuers of the general tendencies of post-Civil War verse and were not accorded the importance they deserved. But as their work has grown and unfolded, as their ideas on poetry have been expressed and linked to their work, and as critics have<br>

  Abstract: As has often been noted, Claudio Rodríguez’s poetry illustrates attitudes and tendencies that came to the fore in Spain in the 1960s. Its seemingly everyday language and its allusions to common events link this poetry to earlier tendencies of post-Civil War verse. Yet a close look at individual texts makes clear that Rodríguez employs that language in a highly unusual and creative way, imparting significance to common words and expressions and making ordinary events suggest very fundamental meanings. His work avoids easy social and conceptual messages, and deals in complex fashion with such subjects as the conflict between negative and<br>

  Abstract: Bodies have always been the subjects of representation, sometimes written about in texts but more often carved in stone or painted on walls. Such images constitute a central feature of the visual culture from which most people in most historical periods have derived their knowledge of how the body is ordered in their society. As postmodern theories constantly remind us, the order of the body is also the political, social, economic, religious, and sexual order of a society.

Over the course of his life, Lonergan wrote extensively and profoundly about an amazing range of topics—painting and music; economics and politics; epistemology, metaphysics, and ethics; quantum mechanics and relativity theory; statistics and evolution; sexuality and marriage; logic, ordinary language, and symbolic meaning; religion and feelings; common sense; the theory of history; sin, grace, and the theology of the Christian doctrines<br>

  Abstract: Novels continue to be new because no one yet knows what they are. The novel has not died but many conceptions of it have. Its birth was marked by painful attempts at self-definition, a struggle that continues to define the genre’s vitality. Of the many critics who have come forward to say what the novel is, few have had their prescriptions pass into use. Two formulations, however, have recently been particularly influential: Georg Lukacs’
                  Theory of the Novel(originally published in German in 1920) and Rene Girard’sDeceit, Desire and the Novel(originally published in French in 1961). While each<br>

  Book Title: Muscially Sublime: Indeterminacy, Infinity, Irresolvability-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wurth Kiene Brillenburg<br>
  Abstract: Musically Sublime rewrites musically the history and philosophy of the sublime. Music enables us to reconsider the traditional course of sublime feeling on a track from pain to pleasure. Resisting the notion that there is a single format for sublime feeling, Wurth shows how, from the mid eighteenth century onward, sublime feeling is, instead, constantly rearticulated in a complex interaction with musicality. Wurth takes as her point of departure Immanuel Kant's Critique of Judgment and Jean-Francois Lyotard's aesthetic writings of the 1980s and 1990s. Kant framed the sublime narratively as an epic of self-transcendence. By contrast, Lyotard sought to substitute open immanence for Kantian transcendence, yet he failed to deconstruct the Kantian epic. The book performs this deconstruction by juxtaposing eighteenth- and nineteenth-century conceptions of the infinite, Sehnsucht, the divided self, and unconscious drives with contemporary readings of instrumental music. Critically assessing Edmund Burke, James Usher, E.T.A. Hoffmann, Novalis, Friedrich Holderlin, Arthur Schopenhauer, Richard Wagner, and Friedrich Nietzsche, this book re-presents the sublime as a feeling that defers resolution and hangs suspended between pain and pleasure. Musically Sublime rewrites the mathematical sublime as differance, while it redresses the dynamical sublime as trauma: unending, undetermined, unresolved. Whereas most musicological studies in this area have focused on traces of the Kantian sublime in Handel, Haydn, and Beethoven, this book calls on the nineteenth-century theorist Arthur Seidl to analyze the sublime of, rather than in, music. It does so by invoking Seidl's concept of formwidrigkeit ("form-contrariness") in juxtaposition with Romantic piano music, (post)modernist musical minimalisms, and Lyotard's postmodern sublime. It presents a sublime of matter, rather than form-performative rather than representational. In doing so, Musically Sublime shows that the binary distinction Lyotard posits between the postmodern and romantic sublime is finally untenable.<br>

  Abstract: The sublime is not only duplicitous in its paradox of pleasure and pain, but also in its “double mode” of a quieter and a more violent sublime: what John Baillie called the sedate sublime and the sublime mixed with pathos—and what Kant, of course, called the mathematical and the dynamical sublime.¹ Usually, critics interpret these two varieties of the Kantian sublime experience as pertaining to theoretical or speculative and practical reason respectively. They can, however, also be elucidated by pointing to the eighteenth-century cult of the sublime as being a cult of empty and vast but also of wild<br>

  Abstract: The writing of history in the Middle Ages cannot be reduced to one single formula or definition. Instead, it straddled a huge variety of genres, covering – and often combining – world chronicles, annals, histories of communities, deeds of individuals, hagiographies, biographies, autobiographies and epic poems.¹ Medieval historiography therefore does not correspond to any fixed genre, in terms of either its form or its style – it could be written in prose, in verse or sometimes as both; it could be sung as a

  Abstract: Landscape and heritage form a strong couple in European culture. Since the Renaissance landscapes have been perceived as ‘art’ and valuated by scenic qualities, represented in painting and reproduced through design and architecture. This connoisseurship is still a basic assumption of heritage conservation and tourism, working under the fetish of authenticity by singling out aesthetic styles and iconic periods. Although recent biographical approaches to historical landscapes have opposed this reductionism by stressing long-term development, the landscape/mindscape nexus can – in my view – not be grasped by the prevailing metaphor of an archaeological layering of time.

  Abstract: Exodus 14, the text of Israel’s deliverance at the Sea of Reeds is very different from either Genesis 12 or Genesis 17. The different genres of Genesis 12 (speech, journey, anecdote) are not present. The sustained divine monologue of Genesis 17 does not recur. Instead, the text is in the form of a report of what happened when the fleeing Israelites were delivered from the pursuing Egyptian force. The paradox has not escaped later rabbis: deliverance for the Israelites means destruction for the Egyptians. In the midst of disturbance, deliverance brings joy; in times of tranquillity, destruction brings pain.<br>

The contrast between some castaways in a state of deep despair and other castaways frantically trying to hail what might be a passing ship in the far distance is a fitting image for the combination of despair and hope within Rorty’s appeal to “human beings clinging together against the dark.”¹<br>

  CRIME AND PUNISHMENT from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16f8cb0">Thou Shalt Not Kill: A Political and Theological Dialogue</a><br>
  Abstract: In April 2010 the D’Orsay Museum in Paris opened an exhibition that drew thousands of visitors. They were attracted first of all by its irresistibly fascinating title: “Crime and Punishment.” The reference to Dostoyevsky’s masterpiece is explicit. In the minds of the show’s curators, crime is synonymous with murder: its paintings, photographs, illustrations, and other forms of documentation all display, in various modes, the crime of murder—that is, the individual offense. As for punishment, it is largely understood in juridical terms. Its symbol is the guillotine: the “merciful” machine, created by the French Revolution to kill in an egalitarian<br>

  Abstract: A barber worked directly across the street from the front door of our apartment in the late 1980s in Nador, a gritty boomtown in the Berber north that was exploding with the repatriated wealth of emigrants away in Europe as well as the revenues from goods smuggled in from Spain and hash smuggled out of Morocco.¹ The barber’s shop was decorated with posters of stylish men, all of them models advertising various hair care products. He had hired another barber—a poorer man, judging by his attire—to help out during busy times, such as early evening hours and Fridays.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gh950">Visual Culture in the Modern Middle East</a><br>
  Author(s) SAVAŞ ÖZLEM<br>
  Abstract: A group of paintings known as Crying Boys—attributed to Italian painter Bruno Amadio (1911–81), also known as Bragolin—gained widespread popularity in many parts of the world in the 1980s. Portraying the tearful faces of children, these works have inspired various popular cultural practices, including the establishment of fan clubs and the telling of urban legends devoted to the subjects’ “curse.”¹ In the 1970s and 1980s one of these paintings became especially popular in Turkey (fig. 5.1 and plate 11). Initially, Crying Boy was in vogue in the private realm, displayed in many working- and middle-class homes—reproductions<br>

The new mural replaces an old, fading image whose background depicted a blue sky poetically strewn with drifting clouds, framed on two sides by lines of poetry executed as an aesthetically appealing exercise in traditional calligraphy. The older mural’s primary subject was a realistic portrait, set off against the background in a separate frame, of a man whose name<br>

In his later writings, the work of art occupies a central place as the second type of saturated phenomenon, saturated according to quality.

  Abstract: The biological, chemical, and material bases of human ontology constitute central sites of investigation and theoretical comment for material ecocriticisms. If we understand pain as a fundamental part of human ontology, then we must also understand that
                  theorizing matterprofits from understanding the importance of relationships among cultural representations of pain, matter, and environment. Building on “a field that defines itself by a neologism (ecocriticism), based on another neologism (ecology)” (7), as Middlebury Shakespearean ecocritic Dan Brayton has recently described ecocriticism, material ecocriticisms seek both to further complicate and to further define what it is that ecocriticism pursues and how.<br>

  Book Title: Video Games Around the World-  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): IWATANI TORU<br>
  Abstract: Video games have become a global industry, and their history spans dozens of national industries where foreign imports compete with domestic productions, legitimate industry contends with piracy, and national identity faces the global marketplace. This volume describes video game history and culture across every continent, with essays covering areas as disparate and far-flung as Argentina and Thailand, Hungary and Indonesia, Iran and Ireland. Most of the essays are written by natives of the countries they discuss, many of them game designers and founders of game companies, offering distinctively firsthand perspectives. Some of these national histories appear for the first time in English, and some for the first time in any language.Readers will learn, for example, about the rapid growth of mobile games in Africa; how a meat-packing company held the rights to import the Atari VCS 2600 into Mexico; and how the Indonesian MMORPG
      Nusantara Onlinereflects that country's cultural history and folklore. Every country or region's unique conditions provide the context that shapes its national industry; for example, the long history of computer science in the United Kingdom and Scandinavia, the problems of piracy in China, the PC Bangs of South Korea, or the Dutch industry's emphasis on serious games. As these essays demonstrate, local innovation and diversification thrive alongside productions and corporations with global aspirations.Africa • Arab World • Argentina • Australia • Austria • Brazil • Canada • China • Colombia • Czech Republic • Finland • France • Germany • Hong Kong • Hungary • India • Indonesia • Iran • Ireland • Italy • Japan • Mexico • The Netherlands • New Zealand • Peru • Poland • Portugal • Russia • Scandinavia • Singapore • South Korea • Spain • Switzerland • Thailand • Turkey • United Kingdom • United States of America • Uruguay • Venezuela<br>

  Abstract: Addressing ambivalence in established categories of colonial art in Mexico, this chapter proposes a “mestizo” category to characterize works of visual art elaborated during the Viceroyalty of New Spain, mainly in the sixteenth century. Those works of interest here are devotional paintings, sculptures, and the doors and façades of a number of architectural complexes, which integrate aesthetic and iconographic elements common to Western European art and pre-Columbian art of Mesoamerica. I address the connection between
                     mestizajeand culture in art, although mestizaje in Mexico often refers to race.<br>

  Abstract: In the past ten or fifteen years, there has been an upsurge of scholarly and popular interest in Englishness, London, and the special relationship between the two. Witness, for instance, Peter Ackroyd’s recent work in London:
                  The Biography(2000) andAlbion: The Origins of the English Imagination(2002). Pointing out the various peoples and cultures that have settled and influenced England, he observes that this ineffable sense of national belonging “has more to do with location and with territory, therefore, than with any atavistic native impulses.” The country’s painting, literature, music, and architecture, like the people themselves, may be the<br>

  Abstract: The history of the Americas in relation to the West begins with a turn: a wrong turn, as the story is commonly told. Christopher Columbus, the Genoan sailing in search of Cathay on behalf of Spain, encountered unexpected islands that he mistook for the Indies. This landfall came after he decided against returning to Europe when the voyage had proceeded farther than his frightened sailors had thought navigationally possible. In the parlance of quips about his “failure to ask for directions” (as Michelle Burnham glosses it in her contribution to this volume), Columbus took an errant turn, mistaking the Americas<br>

  Abstract: There is a genre of landscape painting that developed in the late sixteenth century, notably in a series of six etchings Jacques Callot drew depicting the Spanish Siege of Jeda (1624–25). We know that Callot was commissioned by the Spanish government to memorialize their victory, and this may account for its visual orientation. In the foreground we see, from behind, a cluster of warships gliding toward the shore. We see ahead of them, inland, further up the picture, their Dutch opponents, much smaller, smaller in fact than perspective requires. Perspective is distorted further still as the eye moves up<br>

  Abstract: “Everyone living at the end of the Middle Ages had heard of Cokaygne at one time or another,” writes Herman Pleij about the Dutch tradition of the Land of Cokaygne.¹ If this is true, medieval Europeans would have known it by its different names, “Cokaygne” (British Isles), “Bengodi” (Italy), “Cucagna” (France) “Jauja” (Spain), “Schlaraffenland” (Germany), and “Luilekkerland” (the Netherlands). With respect to the utopian tradition, however, as A. L. Morton, the Marxist scholar of English utopianism, wrote, the Land of Cokaygne survives “as an almost secret tradition under the surface, while the mainstream of utopian thought passed through other channels.”²<br>

  Book Title: Constellations of a Contemporary Romanticism-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): McGrath Brian<br>
  Abstract: Constellations of a Contemporary Romanticism takes its title and point of departure from Walter Benjamin's concept of the historical constellation, which puts both "contemporary" and "romanticism" in play as period designations and critical paradigms. Featuring fascinating and diverse contributions by an international roster of distinguished scholars working in and out of romanticism--from deconstruction to new historicism, from queer theory to postcolonial studies, from visual culture to biopolitics--this volume makes good on a central tenet of Benjamin's conception of history: These critics "grasp the constellation" into which our "own era has formed with a definite earlier one." Each of these essays approaches romanticism as a decisive and unexpired thought experiment that makes demands on and poses questions for our own time: What is the unlived of a contemporary romanticism? What has romanticism's singular untimeliness bequeathed to futurity? What is romanticism's contemporary "redemption value" for painting and politics, philosophy and film?<br>

  Abstract: The existence of evil in the world is regarded by most atheists as the principal objection to the existence of God, called by the Roman Catholic theologian Hans Küng the ‘rock of atheism’. By ‘evil’ is meant the fact of pain and suffering and the ‘problem’ that it poses for religious belief is not hard to see. How can evil exist in a world created by an omnipotent and omni-benevolent God? For the positive atheist this question exposes an insuperable inconsistency within religious belief, thereby invalidating the claim that any God exists.

  5  Radical Embodiment in Light of the Science and Religion Dialogue from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf0ht">Radical Embodiment</a><br>
  Abstract: In creating humankind God sculpted “the earth being,” according to the etymology of “Adam,” the Hebrew word for “humanity” used in Genesis 2. The portrait of humankind painted by the scriptures of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam regards the human person as a psycho-somatic unity. Scientific evidence increasingly points to the truth that human beings are fundamentally embodied in nature, contrary to the Greek-influenced mind-body dualism that has reigned for most of Western theological and philosophical history. In this chapter I will highlight the significance of our embodiment relative to evolutionary biology and to the nature of consciousness in light of<br>

Numerous gifts and fruit of the Holy Spirit, which are particular resources for the ministry of reconciliation, draw on the specific vehicle of the imagination for their expression. Though not an exhaustive list, three areas in particular will be explored as gifts crucial to the healing of relationships, all of which rely heavily on wise imagination: re-creation, hope, and love.

The chapter impresses upon readers a picture of unthinkable reversal: the impossible has occurred and everything is the opposite of what it ought to be. Gold has lost its lustre, sacred jewels are worthless, and precious gold is broken like clay pots (4: 1–2). כהעמי is cruel, suckling infants thirst, and those used to rich delicacies starve for lack of food (4: 3–5).

  Author(s) Mathews Jeanette<br>
  Abstract: In this chapter I suggest that the form-critically identified laments of the Hebrew Bible can be understood via the performance concept of “framing.” In art, drama, and literature the frame lifts the work or event to a heightened consciousness and provides a context for practitioners and audiences to interact. My interest is in the link between frame (form) and content. I argue that the lament form provides a literary framework for the expression of anguish by empowering those who are suffering to name their pain, despite the constraints of the form that generally culminate in a leaning towards hope.

  Abstract: In his well-known mid-nineteenth-century painting,
                  Breaking Lent, the Dutch-born artist Cornelius Krieghoff (1815–1872) depicted half a dozen members of a nineteenth-century habitant family at table in their rudely furnished cabin. They are consuming a forbidden Lenten meal of meat during the Catholic Church’s forty-day period of obligatory fasting and abstinence before Easter. Into the room strides the formidable Father Brassard, the parish priest in Longueuil, on the south shore of the St Lawrence River across from Montréal, where Krieghoff himself was living between 1845 and 1848.

                  Breaking Lentthat the temptations of their bodies were more important to the habitants than the salvation of their souls. On the surface, their sociable behaviour does indeed indicate that the parishioners of St-Joseph had much in common with their fellow French Canadians’ oft-noted propensity for celebration.

  Abstract: African and Caribbean peoples share a history dominated by the violent disruptions of slavery and colonialism. While much has been said about these "geographies of pain," violence in the private sphere, particularly gendered violence, receives little attention. This book fills that void. It is a critical addition to the study of African and Caribbean women's literatures at a time when women from these regions are actively engaged in articulating the ways in which colonial and postcolonial violence impact women.<br>

  Abstract: By sharing a history dominated by the violent disruptions of slavery, colonialism, and latent neocolonialism, African and Caribbean peoples belong to what Francoise Lionnet calls “geographies of pain.”¹ Caribbeanist Jack Corzani identifies various forms of this historical violence. Physical violence manifests itself in the enslavement and killing of Africans and in the dispossession of their continent; in the fights between masters and slaves, between colonized and colonizers, and among colonizers themselves; in abolitionist struggles; and in several postcolonial revolutionary wars (Corzani 15). Figures such as the soldier or the policeman symbolize the violence used to maintain colonial regimes in Africa<br>

They ask questions such as: How can women successfully re-territorialize their violated bodies within the intimate spaces from which they have been exiled?

  Abstract: The pitcher, a pouring vessel with one vertical handle (“bell-mouthed oinochoe”, after Cook 1997, 22; “pitcherolpe”, after Davison 1961, 10) was introduced in the Athenian repertoire before the middle of the 8th century BC presumably by the Dipylon Painter (Coldstream 1968, 34). The shape has been seen as the descendant of the shoulder-handled amphora that hardly survives into the Late Geometric (LG) I period (Coldstream 1968, 34), while an origin to the late Phrygian painted and monochrome one-handled round-mouthed jug of the late 8th century BC has also been suggested (Langdon 1993, 205; Mitten 1995, 379–80).<br>

  Book Title: The Muses on Their Lunch Hour-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>

  Abstract: As a break from their ordained labors, what might the Muses today do on their lunch hour? This collection of witty, shrewd, and imaginative essays addresses interdisciplinary topics that range widely from Shakespeare, to psychoanalysis, to the practice of higher education today. With the ease born of deep knowledge, Marjorie Garber moves from comical journalistic quirks (GÇ£Fig LeavesGÇ¥) to the curious return of myth and ritual in the theories of evolutionary psychologists (GÇ£Ovid, Now and ThenGÇ¥)._x000D_ Two themes emerge consistently in GarberGÇÖs latest exploration of symptoms of culture. The first is that to predict the GÇ£next big thingGÇ¥ in literary studies we should look back at ideas and practices set aside by a previous generation of critics. In the past several decades we have seen the reemergence ofGÇöfor exampleGÇötextual editing, biography, character criticism, aesthetics, and philology as GÇ£hotGÇ¥ new areas for critical intervention. The second theme expands on this observation, making the case for GÇ£cultural forgettingGÇ¥ as the way the arts and humanities renew themselves, both within fields and across them. Although she is never represented in traditional paintings or poetry, a missing MuseGÇöwe can call her AmnesiaGÇöturns out to be a key figure for the creation of theory and criticism in the arts.<br>

                  Chronique des sept misères, and reaches its end with his most recent, and most ambitious, to date,Biblique des derniers gestes(2002).¹ The striking similarity in the very titles of the two texts gestures towards a continuity of thematic preoccupation, and indeed of structure, across theœuvreas a whole. This coherence can be seen for example in the fact thatBiblique, likeTexacoandSolibo, opens in the debased contemporary present, and then projects back in time, uncovering a more vital, if painful, Creole past.

  Abstract: Oil is literally rot. As biomass decomposing over millions of years, oil is the rot of ages, and yet it has become the fuel we cannot yet do without. This dialectic of protracted ruination and fatal promise crystallizes the ethos of our time. If the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth-century moment that inaugurated the age of oil was also, at least in some places, a time of modernist hope for human liberation against the specter of annihilation, the present appears more obviously marked by proliferating decay, desperate walling-in from inequality, political discourse utterly disengaged from arts of survival, and painful archiving of<br>

  Abstract: It has become a truism to say that politics and poetry should not be conflated. This suspicion of the role of poetry in the public sphere has existed as far back as Plato, but became something of an orthodoxy in the period that saw the rise of fascism in Europe. Fascism in Germany, Italy, and Spain merged the divisions between the rational and the emotional and between the constative and the performative, as the public sphere became a dramatic space where the concept of the people, the

  Abstract: Christian missionary work in the Pacific Islands and Australasia has been dominated by two main expressions of Christianity: Protestantism rooted in Britain and North America and Roman Catholicism from continental Europe. Christianity first entered the Pacific Islands through the Spanish colonial presence on the Pacific Rim. In the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries Spanish navigators in the Pacific searched for peoples to bring under the rule of imperial Spain and to convert to Catholic Christianity. They took away a small number of islanders for instruction and baptism. In the 1660s the Spanish royal house sent Jesuits from the Philippines to<br>

  Book Title: The Intimate. Polity and the Catholic Church-Laws about Life, Death and the Family in So-called Catholic Countries<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): PÉREZ-AGOTE ALFONSO<br>
  Abstract: The waning influence of the Catholic church in the ethical and political debate. For centuries the Catholic Church was able to impose her ethical rules in matters related to the intimate, that is, questions concerning life (from its beginning until its end) and the family, in the so-called Catholic countries in Western Europe. When the polity started to introduce legislation that was in opposition to the Catholic ethic, the ecclesiastical authorities and part of the population reacted. The media reported massive manifestations in France against same-sex marriages and in Spain against the de-penalization of abortion. In Italy the Episcopal conference entered the political field in opposition to the relaxation of several restrictive legal rules concerning medically assisted procreation and exhorted the voters to abstain from voting so that the referendum did not obtain the necessary quorum. In Portugal, to the contrary, the Church made a “pact" with the prime minister so that the law on same-sex marriages did not include the possibility of adoption. And in Belgium the Episcopal conference limited its actions to clearly expressing with religious, legal, and anthropological arguments its opposition to such laws, which all other Episcopal conferences did also. In this book, the authors analyse the full spectrum of the issue, including the emergence of such laws; the political discussions; the standpoints defended in the media by professionals, ethicists, and politicians; the votes in the parliaments; the political interventions of the Episcopal conferences; and the attitude of professionals. As a result the reader understands what was at stake and the differences in actions of the various Episcopal conferences. The authors also analyse the pro and con evaluations among the civil population of such actions by the Church. Finally, in a comparative synthesis, they discuss the public positions taken by Pope Francis to evaluate if a change in Church policy might be possible in the near future.

  Abstract: Postclassical narratology has reached a new phase of consolidation but also continued diversification. This collection therefore discriminates between what one could call a critical but frame-abiding and a more radical frame-transcending or frame-shattering handling of the structuralist paradigm. Postclassical Narratology: Approaches and Analyses discusses a large variety of different aspects of narrative, such as extensions of classical narratology, new generic applications (autobiography, oral narratives, poetry, painting, and film), the history of narratology, the issue of fictionality, the role of cognition, and questions of authorship and authority, as well as thematic matters related to ethics, gender, and queering. Additionally, it uses a wide spectrum of critical approaches, including feminism, psychoanalysis, media studies, the rhetorical theory of narrative, unnatural narratology, and cognitive studies. In this manner the essays manage to produce new insights into many key issues in narratology.<br>

  Abstract: This book is about the intersection of gender and class. More specifically, our contention in this book has been that the interests of a predominately male professional class, which was in the process of formation throughout the nineteenth century, strongly influenced, indeed determined, the ways in which the Victorians represented poverty in the city of London. London was in the process of unprecedentedly rapid growth in the nineteenth century, and this rapid growth entailed many painful social adjustments. Although London was not the center of the First Industrial Revolution (the northern cities were), it was the center of British trade,<br>

  Abstract: Although this passage from

Besides the illustrations already noted (from opera, stage scenery, and landscape painting), there is another from an art which had its heyday in the previous century. In the pleasure we experience at the sight of a fine landscape garden, he sees the type of that mimetic restructuring of reality which we enjoy in a good drama.<br>

  Book Title: Sodomscapes-Hospitality in the Flesh<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Gallagher Lowell<br>
  Abstract: Sodomscapes presents a fresh approach to the story of Lot’s wife, as it’s been read across cultures and generations. In the process, it reinterprets foundational concepts of ethics, representation, and the body. While the sudden mutation of Lot’s wife in the flight from Sodom is often read to confirm our antiscopic bias, a rival tradition emphasizes the counterintuitive optics required to nurture sustainable habitations for life in view of its unforeseeable contingency. Whether in medieval exegesis, Russian avant-garde art, Renaissance painting, or today’s Dead Sea health care tourism industry, the repeated desire to reclaim Lot’s wife turns the cautionary emblem of the mutating woman into a figural laboratory for testing the ethical bounds of hospitality. Sodomscape—the book’s name for this gesture—revisits touchstone moments in the history of figural thinking and places them in conversation with key thinkers of hospitality. The book’s cumulative perspective identifies Lot’s wife as the resilient figure of vigilant dwelling, whose in-betweenness discloses counterintuitive ways of understanding what counts as a life amid divergent claims of being-with and being-for.<br>

  Introduction: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1mtz73h">Sodomscapes</a><br>
  Abstract: The Cleveland Museum of Art houses one of the most challenging treatments of the Sodom story in twentieth-century visual culture, Anselm Kiefer’s multimedia work
                  Lots Frau(plate 1). It is easy to miss the pale script spelling out “Lots Frau” in the painting’s lower right-hand corner; yet, without it, the work hardly bears relation to either Sodom’s biblical account or the art-historical archive. The inscription supplies only minimal clues, just enough so that the railway tracks and the postapocalyptic landscape eventually prompt recognition of the Sodom story’s generic narrative elements—the drama of exile, the specter of annihilation.

  Abstract: Out of the crush of sculptural masses and planar angles, bruised thunderheads enshroud the sky. Shards of flame plummet toward the bleached walls of the distant city and the arid expanse of desert, their diagonal chute jarring against the vertical thrust of pale, monumental figures (plate 8). The allusive title—
                  Salt Pillars(Solianye stolpe)—gives the painting passport into the Sodom archive, even as it also introduces a counting error into the representational scheme with not one, but four pillars (and five subjects: observe the two conjoined figures in the first pillar).

They are simplex because, in a very global and immediate way, they enable the brain to grasp a reality, an emotion, a thought, or a complex social relationship. Gesture is a fundamental mark of culture and art, which are always simplex expressions. Gesture is essential to them. Drawing, painting, music, mime, acting, sculpture, and dance are always expressed in gestures. For this reason, we must not be content with a physiology (or a philosophy) of action. We<br>

  Book Title: Bearing Witness-Perspectives on War and Peace from the Arts and Humanities<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Johnstone Tiffany<br>
  Abstract: As the centenary of the Great War approaches, citizens worldwide are reflecting on the history, trauma, and losses of a war-torn twentieth century. It is in remembering past wars that we are at once confronted with the profound horror and suffering of armed conflict and the increasing elusiveness of peace. The contributors to Bearing Witness do not presume to resolve these troubling questions, but provoke new kinds of reflection. They explore literature, the arts, history, language, and popular culture to move beyond the language of rhetoric and commemoration provided by politicians and the military. Adding nuance to discussions of war and peace, this collection probes the understanding and insight created in the works of musicians, dramatists, poets, painters, photographers, and novelists, to provide a complex view of the ways in which war is waged, witnessed, and remembered. A compelling and informative collection, Bearing Witness sheds new light on the impact of war and the power of suffering, heroism and memory, to expose the human roots of violence and compassion. Contributors include Heribert Adam (Simon Fraser University), Laura Brandon (Carleton University), Mireille Calle-Gruber (Université La Sorbonne Nouvelle), Janet Danielson (Simon Fraser University), Sandra Djwa (emeritus, Simon Fraser University), Alan Filewod (University of Guelph), Sherrill Grace (University of British Columbia), Patrick Imbert (University of Ottawa), Tiffany Johnstone (PhD Candidate, University of British Columbia), Martin Löschnigg (Graz University), Lauren Lydic (PhD, University of Toronto), Conny Steenman Marcusse (Netherlands), Jonathan Vance (University of Western Ontario), Aritha van Herk (University of Calgary), Peter C. van Wyck (Concordia University), Christl Verduyn (Mount Allison University), and Anne Wheeler (filmmaker).<br>

  Abstract: What role do painted or sculpted images play in human reproduction? Put this way, the question seems to be concerned more with the history of embryology and reproduction than with the history of art. Yet such an interrogation appears central to Western art and its history if we take into consideration the extent to which theories of art, from the Hellenistic period up to the nineteenth century, have accorded importance to the notion of an “ideal of beauty” capable of guiding the human species to its total perfection – towards its “physical and moral perfection,” as the men of the eighteenth<br>

  Abstract: Shortly after Andy Warhol’s unexpected death during the spring of 1987, 
                  Vanity Fair magazine acknowledged the event with a short article by John Richardson: the article was illustrated with a photograph of the artist’s studio taken by Evelyn Hofner in the days following Warhol’s demise; the image showed, on the back wall of the room, a large painting inspired by Leonardo da Vinci’s Last Supper(fig. 2.1). The photograph played on the commonplace motif of the deserted studio dominated by the last painting and orphaned progeny of the artist. In the twentieth century, the paradigm for this topos was most famously<br>

  Abstract: So successful was the advent of modernist poetic, musical, and visual art in disrupting the critical vocabulary by which we describe them that we have all but lost the means to account for how art actually works. So blinding was its revolutionary blast that we have sometimes failed to distinguish the various courses these arts took during the modernist period; moreover, we have often assumed modern art effected more radical changes than it did, as if it put the aesthetic upon an entirely new basis.

  Abstract: In the last chapter, I contended that all art depends upon narrative. Even those modernist works, such as nonrepresentational painting, that seem most to escape the gravity of story-telling end up simply rendering the narrative exogenous but no less essential. I concluded by urging artists and writers to appreciate what such modernist experiments help reveal about the nature of art, but also to return to formal practices that better respect Mnemosyne as the mother of the arts and, in turn, better respect the form of the story as an essential means to understanding the human condition.

  Abstract: Images are central to contemporary geopolitics. We encounter other people and places in a “field of perceptible reality” that is enacted by visual representations, making some things visible while rendering others invisible.¹ Photographs, paintings, video, film, computer games—each and every pictorial artifact—helps establish what can be represented and how it can be shown.

  Abstract: On the surface, veteran trauma is layered with mythic references that make it in/visible to those not materially, literally experiencing it, rendering it legible, but in ways that naturalize and invoke unreflective ways of seeing. Put differently, the struggle with combat trauma is envisioned as a warrior project in which only those who embody a heroic, if not Homeric, ethos are able to take on and defeat the shock, pain, and distress of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Indeed, one does not have to look hard to see how images of Achilles and Odysseus saturate cultural attempts to redress the phenomenon,<br>

  Abstract: Aging poses a peculiar puzzle for medicine.¹ As a biological reality, aging is an inherent part of organic life, affecting humans no less than animals, plants, and microorganisms. It is in that sense beyond the realm of medicine, a permanent backdrop to all of life. But aging is also ordinarily accompanied by disease, bodily decline, and disability. It is thus well within the realm of medicine, whose historical mission has been the cure of disease and the relief of pain, each much desired by those who grow old.<br>

  Abstract: Willa Cather was both enamored of and inspired by the region, people, and culture of the American Southwest. Scholars have had a lot to say about her relationship to this region, but even so, gaps remain. One unexplored aspect of Cather’s Southwest experiences is her relationship with the modernist American painter Ernest L. Blumenschein. Born in Pittsburgh and raised in Dayton, Ohio, Blumenschein began his career illustrating works by Joseph Conrad, Stephen Crane, and Jack London for such publications as

  Abstract: In this chapter, I examine the social landscape of femininity to contextualize women’s fear of pain in childbirth. For many women, vaginal delivery has become something to avoid. Trends in medicalization and surgical intervention (including increased rates of elective cesarean section) suggest that childbirth need not involve labour (both generally, in terms of effortful work, and specifically, in terms of the three stages of the birth process). In this chapter, I consider what has motivated this trend towards increased medicalization of birth, with an eye towards the cultural features of our social world. In particular, I suggest that the components<br>

  Book Title: Retiring to Spain-Women's narratives of nostalgia, belonging and community<br>
  Publisher: Policy Press<br>
  Author(s): Ahmed Anya<br>
  Abstract: This book is a study of nostalgia, belonging and community which provides a new theoretical framework for understanding retirement migration. It is the first account of retirement migration that focuses on the voices of retired working-class British women, who are considering either return migration to the UK or permanent/temporary settlement in Spain. Through a narrative approach, we follow their journeys as they seek, recreate and construct community in a new context and their experiences of belonging and non-belonging are unravelled. The book offers a critical perspective, challenging positivistic, essentialist definitions of community.The book offers a critical perspective, challenging positivistic, essentialist definitions of lifestyle migration.

  ONE  Retiring to the Costas: from:

  Abstract: This book focuses on the lives of a group of women from the UK who moved to the Costa Blanca¹ in Spain in retirement. We follow their journeys as they seek ‘community’ and belonging in a world characterised by rapid social change. Imbued with nostalgic yearning, community is hailed as a panacea to the ills of modernity and as a representation of social continuity. Nostalgia denotes the mourning of a lost home or place and a lost time – and in this way – the search for community and belonging can also be understood as a quest for another epoch.<br>

  Abstract: Arguably, all migration is about improving one’s life in some way and the women featured here moved to Spain to enjoy a new lifestyle in retirement. For them, a ‘better life’ involved regaining community and a sense of belonging which had been lost in the UK. Community has been identified as a factor that influences the quality of later life (Conway, 2003) and lamenting the loss of community is a key theme underpinning<br>

In this chapter, the core theme is networks and their connection with spatial, temporal and social locations. I explore how geographical location – where one is from and where one is located – is significant in shaping belonging to networks and how women’s<br>

For Cynthia, Celia, Mabel, Margot, Mabel, Agatha and Myra, fulfilling the quest’s goal was possible because they were able to overcome a number of obstacles.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1t896fb">Retiring to Spain</a><br>
  Abstract: Throughout this book we have followed women’s migration journeys across space and time as they spanned and reconstituted boundaries. Beginning with their pre-migration lives – characterised for many by fractured belonging in the UK – upper and more proximate structures enabled and facilitated their agency in moving to Spain in retirement. We have also seen that women’s positionalities and unique biographies are also significant in shaping migration choices, decision-making processes and their post-migration lives. I framed divergent migration trajectories in relation to two plot typologies: the quest and voyage and return. Those women who ultimately chose to remain in Spain<br>

  CONCLUSION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1t896fb">Retiring to Spain</a><br>
  Abstract: I premised at the outset that the idea of community is often romantic and utopian, idealising and evoking a bygone age. Often considered to have been ‘lost’ through modernity, community has also been hailed as the solution to social ‘problems’ by successive governments in the UK. From the New Right to the present Conservative-led coalition government, community has become synonymous with a relinquishment of responsibility by the state (Hoggett et al, 1997). When the women made their move to Spain, community in policy circles was presented by the then government, as a panacea to the lack of social cohesion among<br>

  Abstract: This chapter analyzes a variety of narrative modes that describe, reveal, picture, or convey the experience of pain, especially that of the female body, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Focusing on the discourses of pain popularized by the anti–footbinding movement, I explore the novel conditions that allowed female pain to be narrated, by women or others on their behalf, and the terms of this narration. My main argument is that these conditions and terms bespeak the difficulties involved in the formation of the female “voice” and female “agency”—attributes of the modern female subject—in late<br>

  Abstract: Religion played a crucial role in European expansionism. Toward the end of the Middle Ages, the rise of the Spanish Empire, fostered by the myth of the Reconquista, blended nationalist and religious motives. According to that myth, “Spain was born as a nation convinced that God had entrusted it with the defense of the Catholic faith against all Muslims, Jews, heretics, and other unbelievers.”¹ Under that banner, the Spaniards invaded and explored the “New World … convinced that this was a sacred trust so that they could bring their religion to the benighted people in these lands.”²<br>

  Abstract: M.A.C.: Van Gogh, according to the astounding exhibition in the Metropolitan Museum in New York, knew that the red lake pigment he was using for his still lifes - such as in the irises and the roses he gathered in bunches from the garden in St. Remy to paint, three months before his suicide - might fade. He took that risk because he wanted to see how the purple (blue and red, of course) of the irises would look against the yellow of the sunflowers, and how the pink of the roses (white and red) would look against the verdant<br>

  Abstract: M.D.: If we are looking for artworks which fore­ground the potential for self-erasure or self-de­struction of the image we have to turn to experimental photography and film. In many ways, Stan Brakhage’s 1963 «Mothlight» bridges the conceptual gap between erasure techniques and (self-) destruction per se. «Mothlight» differs from Brakhage trademark hand painted films in that it incorporates insects wings, petals, leaves and blades of grass pasted upon the strips of celluloid. The director’s account of how «Mothlight» originates in personal suffering deserves to be quoted in full: «Here is a film that I made out of a deep grief.<br>

Two paintings face each other in a gallery, above the heads of the visitors: and mystifyingly, they set the scene for a crisis of non-revelation and future pain.

  Book Title: Encounter with the Plumed Serpent-Drama and Power in the Heart of Mesoamerica<br>
  Publisher: University Press of Colorado<br>
  Author(s): Jiménez Gabina Aurora Pérez<br>
  Abstract: The Mixtec, or the people of Savi ("Nation of the Rain God"), one of the major civilizations of ancient Mesoamerica, made their home in the highlands of Oaxaca, where they resisted both Aztec military expansion and the Spanish conquest. This book presents and interprets the sacred histories narrated in the Mixtec codices, the largest surviving collection of pre-Columbian manuscripts in existence. In these screenfold books, ancient painter-historians chronicled the politics of the Mixtec from approximately a.d. 900 to 1521, portraying the royal families, rituals, wars, alliances, and ideology of the times. By analyzing and cross-referencing the codices, which have been fragmented and dispersed in far-flung archives, the authors attempt to reconstruct Mixtec history. Adding useful interpretation and commentary, Jansen and Perez Jimenez synthesize the large body of surviving documents into the first unified narrative of Mixtec sacred history.<br>

  Book Title: Chinese Landscape Painting as Western Art History-  Publisher: Hong Kong University Press, HKU<br>
  Author(s): Purtle Jennifer<br>
  Abstract: This is a provocative essay of reflections on traditional mainstream scholarship on Chinese art as done by towering figures in the field such as James Cahill and Wen Fong. James Elkins offers an engaging and accessible survey of his personal journey encountering and interpreting Chinese art through Western scholars' writings. He argues that the search for optimal comparisons is itself a modern, Western interest, and that art history as a discipline is inherently Western in several identifiable senses. Although he concentrates on art history in this book, and on Chinese painting in particular, these issues bear implications for Sinology in general, and for wider questions about humanistic inquiry and historical writing. Jennifer Purtle's Foreword provides a useful counterpoint from the perspective of a Chinese art specialist, anticipating and responding to other specialists’ likely reactions to Elkins's hypotheses.<br>

  Abstract: I read the manuscript for this book expecting to hate it. Rumors about the manuscript bemoaned a non-specialist author who presumed to tell specialists in the field of Chinese painting history working to recover traditional Chinese ideas about painting that and how they practiced Western art history. Moreover, the author allegedly did so in terms not interesting to many specialists in the field of Chinese painting history, nor fully intelligible to some.

  III  The Argument from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xcrn3">Chinese Landscape Painting as Western Art History</a><br>
  Abstract: A comparison of historical perspectives must begin not where Chinese landscape painting begins, in the dim Jin, Sui, Tang, and Five Dynasties, but where earlier paintings effectively became available as an articulated tradition for later painters: that is, in the Northern Song.¹ The earlier dynasties are populated by legends more than by surviving paintings, and even in the Song few Tang paintings survived.² The legends of pre-Song painters have some parallels in Western art, though that parallelism is less important than the inaccessibility of the paintings themselves. China and the West share formative legends of mimetic excellence, and contests such<br>

  Abstract: Something about Chinese landscape painting stirs my interest in questions of art and art history, rather than the other way around. What is said about the paintings raises questions, and those questions return to the paintings as if for nourishment. Because of the nature of this inquiry I have not had the opportunity to say much about what attracts me to individual paintings—their visual force, their geographic contexts, their consumers, their painters’ lives—and it may often have seemed that I would rather talk about what art history is, rather than what the paintings suggest it should be.

  Abstract: “Great art,” Frank O’Hara insists, “is seldom about art”—“except in baroque periods.” Its insights may be so compelling and so pervasive that they can be applied to art as well, but its true subject is the “structure” of nature. In de Kooning’s work, for example, “structures of classical severity” grant “insight into the structure of man’s identification with nature and the play of forces which it involves.” Similarly, “to think that late Mondrian is ‘painting about painting’ is a grievous error,” and “when Keats wrote, ‘Beauty is truth, truth beauty,’—it is a grievous error to think that he<br>

  Abstract: Three things may be said about the lifelong polemic of Maxim Gorky (1868–1936) with Dostoevsky. First, it had deep psychological roots in a confrontation with aspects of his own nature; overcoming Dostoevsky, for Gorky, was a process of self-overcoming. Second, this process of self-overcoming became linked with a central effort of Gorky’s literary and cultural writings—the task of overcoming Russian history, the painful legacy of violence and disorder in Russian man and life, all that he once called “our most implacable enemy—our past.”² And third, this overcoming ultimately took on the dimensions of a struggle between worldviews,<br>

Such an image is reinforced by the overwhelming attention to what might be called the “positive” dimension of Kant’s philosophy, for example, the Transcendental Analytic.

  Abstract: Nizam al-Din Amir Alishir Nava’i (1441–1501) was a very learned man, a deeply cultivated man, a man of letters, and a man of unsurpassed caring intellect, a powerful patron for artists, the literati, and the scientists of his time. Amir Alishir Nava’i had a generous and gracious company. He was a humanist par excellence—poet, painter, prose stylist, vastly learned in his contemporary intellectual traditions, and a statesman of exceptional courage, tenacity, and imagination. Imagine his contemporary Lorenzo de’ Medici, Lorenzo the Magnificent (1449–1492), if you must, turning the Florentine republic into the epicenter of the Italian Renaissance,<br>

  Abstract: The State of the Union address offers every president the chance to identify his accomplishments, laud the condition of the country under his reign, and offer a vision for the future. In his speech of January 30, 2002, George W. Bush focused on the need for a drastic military buildup and a new doctrine for fighting terrorism in the aftermath of the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon by the al Qaeda terrorist network. It would become, arguably, the most important speech of his first term. The picture was painted of a nation at risk since September<br>

  Author(s) Collins Lindsey<br>
  Abstract: At President Obama’s inaugural luncheon, hanging behind the president’s table was Thomas Hill’s
                  View of Yosemite Valley(1885). Hill, a painter in the Hudson River tradition, is perhaps best known for his paintingThe Last Spike(1881), which commemorated the 1869 completion of the transcontinental railroad in Promontory Summit, Utah. Like the railroad’s completion, Yosemite’s preservation, decreed by Abraham Lincoln after the Civil War, was a symbol of national unity. Commenting on the significance of the painting chosen for Obama’s inauguration, Senator Dianne Feinstein noted, “As a country struggled with Civil War, many Americans looked West to the dawn of<br>

  Abstract: I have written well over a hundred poems that are to one degree or another after works of art—usually paintings. When I was asked recently about the attraction of such a topic, it occurred to me that the attraction lies in part in the fact that those works are finished things: whether or not they sport actual frames, they are all in some sense framed. Another way of saying this is that they are the polar opposite of the chaotic; and for reasons in part instinctive and in part educational, I do love the manifestly coherent—a brick wall<br>

  Abstract: When Mexican artist Diego Rivera traveled to the great metropolis of New York City during the Great Depression, he was both “amazed and appalled” at the shantytowns, breadlines, starvation, and suicides that he found to be endemic to a city that was for non-natives like him the very symbol of the United States. As New York journalist Pete Hamill wrote in his book on Rivera in 1999, the heavy-set, cigar-chomping, “‘big-jowled paisano’” and world-famous muralist proceeded to paint his conflicting views in one of his most compelling works,

  Book Title: Configuring Community-Theories, Narratives, and Practices of Community Identities in Contemporary Spain<br>
  Publisher: Modern Humanities Research Association<br>
  Author(s): George David D.<br>
  Abstract: The concept of community has become central to constructions of Spanish identities since the transition to democracy. Contemporary Spain is witnessing a political, social, and economic resurgence of community, which both cuts across and is prioritized over nation. Yet few studies of contemporary Spanish culture deal with this concept. This book aims to fill a gap in Spanish cultural studies by providing an in-depth analysis of the intersections of theories, narratives, and concepts of community identities across a broad range of media. Literature, film, music, and photography are analysed here in order to explore the diverse means by which community is imagined and constructed.<br>

  CHAPTER 3  TEMPORAL MOSAICS: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32b8xg">Configuring Community</a><br>
  Abstract: This chapter will examine two works by the Basque writer Bernardo Atxaga, 
                  Obabakoak (1988) and El hombre solo (1995), in order to assess their treatment of contemporary Spanish experiences of history and temporality and the subsequent effects on community identity. The previous chapter probed these issues in Llamazares’s work in the context of modernity. My aim here is to intensify the problematization of community in modernity presented in the first chapter through an analysis of Atxaga’s focus on identity in the more recent contexts of post-Francoist Spain. Underlying the key issues which arise in this chapter, therefore, is the postmodern<br>

  AFTERWORD: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32b8xg">Configuring Community</a><br>
  Abstract: As the preceding chapters show, this study of community must remain in the interrogative. Attempts to draw clear-cut conclusions on community would result in a discursive stasis, whereby the larger context of modernity and postmodernity—as late modernity or an intensification of the tensions between discourse and practice that characterise modernity—would be lost. The notion of community in postmodern Spain can be seen to be foregrounded in political and cultural contexts over emphases on nation or state. Nevertheless, community is itself a problematic concept: necessarily fluid in order to survive in current contexts, yet loaded with the fixed structures<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bk1z">Reading Abstract Expressionism</a><br>
  Author(s) MOTHERWELL ROBERT<br>
  Abstract: […] The function of the artist is to express reality as 
                  felt. In saying this, we must remember that ideas modify feelings. The anti-intellectualism of English and American artists has led them to the error of not perceiving the connection between the feeling of modern forms and modern ideas. By feeling is meant the response of the “body-and-mind” as a whole to the events of reality. It is the whole man who feels in artistic experience as when we say with Plato: “The man has a pain in his finger” (The Republic, 462 D), and not, “The finger has a<br>

  Abstract: The Kwakiutl artist painting on a hide did not concern himself with the inconsequentials that made up the opulent social rivalries of the Northwest Coast Indian scene; nor did he, in the name of a higher purity, renounce the living world for the meaningless materialism of design. The abstract shape he used, his entire plastic language, was directed by a ritualistic will toward metaphysical understanding. The everyday realities he left to the toymakers; the pleasant play of nonobjective pattern, to the women basket weavers.

  Author(s) GREENBERG CLEMENT<br>
  Abstract: The latest abstract painting offends many people, among whom are more than a few who accept the abstract in art in principle. New painting (sculpture is a different question) still provokes scandal when little that is new in literature or even music appears to do so any longer. This may be explained by the very slowness of painting’s evolution as a modernist art. Though it started on its “modernization” earlier perhaps than the other arts, it has turned out to have a greater number of 
                  expendable conventions imbedded in it, or these at least have proven harder to isolate and<br>

  Abstract: In discussing the place of painting and sculpture in the culture of our time, I shall refer only to those kinds which, whether abstract or not, have a fresh inventive character, that art which is called “modern” not simply because it is of our century, but because it is the work of artists who take seriously the challenge of new possibilities and wish to introduce into their work perceptions, ideas and experiences which have come about only within our time.<br>

  Abstract: […] As the title indicates, the present exhibition is really a double exhibition which not only surveys the present state of the Abstract Expressionists but follows in some detail the direction to which the name “Abstract Imagists” has been applied. It is a fact that from the late Forties to the present day certain painters, loosely grouped with the Abstract Expressionists, have rather been concerned through extreme simplification of their canvases—frequently to the dominant assertion of a single overpowering element—in presenting an all-encompassing presence. This “presence” could be described as an “image” in the sense of an abstract<br>

  Abstract: The almost complete failure of contemporary art criticism to come to grips with Pollock’s accomplishment is striking. This failure has been due to several factors. First and least important, the tendency of art writers such as Harold Rosenberg and Thomas Hess to regard Pollock as a kind of natural existentialist has served to obscure the simple truth that Pollock was, on the contrary, a painter whose work is always inhabited by a subtle, questing formal intelligence of the highest order, and whose concern in his art was not with any fashionable metaphysics of despair but with making the best paintings<br>

  Abstract: A problem that reciprocally involved both subject matter and formality engaged the Abstract Expressionist painters of the middle and late forties. It was how to make paintings that would be powerful signifiers, and this led to decisions as to what signifiers could be properly referred to without compromising (too much) the flatness of the picture plane. The desire for a momentous content was constricted by the spatial requirement of flatness and by the historically influenced need to avoid direct citation of objects. Something of this train of thought can be seen in Barnett Newman’s reflections on the role of the<br>

  Abstract: For Robert Motherwell, the act of titling his art is an essential component of the creative process. He is convinced that viewers require specific intellectual and emotional perspectives when looking at his paintings so that their experiences of them will be directed and concrete. While some titles reinforce the type of painterly abstraction for which he is renowned, others, including his justly famous 
                     Elegies to the Spanish Republic, bear political and literary tags. He intends these ad hoc conjunctions to be mutually supportive and consequently is careful to consider his options when titling works.<br>

Graham in the American avant-garde art scene in the 1930s and 1940s.¹ Having arrived in New York in 1920, this man of diverse talents was simultaneously an artist, writer, theoretician, collector, polemicist for modernism, mystic and self-proclaimed magus. By the latter Twenties, he had become a pivotal personality in a loose-knit group that ultimately would include some important members of the Early New York School, chief among whom were the painters Arshile Gorky and Willem de Kooning.

  Author(s) RUSHING W. JACKSON<br>
  Abstract: In the late 1930s and early 1940s the “myth-makers” of the New York avant-garde, including Adolph Gottlieb, Jackson Pollock, Richard Pousette-Dart, and Mark Rothko, made paintings that referred to atavistic myth, primordial origins, and primitive rituals and symbols, especially those of Native American cultures.¹ Barnett Newman began to work in a similar fashion about 1944 and was influential as a theorist and indefatigable promoter of this new art. The “myth-makers” shared a tendency to depict ritual violence or inherently violent myths as well as an archaism exemplified by biomorphic forms and, often, coarse surfaces.

  Abstract: Barnett Newman’s observation that he and the other New York School painters had “made cathedrals of ourselves” attests to their participation in the divinization of the self. Schematic though it may be, the outline of some of the varied strands within Modern Man discourse provides an illuminating cultural matrix for the interests and works of the New York School painters. Like the Modern Man authors, these artists saw their work as responsive to the war and other contemporary stresses.

  Abstract: Consider, for just one moment Jackson Pollock’s 
                  Cut-Out of 1948–1950. Don’t flip to look at a reproduction. Instead, and perhaps more appropriately, conjure it in your mind. For though Pollock’s Cut-Out is a painting, it is a work from which the center, the figure, has quite literally been excised, extinguished, a work with nothing more at its core than a ghostly trace, figuration as corpse. Emptied of its bodily fullness, its corporeality, its life, Cut-Out leaves us with nothing other than figuration as a hollow shell, a specter which can only haunt abstraction.

  Abstract: Despite its importance, Clyfford Stillʼs work poses greater problems for scholarship than that of any other artist associated with Abstract Expressionism. Secondary sources remain either scarce or obscure, while the complete corpus of his works has neither been shown nor published.¹ What is known stems largely from Still himself, who thereby sought to pre-empt the mosaic of art-historical interpretation.

We know this from Thomas Hess’s account of Newman’s career published in 1971.

My conclusions will suggest that neither the artist nor his biographer used Kabbalah from a normative Jewish point of view, or, to say it differently, neither used Jewish sources in a way acceptable to<br>

Carmean’s efforts to link Jackson Pollock’s black paintings not just circumstantially but thematically—liturgically—to an abortive church project by Tony Smith. Carmean’s essay, published in French in the catalogue of the big Pollock exhibition at the Centre Pompidou, was now to appear in 
                  Art in America, and the magazine’s editor, Betsy Baker, aware of Lee’s as well as my own vigorous objections, had asked me to write an accompanying reply.¹<br>

  16  Data About Psychoanalytic Processes from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bvwm">Does Psychoanalysis Work?</a><br>
  Abstract: In studying psychoanalytic processes or any other complex phenomenon, enough data must be collected to be meaningful, the data must be reduced to a tractable form without undue loss of significance, and the extent to which particular findings can be generalized must be described. Not only is the analytic process complex, but it varies from one analysis to another. It is therefore important that many detailed instances of psychoanalytic practice be available for close study. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the painstaking collection of information in chemistry, descriptive biology, geology, and many other fields led to the generalizations that<br>

  The “Golden Age” of Jewish-Muslim Relations: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fgz64">A History of Jewish-Muslim Relations</a><br>
  Author(s) Cohen Mark R.<br>
  Abstract: In the nineteenth century there was nearly universal consensus that Jews in the Islamic Middle Ages—taking al-Andalus, or Muslim Spain, as the model—lived in a “Golden Age” of Jewish-Muslim harmony,¹ an interfaith utopia of tolerance and
                  convivencia.² It was thought that Jews mingled freely and comfortably with Muslims, immersed in Arabic-Islamic culture, including the language, poetry, philosophy, science, medicine, and the study of Scripture—a society, furthermore, in which Jews could and many did ascend to the pinnacles of political power in Muslim government. This idealized picture went beyond Spain to encompass the entire Muslim world, from Baghdad<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fgz64">A History of Jewish-Muslim Relations</a><br>
  Author(s) Tolan John<br>
  Abstract: In the Muslim societies of the Middle Ages, Jews and Christians had the status of
                  dhimmīs, protected but at the same time inferior. In the Christian kingdoms of the Middle Ages, Jews and sometimes Muslims lived under similar conditions with respect to the Christians. But their status became increasingly precarious in many European countries. Minorities were subjected to violence and expulsions. For example, the Jews were expelled from France in 1182, again in 1306, and once more in 1394; from England in 1290; from Spain in 1492; and from Portugal in 1497. The Muslims were expelled from Sicily in the<br>

  Abstract: The great movement of the expulsion of the Jews from Spain and Portugal, taken up by several Italian states at the end of the fifteenth and the beginning of the sixteenth centuries, had important consequences for Ottoman Jewry, which would be the major recipient of these exiles. The Sephardic component, which was layered onto older, preexisting strata of Jewish populations, and would in turn be superseded by other arrivals, was henceforth dominant in population and cultural influence, in keeping with a brilliant, carefully preserved heritage. The favorable reception of Jews by Sultan Bayezid II is not a myth, even if<br>

  Abstract: We must await the period of the Mamluks—at the beginning of the fourteenth century—to see the Jews resettle in large numbers in Jerusalem and Hebron. The demography remained stable during the lengthy period from 1250 to 1516, at the end of which Jerusalem fell into the hands of the Ottomans.

  Abstract: The Andalusian philosophical milieu of the Middle Ages holds the key to understanding the dual transmission of knowledge between East and West at that time. First, the centers of cultural life under the Abassids communicated their knowledge to Andalusia (tenth to twelfth centuries). Shortly thereafter, philosophical works from Andalusia were dispersed to the major intellectual centers of Christian Europe. Because of this dual movement of cultural transfer, Arabic Spain was the site of one of the most significant historical moments in terms of scientific exchanges and the development of ideas.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fgz64">A History of Jewish-Muslim Relations</a><br>
  Author(s) Itzhaki Masha<br>
  Abstract: Hebrew poetry in Spain, which took root in Córdoba in the tenth century under the caliphate of ʿAbd al-Rahman III, stemmed from two extremely strong cultural influences: Classical Arabic poetry and the language of the Bible. Biblical Hebrew is the raw material for the Jewish poets of Andalusia, from which they deliberately draw the linguistic tools needed for their poems. From its first appearance, Andalusian Hebrew poetry used the full variety of themes and prosody of Arabic poetry, those of the pre-Islamic period, those of the Abbasid period, and those typical of al-Andalus.<br>

  Abstract: Among the many intellectual and artistic contributions with roots in medieval Islamic Spain, Andalusian music is probably the most widely known in the Arab world and the least well known in the West.¹ Andalusian music certainly merits attention in its own right as a rich tradition that has been transmitted orally for more than a thousand years and that continues to be performed in many regions of the Middle East, but it also merits special attention as the primary vehicle for the collective memory of, and nostalgia for, medieval Islamic Spain, which constitutes such powerful aspects of Arab and Sephardic<br>

  Abstract: For Kant, the “emotional satisfaction” produced by the sublime derives from the realization of the powers of Reason. For Burke, the pain and terror brought by the sublime achieve a catharsis; they “clear the parts, whether fine, or gross, of a dangerous and troublesome incumbrance.”¹ Yet it strikes me that any satisfaction achieved with a more modern sublime relates to the pleasure felt when standing in the midst of ruin.

The larger realities of many shelter lives, which were spent in and out of hospitals, psychiatrists’ offices, and halfway houses, help to explain the use-value of complaints. Complaints typically rode on the first person singular: the “I” was plaintive. They often alluded to some private feeling or personal trouble, but primarily for practical reasons: by noting a pain or oppression, the complaints could effect a reality to which one’s audience might feel compelled<br>

  Abstract: Among the Songhay of Mali and Niger, who consider the stomach the seat of personality, learning is understood not in terms of mental activity but in bodily terms. Songhay bards study history by "eating the words of the ancestors," and sorcerers learn their art by ingesting particular substances, by testing their flesh with knives, by mastering pain and illness. In
      Sensuous ScholarshipPaul Stoller challenges contemporary social theorists and cultural critics who-using the notion of embodiment to critique Eurocentric and phallocentric predispositions in scholarly thought-consider the body primarily as a text that can be read and analyzed. Stoller argues that this attitude is in itself Eurocentric and is particularly inappropriate for anthropologists, who often work in societies in which the notion of text, and textual interpretation, is foreign. ThroughoutSensuous ScholarshipStoller argues for the importance of understanding the "sensuous epistemologies" of many non-Western societies so that we can better understand the societies themselves and what their epistemologies have to teach us about human experience in general.<br>

In later writings Rorty, among others, espoused a new pragmatism that emphasized local truths, community cohesion and civil conversation. Rorty and others did not claim that epistemology did not exist, but rather that epistemologies formulated and reformulated themselves in the interactional instabilities of local community life—all in a myriad of conversations that would edify the public.¹<br>

  Abstract: In his treatise on painting of 1678, the Dutch artist Samuel van Hoogstraten (1627-1678), one of Rembrandt’s pupils, pleaded for the inclusion of the art of painting among the liberal arts. One of his strategies was connecting the visual arts to ideas about language and letters developed by influential philologists such as Gerardus Vossius (1577-1649) and Franciscus Junius (1591-1677). In this context, Van Hoogstraten’s book touched on the subject of pictography, the ideal of a script based on pictures rather than letters. He discussed this in connection to the art of the Chinese.

  Book Title: Poetry as Survival-  Publisher: University of Georgia Press<br>
  Author(s): ORR GREGORY<br>
  Abstract: Intended for general readers and for students and scholars of poetry, Poetry as Survival is a complex and lucid analysis of the powerful role poetry can play in confronting, surviving, and transcending pain and suffering. Gregory Orr draws from a generous array of sources. He weaves discussions of work by Keats, Dickinson, and Whitman with quotes from three-thousand-year-old Egyptian poems, Inuit songs, and Japanese love poems to show that writing personal lyric has helped poets throughout history to process emotional and experiential turmoil, from individual stress to collective grief. More specifically, he considers how the acts of writing, reading, and listening to lyric bring ordering powers to the chaos that surrounds us. Moving into more contemporary work, Orr looks at the poetry of Sylvia Plath, Stanley Kunitz, and Theodore Roethke, poets who relied on their own work to get through painful psychological experiences. As a poet who has experienced considerable trauma--especially as a child--Orr refers to the damaging experiences of his past and to the role poetry played in his ability to recover and survive. His personal narrative makes all the more poignant and vivid Orr's claims for lyric poetry's power as a tool for healing. Poetry as Survival is a memorable and inspiring introduction to lyric poetry's capacity to help us find safety and comfort in a threatening world.<br>

The notion that Jesus was white with blue eyes and blonde hair became anathema for many black power leaders. Long a dominant visual and sacred image in American culture, the white Christ now found himself besieged on all sides, especially in northern cities.

  Abstract: The Colorado Coalfield War Archaeology Project (CCWAP) strove to complement the written history of the 1913–1914 labor strike in southern Colorado.

Further, it cannot show the living conditions that led up to the strike or illustrate the strike’s effect on the material conditions of the workers and their families. Such is the nature of history.

As Herskovitz notes, senility is characterized as “monstrosity” by the lay media with “clichéd metaphors and representations in which Alzheimer’s is characteristically drawn in colourfully dramatic terms that paint vividly disturbing images” (1995, 152–153).

  Book Title: Illness as Narrative-  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Jurecic Ann<br>
  Abstract: For most of literary history, personal confessions about illness were considered too intimate to share publicly. By the mid-twentieth century, however, a series of events set the stage for the emergence of the illness narrative. The increase of chronic disease, the transformation of medicine into big business, the women's health movement, the AIDS/HIV pandemic, the advent of inexpensive paperbacks, and the rise of self-publishing all contributed to the proliferation of narratives about encounters with medicine and mortality.While the illness narrative is now a staple of the publishing industry, the genre itself has posed a problem for literary studies. What is the role of criticism in relation to personal accounts of suffering? Can these narratives be judged on aesthetic grounds? Are they a collective expression of the lost intimacy of the patient-doctor relationship? Is their function thus instrumental-to elicit the reader's empathy?To answer these questions, Ann Jurecic turns to major works on pain and suffering by Susan Sontag, Elaine Scarry, and Eve Sedgwick and reads these alongside illness narratives by Jean-Dominique Bauby, Reynolds Price, and Anne Fadiman, among others. In the process, she defines the subgenres of risk and pain narratives and explores a range of critical responses guided, alternately, by narrative empathy, the hermeneutics of suspicion, and the practice of reparative reading.
      Illness as Narrativeseeks to draw wider attention to this form of life writing and to argue for new approaches to both literary criticism and teaching narrative. Jurecic calls for a practice that's both compassionate and critical. She asks that we consider why writers compose stories of illness, how readers receive them, and how both use these narratives to make meaning of human fragility and mortality.<br>

  Abstract: While the experience of being “at risk” is newly recognized as presenting a problem for language and literature, pain has long been understood to resist expression in words. At its worst, pain is unchosen, extreme, and without purpose; it obscures memory, thought, language, everything but itself. How can one communicate such an experience? Chronic pain does not present the same challenge to expression as acute pain and even agony can find its way into a story as time passes, but the problem posed by pain remains. How people express pain is highly varied, inherently subjective, and thus difficult—perhaps even<br>

  Abstract: While the experience of being “at risk” is newly recognized as presenting a problem for language and literature, pain has long been understood to resist expression in words. At its worst, pain is unchosen, extreme, and without purpose; it obscures memory, thought, language, everything but itself. How can one communicate such an experience? Chronic pain does not present the same challenge to expression as acute pain and even agony can find its way into a story as time passes, but the problem posed by pain remains. How people express pain is highly varied, inherently subjective, and thus difficult—perhaps even<br>

  Abstract: In previous chapters, I discussed the challenges to expression posed by experiences of risk, pain, suffering, and even sympathy, and examined how personal narratives about illness present problems for dominant literary critical practices that are based in hermeneutics of suspicion. In her final book,
                  Touching Feeling, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick labels interpretive approaches that seek to expose secrets, errors, and manipulation “paranoid practices.” She points out a truth that is hard to see from within the world of criticism: “paranoia knows some things well and others poorly” (130). Among the things that paranoia does not know well are personal accounts of<br>

  Abstract: During the last decades of the eighteenth century and the first decades of the nineteenth, the major Atlantic empires confronted, and in several cases succumbed to, movements for national independence in the Americas. The political defeats in the Americas overlapped with, and sometimes drove, the painfully slow elimination of the Atlantic slave trade, though slavery itself survived in one form or another in all the independent American republics except for one. They also overlapped with – and informed, both as sources of inspiration and as warnings – the beginnings of territorial expansion into Africa and Asia. Events in all the<br>

My interest in them here, however, is not primarily literary-critical, and I do not propose to offer sustained critical commentary on the poetry itself, although my discussion does move towards a closer attention to some detailed features of the poetry. I am mainly interested in some larger questions raised by Browning’s interest in those particular painters, at that particular time in the middle of the nineteenth century.

  Abstract: Among the great Victorian novelists, Thackeray could probably best be described as a natural connoisseur of the fine arts. George Eliot and Hardy acquired considerable expertise in matters of art, but both set out with a deliberate intention to learn the subject which was very different from Thackeray’s comfortable familiarity. This may help to explain why Hardy’s novels make more direct reference to painters and their works than do those of Thackeray, although an equally plausible explanation could be found in the later date at which Hardy was writing.

  Book Title: Spanish Spaces-Landscape, Space and Place in Contemporary Spanish Culture<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): DAVIES ANN<br>
  Abstract: Spanish Spaces is a pioneering study that marries contemporary cultural geography with contemporary Spanish culture. The field of cultural geography has grown both extensively and rapidly, as has the field of cultural analysis and debate on Spanish cultural texts; yet despite a convergence in study between cultural geography (and cultural studies more widely) and cultural texts themselves, this has made little impact to date within the area of contemporary Spanish cultural studies. Yet Spain’s varied terrain, with complex negotiations between rural, urban and coastal (negotiations that have on occasion spilled over into political and violent conflict), and perhaps its very lack of a contemporary landscape tradition familiar to British and German cultural studies, offer the opportunity for fresh insights into questions of landscape, space and place. Drawing on case studies from contemporary Spanish film and literature, Davies explores the themes of memory and forgetting, nationalism and terrorism, crime and detection, gender, tourism and immigration, investigating what it means to think of space and places in specifically Spanish terms.<br>

  Abstract: This book derives from my readings from the field of cultural geography in an attempt to reflect on the terrain of the entity known as Spain, through the prism of my scholarly interest in contemporary Spanish cinematic and literary texts. A further motivation is the difficulties I and others wrestle with in Hispanic Studies as we try to investigate questions bounded by an idea of nation, in an era when the whole notion of a nation is open to dispute and indeed discredit. Some scholars now talk of an era of ‘post-nationalism’ and sometimes by implication post-nation-ism, but the concept<br>

  Abstract: This and the next chapter emphasise one of the key contemporary political and cultural issues in Spain today, that of the recuperation of memories of the Spanish Civil War and its aftermath. Spain’s transition from dictatorship to democracy in the late 70s and early 80s was assumed to be based on a
                  pacto de olvido(pact of forgetting) that did not call to account those who played a leading role in the previous Franco regime. In particular, those on Franco’s side who committed atrocities against their opponents benefited from an implicit amnesty for their crimes. However, as democracy consolidated itself,<br>

  Abstract: If landscape, space and place can be used as a way of seeing past traumas and the way in which they haunt the present, they can also be used to see present traumas, too. One of the most enduring legacies of Franco’s dictatorship is the sometimes violent struggle over the political position of the Basque Country, in the north of the Iberian peninsula: although the roots of the Basque nationalist movement promoting greater autonomy or outright independence from Spain go further back in time than the Franco period, the dictatorship added a new edge to calls for a recognition of<br>

  Abstract: Spain has functioned as a tourist location for outsiders for at least the past two centuries. In the nineteenth century Frenchmen found Spain convivial as the primitive other next door, conveniently just the other side of the Pyrenees but allowing an escape, for a time, from the constraints of polite French society. This included a form of sex tourism, or at the very least an appreciation of maidens duskier than those to be found in France.

  Abstract: One of the purposes of this book has been to reinvigorate the meaning of the word Spain as a term of more than simple convenience for academics. What that term means, of course, is another matter altogether. Given the case studies outlined here, the term resonates in different and often opposing ways. While both the films of del Toro and the novels of Torrente Ballester look to recover a Spain apparently lost, the Spains they imagine to be lost are very different, as are the reasons why recuperation is desirable.

With the exception of a few sceptical voices, for most commentators, the documentary, indexical status of photography was a given. If Dadaist and Surrealist experimentation – the photomontages,<br>

  Book Title: Artists, Intellectuals, and World War II-The Pontigny Encounters at Mount Holyoke College, 19421944<br>
  Publisher: University of Massachusetts Press<br>
  Author(s): Remmler Karen<br>
  Abstract: Sixty years ago, at the height of World War II, an extraordinary series of gatherings took place at Mount Holyoke College in western Massachusetts. During the summers of 1942–1944, leading Europeanﬁgures in the arts and sciences met at the college with their American counterparts for urgent conversations about the future of human civilization in a precarious world. Two Sorbonne professors, the distinguished medievalist Gustave Cohen and the existentialist philosopher Jean Wahl, organized these “Pontigny” sessions, named after an abbey in Burgundy where similar symposia had been held in the decades before the war. Among the participants—many of whom were Jewish or had Jewish backgrounds—were the philosophers Hannah Arendt and Rachel Bespaloff, the poets Marianne Moore and Wallace Stevens, the anthropologist Claude LéviStrauss and the linguist Roman Jakobson, and the painters Marc Chagall and Robert Motherwell. In this collection of original essays, Stanley Cavell and Jacques Derrida lead an international group of scholars—including Jed Perl, Mary Ann Caws, Jeffrey Mehlman, and Elisabeth YoungBruehl—in assessing the lasting impact and contemporary signiﬁcance of Pontignyen Amérique. Rachel Bespaloff, a tragicﬁgure who wrote a major work on the Iliad, is restored to her rightful place beside Arendt and Simone Weil. Anyone interested in the “intellectual resistance” of Francophone intellectuals and artists, and the inspiring support from such Americanﬁgures as Stevens and Moore, will want to read this pioneering work of scholarship and historical recreation.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wq429">Postmodern Texts and Emotional Audiences</a><br>
  Abstract: Postmodern literature and film have often been characterized by a thematic obsession with the disintegration of families, communities, and larger socio-political ties. Rather than painting such dark themes with the brush of tragedy, postmodern texts often adopt a tone of mocking irony or disaffected nihilism. Kathy Acker’s parodic avant-garde fiction, for example, is a complex meditation on contemporary nihilism, on the “nothingness everybody now seems to want” (
                  In Memoriam to Identity263). The hipness of postmodern disaffection was cemented with the popularity of Quentin Tarantino’s filmPulp Fiction(1994), which turns an absence of morality into fodder for black comedy.<br>

She began her public career in 1911 with the organization of Seitō (The Bluestocking Society), a literary movement that announced the birth of the women’s liberation movement in Japan. A fierce individualism coupled with the self-effacing practice of Zen meditation combined to sustain her engagement in women’s questions throughout her adult life. During the first decade of the twentieth century, she stood up for women’s right to genuine romantic love. She herself fell in love with Okumura Hiroshi, a painter five years her junior, and, in<br>

  Abstract: “Why did she never tell us this?” My stunned aunt Chanda-phui turned to look again at the small, brightly painted Shiva temple in the Kathiawar peninsula of Gujarat, western India. Moments before, a gray haired stranger had ambled in through the temple gate, settled on a ledge, and casually narrated the founding legend of this village temple: a legend that featured Chandaphui’s mother, my grandmother Ba. This soft-spoken man had most likely not imagined that he would be addressing Ba’s descendents to explode over eighty years of silence and unsettle our conceptions of ancestral identity.<br>

  Author(s) Lara María Pía<br>
  Abstract: Today democracy is almost universally acclaimed as the criterion of legitimacy for political systems. The consensus regarding its worth is the result of painful historical experiences in this century. The revival of political philosophy in academic circles reflects a need to rethink some basic issues concerning what democracy is and how it should be conceived. Political philosophers are discussing whether democracy is merely a form of government, or a political way of life, and how proceduralism relates to questions concerning the good, or if it is even capable of dealing with such substantial issues. Communitarianism and feminism have raised many<br>

  Abstract: The art of the Papunya Tula painting movement has stimulated dozens of exhibitions both locally and internationally in the past twenty-five years. It has inspired many catalogue essays and anthropologically inflected studies. TV documentaries and films have been dedicated to it. Thoroughly researched monographs have been devoted to individual artists involved in the movement’s beginnings. The exhibition catalogue

  Author(s) MOERMAN D. MAX<br>
  Abstract: The Heian period has often been characterized as a golden age of Japanese religious culture, one in which the Buddhist literature, painting, sculpture, and architecture produced at court are considered to have reached unprecedented heights. It is thus all the more surprising that in this time of cultural florescence many Buddhists, monastics and aristocrats alike, understood themselves to be living in an age of decay. According to their interpretation of Buddhist chronologies, the eleventh century marked the beginning of the end: the onset of

  Abstract: At odd intervals in the main galleries of the renovated Museum of Modern Art, there are textual supplements to paintings, rarely more than a paragraph, providing snippets of information about the artist, the context of the work’s production, or the place it holds in the narrative of modern art. What makes these random exceptions to the more frequent practice of labeling the artwork only by artist, title, and date so intriguing is that they seem to follow no obvious pattern that might justify the choices made by the curators to arrest the process of pure looking.

  Book Title: The Aesthetics of Mimesis-Ancient Texts and Modern Problems<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Halliwell Stephen<br>
  Abstract: Mimesis is one of the oldest, most fundamental concepts in Western aesthetics. This book offers a new, searching treatment of its long history at the center of theories of representational art: above all, in the highly influential writings of Plato and Aristotle, but also in later Greco-Roman philosophy and criticism, and subsequently in many areas of aesthetic controversy from the Renaissance to the twentieth century. Combining classical scholarship, philosophical analysis, and the history of ideas--and ranging across discussion of poetry, painting, and music--Stephen Halliwell shows with a wealth of detail how mimesis, at all stages of its evolution, has been a more complex, variable concept than its conventional translation of "imitation" can now convey.<br>

  Abstract: If poetry is the art form that occupies most space in ancient discussions of mimesis, it is equally true that the figurative arts, above all painting, constitute an almost ever present paradigm and point of reference for interpretation of the concept. This state of affairs goes back beyond Aristotle’s
                  Poetics, in which painting is cited as a parallel to poetry on a total of eight occasions, and even beyond Plato’s own frequent comparisons of the two arts, not least in the momentous conjunction of painting and poetry inRepublicbook 10.² The aesthetic association of poetry and painting is at<br>

  Abstract: It is significant that the Society of Biblical Literature Group on Ascetic Behavior in Greco-Roman Antiquity, despite prolonged meetings throughout the 1980s, never reached consensus on a definition of asceticism. After scholars in the Group rehearsed the dictionary definition of “ascetic” (“given to strict self-denial, esp. for the sake of spiritual or intellectual discipline”)¹ and noted its derivation from the Greek word for the physical training that an athlete might undertake,² questions of function, motivation, and purpose intruded to disturb the short-lived agreement.

  Book Title: Through Other Continents-American Literature across Deep Time<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Dimock Wai Chee<br>
  Abstract: Inspired by an unorthodox archive--ranging from epic traditions in Akkadian and Sanskrit to folk art, paintings by Veronese and Tiepolo, and the music of the Grateful Dead--Dimock constructs a long history of the world, a history she calls "deep time." The civilizations of Mesopotamia, India, Egypt, China, and West Africa, as well as Europe, leave their mark on American literature, which looks dramatically different when it is removed from a strictly national or English-language context. Key authors such as Thoreau, Margaret Fuller, Ezra Pound, Robert Lowell, Gary Snyder, Leslie Silko, Gloria Naylor, and Gerald Vizenor are transformed in this light. Emerson emerges as a translator of Islamic culture; Henry James's novels become long-distance kin to
         Gilgamesh; and Black English loses its ungrammaticalness when reclassified as a creole tongue, meshing the input from Africa, Europe, and the Americas.<br>

  Book Title: Slavery and the Culture of Taste-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Gikandi Simon<br>
  Abstract: It would be easy to assume that, in the eighteenth century, slavery and the culture of taste--the world of politeness, manners, and aesthetics--existed as separate and unequal domains, unrelated in the spheres of social life. But to the contrary,
         Slavery and the Culture of Tastedemonstrates that these two areas of modernity were surprisingly entwined. Ranging across Britain, the antebellum South, and the West Indies, and examining vast archives, including portraits, period paintings, personal narratives, and diaries, Simon Gikandi illustrates how the violence and ugliness of enslavement actually shaped theories of taste, notions of beauty, and practices of high culture, and how slavery's impurity informed and haunted the rarified customs of the time.<br>

                  Two Negroes(fig. 1.1), considered one of the most compelling paintings of the last phase of his illustrious career. Working with African models and operating within a Dutch culture whose domestic economy was driven by the slave trade, Rembrandt sought to turn his black figures, people who most probably had arrived in the European Low Countries as slaves or servants, into elevated subjects through art. This gesture—the transformation of the most marginal figures in society into elevated works of<br>

On the surface, Brunias’s images were colorful evocations of tropical landscapes, now familiar touristic pictures of a West Indian paradise where happy blacks and enchanting mulattoes encountered one another in markets, streets, and dance arenas against the picturesque background<br>

  Abstract: As far back as we know, people have been tormented by memories that filled them with feelings of sadness and remorse, the sense of irreparable loss, and sensations of fright and horror. During the nineteenth century, a new kind of painful memory emerged. It was unlike the memories of earlier times in that it originated in a previously unidentified psychological state, called “traumatic,” and was linked to previously unknown kinds of forgetting, called “repression” and “dissociation.”<br>

  Author(s): Favret Mary A.<br>
  Abstract: Favret examines wartime literature and art as varied as meditations on the
      Iliad, the history of meteorology, landscape painting in India, and popular poetry in newspapers and periodicals; she locates the embedded sense of war and dislocation in works ranging from Austen, Coleridge, and Wordsworth to Woolf, Stevens, and Sebald; and she contemplates how literature provides the public with methods for responding to violent calamities happening elsewhere. Bringing to light Romanticism's legacy in reflections on modern warfare, this book shows that war's absent presence affects home in deep and irrevocable ways.<br>

The components of the contradiction may seem, at first glance, obvious. We take for granted, as did Sappho, the sweetness of erotic desire; its pleasurability smiles out at us.

And the desire of each is something paradoxical. As lover you want ice to

  Author(s): NOOTENS GENEVIÈVE<br>
  Abstract: In light of a renewed interest in the study of nationalism, Contemporary Majority Nationalism brings together a group of major scholars committed to making sense of this widespread phenomenon. To better illustrate the reality of majority nationalism and the way it has been expressed, authors combine analytical and comparative perspectives. In the first section, contributors highlight the paradox of majority nationalism and the ways in which collective identities become national identities. The second section offers in-depth case study analyses of France, the United Kingdom, Spain, Canada, and the United States. This book is an international project led by three members of the Research Group on Plurinational Societies based at Université du Québec à Montréal. Contributors include James Bickerton (St-Francis Xavier University), Ángel Castiñeira (ESADE - Escuela superior de administración y dirección de empresas), John Coakley (University College Dublin), Alain Dieckhoff (Institut d’études politiques, Paris), Louis Dupont (Sorbonne University), Enric Fossas (Unversitat Autònoma de Barcelona), Alain-G.

It is therefore a very difficult subject to deal with in a satisfying manner within the framework of a conference, where this chapter originated. Moreover, every assessment is always tainted by some subjectivity that is inevitably dependent on preconceived political ideas, as well as inescapable cultural sensibilities.

  Author(s): Morrison Karl F.<br>
  Abstract: Karl Morrison discusses historical writing at a turning point in European culture: the so-called Renaissance of the twelfth century. Why do texts considered at that time to be masterpieces seem now to be fragmentary and full of contradictions? Morrison maintains that the answer comes from ideas about art. Viewing histories as artifacts made according to the same aesthetic principles as paintings and theater, he shows that twelfth-century authors and audiences found unity not in what the reason read in a text but in what the imagination read into it: they prized visual over verbal imagination and employed a circular, or nuclear, spectator-centered perspective cast aside in the Renaissance of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.<br>

  TWELVE  The Ascendancy of Sensations over Passions: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvm0c">I Am You</a><br>
  Abstract: The contemplative tradition in Western art was an erotic tradition. Violent and exalted, eroticism took many forms, but it was always present in that moment when the contemplator took to his heart the object of his desire. When this kind of absorption occurred in the asymmetry of viewer and painting, it generally hinged on invention, that is, on the subject portrayed. When it occurred in the asymmetry of artist and painting, it hinged on the manifold experience of previsualization, that is, on the instant of choosing the subject. The pathetic and affective fallacies played a role in both asymmetries.<br>

  Abstract: Almost at the very beginning of this book, we considered John Donne’s verses on the delight that painters take “not in made work, but whiles they make” (Chapter 3, n. 79). All that we have said locates the bonding of the “I” and the “you” in art in the creative act, but we have also seen that the creative act may occur, not once only, but many times.

  Author(s) Hoesterey Ingeborg<br>
  Abstract: The analysis of narrative technique in fiction has generally been considered something of a craft, practiced at times with painstaking descriptive precision and analytic power, and predominandy used in the service of interpretation. Narratology has often been mentioned in the same breath with structuralism, for both aspire to systematic comprehensiveness and attempt to identify and classify mechanisms and structures that generate, respectively, cultural and textual meaning. To be sure, “low structuralism” (as Robert Scholes was to call Genettean narratology) could not have matured in the sixties and seventies without the tradition of close textual analysis inaugurated by New Criticism.¹ Structuralist<br>

  Book Title: From Cohen to Carson-The Poet's Novel in Canada<br>

  Abstract: Detailed case studies of novels by Leonard Cohen, Michael Ondaatje, George Bowering, Daphne Marlatt, and Anne Carson, as well as sections on A.M. Klein and Anne Michaels, reveal how these authors framed their early novels according to formal precedents established in their poetry. In tracking the authors’ shift from lyric to long poem to novel, Rae also investigates their experiments with non-literary art forms - photography, painting, film. The authors discussed combine disparate genres and media to alter notions of narrative coherence in the novel and engage the diverse but fragmented cultural histories of Canadian society.<br>

  Abstract: Members of the political science community in Canada were saddened to hear of the sudden death of one of their most respected colleagues, Khayyam Zev Paltiel, on April 17, 1988. For those of us who had spent some time at Carleton University, either as students or as teachers, and who came to know Khayyam, the loss was particularly painful. Many of us in the Political Science department at Carleton had unthinkingly assumed that there would always be a Khayyam Paltiel wandering the corridors of the sixth floor in the Loeb Building, a copy of the

  Abstract: “The power of rewarding modest worth is perhaps the sweetest blessing that attends Rank & authority, for our Great Master tells us that it is more blessed to give than to receive.” Thus wrote the Reverend John Strachan in 1818 (Spragge, 1946:186). For understandable reasons, however, prime ministers, premiers, and others in high political office have been inclined to view the business of bestowing discretionary rewards — that is, the dispensing of patronage — in a less altruistic light, and their power over it as less of a blessing than, as Brian Mulroney put it, “a pain in the neck” (Simpson, 1988:355).<br>

In its heyday the structure was subject to several rebuildings. Then, from the eighth to the nineteenth century, it endured a long, often painful afterlife.

Whereas Findley’s

  Abstract: Discourse—all discourse—has forever been the object of surveillance. History is there to remind us that political or religious thought has never been totally free. And of course, esthetic discourses of all kinds (paintings, books, plays) have always been prey to censorship. Tintoretto, Molière, Voltaire, Rousseau, etc., all had dealings with the thought police of their day.¹ In the last ten years or so, the age-old practice of policing opinions has acquired a new name: political correctness, offspring of the American liberal left of the 1980s. For the purposes of this paper, I will single out two discourses that<br>

  Book Title: Augustine's Theology of Preaching-  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): SANLON PETER T.<br>
  Abstract: Scholarship has painted many pictures of Augustine—the philosophical theologian, the refuter of heresy, or contributor to doctrines like Original Sin—but the picture of Augustine as preacher, says Sanlon, has been seriously neglected. When academics marginalize the Sermones ad Populum, the real Augustine is not presented accurately. In this study, Sanlon does more, however, than rehabilitate a neglected view of Augustine. How do the theological convictions that Augustine brought to his preaching challenge, sustain, or shape our work today? By presenting Augustine’s thought on preaching to contemporary readers Sanlon contributes a major new piece to the ongoing reconsideration of preaching in the modern day, a consideration that is relevant to all branches of the twenty-first century church.<br>

Although the Holocaust took place in the 1930s and 1940s in Europe, its memory routes remain open and continue to guide passengers to the dark places of compulsive return and witness.

  Abstract: Depending on the speaker (children’s author, literary critic, art historian, advertising designer, painter) and the venue (bookstore, literature conference, gallery, marketing meeting), the term “image” implies an array of connotations, purposes, and audiences (Mitchell 1986). In the hybrid contexts of the twenty-first century—where visual culture, visual studies, and visual literacy are related but contested terms—“image” crosses disciplinary boundaries and characterizes multimodal activities in classrooms and communication. For children’s literature, an interdisciplinary field drawing upon many scholarly discourses, pedagogical approaches, and modes of creative expression, “image” is a complex and provisional term, always at play and in flux.<br>

  39  Postmodernism from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qg46g">Keywords for Childrens Literature</a><br>
  Author(s) Nel Philip<br>
  Abstract: “Postmodernism” denotes an historical period, a style, or a cultural logic. If an historical period, then the word means
                  after modernism—although when, precisely, modernism ended is debatable: 1939, 1945, and 1950 are common dates, but the term “postmodernism” crops up well before then. TheOxford English Dictionary(OED) finds J. M. Thompson in 1914 using “Post-Modernism” to describe a shift in Christian thinking that would “escape from the double-mindedness of Modernism.” A still earlier example eluded theOED: circa 1870, the English painter John Watkins Chapman spoke of “postmodern painting,” which he alleged was more avant-garde than French impressionism<br>

  Chapter 9  Concepts of Scripture in Nahmanides from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qg58w">Jewish Concepts of Scripture</a><br>
  Author(s) Hughes Aaron W.<br>
  Abstract: R. Moses ben Nahman (1194–1270), customarily referred to as Nahmanides or the Ramban, is one of the towering figures of premodern Judaism. Scholar, commentator, halakhist, communal leader, and spokesperson, his career represents the creative intersection of the three primary trends of medieval Judaism: rationalism, traditionalism, and mysticism. Like the great Maimonides, with whom he is frequently compared and often too neatly juxtaposed, he was a product of the rich Iberian-Jewish intellectual tradition.¹ However, whereas Maimonides is often regarded as the last great representative of the rationalist school associated with the so-called Golden Age of Muslim Spain, Nahmanides was born<br>

  Author(s) Zhangozha Rustem<br>
  Abstract: In this interview with one of Kazakhstan’s most renowned poets and public figures, Olzhas Suleimenov, Professor Rustem Zhangozha seeks insight from inside the Central Asian region into its recent social and political history. This conversation paints a dynamic picture of political and cultural contestation under Soviet rule and after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Spanning a wide range of topics, including perestroika, the European Union, antinuclear activism, and the potential for Central Asian unification, this conversation not only provides insight into this dynamic region but provides us with ideas on how lessons learned from its politics might be applied<br>

  Author(s) Sakwa Richard<br>
  Abstract: In a conversation with Richard Sakwa, Ivan Krastev paints a picture of not only a shifting global social and political landscape but of a new iteration of modernity itself. He argues that the modern crisis is unique in that public trust in both the market and political elites has been shaken simultaneously, leaving us to contend with a politics without real alternatives and with weak democracies. He traces five “revolutions” that distinguish the current modernity and suggests that, after the fall of the Soviet Union, we have arrived not at Francis Fukuyama’s “end of history” but rather at the “end<br>

  Abstract: Social workers are charged with entering the lives and moral worlds of families, many of whom have routinely experienced disrespect, and have longstanding histories of material and emotional deprivation. In entering such lives, social workers share with those they encounter universal experiences of loss and disappointment. However, there are additional issues that arise in the course of doing such a job involving the making of decisions that bring pain and hurt as well as joy and support with consequences that can endure for generations. This dual mandate (often known as care and control) is one to be treated with humility<br>

  Abstract: THE NUMBER OF articles, books, films, pictures, paintings, and theatrical productions concerning the women assassinated in Ciudad Juárez grows steadily.¹ This is due not only to the bemusing and menacing nature of this massive event that bewilders scholars but also to the intuition that it constitutes a symptom of overriding importance of events to come and constitutes one of the patterns of governmentality in the postmodern world. Without packing everything into a convenient catchall explanation, it can be said that evidence of this menace can be found in the murders of women in other areas of Mexico, such as Baja<br>

  Author(s) FORCER STEPHEN<br>
  Abstract: Either implicitly or directly, the considerable body of published research that now exists in the area of surrealism and Spain variously problematizes, modifies or embodies two potentially contradictory positions that are particularly relevant to Catalonia. The first position is based on the assumption of an uncommonly favourable national predisposition towards surrealism: blessed with a built-in propensity to produce ‘rebellious individualism’, Spain, in the words of Salvador Dalí, enjoys distinction as ‘the most irrational and the most mystic country in the world’ (Dalí, 1990, p. 127), leaving the Spanish themselves ideally placed to make what Robert Havard calls ‘good – or<br>

First staged in Madrid’s Teatro Abadía in October 2005 and having subsequently had its Catalan premiere during Girona’s Temporada Alta festival, the play had already collected four awards at the 2006 Premios Max ceremony, including for best play of the season.

  Abstract: Àngels Margarit is one of the foremost practitioners of contemporary dance in Barcelona. Her career as a dancer and choreographer dates back to the late 1970s, when there began to be a proliferation of contemporary dance performers and companies in Barcelona (Noguero, 2008; Vendrell, 2008). Although Catalan contemporary dance has not had the same degree of international impact enjoyed by the more hybrid and spectacular performance groups such as La Fura dels Baus and Comediants, largely due to the relative absence of funding and infrastructure for dance in Catalonia and Spain, both she and the members of Mal Pelo (Maria<br>

  Abstract: The inevitable media attention surrounding the fiftieth anniversary of Algerian independence resurrected the ghosts of a conflict that many would have preferred to lay to rest. For a time the carefully managed official commemorations replaced the silence which habitually covers one of the most painful episodes in France’s recent history, highlighting the contradictions which characterise the nation’s attitude towards this period. This chapter seeks to tease out some of these conflicts, arguing that the events of 1962 continue to resonate within France because they function as a nexus of continuity and rupture, one which marked a moment of watershed for<br>

After the first attempt fails, because the animal is too big and they are afraid of it, they discuss the matter and decide that one of them will act as bait while the others spear the animal from behind as it chases the lone hunter.

  Abstract: One of the features most frequently mentioned to highlight the social impact of tuberculosis is that it was the main cause of mortality in every industrialised country in the nineteenth century. In Spain, tuberculosis contributed to around 7 percent of the general mortality rate between 1901 and 1930, which resulted in about thirty thousand deaths each year. Some contemporaries claimed that deficiencies in the data collection and analysis meant the actual figure was as high as seventy thousand; indeed, some estimates multiplied the official number of deaths from tuberculosis by ten.

  Abstract: Gossip is to modern drama what myth was to ancient tragedy. Gossip, like myth, offers playwrights a selection of favourite story types, well stocked with embarrassing details. Gossip, like myth, brings secrets into the public light, charming audiences with the socially cohesive pleasures of other people’s pain. Gossip, like myth, unites communities against deviance in the cause of normality or, with equal efficiency, against normality on behalf of popular subversion. Ancient myth, however, handing down the world-historical heritage of atrocious deeds, concerned itself primarily with relations of kinship; modern gossip, by contrast, retailing damaging new information pertaining to just about<br>

My contention will be that textual analysis is indispensable to research in cultural criticism, where cultural criticism includes English, cultural history and cultural studies, as well as any other discipline that focuses on texts, or seeks to understand the inscription of culture in its artefacts. And since textual analysis is in the end empirical, I shall set out to exemplify my methodological account with a single instance. The project is to imagine that Titian’s painting of

  Abstract: This chapter explores Shakespeare in paintings and prints by looking at pictures of Shakespeare himself and at pictures that illustrate the words he wrote. In essence, both types of image are portraits. They attempt to represent a pre-existing entity, whether a real person like Shakespeare, or the people and places he brought to life in his plays. Portraiture is supposedly about verisimilitude, but a successful portrait is less about replicating someone or something in another medium than about meeting expectations. Portraits depict what we want to see or what we expect to see, otherwise they prove unsatisfying. Shakespeare has meant<br>

It is easy to state that the mind is shaped wholly by a combination of neurophysical parameters and social experience, but the very fact that one feels so resistant to this idea shows the merits of deeper examination. Consciousness rebels against the notion that its limits can be so circumscribed and the artistic, cultural and philosophical labour of our species is a record<br>

  Abstract: This chapter is concerned with Gertrude Stein’s response to two modernist parties, one a dinner-party given by the English painter Harry Phelan Gibb and his wife Bridget in Paris in April 1913 to which Gertrude Stein and her companion Alice Toklas were invited by the host, and one a cocktail-party in Hollywood given by Lillian May Ehrman in Stein’s honour in April 1935. These parties span the period of modernism, taking us from the expatriate, avant-garde fervour of 1910s Paris to the popular American culture of the 1930s and, crucially, they provide a means through which to approach the more<br>

  Abstract: Though the past fifteen years have observed a veritable golden age of performance theory—a lively discourse that draws on anthropology, sociology, linguistics, psychoanalysis, political theory, cultural studies, feminism, and queer theory—performance theorists rarely draw on works emanating from American philosophy departments.¹ Similarly, very few professional philosophers have focused in depth on questions pertaining to the phenomena of theater or performance.² This situation is especially surprising given the attention recent philosophers have lavished on other art forms, such as painting, music, and film.<br>

  Abstract: When techniques are broadly defined—as process-oriented and involving any systematic and goal-directed human action—one finds them in every creative human activity: in sports, painting, dancing, playing musical instruments, and acting; in physics, chemistry, medicine, and astronomy; in education, administration, and sex. Joseph Agassi argues that magic consists of techniques, though unscientific ones.¹ The swing-era ballad “Oh, Look At Me Now” mentions “technique of kisses.” But techniques can also be much more narrowly defined to include only fully articulated and independently recognized practices that are specifically identified and studied as techniques (the “Alexander technique”).<br>

  Book Title: The Real and the Sacred-Picturing Jesus in Nineteenth-Century Fiction<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): GATRALL JEFFERSON J. A.<br>
  Abstract: The figure of Jesus appears as a character in dozens of nineteenth-century novels, including works by Balzac, Flaubert, Dickens, Dostoevsky, and others.
         The Real and the Sacredfocuses in particular on two fiction genres: the Jesus redivivus tale and the Jesus novel. In the former, Christ makes surprise visits to earth, from rural Flanders (Balzac) and Muscovy (Turgenev) to the bustling streets of Paris (Flaubert), Seville (Dostoevsky), Berlin, and Boston. In the latter, the historical Jesus wanders through the picturesque towns and plains of first-century Galilee and Judea, attracting followers and enemies. In short, authors subjected Christ, the second person of the Christian trinity, to the realist norms of secular fiction. Thus the Jesus of nineteenth-century fiction was both situated within a specific time and place, whether ancient or modern, and positioned before the gaze of increasingly daring literary portraitists. The highest artistic challenge for authors was to paint, using mere words, a faithful picture of Jesus in all his humanity. The incongruity of a sacred figure inhabiting secular literary forms nevertheless tested the limits of modern realist style no less than the doctrine of Christ's divinity.<br>

                  Christ in the House of His Parentswas exhibited at the Royal Academy in London, where it provoked a torrent of invective in the press. In Millais’s painting, Christ is depicted as a child apprentice in his father’s carpenter shop. Joseph, Anne, and an assistant laborer hover over a workbench; a young, half-naked John the Baptist walks with a bowl of water amid the wood shavings on the shop floor. The left hand of the boy Jesus, meanwhile, is bleeding from a recent wound, which he holds up for an anxious Mary to see,<br>

  CHAPTER 3  The Sublime Portrait from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3998/mpub.5339783">The Real and the Sacred</a><br>
  Abstract: Mid-nineteenth-century portraits of Jesus were not as controversial in fiction as they were in realist painting. Whereas John Everett Millais, Nikolai Ge, and Édouard Manet broke with long-standing iconographic traditions, portraits of Jesus in fiction from the same time period were innovative, in large part, by the fact of their existence. Extended literary portraits are not a common feature of premodern imaginative retellings of gospel narrative. The life of Jesus, as the canonical gospels suggest, need not accommodate descriptions of the Christ image. In the 1830s and 1840s, authors of fiction began hesitantly to describe the body of Jesus thanks<br>

Along the vertical axis runs a time line connecting the figure of the historical Jesus, at the top, with that of the fully modernized Christ, below. The horizontal axis is divided between fiction, on the left, and painting, on the right. Into each of the four corners are grouped the dozens of works of fiction and scores of paintings throughout the nineteenth century that depict the figure of Jesus in realist style: Jesus novels and historical paintings occupy the top corners; Jesus<br>

  Author(s) KUTCHER NORMAN<br>
  Abstract: It would be impossible to begin a chapter on the history of emotions in China without at least making glancing reference to the stereotype of “the emotion-less Chinese.” This shibboleth is of uncomfortably long lineage. It began, most likely, with the coming of nineteenth-century Protestant missionaries to China, men and women who, shocked at the seeming impassivity of the Chinese they encountered, attributed their lack of affect to a kind of racial impermeability to pain and suffering. For these missionaries, it was not much of a leap to argue that once Chinese embraced Christ, among the most precious gifts they<br>

  Abstract: In

This theory runs through a vast panorama of universal history, which is painted in the book’s central chapter in a quaintly archaic style that could make the anthropological reader wince. Not only does it employ the venerable savagery-barbarism-civilization triad, but the proliferating ethnographic references are treated in a seemingly<br>

  Abstract: The department store, site of middle-class female consumer culture since the nineteenth century, demarks a zone in which women not only shop but, in the process of trying on apparel, communally disrobe, sometimes literally together within a huge open space, occasionally under the supervising eye of the saleswoman who monitors the cut and fit of the garments, more often alone before a full-length three-way mirror, producing a solitary portrait. In another part of the modern cityscape, bohemia, female models shed their clothes and pose nude or draped in fabric for life drawing and painting classes in artists’ studios. Each scene<br>

  Book Title: Commemorating and Forgetting-Challenges for the New South Africa<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): MURRAY MARTIN J.<br>
  Abstract: When the past is painful, as riddled with violence and injustice as it is in postapartheid South Africa, remembrance presents a problem at once practical and ethical: how much of the past to preserve and recollect and how much to erase and forget if the new nation is to ever unify and move forward? The new South Africa's confrontation of this dilemma is Martin J. Murray's subject in
         Commemorating and Forgetting. More broadly, this book explores how collective memory works-how framing events, persons, and places worthy of recognition and honor entails a selective appropriation of the past, not a mastery of history.<br>

With the collapse of white minority rule and the dismantling of apartheid, citizens of the “new South Africa” have been called upon to look two ways in time: back to the racially divided past to confront painful memories born of discrimination and oppression, and forward to the future—with its attendant risks, uncertainties, and contingent possibilities. Looking backward, they hold onto the past by remembering and commemorating. Looking forward, they envision a radiant future unencumbered and unburdened by the sordid apartheid past.

At the end of a long afternoon finger-painting with the kids, it is what is left, sprawling across the page. A color you cannot see through, brown captures a connecting opacity at the heart of ecological thinking. It comes at us from both sides of our world, the living and the dead. Brown marks the fertile soil that plants consume and the fecal waste that animals reject.<br>

  Abstract: The Castilian Muslims who accepted Christian baptism in 1502 in exchange for the right to remain in the Iberian peninsula could not have known that a century later their grandchildren would be expelled from Spain. In Aragon these Christian conversions happened twenty-three years later, though even then there would have been little reason to suspect that a Spanish king would ever order the expulsion of several hundred thousand Christian converts. That Felipe III ordered this expulsion in 1609 stands as one of the larger errors of Spanish domestic policy during the early modern period and, from the perspective of those<br>

  Abstract: This chapter will map out in some detail the activity-centered approach to traditional
                  aljamiado-morisconarratives from Castile and Aragon. This approach, based on the analysis of manuscript texts and what is known about the cultural world of Castilian and Aragonese crypto-Muslims, seeks to address the ways in which members of these communities used handwritten narrative texts in their efforts to make sense of their complex and precarious existence in Spain. In order to present the details of this approach, both from a theoretical and methodological perspective, I will be drawing connections between phenomenological philosophy, ethnographic research on oral narrative, and<br>

The eclectic iconography of the Quays’ cinematic world—its meandering narrative structures and unique cosmogony—hinders an assured or exclusive classification to a genre or a movement. If anything, their works belong to a hybrid category of poetic-experimental film that operates at a liminal threshold between live action and animation.

Agius, a monk-priest of the nearby abbey of Corvey—her confidant and perhaps a blood relative—was with her when she died.¹ Afterward, so he tells us, Agius consoled her bereaved sisters at Gandersheim, speaking movingly of Hathumoda’s long and painful passing and the significance of her life and death. Over the next two years he transformed those conversations into a consolatory dialogue in verse. At the same time, so that they, who could “no longer hold her or gaze at her in the flesh,” might at least “possess<br>

  Abstract: In modern times appreciation of the Taiwanese landscape, or the “construction” of landscape painting, gradually began taking shape after Japan established the colonial government, which then provided subjective and institutional guidance. The leading figure in the early phase of this process, and the person whose perceptions were most important, was Ishikawa Kinichirō 石川欽一郎 (1871–1945), who continuously used his watercolors and essays to report on what he observed in Taiwan, starting from the time of his first arrival in 1907.<br>

With few exceptions, these events marked painful losses: the destruction of the Temple and the ensuing loss of political power within the Roman Empire on the one hand, the Restoration of the English monarchy and the disempowerment of more radical embodiments of Protestantism on the other.

  Abstract: Deeply shaped by the presentiment of an impending catastrophe, the dialogue between Adorno and Benjamin depicts a melancholy constellation. In a previous chapter, we have already observed the ambivalent assessments of Benjamin on melancholy, as they appear in both his book on the German tragic drama and his strongly critical review of Erich Kästner’s novels. Now, it is important to emphasize the melancholic character of Benjamin himself. According to many witnesses, melancholy was his deepest disposition; it also explains his fascination with

In death, this bird from a small island in the western Indian Ocean has taken on a strange celebrity, becoming something of a “poster child” for extinction. And yet, many of the specific images and ideas about the Dodo that circulate in people’s imaginations are highly speculative. Ultimately, a great deal remains unclear about what kind of a bird the Dodo was, how it lived, and when it passed from the world. While reports, sketches, and paintings of the Dodo survive from<br>

The bird in question, now long dead itself, was a member of that rarest of corvid species, the Hawaiian Crow (Corvus hawaiiensis). At the time that biologist Glenn Klinger spoke these words, only three of these birds were left in the wild. A couple of years later, in 2002, the last sighting of a free-living Hawaiian Crow was made. Since then, the only surviving crows have lived in captivity, subjects of a long-running breeding and conservation program (USFWS 2009).<br>

  Abstract: The best way to characterize Confucianism in the Qing dynasty (hereafter Qing Confucianism) is to contrast it with what is called Song-Ming Neo-Confucianism. Song-Ming Neo-Confucians were primarily moral philosophers debating among themselves endlessly on metaphysical questions such as whether “moral princi ples” (
                  li理) are inherent in “human nature” (xing性) or in “human mind” (xin心). By contrast, Qing Confucians were, first and foremost, scholars devoting themselves painstakingly to philological explication of classical and historical texts. As a result, the Song-Ming Period witnessed the emergence and development of the rivalry between two major philosophical systems represented,respectively, by the Cheng-Zhu<br>

  Abstract: After independence in 1821, the Mexican elites’ previous identification with Spain took the form of a general identification with Europe and later with the United States. This resulted in imitation of European and U.S. cultural patterns. Simultaneously, Mexico’s leaders continued to look at the most developed indigenous civilizations, especially the Aztec Empire, as episodes of their own past. This double identification of the Mexican upper classes with indigenous civilizations and also with foreign powers replicated in a postcolonial era the identity dynamics of the colonial period.<br>

  Book Title: Eating Beauty-The Eucharist and the Spiritual Arts of the Middle Ages<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): ASTELL ANN W.<br>
  Abstract: Reading the lives of the saints not primarily as historical documents but as iconic expressions of original artworks fashioned by the eucharistic Christ, Astell puts the "faceless" Host in a dynamic relationship with these icons. With the advent of each new spirituality, the Christian idea of beauty expanded to include, first, the marred beauty of the saint and, finally, that of the church torn by division-an anti-aesthetic beauty embracing process, suffering, deformity, and disappearance, as well as the radiant lightness of the resurrected body. This astonishing work of intellectual and religious history is illustrated with telling artistic examples ranging from medieval manuscript illuminations to sculptures by Michelangelo and paintings by Salvador Dalí. Astell puts the lives of medieval saints in conversation with modern philosophers as disparate as Simone Weil and G. W. F. Hegel.<br>

  Abstract: The Protestant challenges to Catholic eucharistic beliefs during the early modern period were implicitly tied to the covering of Michelangelo’s nudes and explicitly connected to an often violent iconoclasm that resulted in the destruction of works of religious art —paintings, statues, books, buildings.¹ What, if anything, does this historical rift within Christianity have to do with modern, Hegelian reflections on the imminent “end of art”?<br>

  Abstract: The use of anesthesia in surgery spread quickly once it had been discovered.¹ Nineteenth-century doctors who adopted anesthesia selected which patients needed it and which deserved it; they thought some people’s pain more serious than others; some people were thought to be hardy enough to withstand pain. Both the medical literature and actual medical practices during the nineteenth century distinguished people’s need for painkillers on the basis of race, gender, ethnicity, age, temperament, personal habits, and economic class. Women, for example, were thought to need painkillers more than men; the rich and educated more than the poor and uneducated. How<br>

And, after abandoning his plans to publishLanguage as Hermeneutic, Ong in 1994 offered to the journalConnotationshis essay “Time, Digitization, and Dalí’s Memory,” an expanded reflection onThe Persistence of Memory.

  Abstract: Walter Ong was drawn toward Salvador Dalí’s masterpiece,

  IN CONCLUSION from:

  Abstract: Artifice is older than the arts of design, the plastic arts of drawing, painting, and sculpting, but the passage through these arts (their technical problems, especially how to imitate visual cues in different media) was decisive for the reorganization of technics as an economy of knowledge. We learned what design can do for artifice. The artistic accomplishment of Upper Paleolithic cave painting (figure 1.1) is a moment of a wider technical achievement that includes the design of tools, which become at once better engineered and more appealing to vision.

These subliminal associations reflect two very different senses of aesthetic modernism, or rather, contribute to the valorization of a French-oriented as opposed to a German-oriented history of modern art, in which French painting rather than German music plays the leading role.

  Abstract: In common parlance the terms “historical interpretation” and “historical representation” are often used interchangeably. The historical text can alternatively be described as an “interpretation” or as a “representation of the past.” Nevertheless, the two terms do not have quite the same meaning. This is clear from the fact that language, either spoken or written, is the prototypical object of interpretation, whereas the object of representation is reality. Texts are interpreted, and landscapes or still lives are represented in paintings made of them. It makes no sense to speak of the “interpretation” of the landscape we see through the windows of<br>

  Book Title: Studies in Medievalism XXIV-Medievalism on the Margins<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Montoya Alicia C.<br>
  Abstract: This volume not only defines medievalism's margins, as well as its role in marginalizing other fields, ideas, people, places, and events, but also provides tools and models for exploring those issues and indicates new subjects to which they might apply. The eight opening essays address the physical marginalizing of medievalism in annotated texts on medieval studies; the marginalism of oneself via medievalism; medievalism's dearth of ecotheory and religious studies; academia's paucity of pop medievalism; and the marginalization of races, ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, and literary characters in contemporary medievalism. The seven subsequent articles build on this foundation while discussing: the distancing of oneself (and others) during imaginary visits to the Middle Ages; lessons from the margins of Brazilian medievalism; mutual marginalization among factions of Spanish medieval studies; and medievalism in the marginalization of lower socio-economic classes in late-eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Spain, of modern gamers, of contemporary laborers, and of Alfred Austin, a late-nineteenth- and early twentieth-century poet also known as Alfred the Little. In thus investigating the margins of and marginalization via medievalism, the volume affirms their centrality to the field.

  Abstract: When the printer Antón de Centenera published Gómez Manrique’s

  Abstract: Most attempts to place the work of Friedrich in context tend to focus on his Protestantism, his patriotism, his contempt for the French, and the reasons he was confined to his bed after Prussia’s defeat by Napoleon in 1806. Friedrich’s paintings from that period are in turn said to express “a desire for freedom based on a revolutionary return to a better past.¹ While this may indeed be the case, I wish to put the larger European historical context in the background and focus on several formal components of Friedrich’s style.

  Abstract: Philipp Otto Runge saw himself as the apostle of a new Romantic religion. He was undisputedly Christian, but his primary object of veneration was less the martyr’s passion than the interconnectedness of man and nature. He was dissatisfied with the contemporary arts — which, in his view, demurred from presenting the unfolding of the natural world — and considered Weimar Classicism a flight into the past. He saw classicism’s failure primarily in its lack of attention to color. Using Jacob Böhme’s theology of light and dark as a basis, Runge developed his own approach to religious painting.

  Abstract: In the preceding chapters I have studied a range of literary and visual works representing a variety of Romantic encounters with art that shed light on the relationship between the real world and the space of the imagination as it was conceived around 1800. These examples have served to paint a fuller picture, so to speak, of what I consider a major turning point in the construction of the modern subject, particularly in relation to aesthetic experience. The critics and artists associated with this period opened a space we still inhabit; the contradictions they confronted have not yet been resolved.<br>

  Book Title: God and the Gawain-Poet-Theology and Genre in Pearl, Cleanness, Patience and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Hatt Cecilia A.<br>
  Abstract: Pearl, Cleanness, Patience and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight are accomplished examples of four different literary genres and represent some of the finest poetry in Middle English. They are, by turns, fast and funny, powerfully dramatic, gentle and ironic, telling of painful bereavement and the terror of victims of disaster and violence, as well as the comic bewilderment of people entangled in alarmingly mysterious situations. The anonymous poet's evident delight in the pleasures and artistry of courtly life has led some readers to suggest that he was a gifted but complacent frequenter of courts, his attention dedicated to the wealthy and his sympathies to the powerful, and moreover, that his poems pay the merest lipservice to religious observance. God and the Gawain-poet argues that, on the contrary, the poet's wide-ranging engagement with all human life explicitly acknowledges all material creation as God's gift, revelling in its physicality, in bodily senses and movement and the ways a community celebrates itself. Dr Hatt shows how, in exhorting readers to recognize and respond to the narrative of divine gift, he appears as an energetic Christian poet and a humane and compassionate observer.

  Abstract: In the essay “Ruysdael als Dichter” (1816; Ruisdael as Poet), Johann Wolfgang Goethe argues that Jacob van Ruisdael’s images seem to move, and in fact to enact a narrative. Goethe notes that the seventeenth-century painter’s technique is impeccable, but the essay focuses on Ruisdael “as a thinking artist, even as a poet” (als denkenden Künstler, ja als Dichter).¹ “Ruysdael als Dichter” implicitly disputes the conclusions of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing’s
                  Laokoon(1766; Laocoon), which states that painting and sculpture can only imitate plots or narratives, not convey them.² Ruisdael, counters Goethe, indeed can portray movement through time in his painting: his<br>

  Author(s) King Nicole<br>
  Abstract: In newspapers and on television, and in museums and at heritage sites, the story of de-industrialisation in the USA is often represented through a simplistic historical lens: broad brushstrokes are used to paint the patterns of boom and bust with little interrogation of local-level, personal and shared experiences of it. This broad historical lens is rarely grounded in specific places, while simultaneously being connected to others with similar patterns of development and decline. Respecting and attempting to understand the people, places and intangible cultural heritage of industry’s rise and fall from the perspectives of those living these experiences is central.<br>

  Book Title: Writing and Heritage in Contemporary Spain-The Imaginary Museum of Literature<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): DAVIS STUART<br>
  Abstract: This is an innovative exploration of cultural heritage and the literary traditions that shape the contemporary literary scene in Spain. Through a coalescence of museum studies, metacriticism and traditional literary criticism the study interweaves discussion of museum spaces with literary analysis, exploring them as agents of memorialisation and a means for preserving and conveying heritage. Following introductory explorations of the development of museums and the literary canon, each chapter begins with a "visit" to a Spanish museum, establishing the framework for the subsequent discussion of critical practices and texts. Case studies include examination of the palimpsest and unconscious influence of canonical cores; the response to masculine traditions of poetry and art; counter-culture of the 1990s; and the ethical concerns of postmemory writing. STUART DAVIS is a Lecturer in Spanish, Girton College, and Newton Trust Lecturer in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese, University of Cambridge.<br>

  Book Title: The Novels of Josefina Aldecoa-Women, Society and Cultural Memory in Contemporary Spain<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): KENNY NUALA<br>
  Abstract: Josefina Aldecoa, in her treatment of themes such as a woman's place in society under and after dictatorship, mother-daughter relationships, war, and memory, confirmed her unique role as a contemporary novelist concerned with women's identity in Spain and as a writer of the mid-century generation ('los niños de la guerra'). The first volume of her trilogy, Historia de una maestra, was one of the earliest narratives of historical memory to be produced in Spain. In this sense, Aldecoa's work anticipated new developments in gender studies, such as the intersection of feminist concerns and cultural memory. This book offers a comprehensive examination of Aldecoa's trajectory as a novelist, from La enredadera to Hermanas, centring on her primary preoccupations of gender and memory, arguing that Aldecoa's fiction offers a new, more complex understanding of women's identity than previously understood. The work combines the two dominating theoretical components of feminism and cultural memory with close textual analysis of Aldecoa's narratives. Her novels highlight the importance of the details of women's daily experiences and struggles throughout the twentieth century, a period of significant socio-political upheaval and change in Spain's history. NUALA KENNY teaches Spanish at the National University of Maynooth, Ireland.<br>

  Abstract: The aim of this study is to present a comprehensive analysis of the novels of Josefina Aldecoa, which span the last three decades. In doing so, it employs a thematic approach, which is combined with a dual theoretical perspective centred on feminism and cultural memory in contemporary Spain. Such a structure accommodates an in-depth investigation of Aldecoa’s body of work and seeks to highlight the interconnection between women’s experiences and Spain’s current preoccupation with cultural memory. Moreover, a key objective of this book is to draw attention to the link between Aldecoa’s narrative and the historical and socio-cultural conditions in<br>

  Abstract: In the following chapter, a brief critical history of the main tenets of feminist theory relevant to this book will be outlined. This will include an analysis of Anglo-American, French, and Spanish feminism. Each movement will be examined with reference to the political and social climate in which they emerged, the basic tenets shaping each movement and the strengths and weaknesses they possess. An understanding of the development of feminist criticism is essential if one is to appreciate the growth of literature by women in Spain, and thus, the work of Josefina Aldecoa, whose writing captures the reality of womanhood<br>

                  Porque éramos jóvenes(1986),El vergel(1988), andEl enigma(2002), Aldecoa charts the evolution of love and relationships in mid- to late twentieth-century Spain. Each of the protagonists in the novels is engaged in an on-going quest for love and self-fulfilment. They experience at first hand the euphoric highs and soul-destroying lows of forbidden romance, unrequited love, and marriages of convenience. Moreover, these middle-aged characters are<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt1x72wv">The Novels of Josefina Aldecoa</a><br>
  Abstract: This study has demonstrated how Aldecoa’s narrative reconfigures women’s identity in contemporary Spain and confronts the memory of the Spanish Civil War and the years of the Francoist dictatorship, exploring its deep psychological impact on current and future generations. In examining the cultural and social myths surrounding women’s role in Spanish society, Aldecoa deconstructs traditional patriarchal paradigms and offers a new, more complex understanding of women’s identity, free from existing hierarchical and binary structures. This rejection of the patriarchal system that pervades the fabric of Western culture is further extended by Aldecoa in her depiction of the Civil War and<br>

  Book Title: Cultural Capital, Language and National Identity in Imperial Spain-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): BINOTTI LUCIA<br>
  Abstract: This innovative study examines the cultural mechanisms in early modern Spain that led to the translation, imitation and selective adoption of the values embodied by the Italian Renaissance. These mechanisms served to delineate a national tradition that addressed the needs of a changing society and gave a "Spanish" physiognomy to the Italian experience, which ultimately led to the Golden Age. By examining such important texts as the sentimental fictions of Diego de San Pedro and Juan de Flores, the Spanish translation of Orlando Furioso, Don Quixote, and the Polifemo, Binotti first describes the conditions imposed on book production by both the expectations of an elite audience and the limitations of the printing market while outlining the process of the creation of an expressive poetic language and the quest for literary models. She then looks at Ambrosio de Morales' chronicles and Bernardo de Aldrete's Del Origen, showing how a cultural discourse founded on foreign scholarship paved the way for the establishment of innovative-and autochtonous-methods of historical and scientific analysis in the early seventeenth-century. LUCIA BINOTTI is an associate professor in the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.<br>

  8  The Misa de amor in the Spanish Cancioneros and the Sentimental Romance from:

  Author(s) SEVERIN DOROTHY SHERMAN<br>
  Abstract: Alan Deyermond’s contribution to the study of the sentimental romance is so essential that, before he wrote his seminal essay on the genre in the medieval volume of his
                  Literary History of Spain(1971), we used to call it the sentimental novel. To him I owe the inspiration for my book on the genre (2005), and this additional footnote to that book. When I categorized religious parody in the sentimental romance in that book, I did not include the category of theMisa de amor, although I made a passing reference to it.

  Author(s) DOVAL ROSA VIDAL<br>
  Abstract: Late medieval Spain witnessed a series of religious, social, and political controversies following the mass conversion of Jews in the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries. While at first these conversions had been regarded as eminently desirable, even miraculous, by the 1450s there was a growing sense in some Christian circles that their effects had been deleterious, and they were the source of many grave problems (Nirenberg 2003: 137). The attempts to eradicate these perceived difficulties led to the establishment of the Inquisition, the expulsion of the Jews, and a division of the Christian community on the basis of blood,<br>

  Book Title: El documental cinematográfico y televisivo contemporáneo-Memoria, sujeto y formación de la identidad democrática española<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): ESTRADA ISABEL M.<br>
  Abstract: Este libro evalúa la aportación del documental cinematográfico y televisivo producido en España a partir de los años 90 al debate en torno a la memoria de la represión franquista, por un lado, así como a la construcción de la identidad democrática, en términos más generales. Propongo que tanto los documentales con un enfoque histórico explícito como aquellos cuya mirada retrospectiva se realiza sin referentes tan concretos cuestionan el proyecto político teleológico concebido durante la Transición. La primera parte de mi estudio trata de la memoria histórica de la guerra civil específicamente y, la segunda, de la memoria en un sentido socioeconómico para apuntar el déficit de agencia del sujeto en la democracia neoliberal. En última instancia se reivindica la marginalidad social de la víctima a la vez que se deja al descubierto su obliteración de los procesos democráticos. Isabel M. Estrada is Visiting Assistant Professor, Franklin & Marshall College. ENGLISH VERSION This book examines how a selected group of documentaries made since 1995 for both film and television inform the debate centered on the so-called "recuperation of memory" of the Spanish Civil War and dictatorship. Estrada contends that these documentaries modify Spanish identity as it was conceived by the teleological historical project of the transition. The narrative of mass media should be examined in order to comprehend the process of the "recovery of memory" that culminated in the Law of Historical Memory (2007). She carries out a comparative analysis of the visual discourse of the documentary and the narrative discourses of history and testimony, paying special attention to the relations of power among them. Using theoretical frameworks provided by Badiou, Adorno, Renov, and Ricoeur, this study ultimately sheds light on the status of the victim in the context of Spain's neoliberal democracy. Isabel M.

  Abstract: Emerging from a period of civil violence and political upheaval, the English in 1660 faced a critical question: what from the troubled past should be retained in memory and what ought to be consigned to oblivion? It is a question that many nations today with painful and tragic histories still struggle to answer.¹ At the turn of the millennium, Canadian journalist Erna Paris travelled to seven of them – Germany, France, Japan, the USA, Chile, Argentina and South Africa – determined to understand how their citizens remembered or did not remember past conflicts, and the impact that remembering and forgetting had on<br>

  Author(s) WRIGHT TOM F.<br>
  Abstract: How does the role of public speech evolve in an age of technological transformation? Two literary and visual artefacts from the wars of nineteenth-century America pose this question, and offer insights into a chapter of media history that is still poorly understood. In the first, Richard Caton Woodville’s
                  War News From Mexico(1848), the ambivalent place of wartime voice takes centre stage. This most iconic of genre paintings records a foundational scene of US imperialism, and captures the public drama of national expansion. Its broader subject, however, is the social life of information. Woodville’s image depicts news of Mexican surrender<br>

  Abstract: Ludwig Feuerbach was born in Landshut, Bavaria, in 1804. His father was a politically liberal jurist of international renown; one of Ludwig’s brothers, Karl Wilhelm, would make a name for himself in mathematics; and one of his nephews, Anselm, was to become a famous painter. In 1823, Feuerbach started studying theology in Heidelberg, where, through the teaching of Karl Daub, he became an enthusiastic adherent of Hegelianism. After two semesters, he moved to Berlin to study with Hegel himself, switching from theology to philosophy in the process. He completed his studies at the University of Erlangen in 1828 with a<br>

  Abstract: Willy Colberg’s painting

In the following discussion, I will examine how the persistence of a naturalistic style, communicated in part by West German artworks like Colberg’s, helped to shape East Germans’ perceptions of their own progress towards socialist realism. As the case of theDritte deutsche Kunstausstellungdemonstrates, exhibitions are active, public narratives through which organizers are able to<br>

  Book Title: Tragedy and the Tragic in German Literature, Art, and Thought-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Quinn Thomas P.<br>
  Abstract: The many catastrophes of German history have often been described as tragic. Consequently, German literature, music, philosophy, painting, and even architecture are rich in tragic connotations. Yet exactly what "tragedy" and "the tragic" may mean requires clarification. The poet creates a certain artful shape and trajectory for raw experience by "putting it into words"; but does putting such experience into words (or paintings or music or any other form) betray suffering by turning it into mere art? Or is it art that first turns mere suffering into tragic experience by revealing and clarifying its deepest dimension? What are we talking about, exactly, when we talk about tragic experience and tragic art, especially in an age in which, according to Hannah Arendt, evil has become banal? Does banality muffle or even annul the tragic? Does tragedy take suffering and transform it into beauty, as Schiller thought? Is it in the interest of truth for suffering to be "beautiful"? Is it possible that poetry, music, and art are important because they in fact create the meaning of suffering? Or is suffering only suffering and not accessible to meaning, tragic or otherwise? This book comprises essays that seek to clarify the meaning of tragedy and the tragic in its many German contexts, art forms, and disciplines, from literature and philosophy to music, painting, and history.

  11:  The Tragic Dimension in Postwar German Painting from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt7zstkf">Tragedy and the Tragic in German Literature, Art, and Thought</a><br>
  Author(s) Gosetti-Ferencei Jennifer Anna<br>
  Abstract: There is an undeniably tragic dimension to central motives of postwar German painting, particularly in the works of Anselm Kiefer. The imagery of devastated landscapes, charred fields and forests, empty attics and bunkers, flames, and ashen skies in Kiefer’s paintings evoke the devastation wreaked by Germany during the Second World War and by National Socialism. References to the poetry of Paul Celan and a lost Judaic heritage render such scenes extraordinarily haunting. The use of such materials as ash, lead, burnt canvas, human hair, and straw contribute to both the material innovation and the provocative nature of these works. Invoking<br>

  Book Title: Arturo Pérez-Reverte: Narrative Tricks and Narrative Strategies-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): WALSH ANNE L.<br>
  Abstract: The writings of Arturo Pérez-Reverte, one of Spain's most renowned contemporary authors, have been described as a minefield. This monograph examines the complexities behind the narrative technique employed in creating such a minefield, including an analysis of the role played by both male and female characters, the relevance of the past as a motif, and aspects of the role of storytelling in creating mystery where none should exist. Both Revertian novels and journalistic writing are seen to be part of an over-all game which is played between their author and his readers. Film, too, forms part of the material reviewed as, though Pérez-Reverte is not a script writer, many films have been based on his novels. The text-centred analysis concludes that the themes of interest in all Revertian output revolve around two main areas: the significance of the past, whether historical, cultural, or literary, and the role of the written word in communicating, in rescuing and in challenging versions of that past in order to combat what Pérez-Reverte terms 'dismemory'.

  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Kennedy Angus J.<br>
  Abstract: Martin Le Franc's prediction in Le Champion des dames (c. 1440) that Christine de Pizan's name would endure for ever is borne out in the current extraordinary vogue of interest in Christine as France's first professional female writer (c. 1364-c. 1431). Supplement II, building on the volumes published by Kennedy in 1984 (502 items) and 1994 (391 items), covers the most productive period to date of scholarship on her work: 1991-2002 (1255 items). The present work is made up of six chapters: Bibliographies and Manuscript Catalogues; General Surveys of Christine de Pizan's Life and Works; Studies of Specific Topics (Manuscripts, Miniatures and Manuscript Illumination; Christine de Pizan, England, Spain, and Portugal; Christine de Pizan and Italy; Feminism and Related Topics; Humanism; Political, Social, and Educational Themes; The Court of Love 1400/01; Poetic Themes and Form; Language; Musical Settings; Miscelleaneous); Anthologies, Selections, and Collected Critical Studies; Individual Works: Manuscripts, Editions, Translations, and Critical Studies; Reviews of Items Listed in the 1994 volume. The Indexes are now cumulative, covering all three volumes published to date. This analytical bibliography will provide a unique interdisciplinary resource to all scholars working in the field of late-mediaeval studies.ANGUS J.

  Book Title: Juan Goytisolo: The Author as Dissident-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): de Menezes Alison Ribeiro<br>
  Abstract: This monograph offers two new perspectives on Spanish writer, Juan Goytisolo. First, under the themes of authorship and dissidence, it integrates his writing across several genres, providing a rounded assessment of his contribution to cultural debates in Spain since the sixties and arguing that resistance to repressive discourses characterizes his essays and autobiographies as much as his fiction. Second, it revises the prevailing critical interpretation of Goytisolo's fiction by building on four premises: that his novels are less clearly oppositional than prevailing interpretations imply; that, in order to engage with discourses of identity, he employs an idiom which, contrary to his own statements, is not a poststructuralist autonomous world of words; that a textual practice grounded in the recognizable experience of post-Civil War Spain, rather than one which seeks out the realm of pure textuality, is essential to Goytisolo's subversive political intentions; and that the autobiographical element of much of his work constitutes a more complex narrative aesthetic than has been appreciated. The book argues that if Goytisolo's work is interpreted as an ethical engagement with postmodernist theory, rather than as an illustration of it, then certain contradictions for which he has been criticized are seen in a new and valuable light.

  Book Title: Juan Goytisolo: The Author as Dissident-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): de Menezes Alison Ribeiro<br>
  Abstract: This monograph offers two new perspectives on Spanish writer, Juan Goytisolo. First, under the themes of authorship and dissidence, it integrates his writing across several genres, providing a rounded assessment of his contribution to cultural debates in Spain since the sixties and arguing that resistance to repressive discourses characterizes his essays and autobiographies as much as his fiction. Second, it revises the prevailing critical interpretation of Goytisolo's fiction by building on four premises: that his novels are less clearly oppositional than prevailing interpretations imply; that, in order to engage with discourses of identity, he employs an idiom which, contrary to his own statements, is not a poststructuralist autonomous world of words; that a textual practice grounded in the recognizable experience of post-Civil War Spain, rather than one which seeks out the realm of pure textuality, is essential to Goytisolo's subversive political intentions; and that the autobiographical element of much of his work constitutes a more complex narrative aesthetic than has been appreciated. The book argues that if Goytisolo's work is interpreted as an ethical engagement with postmodernist theory, rather than as an illustration of it, then certain contradictions for which he has been criticized are seen in a new and valuable light.

  Abstract: In the summer of 1998, I visited the artist Todor Tsonev, who had become famous after 1989 with his exhibition of cartoons of Todor Zhivkov that he had painted during communism, one of the very few cases where the expectation of a “closet full of masterpieces” that were cached away from the forbidding eyes of censorship actually was vindicated. Maria Ovcharova, his close friend and collaborator and a scholar in her own right, had organized this exhibit after 1989, and it triggered enormous interest.

  Book Title: Remembrance, History, and Justice-Coming to terms with traumatic pasts in democratic societies<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Iacob Bogdan C.<br>
  Abstract: The twentieth century has left behind a painful and complicated legacy of massive trauma, monstrous crimes, radical social engineering, or collective/individual guilt syndromes that were often the premises for and the specters haunting the process of democratization in the various societies that emerged out of these profoundly de-structuring contexts. The present manuscript is a state of the art reassessment and analysis of how the interplay between memory, history, and justice generates insight that is multifariously relevant for comprehending the present and future of democracy without becoming limited to a Europe-centric framework of understanding. The manuscript is structured on three complementary and interconnected trajectories: the public use of history, politics of memory, and transitional justice. Key words 1. Europe, Eastern—Politics and government—1989– 2. Collective memory—Europe, Eastern. 3. Memory—Political aspects—Europe, Eastern. 4. Democratization— Social aspects—Europe, Eastern. 5.

  Book Title: Hybrid Renaissance-Culture, Language, Architecture<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burke Peter<br>
  Abstract: Hybrid Renaissance presents the Renaissance in Italy, elsewhere in Europe and in the world beyond Europe as an example of cultural hybridization. It is impossible to give a clear definition of either of the two key concepts used in this book, “hybridization" and “Renaissance". Roughly speaking, hybridity refers to something new that emerges from the combination of diverse older elements. The term “hybridization" is preferable to “hybridity" because it refers to a process rather than to a state, and also because it encourages the writer and the readers alike to think in terms of more or less rather than of presence versus absence. The book begins with a discussion of the concept of cultural hybridity and a cluster of other concepts related to it. Then comes a geography of hybridity, focusing on three locales: courts, major cities (whether ports or capitals) and frontiers. There follow six chapters about the hybrid Renaissance in different fields: architecture, painting and sculpture, languages, literatures, music, philosophy and law and finally religion. The essay concludes with a brief account of attempts to resist hybridization or to purify cultures or domains from what was already hybridized<br>

  Author(s) WOLF-KNUTS ULRIKA<br>
  Abstract: In Swedish folklore in Finland the devil was regarded as a helper when a woman was in pain giving birth to her child. Alternatively, he helped a mother to make her unwanted baby disappear. In this paper I shall consider the folklore texts as complements to the creation myth in Genesis. My inspiration comes from theories on intertextuality. I combine these thoughts with studies of tricksters and culture heroes. Although the Finland-Swedish folklore records do not refer to the Bible 
                     expressis verbis, I find it possible to understand them as inverted extensions of the Judeo-Christian creation myth.<br>

Journal Title: Ethics<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: et.2001.112.issue-1<br>
Date: 10 2001<br>
Author(s): Young, Jeffrey T.<br>
Abstract: Young’s new book on Adam Smith provides a careful textual analysis of Smith’s two major works:
      The Theory of Moral SentimentsandThe Wealth of Nations. Young argues, with good textual evidence, that Smith did not divide economics from moral theory and that, indeed, Smith thought of economics as a moral science. Young traces Smith’s economic and moral philosophy to Aristotle and Hume, and he points out, correctly, that “self‐interest itself had a significant moral dimension in Smith” (p. 173). Thus Smith’s alleged focus on self‐interest inThe Wealth of Nationshas normative dimensions not always recognized by all Smith scholars. Young uses Smith’s notions of the impartial spectator and benevolence as well as his theory of justice to link the two texts. This is a controversial conclusion since neither the impartial spectator nor benevolence is evident as an important concept inThe Wealth of Nations. Young also argues that Smith divides the economic sphere from the political sphere (see his matrix on p. 158), a questionable conclusion in light of Smith’s focus on political economy inThe Wealth of Nations. Young’s book also suffers from his apparently not having read Amartya Sen’s or my works on Smith, both of which make many of the same arguments Young develops. Still, Young has added further to the growing literature that reads Smith as a serious moral philosopher whose theory of self‐interest is far from libertarian and who neither divided economics from ethics nor politics from either.<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur gets the relation of critique and reason right, in Bourgeois’s eyes, as a philosopher who sees imagination tied to thinking at the boundary (not limit) of reason. In a chapter examining Derrida’s views on “sign, time, and trace” (chap. 7), Bourgeois elaborates Derrida’s view that Edmund Husserl’s distinction between meaningful expression and sign depends on a stable borderline between primary and secondary memory (or retention and recollection) in his theory of “the living present” (or duration), which, Derrida asserts, is phenomenologically unavailable. In light of this analysis, Bourgeois draws an interesting contrast between Derrida’s insistence on a discrete closure of meaning and Ricoeur’s theory of language and imagination based in a view of the living present of meaning and experience that refuses such discrete closure. Once more, however, Bourgeois overreaches when he attempts to identify these accurately drawn contrasts with the limit/boundary distinction. In Bourgeois’s reading of Ricoeur, imagination does not produce reason from below (as in Heidegger); rather, “reason itself limits knowledge to experience from above, putting the imagination in a central position both in knowledge and thinking” (p. 131). A productive imagination of living metaphor takes place at the boundary of reason, allowing the living present in meaning and action to escape deconstruction’s critique while still incorporating a positive relation to alterity. Nevertheless, Bourgeois may be drawing the wrong conclusion about these contrasts, for it seems possible to read both Ricoeur and Derrida as seeking to work at the boundary (not limit) of reason and to think somehow the presentation of the Idea in the Kantian sense. Whereas Ricoeur’s theory of metaphor and narrative allows him to present the semantic content of the Ideas of Reason positively, these remain for Derrida (as for Kant) unrepresentable, or “the impossible.” This problem has been Derrida’s enduring concern since his 1962
   Introduction to Husserl’s “The Origin of Geometry.”The real difference between the thought of Ricoeur and Derrida is the distinctive way each thinker supplements phenomenology to take into account the creativity of meaning at the boundary of reason. For Derrida, it is thedifféranceof deconstruction; for Ricoeur, the graft of hermeneutics.<br>

Abstract: For the notion of strategic essentialism, see Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, “Subaltern Studies: Deconstructing Historiography,” in her
            The Spivak Reader, 214–21. Serene Jones has drawn attention to the fact that the poststructuralist theoretical assumptions about the always oppressive nature of binarisms do not necessarily hold up under the pressures of concrete political struggles and that, in order to strengthen the bond of solidarity for a coalition of diverse social and cultural identities, what is called for is some kind of grand narrative that clearly defines the powers to be resisted and dismantled. I think this applies to a coalition of different religious identities as well.

Abstract: My encounter with this student suggests another way of thinking about the political value of rewriting. Countering all the more blasé signals my students were giving me that it was most naive to think the retelling of stories from another point of view could have any political impact, it is evidence that women’s rewritings of classic texts can still affect young women, still make them think and make them want to contribute to the discussions, the debates that shape the public sphere. Although we need, of course, to factor in serendipity—the student was on holiday and thought she had discovered a little‐known book when in fact it was a
      New York Timesbest seller—there is definitely a sense in which her discovery marked a moment in her life and signals the development of a feminist consciousness (broadly defined as a certain awareness of gender identity combined with a critical position in respect to misogyny and patriarchy and a conviction that things can be changed). There is no denying that increasing individualization at all levels of society has caused the loss of a sense of collective action and political projects. This is equally true for ideas of improvement, emancipation, and modernization, the responsibility of which has largely been shifted to the individual, whose “human rights,” as Bauman argues, are redefined as “the right of individuals to stay different and to pick and choose at will their own models of happiness and fitting life‐style” (2000;2005, 29). In this deregulated and privatized sociopolitical context that knows no common cause, re‐vision can only fail to formulate enabling fictions for a better future for all. Yet in its capacity to speak to individuals, it can still draw them into visions of community and collectivity. Re‐vision may thus not be the lifeline that is to haul us out of patriarchy any more, but as a structure of address that engages readers into contemplating differences, it remains one of the ways in which we keep sane and critical and thinking, moved by the stories of long‐forgotten lives into participating in an open public sphere.<br>

ROSEMARY MITCHELL University of Leeds J. G. A. POCocK. [[END 06A00070]] [[START 06A00080]] Barbarism and Religion: Volume Three, The First Decline and Fall. New York: Cam- bridge University Press. 2003. Pp. xiii, 527. $60.00. In reviewing for this journal the first two volumes of J. G. A. Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters. Gibbon's readers had to wait until 1781 for the story to pick up again. Exposition of this "first decline and fall" in fact occupies only the last hundred pages of Pocock's volume and therefore serves as both a climax to the Pocockian story so far, and a bridge to the next volume. Volume one of Barbarism and Religion situated Gibbon intellectually within a number of different European "Enlightenments"; volume two located him on a different axis, among the various writers of "narratives of civil government" in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. (We are still missing the parallel vector running through ecclesiastical histori- ography, although Eusebius, Augustine, Orosius, and Otto of Freising figure prominently here. Christianity only begins to signal its importance with chapter fifteen of Gibbon; where he used ecclesiastical author- ities, up to that point, it was to document civil rather than sacred history.) Volume three moves in a third, diachronic dimension, tracing the transformations of key themes, in particular the idea of "decline and fall" itself, from very ancient origins up to the Scot Adam Ferguson's Progress and Termination of the Roman Republic (which appeared seven years after Gibbon's first volume and is thus offered for comparison rather than direct influence). The flight of concepts and motifs is dizzying, the lengthy quotations apposite, and as with the previous volumes, one can scarcely miss a sentence without losing a nuance or a parenthetical qualification. The theme of decline and fall, which informs the conception and beginning of Gibbon's book, would eventually yield to "barbarism and reli- gion" as its principal causes in later volumes (along with over-taxation, which Gibbon mentions at the close of chapter fourteen). But behind that idea, which only gradually emerged from Polybian political cycles via medieval notions of the translatio imperii, lay much else, including sequential recognitions of crucial turn- ing points in Roman history going back to Gracchan land reforms in the late second century B.C.E. The core problem, historiographically, remains how to explain why Gibbon, committed from an early stage to a Tacitean narrative, chose to begin his account not with the Julio-Claudians but instead at the "Antonine moment" of imperial zenith achieved by Trajan. (As he once did with cinquecento Florence, Pocock inclines to define major turning points or episodes, both historical and intellectual, in terms of "moments"-a historical Constantinean and historiographical Zosiman moment lie ahead, and the Machiavellian version even puts in a cameo appearance when this volume reaches the early eighteenth century.) Gibbon knew intimately the char- acter of Augustan rule and the flaws of the late republic; he had read his Sallust as well as Tacitus. The later imperial historians, especially Appian of Alexan- dria and Ammianus Marcellinus, also figure in this account as historians of decline, but of a decline that takes a great deal of time-all the way to the "Illyrian" recovery of the late third century-really to become unmistakeable. The subjects confronted by Gibbon's nearly two millennia of predecessors include the military problem of restless troops settling in an empire that has con- quered all its rivals and closed itself off from further expansion; the civic conflict between virtue and cor- ruption (or rather, the way in which virtue leads to military conquest and empire, which in turn produce an oriental softness); the role of the soldiers in making emperors and especially the legions' realization, in the Year of Four Emperors (68/69 C.E.), that emperors could be made "elsewhere than Rome"; the place of the Augustinian-Orosian "two cities" view of history; the vicissitudes in republicanism (an issue revived in the fifteenth century by Leonardi Bruni, who as a non-Roman concerned mainly with Florence was able to see the empire's longue duree for the first time as declinatio rather than translatio and to initiate, though not complete, a gradual transition in historiography from the latter to the former); and the extension of citizenship to the provinces, along, soon, with the capacity of provincials to be proclaimed emperor. All of these streams converge, not entirely satisfactorily AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 470 APRIL 2004 [[END 06A00080]] [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility. This volume is every bit as persuasive as its prede- cessors and, perhaps because it is as much recit as the others were peintures, it is also rather more compelling a read. More than the first two volumes of his work, volume three of Barbarism and Religion leaves one hanging; like Gibbon and his first readers, we are only at the Milvian Bridge, pondering what will follow with Constantine. One hopes that, unlike those readers, we will not have to wait five years for the next episode. DANIEL WOOLF University of Alberta [[END 06A00080]] [[START 06A00090]] LAWRENCE W. MCBRIDE, editor.

The academic career of one Galway student, H. Fitzwalter Kirker, is traced in its entirety, but only in a footnote. The reader gets at least something approximating a lifeline in the piece by McBride on the young reader and the teaching and learning of Irish history. That "young people are by nature curious" (p. 114), however, seems an inade- quate point on which to hang a conclusion. The book is at its strongest in the essays by Jose Lanters and Gregory Castle, which focus on the work of T. W. Rolleston and Standish O'Grady, respectively. Both historians are examined in the context of their contemporaries; both essays actually attempt to fulfill the claims they make for themselves in their opening pages. The same cannot be said, however, for Eileen Reilly's piece on J. A. Froude. Its bland rehearsal of his life is punctuated with references to his visits to Ireland and quotations from some of his more offen- sive diatribes on the Irish people. She offers little or no comment on the bigotry that billowed forth from his pen. For example, one is told of Froude's dislike for Daniel O'Connell but not the reason why. Novick's piece on the military education of the Irish Volunteers begins with an interesting description, but it is rather disappointing thereafter. Although the material is fascinating, the author's conclusions are not. At one point, he deduces that "The pattern of military education seen in the Irish Volunteer and the Workers' Republic lends weight to the idea of the Rising as blood sacrifice, since the key strategist, Joseph Plunkett, never wrote military columns for the Irish Volunteer" (p. 198). At no point does it occur to Novick that the rebels might not have printed their plans in the paper because letting the authorities in Dublin Castle know in advance was not really part of the plan. How useful, indeed, is an examination of the Irish Volunteer's role in the training of the rebels when even the author concedes that details of training on urban insurrection were "left to the writers of the Workers' Republic" (p. 210); when the author gives approximately nine lines of consideration to what he adjudges to be the more important source? Through- out there is little sense of the eye of Dublin Castle watching over what was published and curtailing what could be written. This is a worthy but a frustrating book. There is a lot of value in each essay in terms of the material that is brought to light, but there is also the crushing weight of the artificial framework under which the essays are forced to labor. Like Froude, it is perhaps this book's "portion in life to please no one faction" (p. 140). ANNE DOLAN Trinity College Dublin [[END 06A00090]] [[START 06A00100]] COLIN NEWBURY. Patrons, Clients, and Empire: Chief- taincy and Over-Rule in Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. New York: Oxford University Press. 2003. Pp. xii, 328. $72.00. It is a brave historian nowadays who admits that his or her current academic preoccupations began in the 1950s, but an unrepentant Colin Newbury tells us that imperial history at Oxford University is peculiarly marked by continuity. He says that literary theory has dominated the study of discourse for too long (al- though presumably not at Oxford), and it is time to get back to the study of political discourse using the time-honored model of patron-client relations. Drawing on his extensive knowledge of African and Pacific imperial history, with the addition of material on South and Southeast Asia, Newbury presents a well researched and cogently argued case for the persis- tence of precolonial clientage networks in certain British and French colonies. Patron-client modeling was refined by social scientists in the 1960s and 1970s, when it became a useful way of explaining why inde- pendence had brought relatively little change to the administrative systems of former colonies. That polit- ical and economic relations in some colonies can be analyzed effectively using this theory is clear; whether the exercise speaks to wider debates about empire is another question. The omission of colonies of settle- ment, along with almost all of the Portuguese, Dutch, and German empires, weakens the case considerably. Newbury draws on a wide, although extremely selec- tive, range of secondary literature to supplement his own research, wisely conceding that authors may not like the use he makes of their material. He feels no need to address the epistemological and methodolog- ical concerns raised by authors whose work he mines for empirical detail. He excludes pioneering cross- disciplinary studies, such as Jean and John Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution (1991) and Nicholas Thomas, Colonialism's Culture: Anthropology, Travel and Government (1994), which have done so much to shape current debates in postcolonial anthropology. Newbury calls for more interaction between social scientists and historians, but he does surprisingly little to encourage it. If patron-client brokerage really is the best model, Newbury should be able to tackle other theories with confidence, demonstrating their inade- quacies through constructive engagement. Instead he revives battles won long ago, such as the critique of "collaboration" and "indirect rule" analysis. There are still some historians who work with these terms, but far more interesting is the much larger number of scholars tackling more recent debates. This book's contribution to imperial historiography is therefore difficult to assess. Newbury hopes that it will help to determine whether imperial rule suc- ceeded or failed "in 'preparing' [its colonies] for the exigencies and responsibilities of devolved govern- ment" (p. viii). One wonders whether this is still a pressing question, however. It has been a long time since independence for many of the countries Newbury discusses. Scholars posing broader questions about colonialism's legacy will wonder about the cost of Newbury's ruthlessly exclusive approach.

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important proponents, is thus linked by the Comaroffs forward to colonialism and to contemporary globalization, and backward in time to Part of this article was presented in a much earlier version at the Twentieth Anniversary Conference of the Journal of Southern African Studies, York, 1994; I would like to thank the participants as well as those who subsequently commented helpfully, including David Maxwell, Norman Etherington, Ed Wilmsen, and Paul Landau.

Missionaries were, in effect, agents of a first wave of globalization. The missionary movement was an early exemplar of a transnational global movement, while the intellectual claims of missionaries to universality paralleled the modernist claims of a globalizing colonialism. The struggles over the texture and composition of everyday life that took place on the frontiers of colonial society in nineteenth-century southern Africa therefore tell us something not only about the nature of colonialism but also about modernity and its considerable discontents, as well as about the resistance of the colonized to the European colonial project. In this sense, a quest for origins informs the narrative structure of both books.2 Indeed, one of the reasons that this seminal text engages us so closely is its concern with the narrative of dispossession and resistance, with a beginning and therefore, implicitly, some hope for an end-an only ambivalently postmodern narrative, in fact, despite some alarm in southern Africanist circles over Of Revelation and Revolution as a postmodern nail in the coffin of materialist history.3 This focus lends moral urgency to the Comaroffs' consideration of the distant initial encounters between white missionaries and the southern Tswana in the early nineteenth century. Volume 2, for example, opens with a striking vignette: Tswana soldiers refuse to defend the white regime in 1994, as Afrikaner patriots launch a last-ditch raid on Bophuthatswana. As homeland structures crumble around them as they write, the Comaroffs acknowledge that endings and beginnings are never entirely neat. "And yet in many respects, the narrative of Tswana colonization had completed itself, finally running its course from Revelation to Revolution."4 Doubtless the authors would now adopt a less utopian position, but their enthusiasm for revolution and for endings is important, and typical of South African historical writing from the decades before the end of apartheid.5 2 Catherine Desbarats, "Essais sur quelques elements de l'6criture de l'histoire am6rindienne," Revue d'histoire de l'Ameriquefranqaise 53, no. 4 (Spring 2000): 491-520, provides an interesting model, inspired among others by Paul Ricoeur, Hayden White, and Kerwin Lee Klein, for the reading of various historical approaches to the colonial encounter as forms of narrative romance, given the inescapable narrativity of the historical text. Susan Newton-King, also drawing on Ricoeur, similarly reflects on the inescapable imposition of an artificial order on colonial encounters by the historian of colonialism.

This chapter sets out to explore "the initial meeting of two worlds, one imperial and expansive, the other local and defensive."6 In marvelously evocative detail, the authors describe the initial entry of envoys of the London Missionary Society (LMS) in 1816 into the Tswana capital, Dithakong (seen by the missionaries themselves as a sacred journey into the land of Satan), a subsequent meeting, and the complex negotiations that took place throughout over the terms of the mission. A key metaphor is furnished by the mirror that the LMS envoy John Campbell presented as a gift to the Tswana chief, Mothibi, symbolizing the Western effort to reconfigure Tswana consciousness and the Tswana notion of the self. These initial encounters prefigured the colonial encounter to come: "the square enclosure and all that 'took place' at the center of the most public of Tswana spaces was ominous, foreshadowing a methodical reconstruction of their symbolic map."7 The Christian missionary project, this chapter further suggests, was from the start central to the creation of the dialectical oppositions of colonialism, ironic in view of its claim to erase difference. For the Comaroffs, the colonization of the Tswana thus began (although it certainly did not end) with the word, in the sense both of Bible and of cultural text, with the advent of white Protestant missionaries and their claims to possess the revealed divine word-albeit a word made flesh, clothed in material power. The roots of colonization were in a series of knowledge claims and a set of hegemonic cultural discourses, which would bolster the later seizure of land and of labor. Many scholars have explored the linkage between knowledge claims and colonial power, an issue that has long lain at the heart of postcolonial scholarship and that occupies an increasingly central place in the study of imperialism from a diversity of perspectives.8 Nonetheless, Of Revelation and Revolution furnishes a particularly influential and important statement of the position, in part because it provides a great deal of flesh on the bones of a theoretical model of cultural colonialism. The work moves from the field of discourse alone to examine in great detail concrete material struggles over the remaking of everyday life, including Tswana efforts to resist cultural colonialism. More controversially, perhaps, Of Revelation and Revolution also attempts to make explicit the links in southern Africa between a postcolonial setting.

The need to make linkages and the Comaroffs' explicit commitment to the exploration of large-scale processes lead the authors to oversimplify in places. Not only that, but the imperatives of a dialectical method push the Comaroffs at times (despite their parallel stress on indeterminacy and their very explicit engagement with the costs and benefits of a dialectical analysis, especially in Volume 2) into tighter methodological corners than they might themselves like. The links between early nineteenth-century cultural colonialism and late nineteenth-century political colonialism are not as direct or as ontologically indissoluble as the Comaroffs assume they are, while the relationship of "modernity" to colonialism furnishes matter for debate, with considerable contemporary implications. The very boldness of the Comaroffs' arguments has indeed contributed to a mixed reception among scholars of southern African history and of religion in Africa, with some enthusiastically welcoming the methodological innovation of the Comaroffs and others casting doubt in a number of ways. In the second volume of the series, the Comaroffs seem to me to have backed down somewhat from some of their bolder claims, despite their spirited engagement with the critics. This in itself provides an interesting case study of the evolution of ideas during a turbulent decade in South African history. In what follows, I would like to engage with this important work in several ways. First, I want to lay out my understanding of the theoretical guidelines in the opening volume, with particular attention to the issue of hegemony and power. Second, I want to provide an alternate reading of the opening encounters between Tswana and missionary, focusing on other intermediaries and on the fact that, even before the advent of European missionaries, the region was already affected by colonialism. I shall use this example to ask whether a dialectic model does not in some ways oversimplify complicated situations and make it hard to account for fudging across the fault lines. I shall further ask whether the result is not a rather muted account of individual agency and an attenuated depiction of the multiple uses of mission Christianity, both as language and as practice. This is not, however, to deny the latent authoritarian potential of much missionary activity, particularly in a colonial context. Third, I also want to gesture, albeit sketchily, toward some issues associated with narrative and chronology, suggesting that the schematic narrative about "modernity," industrialization, and globalization that undergirds both volumes, though provocative and important, also offers a number of hostages to fortune. These include an undue stress on the capacity of missionaries to induct converts into the global economy by changing their consciousness; rather, I see converts struggling to adapt to an overpowering global economy, among other things by trying to use Christianity in a variety of ways, with greater or lesser degrees of success. Having said all that, does this fact-mongering matter?-What are the Comaroffs doing that might go beyond reading the content of particular 9 Colonialism was simultaneously a "process in political economy and culture," and these dimensions were "indissoluble aspects of the same reality, whose fragmentation into discrete spheres hides their ontological unity."

Throughout, I want to take up some concerns of African historians and anthropologists with questions of narrative, voice, and agency in Of Revelation and Revolution. THE INITIAL CHAPTER OF THE FIRST VOLUME is a careful theoretical exposition. Although the authors rather cheerfully direct those with little stomach for theoretical discussions to skip theirs and, en bon bricoleur, to pick up the narrative at a later point, the opening discussion of anthropological concepts is in fact crucial for an understanding of what both this book and its later companion seek to accomplish. I would accordingly like to pause upon it. The stated goal of the work is to present an anthropology of the "colonial encounter," in this case between British Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana, with the larger implication that the missionaries acted as the cultural arm of colonialism, while the dilemmas of the Tswana in their confrontations with colonialism mirrored, if they obviously did not precisely reproduce, the experience of other colonized African groups in South Africa. The Comaroffs state that they hope that their discussion of this particular mission will accomplish three other things: to anticipate later modes of consciousness and struggle in South Africa; to look at an example of historical processes that were happening across Africa and indeed much of the non-Western world; and to examine analytic issues to do with the "nature of power and resistance." With reference to this latter objective: How, precisely, were structures of inequality fashioned during the colonial encounter, often in the absence of more conventional, more coercive tools of domination? How was consciousness made and remade in this process? ... How were new hegemonies established and the "ground prepared," in [Antonio] Gramsci's phrase, for formal European political control? ... Even more fundamentally, how are we to understand the dialectics of culture and power, ideology and consciousness that shape such historical processes?'1 From the vantage point of 1991, the Comaroffs placed their project into a historiographical framework that has since changed considerably, in no small part due to their own work."1 At the time, the Comaroffs castigated anthropologists for 10 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 6. 11 Among many possibilities, some works of particular importance to southern Africa include Paul Stuart Landau, The Realm of the Word: Language, Gender and Christianity in a Southern African Kingdom (London, 1995); Henry Bredekamp and Robert Ross, eds., Missions and Christianity in South African History (Johannesburg, 1995); Pier M.

The sheer diversity of recent approaches to the history of mission Christianity, a growth field, is impossible to capture in a footnote but is suggested by works such as David Maxwell and Ingrid Lawrie, eds., Christianity and the African Imagination: Essays in Honour of Adrian Hastings (Leiden, 2001); Nicholas Thomas, "Colonial Conversions: Difference, Hierarchy and History in Early Twentieth-Century Evangelical Propaganda," in Hall, Cultures of Empire; Susan Thorne, Congregational Missions and the Making of an Imperial Culture in Nineteenth- Century England (Stanford, Calif., 1999); Peter van der Veer, ed., Conversion to Moderities: The Globalization of Christianity (London, 1996); Robert W.

Historians paid more attention to missions but in the 1960s and 1970s often focused on the theoretically crude question of "whose side were the missionaries really on?" By the 1980s, mission history had been more fruitfully incorporated into work on such long-term processes as colonial conquest, capitalist expansion, state formation, and proletarianization. The methodological innovation of the Comaroffs in the early 1990s was, however, to underscore how much this new approach was itself limited by its "preoccupation with political economy at the expense of culture, symbolism, and ideology."12 They echoed the 1986 claim of Terence Ranger that most of the historiography of early missions to that point had overestimated the political and economic factors in its expansion-in a manner, according to the Comaroffs, stemming ultimately from oppositions between mind and matter at the ontological roots of our social thought.13 In rejecting a narrowly political-economic approach, the authors believed they could better answer the questions of why it was that missionaries succeeded in effecting broad social, political, and economic changes without substantial material resources (a question that, of course, assumes that this was accomplished by missionaries). What was needed, the Comaroffs claimed, was a study of consciousness: of why people articulated belief in certain things, why they took others for granted, how colonialism and consciousness were inextricably intertwined. It is in this sense that missionaries were most clearly colonial agents: they sought to remake the lifeworld of the Tswana, indeed, to colonize their consciousness. They did not necessarily seek directly and simplistically to incorpo- rate the Tswana into an unequal colonial world: they had dreamed instead of a "global democracy of material well-being and moral merit," in the Comaroffs' phrase.14 Nonetheless, their actions contributed to building an empire of inequality. This claim rests on the additional argument that the missionaries were the products of post-Enlightenment modernity, creations and agents of rationalization in the Weberian sense. Similarly, Tswana interlocutors made a variety of unexpected uses of the evangelical message, and of evangelical attempts to remake their world, again with unpredictable results. In sum, the encounter between colonial evangelism and the southern Tswana can best be described as a "long conversation," a continuing process in the course of which "signifiers were set afloat, fought over, and recaptured on both sides of the colonial encounter."15 Over the course of this conversation, the Tswana came to conceive of themselves as constituting a separate, Translating the Message: The Missionary Impact on Culture (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1989); and V. Y. Mudimbe, The Invention of Africa: Gnosis, Philosophy, and the Order of Knowledge (Bloomington, Ind., 1988). The Currents in World Christianity Project, at the University of Cambridge, has also since 1996 lent considerable impetus to the scholarly study of missions. A longstanding African literature reconsiders missions and the truth claims of missionaries, often from a theological perspective: for example, J. N. K. Mugambi, From Liberation to Reconstruction: African Christian Theology after the Cold War (Nairobi, 1996). Many works by African scholars are less well distributed in the West than they might be, given material constraints. From a wide variety of directions, missionary activity has become a newly invigorated area of research since the 1990s, although some of the more difficult underlying issues are perhaps not adequately discussed in all the literature. 12 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 8. 13 Terence Ranger, "Religious Movements and Politics in Sub-Saharan Africa," African Studies Review 29 (1986): 1-69. 14 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 12. 15 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17-18.

At the same time, the "forms" of the "European worldview" became inscribed on the "African land- scape": "not only did colonialism produce reified cultural orders, it gave rise to a new hegemony amidst-and despite-cultural contestation."16 Throughout this discussion, the Comaroffs reject the poststructuralist claim that all meanings are equally tenuous and open to contestation, regretting the episte- mological hypochondria and consequent intellectual immobility to which postmod- ern critiques have given rise in academia-even as the authors uphold some of the central insights of such critiques, notably their insistence that the indeterminacies of meaning and action be addressed by scholars.17 What poststructuralists cannot address is the basic question of how some meanings get widely accepted over significant periods of time by those against whose interest it is to believe them. This is the problem of hegemony, raised by Gramsci (however sketchy his discussion in the Prison Notebooks) and developed by many social theorists.18 The Comaroffs offer a solution, though over-schematic in the literal sense of the word. They see human consciousness as existing on a spectrum from "hegemony" to "ideology." At the hegemony end of the spectrum, one finds the taken-for-granted inscribed in everyday life-those beliefs that are not questioned because they are not even noticed as beliefs. At the other end, one finds articulated ideology, which is available for debate and which often tries to bring into consciousness the hegemonic beliefs of earlier stages. Culture in general is the "space of signifying practice, the semantic ground on which human beings seek to construct and represent themselves and others-and hence, society and history."l9 Somewhat oddly, hegemonic concepts are described as "constructs and conventions that have come to be shared and naturalized through a political community," while ideology is "the expression and ultimately the possession of a particular social group, although it may be widely peddled beyond."20 This psychological structure seems artificial and unwieldy; it is unclear why the province of the hegemonic idea should be the political community (a tricky concept to define in any case), while ideology is described not only as the product of communities (rather than at least sometimes of individuals) but as the province of the social rather than, say, political or even self-consciously intellectual groupings. The definition of the political is murky here, as it is throughout the book, despite (even sometimes because of) the painstaking effort of the authors to demonstrate the deeply political nature of the everyday stuff of life; what is lacking here and elsewhere is a willingness to limit and define the nature of the political in such a manner as to make it meaningful to call something political in the first place. Be that as it may, this construction of group political psychology permits the Comaroffs to draw conclusions that are critically important for their overall project. Indeed, the reconstruction of struggles over the stuff of everyday life that takes pride of place in the second volume depends ultimately on this theoretical 16 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 18. 17 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17. 18 Antonio Gramsci, Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci, Quentin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith, trans.

Given the place of hegemony and ideology on an ever-changing spectrum, the two are constantly fluid; meanings are always being made and remade, as ideology challenges hegemony to reveal itself, and it is in the inchoate, fluid space between hegemony and ideology that human consciousness is at its most creative. Given that hegemony is constructed largely through the "assertion of control over various modes of symbolic production: over such things as educational and ritual processes, patterns of socialization, political and legal procedures, canons of style and self-representation, public communication, health and bodily discipline and so on," the realm of "symbolic production" is (presumably) political because it is a site for power struggles. This means both that the "symbolic production" is political and that resistance to modes of symbolic production that generate hegemony is political. Modes of resistance run across as wide a spectrum as modes of control, with at one end organized protest and other movements readily recognized as political by the West; at the other end are "gestures of tacit refusal and iconoclasms, gestures that sullenly and silently contest the forms of an existing hegemony."21 It is thus in this light that missions must be seen. They sought to extend hegemonic control over indigenous peoples by changing their worldviews to a point that new ways of behaving and seeing the world were completely internalized. Resistance to the specific forms of Christianity was also resistance to the message behind the signs. In the purest sense, resistance to Christian forms was resistance to the content of capitalism and to the global capitalist system; this is indeed a critical plank of Jean Comaroff's fascinating (if not uncontroversial) reading of African independent churches as quintessentially subversive because they appropriated and yet subverted Christian forms, in her important 1985 study Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance.22 Christian missions must also be re-read. Their gestures and ritual must be analyzed in order to see how missionaries were attempting to change far more than religious allegiance, acting as emissaries of modernity and economic transfor- mation. Finally, conversion was inextricably political, and as such a suitable site for political competition between colonizers and the colonized. The extremely rich remainder of this book and its successor volume work out the implications of these theoretical positions through a quite brilliant analysis of the nineteenth-century "colonial exchange" between the southern Tswana and the Nonconformist missions to them run first by the London Missionary Society (pioneers in the field) and then by their later-arriving brethren, the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society. An additional important project of the authors throughout this study is to demonstrate the importance of an imagined Africa to the British sense of themselves and more broadly to the construction of modernity. As the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2, as part of a series of seven propositions about colonialism, "colonialism was as much involved in making the metropole, and the identities and ideologies of colonizers, as it was in (re)making peripheries and colonial sub- 21 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 31. 22 Jean Comaroff, Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance: The Culture and History of a South African People (Chicago, 1985).

A final critical point is that the authors see the interaction between missionary and Tswana as a form of dialectic between two key groups of interlocutors, dependent on the notion of difference. In the second volume, the Comaroffs acknowledge with more force than in Volume 1 the existence of overlap on the ground, and they reemphasize that the idea of difference was created by the dialectical process, despite some merging of lifeways on the ground and the mutual influence of Tswana and British. Note their comment that "neither 'the colonizer' nor 'the colonized' represented an undifferentiated sociological or political reality, save in exceptional circumstances."25 Since the end product of the colonial encounter was so clearly the production of difference and a series of deeply embedded dialectical oppositions, the Comaroffs nonetheless argue that this is the most productive optic through which to view the early nineteenth-century encounter between European mission- aries and Africans. This model is furthermore essential to their theoretical account of the formation of hegemony. ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE FOUND MOST PERPLEXING about the work of the Comaroffs is, nevertheless, the question of the extent to which it is appropriate to describe the Tswana encounter with Christianity as a form of dialectic. This question implies the ancillary question of who the agents of the dialectic were at given moments. On the face of it, these are tendentious concerns, since colonialism was so clearly in many ways a dialectic between colonized and colonizer, just as colonialism clearly generated reified views of colonizer and colonized alike. Missionaries themselves usually understood their activities in dialectical terms. Yet I think one can ask whether a dialectical approach to the history of Christianity in colonial contexts 23 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 22. 24 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 86.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 443 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne does not fail to capture some aspects of social and political reality. This is above all because of the rapidity with which Christianity was out of the hands of the missionaries and settlers who brought it, the corresponding importance of non- Europeans in the spread of Christianity, the multiplicity of uses to which diverse interest groups of all ethnicities put Christianity as both a language and a practice, and the political and cultural complications of regions with multiple power players. These issues are brought out by a re-reading of the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana that occupy so key a role in the first volume of Of Revelation and Revolution. I should add that I made similar comments about the opening phases of the mission in an unpublished conference paper after the publication of Volume 1. The Comaroffs respond generously to this paper in Volume 2, as they do to a number of other critics, using the occasion to clarify and amplify their understanding of a dialectical approach. I do not want to beat a dead horse. Nonetheless, I think there are some useful differences of interpretation at stake, and so will abuse the Comaroffs' patience by briefly recapitulating a potential alternate reading of these opening gambits, before returning to the wider issue of different approaches to mission history.26 Let me first make a comment about regional issues. The lands of the southern Tswana were disrupted by colonialism, drought, hunger, and regional conflict well before the formal advent of missions. Furthermore, as Johannes du Bruyn has underscored, the lands inhabited by the southern Tswana were so profoundly affected by the Cape Colony to the south that it is problematic to frame a discussion of cultural colonialism primarily in terms of Europe and the Transvaal. In particular, the colonial firearms frontier moved with great speed, was highly destructive, and was arguably more important earlier than the Comaroffs suggest. Many different armed bands, some of them ethnically mixed, decimated peaceful groups in conflict situations exacerbated by hunger.27 Arguments about the regional context for evangelical missions to the Tswana are also implicit in a much wider body of literature about the so-called mfecane (or difaqane)-terms that have been much disputed by historians. Traditionally, the mfecane was a term given to the widespread wars, famines, and refugee movements that shook (and temporarily depopulated) much of the interior of southern Africa in the early nineteenth century, the impact of which on the Tswana the Comaroffs date from 1822. There is no space here to explore that debate, although it will be helpful to know that a 26 My re-reading of the opening encounter is based on my own work on LMS archives, which I consulted primarily with the aim of writing about contestation over the uses of Christianity within the Cape Colony and with a focus on Khoesan not Tswana uses of Christianity. It seems to me fruitful, however, to unite diverse perspectives on a very complex subject. Elizabeth Elbourne, Blood Ground: Colonialism, Missions and the Contest for Christianity in the Cape Colony and Britain, 1799-1853 (Montreal, 2002). There were four LMS delegations to the Tswana to establish a mission, not two as the Comaroffs have it. 27 Johannes du Bruyn, "Of Muffled Tswana and Overwhelming Missionaries: The Comaroffs and the Colonial Encounter," South African Historical Journal, no. 31 (1994): 294-309; Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 275-76. On Tswana views of the firearms frontier, see Robert Moffat to Richard Miles, Lattakoo [Kuruman], December 5, 1827, in Isaac Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman: Being the Journals and Letters of Robert and Mary Moffat, 1820-1828 (London, 1951), 274. Other letters in this collection describe frequent deadly raids throughout the 1820s, in which a wide variety of often ethnically mixed groups preyed on one another. On Cape influence, see also Johannes du Bruyn, "James Read en die Thlaping, 1816-1820," Historia 35 (1990). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 444 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh critical issue is whether or not covert slave trading from the Cape Colony and Portuguese territories was at the root of disruptions that have more traditionally been ascribed to the many conquests of the Zulu kingdom in the region of what is now Natal. The point I want to emphasize here is not only the great disruption in the region but also the plausibility of historian Neil Parsons's argument that Tswana territory had already been subject since the seventeenth century to political unrest and the large-scale movement of populations. Parsons in fact suggests that the roots of disruption and state formation in the area may well lie in destabilization that considerably antedated the 1820s and may in turn be linked in at least some way to eighteenth-century slave trading to the north and the rise of the predatory Cape Colony to the south.28 Scholars also tend to see later Afrikaner settler colonialism in the region as part of the same broad processes. All this calls into question the determinative impact of mission Christianity in an already destabilized region. Maybe political colonialism did precede cultural colonialism after all? How might we need to reconceptualize the Christian/Tswana encounter if we think of it as taking place in some sense in a frontier zone, or even a borderland, with multiple players, already characterized by cultural admixture, politically influenced uses of Christianity, and political turbulence? The Comaroffs are of course sensitive to these hugely important issues. I think nonetheless that they could emphasize regional complexity more and the power of missionary Christianity somewhat less in their discussion of the roots of material change (at both ends of the nineteenth century), as well as pay more attention to the implications for their overall theoretical argument of the fact that Africans tried to experiment in response to very difficult local conditions. It is also important that the missionaries entered as potential power brokers in a turbulent environment but were initially weak, able to manipulate power if and only if they could make the right alliances. With these types of broad issues in mind, the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana, so well described by the Comaroffs, might be re-read as conversations between a number of actors. Four LMS delegations traveled between 1813 and 1817 to the southern Tswana settlement known to the missionaries as Lattakoo (later Dithakong) to try to persuade the Tswana to accept missionaries. It is perhaps symbolically appropriate that none of these delegations was exclusively white. In addition to the delegations' African members, even the missionaries themselves included a black West Indian man and a Welsh speaker. Neither, come to that, was the Tswana polity entirely "Tswana." The Thlaping polity was relatively multi-ethnic; the chief Mothibi, for example, was half !Kora (a Khoekhoe-speaking group) and (like others of the chiefly lineage) married a !Kora woman. More significantly, the Europeans were not the only, or even the most important, players promoting an evangelical mission. Key from a Tswana perspective were regional actors, the Griqua (as they 28 Julian Cobbing, "The Mfecane as Alibi: Thoughts on Dithakong and Mbolompo," Journal of African History 29, no. 3 (1988): 487-519; Caroline Hamilton, ed., Mfecane Aftermath (Johannesburg, 1996), including Neil Parsons, "Prelude to Difaqane in the Interior of Southern Africa c. 1600-1822," 323-49; Neil Parsons, "Kicking the Hornets' Nest: A Third View of the Cobbing Controversy on the Mfecane/Difaqane," address to the University of Botswana History Society, Gabarone, Botswana, March 16, 1999 (available online through the University of Botswana History Department web page, at http://ubh.tripod.com/ub/np.htm).

The Griqua were clusters of settlers in the region of Khoekhoe descent, some of whom had white fathers and Khoesan mothers, and many of whom had migrated from the Cape Colony, epitomizing the remaking of identity in the wake of colonialism. Groups spearheaded by Griqua had established regional hegemony through their access to arms and horses. They provided important trade links with the Cape Colony and were sources of trade goods for the Tswana. The Griqua were already using Christianity in a variety of complicated ways, as a token of equality with white settlers, as justification for what Robert Ross has termed "sub-imperialism" with regard to the unconverted Tswana, and indeed as a basis for their reconstituted polities. Alliances with missionaries gave these emergent polities potential access to diplomacy and markets, including the arms trade, in addition to spiritual concerns. Indeed, on the way to Mothibi's settlement, British LMS inspector Campbell had helped compose a formal written constitution for a Griqua group, reflecting the symbolic uses of the language of law. The language of Christianity was already on the loose in the interior, in other words, and subject to interpretation in Griqualand as much as in the seminaries of Europe.29 The (Khoekhoe) !Kora had also been exposed to Christianity and were also competing by the 1820s to obtain guns and horses from the Cape Colony. The decision of Mothibi and his counselors about whether to accept an LMS mission was thus complicated by the fact that the LMS came under the protection of the powerful Griqua Kok clan. During a second LMS delegation to the Tswana (overlooked by the Comaroffs), for example, Adam Kok presented newly arrived missionaries to Mothibi and acted as their translator. Mothibi was anxious not to offend the powerful Kok family, but worried because his own people had since turned against the mission. In fact, he eventually sent these missionaries away altogether. When two missionaries told Mothibi that one of them "wrought in wood, and one that was to come wrought in Iron, that we would do all the work for him in that way that he wanted," Mothibi was pleased and told Kok "he could not think of rejecting those that came with or through the medium of him." When the missionaries pursued the issue of teaching, however, Mothibi worriedly told Kok that "he would not be instructed, and if A. Kok should endeavour to press it sharply upon him, and his refusal cause a variance between them, he said that he would rather take the flight from Lattakoo, with people." Kok had to reassure Mothibi that the Griqua leader would not force the Tswana chief to relocate if the Thlaping 29 This discussion both here and below draws on Robert Ross, Adam Kok's Griquas: A Study in the Development of Stratification in South Africa (Cambridge, 1976); Elizabeth Elbourne and Robert Ross, "Combating Spiritual and Social Bondage: Early Missions in the Cape Colony," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa; Alan Barnard, Hunters and Herders of Southern Africa: A Comparative Ethnography of the Khoisan Peoples (Cambridge, 1992), 156-75, 193-94; Martin Legassick, "The Northern Frontier to c. 1840: The Rise and Decline of the Griqua People," in Richard Elphick and Hermann Giliomee, eds., The Shaping of South African Society, 1652-1840 (Middletown, Conn., 1988), 358-420; Nigel Penn, "The Orange River Frontier Zone, c. 1700-1805," in Andrew B.

If missionaries were initially dependent on Griqua intermediaries, they were also materially dependent for travel and translation on Khoesan hired in the colony. The Khoekhoe and San had long borne the brunt of brutal colonial subjugation and were in many cases more receptive to conversion than groups beyond the Cape Colony. The Comaroffs indeed have a wonderful discussion of the occlusion of such intermediary figures from missionary accounts of putatively solitary heroic jour- neys.31 I would go further than the Comaroffs, however, and suggest that at least some of these companions saw themselves as fellow missionaries. On the first delegation, Campbell was accompanied by a number of Khoesan Christians from the Cape. Their prayers and preaching had made a pilgrimage route of their journey through a country of which they saw themselves as taking spiritual possession. They were active in trying to persuade Tswana individuals to accept missionaries.32 In 1814, a synod of the southern African LMS missionaries had "set aside" in a religious ceremony several men of Khoesan descent to act as LMS agents in the interior, several of whom, including Griqua leader Andries Waterboer, subse- quently played important roles in the politics of Transorangia. Cupido Kakkerlak, a product of Eastern Cape mission schools whose letters reveal a passionate spirituality, also itinerated in the region, attempting, albeit with little success, to evangelize among the !Kora. These men were employed by the LMS. As the Comaroffs point out, the society would devote much energy to reining in and controlling "native agents" after the earliest years of the mission. Nonetheless, evidence from the Cape suggests that there was also considerable evangelical activity by converts who were not formally paid by missionary societies, including elephant hunters such as Hendrik Boesak or long-range wagon drivers. In addition, as mission stations became more like churches and congregations fought for independence from missionary control around the mid-century mark, congregations had more authority, not less. My point is that evidence from elsewhere in southern Africa suggests that Christianity was spread by people with long-range contacts other than missionaries, presumably not necessarily in orthodox form. The central- ity of Khoesan people (and later other Africans) to European-led missions to the Tswana suggests a wider oral evangelical culture that the written records would not completely reflect.33 Be that as it may, the importance of Khoesan agents to the Tswana mission is most clearly exemplified by the fourth delegation to Lattakoo, led by a former 30 Robert Hamilton to LMS Directors, Griquatown, April 28, 1816, London Missionary Society Papers, South Africa Correspondence-Incoming, 6/3/C, Council for World Mission Archives, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (hereafter, LMS-SA).

Read brought with him an unusually large group of people of varied ethnic origins, mostly Khoesan, including, more problematically, his own Khoekhoe wife, Elizabeth Valentyn, and his pregnant former mistress, a San woman, Sabina Pretorius, whom he claimed to have met by accident on the road. At least ten Khoesan men and six Khoesan women accompanied Read, all of whom were church members and some of whom were "zealous persons."34 It is indeed possible that the Khoesan of the Cape Colony saw this as a Khoesan mission to the Tswana, brokered by their kin among the Griqua. In any case, once Robert Moffat took over the Lattakoo station in 1821 from Read (disgraced for his adultery), he would fight successfully to diminish the influence of the Khoesan group from the Cape Colony, whom he then firmly wrote out of the history of the station. He dismissed several for immorality, despite the resistance, in which women played prominent roles, of members of the group. Moffat also found himself opposed by Griqua factions, many of whom resented his power-mongering presence.35 Before the late 1810s, the earliest LMS agents in southern Africa were not particularly good or even very enthusiastic apostles of capitalist cultural practices, mostly because they were so poor themselves and so looked-down-upon by many respectable members of colonial society. More than a few also tended to believe in dreams, to hear the personal voice of God, or to look for the imminent end of the world. Those missionaries who were closest in time to the Enlightenment, in sum, acted least like the bourgeois agents of respectability described by the Comaroffs as quintessential exemplars of the rationalizing project of modernity. The colonial unrespectability of early missionaries was compounded by the fact that perhaps a third of them married African women before 1817, while several were involved in sexual scandals. Others took high-profile political positions that were unpopular among settlers. The Comaroffs pick up the story as Moffat, in common with many of his fellows, was urgently trying to reclaim the moral high ground and to reinvent the mission as visibly respectable and as focused on "civilization." A lot of this is more about the internal history of the LMS than about African Christianity; we certainly in general need more of the latter and perhaps less of the former. Nonetheless, it argues for the importance of local detail, and for the centrality of fractures within as well as between groups. It also points forward to ways in which converts would later need to perform "civilization" and "respectability" in order to maneuver on the colonial stage, not solely because their consciousnesses had been colonized. From the start, tensions among evangelicals themselves were fueled by anxiety over the rapid removal of Christianity from the control of white missionaries. This tension was arguably innate to a type of evangelical Christianity based on textual interpretation and the notion of divine inspiration, as well as being the product of Tswana reconstruction of Christian forms. Certainly, missionaries soon lost control even of "orthodox" Christianity. Among the northern Tswana, Paul Landau has brilliantly documented the use of Christianity by junior royals to challenge existing authority in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in ways that escaped 34 LMS-SA, 6/4/A: James Read to Joseph Hardcastle, Bethelsdorp, August 7, 1816. 35 See Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman. AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 448 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh a series of rather peripheral white missionaries. Among the southern Tswana, Thlaping elites also exploited divisions among missionaries to their own political ends. In 1842, for example, Tswana elite men successfully appealed to LMS superintendent John Philip to fire missionary Holloway Helmore for excessive interference in congregational affairs, including deposing Mothibi's son as a deacon.36 Missionaries to the Tswana experienced other humiliations. The coherent Tswana group targeted by the mission decamped, to be replaced by a more motley group of refugees. The mission was battered by raids from various groups, could not protect its members, and was not successful at all until it started picking up displaced persons in the 1830s. A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS arise from this type of re-reading. At a macro level, the region was already turbulent and populations were mobile, so Christianity scarcely arrived as the harbinger of globalization in anything other than an ideological sense. This raises in turn the thorny and ultimately unanswerable question of whether Christianity would have had the capacity to colonize minds without the prior disruption of material conditions. We are back at the difficult issue of how determinative "culture" is by itself. Perhaps in the end, this rejigging of chronology strengthens the Comaroffs' fundamental argument about the inextricability of "culture" and material struggle. It does nonetheless pose all the more sharply the question of how Christianity-and religious innovation, more broadly defined- functioned in a frontier zone in a manner that was independent of the machinations of white missionaries.37 Also at the "macro" level, the Tswana were not entirely "local," nor were they unused to cultural difference. In a multi-lingual, multi-religious environment, were missionaries really needed to contextualize "Tswana custom"? Missionary papers record Mothibi making distinctions between !Kora, Tswana, and colonial Khoekhoe customs, for example. I would not want to deny the importance of local identity, or to exaggerate the degree of long-range contacts of the southern Tswana, in contrast to the remarkable global reach and global identity claims of the early missionary movement. There are issues of tremendous importance raised by that contrast. But it also seems important that there were other regional interlocutors who were of greater material importance initially to the Tswana than the Europeans, and with whom they already had the kind of cultural interchanges that might have permitted the type of self-consciousness about "Tswana" identity that the Comaroffs see as the fruit of the "long conversation." This is also a way of asking about what the southern African interior looked like before formal European colonialism and whether the communities of the region were really as settled as they appeared. There are echoes here of an older debate about whether the encounter with the "macrocosmic" claims of the "world religions" Christianity and Islam shattered the 36 Landau, Realm of the Word; Elbourne, Blood Ground. On Helmore's dismissal, see LMS-SA, 19/2/A: James Read to LMS Directors, Philipton, June 3, 1843. The LMS Directors overturned the dismissal and censured Philip. 37 An interesting point of contrast is provided by Janet Hodgson, "A Battle for Sacred Power: Christian Beginnings among the Xhosa," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa.

As Terence Ranger has argued, whatever the intellectual issues at stake, African societies, at least in the southern African interior, have to be recognized as also "macrocosmic" in the sense that they had long-range contacts, exchanged ideas over large swathes of territory (as the rapid spread of prophetic movements suggests), and rubbed up against a wide variety of different groups.38 The relative mobility of different communities was also a factor in breaking down localism. This type of approach, to my mind, decenters the European missionary-at least until the missionary came backed up by a colonial economy and a colonial army. The power exerted by the conditions of the "frontier zone" of the region is represented by the fact that even missionaries were compelled by material circumstances to take on features of African polities. The Comaroffs highlight the vision of Kuruman mission head and former gardener Robert Moffat, and his wife Mary, like that of many early nineteenth-century Nonconformist missionaries, as one of an unrealistic rural idyll, in which they sought to remake Africa in the image of a vanishing and imagined rural utopian Britain. One could, however, go further in considering the contradictions of Kuruman. Robert Moffat acted in many ways like an African leader as well as like a nostalgic Scot, and he needed to do so because of the material conditions of the frontier. In the 1820s, he proved unable to retain the allegiance of existing chiefs, for whom he was too clearly a competitor. As the refugee crisis accelerated, however, Moffat was able to gather together dispossessed people. The price of their admission was allegiance to the religion of the leader, since religion was used to rebuild communities. The currency of power was people. In similar ways, the control of women and their reproduction was important to the maintenance of the power of the patriarch, whether African chief or mission station head-Moffat even went so far, for example, as to attempt to discipline publicly Ann Hamilton, the wife of his colleague Robert Hamilton, for refusing to sleep with her husband.39 Moffat was more a part of the African frontier world than he might have liked to admit. A further critical point raised by this case study is that Africans transmitted Christianity more effectively than missionaries did. The centrality of Africans to the spread of Christianity means that much of the early history of the mission is unrecoverable. It is often unclear what kinds of Christianity were spread orally, for example. In other parts of southern Africa, prophetic figures emerged from time to time to use aspects of the Christian message in a context that suggests how quickly its language became unhinged from missionary guardianship. For example, Xhosa prophet and war hero Makanda Nxele (Makana), who led a Xhosa attack on the colony in 1819, had an earlier flirtation with the LMS; he was refused the right to work as a native agent when he insisted that there was a god for the white man and a god for the black man, and that he himself was related to Jesus Christ. The examples could be multiplied, as the Comaroffs would certainly agree.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 450 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh between orthodoxy as the missionaries perceived it and African prophetic innova- tion were fluid and could be crossed in both directions, explaining the anxiety of white missionaries to bring Christianity back under control. In contrast to the Comaroffs, who emphasize the orthodoxy of the Nonconformists (whom they see in rather stereotypical, indeed Victorianist, terms), I would contend that this anxiety was familiar from debates within the European churches as well; after all, Methodism had once been perceived from within the citadels of Anglican orthodoxy in ways similar to Nonconformist views of African ecstatic innovation.40 If in the early days of missionary activity, Christianity was never fully in the control of the white missionaries who had brought it and only became popular once it was spread mostly by Africans and then transformed in the process, what does this imply about how we might conceptualize the study of colonial missions? I have suggested in the past that the messy scenario I outline above, with its complications and its fudging across the fault lines, calls into question the utility at the micro level of a strict dialectical approach to the history of colonial Christianity. The ghost of French structuralist understandings of G. W. Hegel's master-slave dialectic seems to me to hover over and to constrain the first volume. In response, however, the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2 that I have too conventional an understanding of their view of dialectical processes. A dialectic is not a "formal, abstract, or strictly teleological movement through time and space," in a Hegelian sense. Rather, it is a "process of reciprocal determination; a process of material, social and cultural articulation-involving sentient human beings rather than abstract forces or structures."41 Colonialism is dialectical because it creates binary understandings of difference and depends on the idea of opposites; it is also presumably dialectical because colonial interaction shapes both the colonized and the colonizer in new ways. Returning to the issue at the end of Volume 2, the Comaroffs reiterate (although this seems to me a somewhat different take) that by "dialectics" they mean "the mutually transforming play of social forces whose outcome is neither linear nor simply overdetermined." Defined thus, they add, "it is hard to imagine how colonial history could be regarded as anything else."42 In a weak sense, this is undeniable. Furthermore, on this model, it may not matter that the early encounter between missionaries and Tswana was so much messier than a "dialectical" account would suggest. The Comaroffs' point is precisely that out of difference and mess colonialism created binary opposites. At the same time, the exact nature of this process is often hard to capture. It is interesting to hear John Comaroff raise, in a recently published transcribed conversation with Homi Bhabha, what he terms the question of theory related to "the old Manichean opposition between colonizer and colonized, those 'iteratively marked,' positionally conflated points of reference around which the human geography of empire is so widely imagined. How, other than purely by descriptive insistence, does one displace the crushing logic of binarism in terms of which 40 Among many possibilities, see Deborah Valenze, Prophetic Sons and Daughters: Female Preaching and Popular Religion in Industrial England (Princeton, N.J., 1985). 41 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 29. 42 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 410.

Perhaps my own discomfort arises from the difficulty of defining who the agents of dialectic are. In the end, the Comaroffs are interested in doing a historical anthropology of colonialism, more than of religion in colonial contexts. In this optic, the fault line of interest is that between colonized and colonizer. Religious belief did not, however, adhere to that fault line, even though both colonized and colonizers mobilized religion to the ends of power struggle. Nor of course was Christianity itself static. At the same time, the very notion of ethnic difference was still in the process of being worked out more broadly well past the early era of industrialization; therefore it was incorporated differently into the views of colonial evangelists at different times. From the point of view of the Comaroffs' overall narrative structure, this leads us away from the Enlightenment and onto the terrain of more immediately nineteenth-century colonial concerns. On this model, colonial conquest and the need to maintain and justify white rule shaped the mid- nineteenth-century culture of white Christianity. The end was not contained in the beginning but formed by colonial processes. Be that as it may, it is instructive that the Khoesan themselves were not able indefinitely to maintain the interstitial status to which Christianity gave them some access. By the early 1850s, many living in the Cape Colony were forced to choose between the colonial binaries of "black" and "white," in the 1850-1853 frontier war in which many people of Khoesan descent rebelled to fight against the "white" colony, as "race" became the determinant of colonial identity.44 The example also underscores the importance of "black" and "white" as colonial binaries arguably of more importance than "English" and "Tswana." All this should not, however, lead us to read the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in terms of the mid-nineteenth. There is a basic problem here that dogs the Comaroffs throughout the books. Christianity is both text and practice, and therefore difficult to pin down. Not only that, it also permits and contains a wide variety both of practices and of different interpretations of its central themes. As text, Christianity became a free-floating signifier. As a practice, it was fought over bitterly by those who wanted to benefit from it. It is therefore difficult to identify Christianity clearly with one side of a dialectical or even dialogic model. This is all the more problematic because it is hard to define Christianity clearly, other than by appeals to authority. There was considerable scope for Africans to reinvent Christianity even from the beginning of the mission described by the Comaroffs. In some ways, this is precisely the Comaroffs' point: the signs of Christianity were fought over by competing ethnic groups. The Comaroffs nonetheless cannot bring themselves to see acceptance of Christianity in its unadulterated mission form as anything other than a defeat for 43 Bhabha and Comaroff, "Speaking of Postcoloniality," 22. 44 Elbourne, Blood Ground, 345-76; Robert Ross, "The Kat River Rebellion and Khoikhoi Nationalism: The Fate of an Ethnic Identification," Kronos: Journal of Cape History/Tydskrif vir Kaaplandse Geskiedenis 24 (November 1997): 91-105.

This position ultimately obscures complexity. EVENTUALLY, ONE MUST CONFRONT the type of question raised by Leon de Kock, about disciplinary conventions and the fetishization of the archive.45 De Kock argues that historians have spent too much time in their reaction to this wonderful book looking for factual flaws. To put the question in its boldest form, are the details really that essential to the overall project? Perhaps less tendentiously, what are the Comaroffs doing that goes beyond the reading of the words of colonists? The Comaroffs are important precisely because they move beyond words to decipher the gestures of people in the past. They put an anthropologist's emphasis on ritual and performance. They add thereby a crucial dimension to our reading of culture-bound historical archives. The Comaroffs' understanding of performance goes well beyond the staged performances of religious rites (although they acknowledge at the same time that people used the framework of religious ritual as a springboard for their own acting out of emotions and ideas). The missionaries are described as performing civilization, in the hope of educating the Tswana to adopt Western cultural practices through the power of display. In response, the Tswana performed noncompliance or acted out cultural bricolage. The tangible display of the body interests the Comaroffs, just as the material suffering of the colonized body that we readers know is to come provides a moral template for our reading of the early nineteenth century. The authors are particularly interested in space and the disposition of the body in space: their analyses frequently return, like the apartheid state itself, to issues of the control of the movement of African bodies.46 The Comaroffs are in some ways mistrustful of the self-interested and one-sided colonial text and find more solidity in the unspoken exchanges of bodily perfor- mance. It is this approach that both furnishes the greatest richness of the books and yet at the same time has excited unease in some interlocutors. If the evidence that remains of Tswana actions is mostly accounts of their physical activity, does that not place the reporter (the anthropologist, the historian, or even the reader) in the privileged position of interpreting Tswana actions, leaving the Tswana themselves rarely free to speak directly in their own voice? Is this even an accurate assessment of the nature of the historical record, or are there more extensive Tswana records? J. D. Y. Peel and Terence Ranger have both queried the absence of Tswana 45 De Kock, "For and Against the Comaroffs." 46 For example, Volume 2 tellingly argues that integral to the late nineteenth-century struggle over African labor was a further struggle over the "distribution of people in space and, concomitantly, their passage across the social landscape." This is a typical discussion of space that appropriately reflects the struggle of the apartheid state to control the physical body, just as slavery had earlier lent mastery of the body to the slaveowner.

The Comaroffs have responded that community historical narrative was not a genre espoused by the Tswana. They argue, furthermore, that the quest for "narrative" is elitist: it is "a short step from the stress on narrative to the history of elites, thence to elitist history."48 The issue remains uneasily unresolved. For Paul Landau, the Comaroffs themselves have a culturally constrained view of what constitutes "genuine narrative." They pay "little attention to genealogy, song, Tswana conversation, letters, political speech, tales, myth or church charters- because they are not 'genuine' narratives. Consequently Tswana people's ideas of fulfillment and transcendence do not show themselves in either volume."49 Even the Tswana intellectual and politician Sol Plaatje's great novel Mhudi, which draws on Tswana traditions about the difaqane, has been brought into the fray: for the Comaroffs, the fact that Plaatje himself claims that he could only gather material in fragments suggests that the southern Tswana indeed did not have a tradition of sustained historical narrative as late as the early twentieth century, even though Mhudi is more conventionally seen as a reflection at least to some extent of more sustained Tswana oral tradition.50 There is another critical debate at work in these discussions of agency and voice. The Comaroffs are very clear that missionary activity was part of the victimization of Africans. Much recent scholarship on southern African Christianity emphasizes instead the agency of Africans in using and reshaping Christianity to their own ends, as the focus has shifted away from missionaries and onto African Christians. In some ways, the Comaroffs want to restore a sense of moral indignation at the ways in which colonial missions did change the consciousness of Africans in a damaging fashion. Ironically, this may involve seeing people as victims who did not necessarily see themselves that way at the time-another issue of authorial voice. The Comaroffs' anger represents nonetheless an important strand of longstanding protest across the colonized world at the "colonization of the mind."51 It is impossible to deny that many Christian missionaries had a profoundly negative 47 J.

Furthermore, as Peggy Brock has persuasively argued, missionary institutional structures affected the degree of control missionaries could exert over congregations, and these structures were affected by indigenous social arrangements as well as by state power.53 I would further contend, in ways there is not space to elaborate on fully here, that shame was a key element of colonial control. Mission education could and did reinforce this. At the same time, Christianity could also provide a language through which to reclaim dignity and deny the shaming process. I think it is important in sum to see Christianity as a language with many possible uses. Conversion, for example, fulfilled a wider and more flexible range of functions than is suggested by the Comaroffs' reduction of it to a symbolic field of struggle over capitalism. A reading that focuses too exclusively on Christianity as a language of cultural domination rather than a language with a multiplicity of possible meanings pays too much attention to the Western roots of Christianity and not enough to the multiple uses to which Africans very quickly put it. I make this comment in awareness of the extent to which the Comaroffs emphasize the need to explore African perspectives through every possible means, and the extent to which they clearly do this. However, conversion was even more of an empty signifier than the Comaroffs suggest, and some of these significations did not have a lot to do with rational capitalism. On the other hand, conversion was also an act, with attached rituals and beliefs, and this is important for understanding what the act meant in the immediate rather than long-term sense. Even if I am not completely at ease with a victimization model, I would want to add that these were and are enormously complicated processes. They had deep and often painful implications for many. This demands humility from any historian. Undergirding much of the above has been a historian's concern with chronology, which, while justified, cannot do full justice to the rich ferment of ideas in these remarkable books. The Comaroffs in fact comment on what they see as different disciplinary conventions and their inherent costs and benefits. They see real and longstanding differences, as they remark at the end of Volume 2, between the ideal type of a more conventional historian and the archetypal historical anthropologist: "differences between the ideographic and the nomothetic, between the effort to arrive at the fullest possible description of events in their infinite particularity and the desire to pick out general principles across time and space." The latter approach, they underscore, "demands a certain boldness of abstraction" and is "inherently risky."54 Although one would hope that historians are not as painstak- ingly antiquarian and abstraction-averse as this implies, there is some justice to the 52 A wonderfully instructive example of the ambiguities of Christian liberal control of the education system in South Africa, just before apartheid, is furnished by Shula Marks, ed., Not Either an Experimental Doll: The Separate Worlds of Three South African Women (London, 1985). 53 Peggy Brock, "Mission Encounters in the Colonial World: British Columbia and South-West Australia," Journal of Religious History 24, no. 2 (June 2000): 159-79. 54 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 411. AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 455 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elboume comment, at least as it pertains to the Comaroffs' own work. The very manner in which they offer up a multitude of bold ideas, fizzing with possibility, also ensures that they offer a number of hostages to fortune. The Comaroffs are, for example, probably the most influential of recent scholars to argue for tight linkage between missionary activity, "modernity," "Enlighten- ment," and globalization. As Brian Stanley points out, this is also a question that has been much debated in the past few years by Christian theologians and mission theorists, with theologians paying particular attention to the damage done by the universalist truth claims of mission Christianity.55 More broadly, the Comaroffs are participating in a vast debate about modernity and postmodernity among social, political, and cultural theorists that it would be foolhardy to venture upon here. Their contribution is both important and vexed: important because they show the culturally constrained nature of claims to "modernity," vexed because despite everything they reify the truth claims of modernity and have too neat a view of the "Enlightenment," despite substantial historical debate on the utility of the concept. In so doing, they exaggerate the long-term influence of mission Christianity on the material subjugation of the Tswana, particularly by minimizing the impact of illiberal forces and overemphasizing cultural change. This could be true, however, and the significance of the Comaroffs' analysis of practice still be undimmed. The Comaroffs see "modernity" as "always historically constructed." It is in their view "an ideological formation in terms of which societies valorize their own practices by contrast to the specter of barbarism and other marks of negation."56 The Comaroffs link modernity to a view of the self as a rights-bearing atomistic individual, ultimately the "fully fledged bourgeois subject." They further associate modernity with a wide-ranging series of cultural and economic practices, including but not limited to dependence on a worldwide market, industrialization, the use of money, the use of "advanced" agricultural practices, the promotion of individuated space, and a sense of the body as private.57 It is part of the great richness of the Comaroffs' approach that they so fruitfully link cultural and economic practices, refusing to prioritize one over the other. At the same time, this view of modernity is slippery-and this is both its richness and an occasional source of frustration. The Comaroffs move between presenting the truth claims of modernity-its "text," if one likes-and the concrete material practices that advocates saw as characterizing the modern. The authors' desire not to take the truth claims of missionaries at face value make it difficult for them to spell out what, if any, were the irreducible material practices that defined modernity. If there weren't any, however, what was the material force behind the cultural claims and practices of missionaries? Yet it is arguable that at least some of what the Comaroffs identify as the 55 Brian Stanley, "Christian Missions and the Enlightenment: A Reevaluation," in Stanley, ed., Christian Missions and the Enlightenment (Grand Rapids, Mich., 2001), 1-2. Stanley points to David Bosch's Transforming Mission: Paradigm Shifts in Theology of Mission (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1991) as a seminal text for Christian theologians of mission in a postmodern context. 56 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 32. 57 A particularly influential figure for the Comaroffs' reading of the creation of the modern self in Volume 2 is Charles Taylor, whose Sources of the Self is a seminal text for their work. Taylor is of course a Christian Hegelian, whose view of the emergence of the modern self is certainly influenced by Hegelian dialectics, in however inexplicit a fashion.

There are echoes here of the great debates between radical and liberal historians in 1970s and 1980s South Africa, split over the origins of apartheid.58 For the "radical" school, liberalism, in both its ideological and economic sense, contributed to the economic domination that was at the root of apartheid. Radical historians argued that late nineteenth-century British capitalism precipitated and anticipated many features of South African society under apartheid, just as the Comaroffs here blame nine- teenth-century British liberal ideas about such things as money, markets, the individuated self, and the primacy of certain gender roles for the mental prepara- tion of the Tswana for labor oppression. Indeed, in their 2000 article "Millennial Capitalism: First Thoughts on a Second Coming," the Comaroffs explicitly link what they term the "Age of Revolution" (1789-1848) to the current "Age of Millennial Capitalism" with their similar anxieties and ontological challenges.59 This article makes explicit the magical, mystical elements of neoliberalism, and its culturally constrained forms, in contrast to neoliberals' claims to rationality and access to universal truth, just as Of Revelation and Revolution describes culturally constructed views of "modernity" and a "modern" economy. This is very helpful. Nonetheless, I think it would also be useful in Of Revelation and Revolution to be more explicit about actual intellectual debates among and between people: to have more ideology in places and less hegemony. The argument made by many, that early twentieth-century white liberals in practice came to support racist segregationist policies, while in ideological terms liberalism's support of the free market economy and nonviolent political action left it with little space to mobilize opposition to apartheid, all adds up to a trenchant and at least partially justified critique. By leaving out of the picture the intellectual shifts in liberalism (and among the opponents of liberalism) on the ground in the nineteenth century (and implicitly in the twentieth), however, the Comaroffs, like other authors, conflate several ills into one. Disciplinary specialists might want to throw further darts at the Comaroffs' narrative superstructure. Must industrialization and by implication modernity really begin in 1789? This is very French. What might be the impact of the questioning by economists of the linearity and suddenness of industrialization in Britain, which now looks more like an extended messy process than a "revolution" within neat chronological parameters? What difference does it make that the evangelical movement had many roots in seventeenth and eighteenth-century continental pietism? If Protestantism is the necessary condition of capitalism, where does this leave Catholic countries (not least France)? The point I want to close on is, however, that of tragedy. If there is, as I have suggested, an implicit narrative of origins that runs throughout Of Revelation and Revolution and lends the work its moral passion, this is not, for all that, a straightforward linear narrative of beginnings and ends. Rather, it is marked by 58 Christopher Saunders, The Making of the South African Past: Major Historians on Race and Class (Cape Town, 1988), describes the liberal/radical split. 59 Jean Comaroff and John L.

The Nonconformist missionaries who labored so intensely to change the daily lives of Africans in order to induct them into the "modern" economy did not foresee the devastating consequences of that economy for the Tswana peasantry (as might be said of some of the missionaries' modern counterparts, development workers). At the same time, the Comaroffs write as though missionaries inducted the Tswana into the global market and colonized their consciousness in a way that made their engagement more likely. It seems to me just as possible that the global market and related economic coercion came crashing into the lives and consciousness of the Tswana in a way about which they could do little, particularly as their contact was frequently mediated by coercive legislation on the part of the colonial state.60 Missionaries reflected the efforts of other Westerners to moralize the market: to see it as a force for moral good. In this, they shared the ambiguities (and guilty conscience?) of nineteenth-century liberalism. It does not take a great leap of the imagination to find contemporary parallels in the neoliberal discourse, and of course the Comaroffs are right that this putatively universalist creed contains deeply embedded culturally specific assumptions, as did nineteenth-century Anglo- American liberalism itself.61 If nonetheless market expansion is relatively inevita- ble, then is it not appropriate to ask on what terms this expansion might be the most moral? Or is the most appropriate response full-fledged resistance? Must the global marketplace necessarily be bad, on average, for Africa? From a somewhat different point on the ideological spectrum, one might also ask whether in fact Africa is incorporated into the global market on the equal terms supposedly demanded by neoliberal economics. These are clearly issues beyond the scope of this article, but not without historical parallels. In late nineteenth and early twentieth-century terms, the Tswana, it could be argued, were crowded out of an agricultural market in which many were making profits and farming more effectively than whites, in fact, in order to favor white farmers artificially and in order to bolster labor for the mines, again through "artificial" restraints on movement, through the theft of land, through racially targeted taxation, and through coercive legislation. This antici- pated many of the later strategies of apartheid.62 It is not as clear to me as it is to the Comaroffs that the questions some missionaries and Africans were asking about the possibility of a just economy were not the right ones, even if the culturally constrained answers they gave were so obviously, hopelessly wrong. I do not have answers to these questions either-merely some sympathy with the misguided quest for certainty in a rapidly changing, brutal, and deeply uncertain economic universe. 60 This is a point also made by Landau, "Hegemony and History." 61 Uday Mehta, Liberalism and Empire: A Study in Nineteenth-Century British Liberal Thought (Chicago, 1999); Mehta, "Liberal Strategies of Exclusion," in Stoler and Cooper, Tensions of Empire, 59-86. 62 Ted Matsetela, "The Life Story of Mma-Pooe: Aspects of Sharecropping and Proletarianization in the Northern Orange Free State 1890-1930," in Shula Marks and Richard Rathbone, eds., Industrialization and Social Change in South Africa (New York, 1982), 212-37; Charles Van Onselen, The Seed Is Mine: The Life of Kas Maine, a South African Sharecropper, 1894-1985 (Cape Town, 1996). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh I HAVE SUGGESTED THROUGHOUT THIS ESSAY that the Comaroffs present nineteenth- century missionaries as fairly powerful figures, able to effect changes in the consciousness of Tswana interlocutors, despite the resistance of many. In contrast, I see Christianity as important but, with some important exceptions, not necessarily white missionaries themselves. I also suggest that the linkages between political and cultural colonialism are often unclear in Of Revelation and Revolution, and that the role of "cultural colonialism" is overdetermined. If it is possible to guess about such counterfactuals, I suspect that at least some of the missionaries whose work has been scrutinized by the Comaroffs would ironically have preferred the Comaroffs' account of their activities to mine, however doubtless upset they would have been at the implication that their preaching laid the groundwork for the Tswana's entrapment within enslaving capitalist systems. But the Comaroffs do give the missionaries credit for a coherent, rationalizing, globalizing system that taught one universal truth. They also recognize the missionaries' own belief that they might instill into their converts the necessary principles of "civilization" to transform totally their supposedly primitive economies and to move them rapidly up the scale of human development toward settled commercial societies. My own interpretation, while recognizing the tremendous importance of the universalizing project as a mode of domination, calls into question the capacity of Christianity to convey as effectively as it would have liked a message of unifying orthodoxy, or indeed the overall ability of missionaries to accomplish their objectives. From the very beginning of the activity of Christians in Africa, as elsewhere in the world, Christianity was out of control, unorthodox, and an available subject for reinter- pretation in light of the needs of its interlocutors. Ironically, in sum, it is not always wise to take missionaries at their word.

Abstract: It is true, of course, that we have a much harder time postulating an author for
            Adaptation—that is, working out what an “ideal” Kaufman would have wanted the overall effect of his film to be—than postulating an author for the average Hollywood movie. Still, it is surely not the case thatAdaptation“undermines the concept of the author as a unifying origin and legitimation,” as Karen Diehl claims (Karen Diehl, “Once upon an Adaptation: Traces of the Authorial on Film,” inBooks in Motion: Adaptation, Intertextuality, Authorship, ed. Mireia Aragay [Amsterdam, 2005], p. 100). It may be harder to know what Kaufman is up to than what James Cameron (say) is up to, but Kaufman is clearly up tosomething, and the film bears if anything a more powerful stamp of an original vision than that average movie we find easier to read. In fact,Adaptationhas only solidified Kaufman's reputation as a filmmaker with an idiosyncratic and internally consistent way of seeing the world. (Although cinema is a collaborative enterprise, it is reasonable to imagine Spike Jonze and company collectively seeking to realize Kaufman's design.) Far from putting inherited notions of authorship into question, then, it has comfortably positioned Kaufman as the “unifying origin” of his various works.<br>

Abstract: Pablo Wright observes that while I leave behind Geertz’s concept of a cultural system with respect to morality, I retain the Geertzian concern with symbols and meaning. I would not dispute Wright’s statement that meaning is the master concept on a methodological level prior to the substantive issue of evil but would stress that in addition to idiom, code, practice, and symbol, experience must figure into a comprehensive account. Wright’s evocative references to “moral installation in the world” (one might consider terms like investment, suffusion, and tonality, as well as installation) and morality as a “practiced ontology in the micropolitics of social life” deserve further elaboration. Wright endorses a pluralized notion of moralities, but I reiterate that even more important is an adjectival sense of moral rather than the nominal morality. Like Parkin, Wright poses the question of how to reintroduce the ethnographically salient notions of cosmological and radical evil once evil is first construed as a human and intersubjective phenomenon. The answer is to ask how these dimensions come into play in the experiential immediacy of social life, for example, how a cosmological battle between angels and devils is experienced concretely on the human scale. Finally, he suggests that concepts of power from Otto and the shadow from Jung may be alternatives to the notion of evil, though I rejoin that they are just as much in need of critique with respect to Christian overtones. They may be valuable for the study of morality but are not suitable replacements for evil in the sense for which I have argued.<br>

Abstract: This article examines challenges to discourses of curriculum research and practice by the growing fascination with alternative forms of representation. The author takes as a starting point a cluster of exchanges with students that were situated in a study of a classroom in which music and image joined word and number as essential sources for learning about a context irreducibly distant from students' own: the past. In the study, what seemed to make painting, photography, film, and poetry potent sources of understanding was their capacity to bridge the gap between a remote, textbook past, and the sensory world of the students' present; these forms expressed to students not only the outline of events, but also what the events signified and felt like. Yet, in juxtaposing students' comments against discourses of historiography, philosophical aesthetics, and history teaching and learning, one soon recognizes that the very ability of the arts to communicate a sense of immediacy and human intention is what makes them problematic as sources of historical insight: in pushing out the boundaries of "acceptable" forms beyond discursive text, one also pushes up against assumptions about the nature and purposes of knowledge and inquiry. While the starting point of this article is historical inquiry, the author argues that the difficulties of representing experiences of persons in contexts removed in time or space, and of making sense of others' representations, are relevant to other forms of inquiry; the challenge of the arts to historical inquiry is paralleled in other fields, and no less in educational research.<br>

Author(s): Woolf Steph<br>
Abstract: This article is concerned with the ways in which women narrate a move from a 'working-class' position to a position marked (in however fragmentary and complex a way) as 'middle class'. While such a move might be seen in terms of a straightforward escape from a disadvantaged social position, I argue here that what has to be analysed is the pain and the sense of estrangement associated with this class movement. Drawing on the class narratives of a group of seven white British women, the article uses Bourdieu's concepts of symbolic capital and habitus to explore the cultural and symbolic configurations of class. These configurations may be inscribed into the self, so that the self, itself, is class marked. Since working-class selves are frequently marked in pathological terms, this raises particular difficulties for the idea of an 'escape' from such a position. Class in this sense is embedded in people's history and so cannot be so easily 'escaped'. The usual conventions of life-narratives - in which the self remains the same entity from birth to death and later events are a culmination of earlier ones - are also disrupted in this case. But if a working-class position is marked as pathological, so too is taking on the markers of middle-class existence. to do so is not only to risk 'getting it wrong', but it is also to risk the scorn attached to 'pretentiousness'. There is a particular jeopardy here for women, since it is women who have been especially associated with desires for artefacts associated with bourgeois existence. The article argues for a focus for classed desires and class envy, not in pathological terms, but in terms of a coherent response to political and social exclusions.<br>

Abstract: Drawing from research conducted on the personal, cultural, and moral significance of pain on the island of Yap (Waqab), Federated States of Micronesia, I argue in this article that one possible root to reincorporating empathy within the context of contemporary culture theory is to uncover the cultural and phenomenological ways that understandings of empathy and what constitutes authentic empathetic acts are shaped. After briefly examining foundational philosophical definitions of empathy, the article advances a number of differing cultural phenomenological orientations implicated in the experience and expression of empathy. These orientations are understood to help to foreground the place of empathy in what may otherwise be viewed as a general reluctance to engage in empathetic attunement in Yapese society.<br>

Abstract: Caryl Phillips's narrative is painfully concerned with the relationship of Empire, Colony, and the In-between; Europe, Africa, and the Caribbean; slavery, rebellion, and freedom; Men, women and children; absent or useless fathers and damaged, aimless sons. It explores what hold in common while never losing sight of the painful quotidian, the specific. It is a narrative where the picaresque shakes hands with the epic and the linearity is broken, encircled, and put fast forward or in reverse by a mise-en-abîme of sorts: the tale-within-the-tale-within-the-tale even if interrupted by the tapestry of an emergent voice that finally proposes itself as both the identity and the difference of its verbal universe. "Enter your own self and discover the world," Phillips seems to be saying, "but also go out into the world and discover yourself." Once that call is answered, fiction itself becomes another way of questioning truth as we strive for it through the paradox of a lie. That lie can be called the imagination. It can also be seen as a parallel reality. For it may be observed as a critical mirror of what passes for the truth in the world of convention. It certainly sets up a second universe of being, where the narrator, say Cambridge in Cambridge, has a reality greater, though no less important, than the host of hastily met and then forgotten people we deal with on a daily basis. It is in this sense that Phillips brings into light another way of telling in that his narrative gives weight and presence to the virtues and vices—the fugitive personalities—of our daily acquaintance. This is the prerogative of his style, which I try to discuss in this essay. It has the power to render disenchantment and pleasure without resolving the contradiction between them. In fact, what holds them in tension, as equal forces straining in opposite directions, is the artist's mature subjectivity, stripped of hubris, unashamed either of its fallibility or of the modest assurance it has gained as a result of being out of place and not quite right.<br>

Abstract: After 1814, the French looked to parallels in the past to explain the causes of contemporary events. For them historical time was doubled, understood through analogies. Signaling multiple times, easily accomplished in historiographic narratives, posed a challenge to historical painters. Delaroche utilized innovative approaches to representing time in his works, which were praised by contemporary historians and art critics as visual parallels to modern historical literature. In this essay I argue that Delaroche's repeated visual quotation of works from the Bowyer Historic Gallery enabled him to represent a doubled moment in his historical paintings. I examine his approach to temporality in Jane Grey (1834), Assassination of the duc de Guise (1834), a suite of watercolors (c.1825) on an episode in Rousseau's Confessions (1782), and Cromwell (1831). The latter was one of several works by Delaroche inspired by Chateaubriand's Les Quatre Stuarts (1828), an insistently multi-temporal text which compared Stuarts and Bourbons, written to ensure the stability of the newly restored Bourbon dynasty.<br>

Abstract: Rav H̱isday Crescas (1340-1410/11), Rabbi of Aragonese Jewry in Christian Spain and a major figure in medieval Jewish philosophy, is unique in positing an all-embracing thesis of Love. This thesis permeates his theories of cosmogony, metaphysics and theology and generates far-reaching didactic implications. This article examines Crescas' rather bold description of Love as a positive Divine attribute, an anthropopathism meant to convey ontological meaning about the Divine Nature via an analogous construct. Themes such as Infinite Goodness, Joy and Kindness enable Rav H̱isday to structure a new conception of the Creator and Providence. After postulating Divine Love as the Cosmic Force sustaining creation, Crescas explains the purpose of Torah and mitzvot in terms of evoking love for God thus drawing the soul to link up to the Divine Overflow of Love. Even spiritual existence after death is explicated in terms of the soul's love for its Divine Source. To understand Crescas' unique theory of Love, we compare it with the views of his predecessors and analyze his use of philosophic sources such as the 5th century BCE pre-Socratic scientist-mystic Empedocles. We examine educational aspects of Crescas' teachings on love and view them in context of the mass conversions to Christianity resulting from the 1391 riots. Finally, Crescas' ideas are read as pedagogical messages relevant to both Jews and conversos in the twenty traumatic years after 1391 when he served as chief rabbi and political leader in Saragossa.<br>

Abstract: Through the analysis of a major religious painting by Botticelli, this article builds on important recent work on Botticelli's sacred art to explore apparent responses on the part of an especially sophisticated artist to the gathering atmosphere of crisis in the city's political and religious life. The artist uses various devices of connection or separation between the viewer/worshiper and the holy image; these devices are not unique to the painting, but their combination is exceptional. First, Botticelli uses a hieratic gold ground to distinguish a scene set in heaven, the coronation of the Virgin, from a more earthly zone; here recent scruples about the representation of transcendence seem to be in play. Second, the figures beneath, four major saints, embody different ways of addressing the viewer and mediating between him/her and the heavenly event. Third, the latter appears to be treated as an apsidal image within an implied architectural setting, in other words, as a representation of a representation. By establishing modes of mediation, then, Botticelli confronts issues emerging as central to the representation of the sacred, in part on the basis of a critical understanding of Albertian picture theory.<br>

Abstract: I begin with the hypothesis that Jacques Derrida's Memoirs of the Blind: The Self-Portrait and Other Ruins is in a way the illustration of Speech and Phenomena and therefore Derrida's critique of phenomenology, intuition, perception, and seeing. I also want to show in this regard parallels with both Husserl and Kant. I emphasize that what is at issue in Memoirs of the Blind is art, visual arts; and in the great thematic richness of this text, I note the high points as well as the low points concerning the arts of the "visible." The fundamental question is: Does Derrida "see" the drawing, the painting, and indeed listen to the music?<br>

Abstract: Because they escape precise modal qualification, Troost suggests that insight into disposi-
tions can only be gained in an idea-ruled (idee-matig) understanding, in an idea-regulated 'on
the way' in the transcendental direction of time. For reformational philosophy this raises an
old and prima facie purely theoretical problem: Do the modalities 'continue' right into the
heart? One could paraphrase Troost's view for example such that for him the heart should
primarily be sought 'below' or 'behind' the act structure, and that the dispositions — relative
to this vertical axis — constitute a horizontal layer in which the lower substructures are
interwoven with the act structure. In that case the integration of the lower structures in the act
structure would take place via the dispositions rather than through a direct relationship with
the heart. This notion — for which hints can be found in Dooyeweerd — would in any case
lead to an appreciably more nuanced picture of the 'binding' and 'releasing' of substructures.
If I understand Troost correctly, he would allow this interpretation for the substructures,
though not for the modalities. His caution concerning the 'continuing' of the modalities 'into
the' heart is epistemological: the cosmological concentration of the modal functions in the
heart is a transcendental idea; at best we see dots (the idea-regulated 'on the way' in the
transcendental direction of time), but we should not turn them into lines.<br>

Abstract: Afrikaans writers have often found themselves in a marginal position. During the time of apartheid, they vehemently criticised racial discrimination, thus dissociating themselves from the centre of power. After the demise of apartheid, Afrikaans writers were marginalised in a different way, when the Afrikaans language lost its previous dominant position and truly became a minority language. They were then forced to reexamine their past and reinterpret their present. In this article, recent Afrikaans writers' radical reinvention of the ideological significance of the Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902) is discussed. One novel about the War, Ingrid Winterbach's Niggie ("Cousin") is analysed in detail as an example of the search for meaning from a marginal position. The novel has a special relevance for Afrikaners in their painful adaptation to a new South Africa, but it is also linked to general themes like trauma, despair and hope.<br>

Abstract: This article explores how Gayl Jones's "Corregidora" constructs, through the journey of its main protagonist Ursa Corregidora, a viable model for dealing with the painful legacy of slavery, oppression and haunting by the past. The process of self-redefinition in which Ursa engages is based on the reconfiguration of family and sexuality and the hybridization of her relationship to individual as well as collective narratives. After probing Ursa's complex psychological journey, the article examines the main elements mediating the reinscription of her life narrative into a broader context of métissage involving sexual and historical resistance, anchored in the story of Palmares as a Brazilian maroon community (quilombo). Finally, the article analyzes the implications and resonances of this model of revision/reclamation for Gayl Jones and her theorization of the interconnectedness of struggles against oppression in Brazil and the United States.<br>

Abstract: The interdependence of language and culture highlights the need to find methods for second language students to acquire cultural information and practices. This article reviews definitions of culture posited by anthropologists and language educators and discusses problems related to the recent paradigm shift from "small 'c' and big 'C'" as classifications for culture to the three 'P's of products, practices, and perspectives proposed by the Standards for Foreign Language Learning in the 21st Century (National Standards 2006). Drawing from Kramsch's (1993) postulate of real culture (C1) versus perceived culture (C1'), the current study solicited responses to a questionnaire regarding the practices of Spaniards from two age groups (young and mature) and American students involved in a study abroad program in Spain. Data analyses reveal that perceptions of American Students most closely align with those of Young Spaniards. Implications point to the need for intervention and instruction to provide students with a broader perspective of Spain's cultural practices.<br>

Abstract: This essay examines the correspondence between Beckett and Duthuit in the light of the unpublished notes that Beckett took in Germany in 1936-37. The underlying issue that Beckett's reflections on the image seems to address is the reorientation of his creative writing and the development of a new aesthetic. There is, when Beckett is confronted to an image, a double movement that can be discerned in the way he beholds the image, of fascination, first, but also of mistrust towards this painting. In stripping paintings of their narrative of figurative intention, Beckett's comments seem to aim at a situation of mankind in the world, apprehended outside of all preoccupations with its causes or as the effect of an absent cause. Cette contribution examine la correspondance entre Beckett et Duthuit et cherche à la mettre en perspective avec les notes inédites que Beckett prend en Allemagne (1936-37). L'enjeu indirect des réflexions de Beckett sur le problème de l'image, c'est la réorientation de son écriture, le développement d'une esthétique nouvelle. Il y a chez Beckett un double mouvement, de fascination, mais aussi de méfiance, face à l'image. En dépouillant ces peintures de leur charge narrative ou figurative, les commentaires de Beckett semblent viser une situation de l'homme, appréhendée en dehors de toute cause ou comme l'effet d'une cause absente.<br>

Abstract: The present essay examines the ideological implications of Luis Cernuda's "Ninfa y pastor por Ticiano." In the Poem Cernuda uses ekphrasis as a springboard for the exploration of creative desire, transforming Titian's painting into an erotic generator of creativity. The erotic center of the painting—the nymph's form—becomes a mirror in whose light are reflected and merged the speaker's, Titian's, and the reader's creative desires. Starting from a position of radical dissent, the poem critiques canonical visual values with respect to the viewing subject, moral values as expressed and represented by the Christian story of man/woman's creation, and, more widely, by producing a deviation of readerly desire, it critiques the traditional codes of control and power relations in which we are immersed.<br>

de vecindad, por las que un alicantino que resida en Alicante, por ejemplo, tiene francamen-

Abstract: While the Dialectic of Enlightenment (1944; 1947) is often judged to be too limited a cultural critique, it is still widely accepted as pioneering cultural criticism, a mix of critical discourse analysis, hermeneutics, and semiotics. This article contests this reputation by turning to a source that Horkheimer and Adorno are at pains to occlude: Ernst Cassirer's Philosophy of Symbolic Forms (1923-29). Drawing on the tradition of eighteenth-century German Christology revived by the Young Hegelians in general and F.W.J. Schelling in particular, Cassirer evolves a critical strategy broader than that in the Dialectic, yet clearly implied by it. Most particularly, Cassirer's Schelling analysis discriminates philosophy, art, and religion as forms of knowledge and forms of epistemological critique, where Horkheimer and Adorno recast the art of the Bildungsbürger to occlude Cassirer's innovation, a new materialist semiotics that offers cultural critique in the broader terms that the Dialectic's critics would favor.<br>

Abstract: Borges's appropriations of literary theory are mischievous, undermining the grand, universalizing claims of theory. His strategies are clearly exemplified in "La busca de Averroes," which shows not only Averroes's difficulties in explicating Aristotle's Poetics but also Borges's own difficulties in depicting Averroes in his otherness in twelfth-century Islamic Spain. Ultimately the story is a parable of the impossibility of theory, a swerve from the general to the particular.<br>

Abstract: In this article, I seek to make an intervention in debates between psychological and postmodern anthropology by engaging with the theme of border crossing. I argue that the theme of the border is one that fundamentally instantiates a separation between interior and exterior with respect to subjectivity, itself a fundamental transformation and a painful and difficult border. This is related to a Cartesian distinction critiqued in this article. How the distinction between interior and exterior may be transcended is discussed in relation to examples of transformation from the crossing of class borders to the production and regulation of workers in a globalized and neoliberal economy. I begin with reference to postwar transformations of class with its anxious borders and go on to think about changes in the labor market and how these demand huge transformations that tear apart communities, destroy work-places, and sunder the sense of safety and stability that those gave. Advanced liberalism or neoliberalism brings with it a speeding up of the transformations of liberalism in which subjects are constantly invoked as self-contained, with a transportable self that must be produced through the developmental processes of personality and rationality. This self must be carried like a snail carries a shell. It must be coherent yet mutable, fixed yet multiple and flexible. But this view of the subject covers over the many connections that make subjectivity possible. I conclude by asking what it would mean to rethink this issue of the production of safe spaces beyond an essentialist psychological conception of only one mother-child space, separated from the social world, as having the power to produce feelings of safety? I end the article with an argument for a relational approach to subjectivity and sociality.<br>

Abstract: The collection of essays under review is the most innovative attempt thus far to expain the decline of fertility in Europe. Of particular interest is the frequent mention of culture as a prominent factor in such explanations. The review suggests that while this collection is significant in higlighting its importance, bringing culture into population history may require a rethinking of the metanarratives and metaphors in which that history is cast.<br>

Abstract: A comparison of Giuseppe Bagetti's landscape sketches, watercolours, oil paintings and engravings with contemporary maps and the existing landscape reveals that in the creation of Bagetti's landscapes, narrative played a role that differed in cartographic and artistic representations. The comparison also demonstrates that his images were powerful constructions that were more successful in reflecting a narrative of glorious conquest than was possible through cartography. This paper offers a critical examination of Bagetti's representations of Napoleon's northern Italian campaign, which he sketched and painted between 1802 and 1809. Bagetti's paintings were neither pacifist nor an expression of Piedmontese patriotism but instead were inspired by, and constructed according to, a narrative about the conquest that reflected the views of the French authorities. The narrative found expression in formal written instructions from the central cartographical office in the Dépôt de la guerre, Paris, in verbal and written instructions from Bagetti's immediate superior, Jean François Martinel, and in letters personally addressed to Bagetti from the officer commanding the Dépôt. It is clear from a careful reading of the correspondence and from a comparison of Bagetti's paintings with both the present landscape and maps made at the time that Bagetti's disputes with his supervisors revolved around protecting his artistic integrity and reputation rather than resisting the authority of a foreign regime. /// Une comparaison entre les dessins, aquarelles, peintures et gravures de paysages de Giuseppe Bagetti avec des cartes de son temps et les paysages actuels révèle que dans la création des paysages de Bagetti le récit ne joue pas le même rôle que dans les représentations cartographiques et artistiques. La comparaison démontre également que ses images étaient des constructions puissantes qui reflétaient l'histoire d'une conquête victorieuse plus efficacement que la cartographie ne le permettait. Cet article propose un examen critique des représentations des campagnes napoléoniennes en Italie du Nord, dessinées ou peintes par Bagetti entre 1802 et 1809. Les peintures de Bagetti n'étaient ni pacifistes, ni représentatives d'un patriotisme piémontais, mais au contraire inspirées par un récit de la conquête qui reflétait les vues des autorités françaises et construites selon celui-ci. Ce récit se trouvait exprimé dans les instructions écrites de l'office central de cartographie du Dépôt de la Guerre à Paris, dans les instructions verbales et écrites du supérieur direct de Bagetti, Jean-François Martinel, et dans les lettres adressées à Bagetti en personne par l'officier qui dirigeait le Dépôt. Il est clair, si on lit attentivement la correspondance et si l'on compare les peintures de Bagetti avec le paysage actuel et les cartes faites à l'époque, que les discussions entre Bagetti et ses chefs tournaient autour de la préservation de son intégrité et de sa réputation artistique plutôt que de sa résistance à l'autorité d'un régime étranger. /// Ein Vergleich von Giuseppe Bagettis Landschaftsskizzen, Aquarellen, Ölbildern und Druckgraphiken mit zeitgenössischen Karten und der erhaltenen realen Landschaft zeigt, dass bei der Entstehung von Bagettis Landschaftsdarstellungen eine Variante der Ereignisgeschichte eine Rolle spielte, die in seinem Werk zu anderen Ergebnissen führte als bei kartographischen und anderen künstlerischen Darstellungen. Die Vergleiche zeigen auch, dass dabei aussagestarke Bilder entstanden, die die Geschichte der erfolgreichen Eroberungen besser transportierten als es mit den Mitteln der Kartographie möglich war. In diesem Beitrag werden Bagettis Darstellungen der Oberitalienischen Feldzüge Napoleons, die er zwischen 1802 und 1809 anfertigte, kritisch gewürdigt. Seine Darstellungen waren weder pazifistisch noch Ausdruck eines Piemontesischen Patriotismus, sondern Bagetti folgte bei der Konzeption seiner Landschaftsdarstellungen der von offizieller französischer Seite bevorzugten Sichtweise der Geschichte der Eroberungen. Seine Grundlagen bildeten formelle schriftliche Instruktionen der zentralen kartographischen Einrichtung, des Dépôt de la guerre in Paris, sowie mündliche und schriftliche Anweisungen durch Bagettis unmittelbaren Vorgesetzten, Jean François Martinel. Darüber hinaus erhielt er Briefe, die vom Kommandanten des Dépôt de la guerre an ihn persönlich gerichtet waren. Bei sorgfältiger Auswertung dieser Korrespondenz und dem Vergleich seiner Gemälde mit der erhaltenen realen Landschaft und den zeitgenössischen Karten wird deutlich, dass es bei Bagettis Auseinandersetzungen mit seinen Vorgesetzten mehr um Fragen seiner künstlerischen Integrität und Reputation ging als um den Widerstand gegen die Autorität eines fremden Regimes. /// Una comparación de los bocetos de paisajes, aguadas, óleos y grabados de Giuseppe Bagetti con mapas contemporáneos y con el paisaje existente, revela que en la creación paisajística de Bagetti la narrativa jugó un papel diferente de las representaciones cartográficas y artísticas. La comparación también demuestra que sus imágenes eran poderosas construcciones que reflejaban una narrativa de famosas conquistas de manera más acertada de lo que era posible a través de la cartografía. Este artículo ofrece un examen crítico de las representaciones de las campañas napoleónicas en el norte de Italia, que Bagetti dibujó y pintó entre 1802 y 1809. Las pinturas de Bagetti no fueron ni pacifistas ni una expresión del patriotismo piamontés, sino que fueron inspiradas y construidas de acuerdo a una narrativa sobre la conquista que reflejaba el punto de vista de las autoridades francesas. La narrativa encontró su expresión en instrucciones formales escritas desde el centro cartográfico del Dépôt de la Guerre en Paris, en instrucciones verbales y escritas del inmediato superior de Bagetti, Jean François Martinel y en cartas personales dirigidas a Bagetti por el oficial que mandaba el Dépôt. Queda claro, a través de una cuidadosa lectura de la correspondencia y de la comparación de las pinturas de Bagetti con el paisaje actual y con los mapas de su tiempo, que las disputas de Bagetti con su supervisor se centraban en proteger su integridad artística y su reputación más que en resistirse a la autoridad de un régimen extranjero.<br>

Abstract: This review explores the most significant dimensions and findings of phenomenological approaches in anthropology. We spell out the motives and implications inherent in such approaches, chronicle their historical dimensions and precursors, and address the ways in which they have contributed to analytic perspectives employed in anthropology. This article canvasses phenomenologically oriented research in anthropology on a number of topics, including political relations and violence; language and discourse; neurophenomenology; emotion; embodiment and bodiliness; illness and healing; pain and suffering; aging, dying, and death; sensory perception and experience; subjectivity; intersubjectivity and sociality; empathy; morality; religious experience; art, aesthetics, and creativity; narrative and storytelling; time and temporality; and senses of place. We examine, and propose salient responses to, the main critiques of phenomenological approaches in anthropology, and we also take note of some of the most pressing and generative avenues of research and thought in phenomenologically oriented anthropology.<br>

Abstract: This article seeks to address how Lebanese youth are dealing with the legacy of civil war (1975-90), given the national backdrop of official silence, persisting injustice, and competing memory discourses. Drawing on Marianne Hirsch's concept of postmemory, it explores the memory of a generation of Lebanese who have grown up dominated not by traumatic events but by narrative accounts of events that preceded their birth. This residual form of memory carries and connects with the pain of others, suffusing temporal frames and liminal positions. The article examines how postmemory is mediated and transformed through the mnemonic lenses of visual landscapes and oral narratives. Consideration is given to the dynamic production of "memoryscapes"—memories of violence localized in particular sites—and to narrative constructions of the past implicated in the ongoing search for meaning, historical truth, and identity. This article seeks to challenge pervasive notions of Lebanese postwar amnesia and of a generational detachment from the residual effects and future implications of war recollections.<br>

Abstract: As oral historians, we devote a great deal of time to painstakingly designing our projects, cognizant of the fact that our research requires us to interact with human beings in often intimate ways. For this same reason, though, our careful methodology and meticulously designed projects are constantly being tested. This article is a reflection on some of the ethical and methodological challenges that the authors faced during their life story interviews with Holocaust survivors in Montreal, Canada. In particular, it explores three major themes: the elaborate process of learning to "share authority" and build trust with interviewees; the limitations of "deep listening" and their implications; and the struggle to deal with contentious politics, such as perceived racism, that emerged out of some interviews. Reflection on these methodological and ethical challenges not only opens up a wider and important discussion among researchers about how practice relates to theory but also teaches us about our interviewees. For example, what does an interviewee's refusal to engage deeply about his or her past tell us about how they formed their identity in the aftermath of mass violence? Challenges, such as this one, are part of the story. They shed light on questions of narrative formation, the identity politics that result from survival, and how individual memory interacts with dominant narratives about atrocity. They force us to recognize that both our interviewees—and ourselves—are human beings, and not just collections of stories.<br>

Abstract: This paper attempts to compare two lives, that of Ramana Maharshi, the beloved cereberal sage of South India, and Sigmund Freud, the founding father of psychoanalysis. Much has been written on both these individuals, so what this paper does is to focus on affliction as a source of insight about life, detachment, pain, existentialism and coping. By taking narratives which delineate a historical plane on which illness can be coded, I try to understand the anthromorphic nature of suffering and its consequences in these two great lives. Individuals reflect the culture of which they are a part, so what we receive through the narratives which tell us about them is significant in terms of their similarities and their differences. Who authors narratives which we analyse is of utmost significance, and both feminism and narrative analyses looks at social anthropology as benefiting from the question of the writing subject. The Nirvana principle works in Ramana Maharshi's case to create a comfort zone for helping us to think of death as dream, in Freud it works as a comfort zone to cope with existence. Human beings work with ideas in order to evaluate the nature of life and survival, or with death as an attribute which too is natural and part of the order of reality. Paul Ricoeur's work helps me to build a bridge between the two thinkers, Ramana Maharshi and Freud, in terms of the application of the concepts of Eros, Thanatos and Ananke.<br>

Abstract: Can fixed images tell a story; do autonomous visual stories exist? In order to answer this question, two categories of narrative images are considered: series like tapestries, which constitute together one narration, and on the other hand single paintings. Historical paintings representing a collectivity can suggest temporal evolution (like Poussin's Manna in the Desert) while those which represent one central hero must choose the "pregnant moment" of peripeteia (like Rembrandt's The Feast of Balthazar). The conclusion is that autonomous visual stories cannot be developed alongside existing verbal (literary) stories.<br>

Abstract: Several debates arose in the nineteenth century on the status of women in India in the context of determining an appropriate colonial policy on such matters as "sati" which were seen to mark the depressed position of women in society. The reform of these practices was held to be part of the regenerating mission of colonisation. The most sensational and the first of these debates concerned the outlawing of "sati". The literature on "sati" (and on social reform) of the period has largely adopted the framework of modernisation theory. The paper argues that the characterisation of the official debate as one between 'preservationists' and impatient westerners obscures a number of important issues. For instance, rather than argue for the outlawing of "sati" as a cruel and barbarous act, officials in favour of abolition were at pains to illustrate that the abolition would be consonant with the principle of upholding tradition. By treating the debates on "sati" as a discourse and examining its production the article contests the conclusions on "sati" drawn by colonial officials.<br>

Abstract: Pour expliquer le suicide des agriculteurs, les médias se limitent généralement au seul facteur économique. Une approche comprehensive de cette question révèle d'autres conditions objectives de production de ce qu'on peut appeler la « souffrance sociale ». Le déséquilibre structurel entre l'organisation prescrite et l'organisation réelle du travail génère chez les agriculteurs un sentiment de pénibilité mentale. Tenus de répondre à des impératifs d'autonomie et de réalisation de soi, ces derniers ne disposent pas tous des mêmes ressources sociales pour parvenir à une image positive d'eux-mêmes. Pour se développer, la souffrance suicidaire s'appuie en effet sur la distribution inégale du capital économique, culturel et d'autochtonie. When explaining suicide among farmers, the media tend to focus exclusively on economic factors. This paper argues that adopting a more comprehensive approach to the issue highlights other conditions of production of what might be termed "social suffering". It is suggested that the structural imbalance between the prescribed and actual organization of work causes mental pain among farmers. The paper argues that amid increasing pressure to demonstrate greater autonomy and self-realization, farmers may not have the same social resources for developing a positive self-image. Research shows that an unequal distribution of economic and cultural capital and capital of autochtony leads to increased suicidal thoughts.<br>

Abstract: Contemporary rural anthropology, both applied and ethnographic, often takes place in situations of extreme political and class conflict. Despite recent debates over reflexivity and ethics generally in such studies, the methodological problems of doing fieldwork under conditions of class conflict rarely figure into the debate; this is particularly true of southern Europe. These problems are at once personal, moral, epistemological, and methodological. This paper describes one fieldworker's efforts to maintain scholarly neutrality in an agro-town in Franco Spain where class conflict was severe. The implications of this experience for critical anthropology and for applied anthropology are discussed.<br>

Abstract: Drawing on the theoretical insights of Paul Ricoeur this paper investigates the geographies of public remembrance in a post-conflict society. In Northern Ireland, where political divisions have found expression through acts of extreme violence over the past 30 years, questions of memory and an amnesty for forgetting have particular resonance both at the individual and societal level, and render Ricoeur's framework particularly prescient. Since the signing of the Belfast Agreement in 1998, initiating the Peace Process through consociational structures, discovering a nomenclature and set of practices which would aid in the rapprochement of a deeply divided society has presented a complex array of issues. In this paper I examine the various practices of public remembrance of the 1998 bombing of Omagh as a means of understanding how memory-spaces evolve in a post-conflict context. In Omagh there were a variety of commemorative practices instituted and each, in turn, adopted a different contour towards achieving reconciliation with the violence and grief of the bombing. In particular the Garden of Light project is analysed as a collective monument which, with light as its metaphysical centre, invited the populace to reflect backward on the pain of the bombing while at the same time enabling the society to look forward toward a peaceful future where a politics of hope might eclipse a politics of despair.<br>

Abstract: Historiography in Francoist Spain (1939-75) sought to affirm the morally and historically correct role of the regime within the flow of Spanish history. As an important vehicle of dissidence, the novel of memory stands in sharp contrast to Francoist history: it explores the past largely eschewed or appropriated by the regime and contests the so-called truths that Franco shaped through the discourse of myth. This essay examines the role of subjective memory as a challenge to historiography and discloses the narrative strategies novelists used to counter the government's myths. Unlike Francoist historiography, the novel of memory lays out history as a series of disruptions and undermines the referential illusion of truth and wholeness in our understanding of the past.<br>

Abstract: In this article, I use Obeyesekere's concept of the work of culture to examine a case of magical poisoning among the Toraja (South Sulawesi, Indonesia). I argue that episodes of suffering must be situated not only culturally but also within the context of the individual sufferer's life experience, and suggest that we must consider carefully why only certain symbolic transformations of painful emotions may "work" for a given individual, why a symbolic transformation that "works" for one person may not for another, and why even apparently successful transformations of suffering may bring only temporary relief.

Abstract: This article focuses on the last two novels by Adolfo Couve, La comedia del arte (1996) and Cuando pienso en mi falta de cabeza (La segunda comedia), posthumously published in 2000. The article proposes an allegorical reading of the transformation of the painter Camondo into a wax statue, the protagonist of both novels who later loses his mind. The article argues that the loss of the mind allegorizes a quotidian time, in tune with Couve's world, which spins and repeats itself, closed, without a horizon, a “beheaded” time (lacking future). This allows the possibility to build a coherent sense of a series of narrative forms (which include language, space, time, characters) and that, taken as a whole, show the particular way in which Couve's narrative is built and developed.<br>

Abstract: This study presents an interpretation of the configuration of the poetic subject in the books of poems El Primer Libro (1985) and Albricia (1988) by Soledad Fariña (1943), which understand a self in a continuous process of gestation and birth. This process serves the purpose of recomposing a disarticulated subjectivity lost in the framework of the political and cultural conditions imposed by the military dictatorship that ruled Chile in the 1970s and 1980s. By using a metaphor of a journey and searching for a new language, the subject attempts to access a primitive stage andfind its maternal self in order to confront the dominant power, by codifying and configuring herself through an otherness in a feminine body-text. However, this process of maturation and discovery is intervened and left incomplete by the impulse of modernity, thereby creating a deformed, dissociated and off-centered self, which aims at growing opposed to logos. This conflict turns the upcoming of the new self into a painful event, like giving birth, that stems from the subject's wounded and fractured body, intending to re-establish de selffrom its fragments, traces and memories.<br>

Abstract: This article treats Mexican
         retablos(devotional paintings) in relation to people's actions. Retablos serve as a basis for seeing, talking about, and interpreting events born from oppressive, modern conditions. Actions and artful representation indicate, respectively, proximity to reality, from near to far—a difference that outlines a space for aesthetic production. I argue that retablos contribute to an aesthetic that orients the senses and the mind against oppressive conditions and toward a positive vision of what the world might be.<br>

Abstract: The combinatory and ludic polyculturalism, the parodic transmutation of meanings and values, the open, multilingual hybridization [which] are the devices responsible for the constant feeding and refeeding of this “baroquizing” almagest: the carnivalized transencyclopedia of the new barbarians, where everything can coexist with everything. They are the machinery that crushes the material of tradition, like the teeth of a tropical sugarmill, transforming stalks and husks into bagasse and juicy syrup.

Abstract: Fitzgerald's nostalgic style, though, set an example of how a nostalgic narrative could be structured, and in its aftermath it was used by such different authors as Evelyn Waugh in
      Brideshead Revisited(1945), Anthony Burgess inA Clockwork Orange(1962) and the works of Kazuo Ishiguro. The author's own later work employs it as well. The technique of using the reader's textual memory in order to evoke a phenomenological nostalgic experience is very evident in both versions ofTender Is the Night(the 1934 original, and Malcolm Cowley's 1951 restructuring). In the 1951 version, the structure of the narrative closely follows the pattern of happiness and reflection. An early description of a Swiss valley communicates an awe of life and nature: “The sun swam out into a blue sea of sky and suddenly it was a Swiss valley at its best—pleasant sounds and murmurs and a good fresh smell of health and cheer” (9). In the transitory third book, “Casualties: 1925,” the tone has changed from appreciative to melancholic, as in this description of the small town of Amiens: “In the day-time one is deflated by such towns, with their little trolley cars of twenty years ago crossing the great grey cobble-stoned squares in front of the cathedral, and the very weather seems to have a quality of the past, faded weather like that of old photographs” (138). At the end of the novel both Dick and Nicole Diver become obsessed with youth and the past as well as with time: “for Nicole the years slipped away by clock and calendar and birthday, with the added poignance of her perishable beauty” (228). Toward the end of the novel, Nicole's last sight of Dick—“her eyes followed his figure until it became a dot and mingled with the other dots in the summer crowd” (386)—forces the reader to reflect in a reversed movement. Instead of vanishing like Dick, this image suggests a backward recollection of what was a Swiss valley “at its best.”<br>

Abstract: Even in her familial tone, and perhaps because of it, Jabbeh Wesley never forgets that the healing and meaning-making function of grief and mourning, as painful as grief and mourning are, is not to be avoided. Rather, as DuBose argues, based on the painful experience of his wife's miscarriage, as “‘child’ and ‘parent’ disappeared, our bodies and our society
      dys-appeared, and our connections and hopes re-appeared” (374). Jabbeh Wesley attaches the reappearance of the hopes for the healing and reconstruction of her Liberian world to people's ability and willingness to truly experience the painful process of grief and, perhaps informed by that cathartic experience, allow compassion and empathy to guide their relationship to others.<br>

Abstract: Some time ago, Paul Ricoeur pointed out that “the symbol gives rise to thought.”
      
               These diasporic religious communities enable us to find a new beginning for thought that has the possibility of avoiding the exclusivity and elitism that has too often accompanied the objective meaning of thought as a science of the rational. Not only these diasporic religions, but also the very conundrum of the continent of Africa as a whole, to echo Skinner at the beginning of our paper, may serve in the same manner as one of the most important ways that thought might be renewed—and the relationship of thought to action and performance.38<br>

Abstract: Our plight, then, is not simply that we are all in the same boat, let alone on the same ocean. Yet we are still bound by the responsbility of inhabiting the same planet. What would it mean, then, to share the earth with all its inhabitants, not just in terms of occupying the same planet but also in terms of caring and looking after each other in the anachronistic sense of the word
   dutyas plight? Can we risk pledging to solemnly avow our own investments in the very things we so self-rightousely protest against, not in order to stop protesting in the name of justice but, rather, in the hopes of turning the killing machine back against itself and taking another step toward “hunting down” and abolishing death penalities wherever they may be hiding, even in our own disowned fears and desires?<br>

Abstract: The point here is that whoever I am in terms of my personal identity and my capacity or incapacity to identify myself through sortal terms as a being in the world with others, I will have no doubt who is in pain or who will have the pain. Here, again, is a sense of “I” in which I can be aware of myself and refer to myself without it being necessary to employ any nonindexical or third-personal referents.<br>

Abstract: We at SPEP have never been modern and have made a good living off the critique of modernism and of its binary oppositions. But I think that the business as usual of Continental philosophy will have to be expanded to include a critique of the opposition of the human and the nonhuman, of
            physisandtechne, and of “Continental philosophy” and “science.” For the truth is that we have been a party to the science wars. That is why I think that the work of Catherine Malabou is exactly the sort of work that SPEP and Continental philosophy generally will have to do in the future.
                  We have yet to admit how deeply inscribed the human is in the nonhuman and the technical. We have yet to appreciate that being-in-the-world is not only historicized, gendered, and incarnate but also both a neural and a galactic event, of both microscopic and macroscopic proportions. Can it be of no interest to “philosophy,” can there be nothing to “wonder” about, that our bodies are literally made of stardust? We have yet to realize how deeply interwoven is the imagination of speculative physics with the wonder of the philosophers. If the best we can do is to protect our turf by saying that science does not think, the sciences will steal our thunder, that is, our wonder, right out from under us. Science does think, and science wonders, because wonder is the piety of thought. That is a matter to which SPEP, and Continental philosophers generally, whether they have taken a theological turn or are running in the opposite direction, should give more thought.36

Abstract: For, if phenomenology renounces its search for the absolute and for foundations, then it must give up seeing itself as a single and self-contained discourse. The minimal phenomenologist renounces monolinguism and is no longer the master of only one discourse. Instead, he or she must practice a mixed discourse. To do this is to practice diglossia, to become a code-switcher. In its ordinary sense, the practice of code-switching refers to the passage from one language or dialect to another one in the course of a single conversation, for instance, when the conversation moves from an informal to a formal setting or when it moves from one topic to another. But in the phenomenological context, this would involve the ability to shift from a phenomenological discourse to its “others,” whether they might be Freudian energetics, Deleuzian aspects, Badiouan events, and so on. This practice of translation or code-switching has perhaps always been the role of the phenomenologist, if it is accepted that phenomenological reflection does not begin from itself but is nourished by a life that precedes it and gives rise to it.<br>

Abstract: Moreover, for Shaw and Ricoeur, imaginative works of art have the power to project alternative and potentially redemptive ways of living together harmoniously, which in turn can substantially change hearts, alter beliefs, and reorient behavior in an empathetic direction that promotes vigilant concern for the other. Be they biblical narratives, plays for the stage, fictions for the page, or other forms of literary texts broadly construed, stories can portray freedom and fault reconciled in compassionate beings committed to advancing the common good. In this way, poetic making can and has instilled in us not only faith and hope but magnanimity as well. Thus, the answer to the provocative question Shaw poses at the beginning of his last major treatise,
      Everybody's Political What's What?—“Is Human Nature Incurably Depraved?”
               —is a resounding no: not just for him but for Ricoeur, too. Where there is faith, there is hope; and where there is hope, there is life. Life expectant.55<br>

Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: What is left unsaid in this article about the relationship between utopia and rhetoric could certainly fill the pages of many books. The range is especially rich when we turn to contemporary rhetorical theorists who specifically address society as a value to be combined with a remembered or imagined better place, as in Nedra Reynolds's
      Geographies of Writingor bell hooks'sBelonging: A Culture of Place.
               Just as constitutive rhetoric (that is, cumulative discourse that contributes to building the structure of human society) has been important in the works of theorists often cited by utopists as crucial to their work, so the utopian impulse continues to be inherent in the way rhetoricians see their subject. To persuade verbally or visually, we must have our own idea of what is socially better, and we must also be able to imagine what our audience believes to be better. The function of utopia, then, may be less philosophical and ideological at its root than it is linguistic in a pragmatic sense. As Kenneth Burke has written of human beings, we are “the symbol-making, symbol-using, symbol-misusing animal … rotten with perfection.”38

Abstract: Milan Kundera has described this kind of comedy as echoing a joyous, life-affirming laughter—“the serious laughter of angels expressing their joy of being.”
      
               But that is not to suggest that there is anything divinely pious in this position: if Joyce is an angel, then he is one, like Stephen Dedalus, who will not blindly or uncritically serve.168
            
               In commenting upon an earlier version of this article, Patrick Parrinder spoke of “the difficult relationship between Utopia and comedy.” This relationship is problematized by the fact that Utopia rarely seems able to laugh at itself or therefore to offer the liberating possibilities of comedy. Joyce's later writing, however, appears to advance the rare chance of a pluralist, ambiguous, and dynamic vision of Utopia: a Utopia that might be sustained into futurity—a Utopia that still has room for dreamers and for democrats. But is it still possible that we can call this realm of radical openness, this flux of possibilities, this resolutely material site, Utopian? And do we really need to? This kind of Utopia is not a category or a frame but a direction, a progress, a confluence of streams of consciousness and of unconsciousness, flowing into the river of life: not just a symbolic river but a real one too, the Liffey, the great Anna Livia Plurabelle herself. Or as Joyce put it, more succinctly (and more joyously), it is simply “Lff!”169

Abstract: Olga Stanisławska's reportage book
         Rondo de Gaulle'a[Charles de Gaulle Roundabout] was published in 2001 by Wydawnictwo Twój Styl in Warsaw. The book describes one woman's yearlong journey across Africa, from Casablanca, to Morocco, through Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, Guinea, Congo, Zaire, and Uganda to Nairobi, Kenya. Stanisławska writes about the political, economic, and social issues of numerous African countries. She describes the painful issue of modern-day slavery in Mauritania, the dramatic fate of the Tuareg nation, and recent conflicts in Chad. The book's narrative sometimes merges with objectified, newspaper-style news, but more often ventures into a solipsistic memoir and a warm and sensual portrayal of the various communities the author visits. Stanisławska's actual journey across Africa is complemented by her emotional and literary voyage from the paradise-like plains of the Saharan desert countries to the hellish depths of the jungle in the Congo. She frames her journey, or rather "travels," from Karen Blixen'sOut of Africa(a self-created paradise) to Joseph Conrad'sHeart of Darkness(a self-imposed hell). Both of Stanisławska's journeys–physical and literary–provide a captivating platform for studying her narrative as an unending and deeply empathic encounter with another human being. InCharles de Gaulle Roundaboutthere is a visible tension between the author's need to tell a story and her anxiety that in doing so she may (mis)treat people and turn them into fictional characters, that is, make their stories finite.<br>
