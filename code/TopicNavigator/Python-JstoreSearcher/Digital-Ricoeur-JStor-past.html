  Book Title: Superchurch-The Rhetoric and Politics of American Fundamentalism<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Edwards Jonathan J.<br>
  Abstract: Christian Fundamentalism is a doctrine and a discourse in tension. Fundamentalists describe themselves as both marginal and a majority. They announce the imminent end of the world while building massive megachurches and political lobbying organizations. They speak of the need for purity and separation from the outside world while continually innovating in their search for more effective and persuasive ways to communicate with and convert outsiders. To many outsiders, Fundamentalist speech seems contradictory, irrational, intolerant, and dangerously antidemocratic. To understand the complexity of Fundamentalism, we have to look inside the tensions and the paradoxes. We have to take seriously the ways in which Fundamentalists describe themselves to themselves, and to do that, we must begin by exploring the central role of "the church" in Fundamentalist rhetoric and politics. Drawing on five fascinating case studies,
      Superchurchblends a complex yet readable treatment of rhetorical and political theory with a sophisticated approach to Fundamentalism that neither dismisses its appeal nor glosses over its irresolvable tensions. Edwards challenges theories of rhetoric, counterpublics, deliberation, and civility while offering critical new insights into the evolution and continuing influence of one of the most significant cultural and political movements of the past century.<br>

  Author(s) MCARTHUR JO-ANNE<br>
  Abstract: The remains of animals, fragments of bone and horn, are often the most common finds recovered from archaeological excavations. The potential of using this material to examine questions of past economics and environment has long been recognized and is viewed by many archaeologists as the primary purpose of animal remains. In part this is due to the paradigm in which zooarchaeology developed and a consequence of practitioners’ concentration on taphonomy and quantification.¹ But the complex intertwined relationships between humans and animals have long been recognized, a good example being Lévi-Strauss’s oft quoted “natural species are chosen, not because they are<br>

  Author(s) Ell Theodore<br>
  Abstract: Research work in the humanities in general, and in philosophy in particular, is today looked at with a certain degree of suspicion, for various, and sometimes even opposed, reasons. On one hand, work on subtle epistemological questions and/or historical analysis of the thought of past philosophers is regarded as a navel-gazing activity, otiose at best, wasteful at worst. On the other hand, when philosophy and intellectual analysis come to focus on popular culture phenomena, such as comics, movies, and TV programs, they are regarded as trivializing ideas and as committing themselves to marginal and eventually unimportant work.

  Abstract: The categories “western peoples” and “inferior races” to which the above quotation refers have undergone several transformations over the past century. Just as these categories were once accepted as natural, the contemporary categories of “first world/third world,” “core/periphery,” “developed/underdeveloped,” “modern/traditional,” and “North/South” are widely regarded in international relations as neutral and unproblematic. They function as a pre-conceptual frame within which relations among countries so classified can be analyzed. This is true of a variety of approaches that differ radically in other ways, yet share these same classificatory schemes. The approach taken in this study suggests that relations among countries classified<br>

  Book Title: Memory Work-Anne Truitt and Sculpture<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): de Baca Miguel<br>
  Abstract: Memory Workdemonstrates the evolution of the pioneering minimalist sculptor Anne Truitt. An artist determined to make her way through a new aesthetic in the 1960s, Truitt was tireless in her pursuit of a strong cultural voice. At the heart of her practice was the key theme of memory, which enabled her not only to express personal experience but also to address how perception was changing for a contemporary viewership. She gravitated toward the idea that an object in one's focus could unleash a powerful return to the past through memory, which in turn brings a fresh, even critical, attention to the present moment. In addition to the artist's own popular published writings, which detail the unique challenges facing female artists,Memory Workdraws on unpublished manuscripts, private recordings, and never-before-seen working drawings to validate Truitt's original ideas about the link between perception and mnemonic reference in contemporary art. De Baca offers an insider's view of the artist's unstinting efforts to realize her artistic vision, as well as the cultural, political, and historical resonances her oeuvre has for us today.<br>

  Book Title: Symposium of the Whole-A Range of Discourse Toward an Ethnopoetics<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Rothenberg Diane<br>
  Abstract: Symposium of the Wholetraces a discourse on poetry and culture that has profoundly influenced the art of our time, with precedents going back two centuries and more. Beginning with a reassertion of the complexity of poetry among peoples long labeled "primitive" and "savage," many recent poets have sought to base a new poetics over the fullest range of human cultures. The attempt to define an ethnopoetics has been significantly connected with the most experimental and future-directed side of Romantic and modern poetry, both in the Western world and, increasingly, outside it. As a visionary poetics and as a politics, this complex redefinition of cultural and intellectual values has involved a rarely acknowledged collaboration between poets and scholars, who together have challenged the narrow view of literature that has excluded so many traditions.In this gathering, the Rothenbergs follow the idea of an ethnopoetics from predecessors such as Vico, Blake, Thoreau, and Tzara to more recent essays and manifestos by poets and social thinkers such as Olson, Eliade, Snyder, Turner, and Baraka. The themes range widely, from the divergence of oral and written cultures to the shaman as proto-poet and the reemergence of suppressed and rejected forms and images: the goddess, the trickster, and the "human universe." The book's three ethnographic sections demonstrate how various poetries are structured and composed, how they reflect meaning and worldview, and how they are performed in cultures where all art may be thought of as art-in-motion.Among the poetries discussed are the language of magic; West African drum language and poetry; the Huichol Indian language of reversals; chance operations in African divination poetry; picture-writings and action-writings from Australia and Africa; and American Indian sacred-clown dramas and traditional trickster narratives. The cumulative effect is a new reading of the poetic past and present-in the editors' words, "a changed paradigm of what~<br>

  Book Title: Alef, Mem, Tau-Kabbalistic Musings on Time, Truth, and Death<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Wolfson Elliot R.<br>
  Abstract: This highly original, provocative, and poetic work explores the nexus of time, truth, and death in the symbolic world of medieval kabbalah. Demonstrating that the historical and theoretical relationship between kabbalah and western philosophy is far more intimate and extensive than any previous scholar has ever suggested, Elliot R. Wolfson draws an extraordinary range of thinkers such as Frederic Jameson, Martin Heidegger, Franz Rosenzweig, William Blake, Julia Kristeva, Friedrich Schelling, and a host of kabbalistic figures into deep conversation with one another.
      Alef, Mem, Taualso discusses Islamic mysticism and Buddhist thought in relation to the Jewish esoteric tradition as it opens the possibility of a temporal triumph of temporality and the conquering of time through time. The framework for Wolfson's examination is the rabbinic teaching that the wordemet,"truth," comprises the first, middle, and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet,alef, mem,andtau,which serve, in turn, as semiotic signposts for the three tenses of time-past, present, and future. By heeding the letters ofemetwe discern the truth of time manifestly concealed in the time of truth, the beginning that cannot begin if it is to be the beginning, the middle that re/marks the place of origin and destiny, and the end that is the figuration of the impossible disclosing the impossibility of figuration, the finitude of death that facilitates the possibility of rebirth. The time of death does not mark the death of time, but time immortal, the moment of truth that bestows on the truth of the moment an endless beginning of a beginningless end, the truth of death encountered incessantly in retracing steps of time yet to be taken-between, before, beyond.<br>

  Abstract: However much Canto XXXI forms a solid continuation of the one preceding it, only here does Dante render a full account of himself, even if his confession is directed at Beatrice, who draws it out after she turns directly toward him. It has been preceded by her condemnation of his past behavior that she mediates by addressing the angels around her chariot, as Dante listens from across the stream of Lethe (XXX, 103), and by her ironic, sarcastic comments (XXX, 55–57 and 73–75), with which she nonetheless implicates herself.<br>

  Abstract: A concern with time is intrinsic to the internal logic of modernity. “More than anything else,” Zygmunt Bauman writes, modernity is the “history of time: the time when time has history” (“Time and Space Reunited,” 172). Radically breaking with the authority and legitimacy of the past, modernity offers a totalizing vision of progress toward an illimitable future.¹ Its universal narrative of irrepressible global development presupposes a uniform scale of spatial and temporal measurement. In this context the legislative creation of world standard time at the International Prime Meridian Conference of 1884 stands as a signal moment in the history of<br>

However, these approaches are increasingly being criticized as reductionist, incoherent, or incomplete by scholars who recommend a return to emphases on religion and culture as autonomous symbolic<br>

  Book Title: A Usable Past-Essays in European Cultural History<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): BOUWSMA WILLIAM J.<br>
  Abstract: The essays assembled here represent forty years of reflection about the European cultural past by an eminent historian. The volume concentrates on the Renaissance and Reformation, while providing a lens through which to view problems of perennial interest.
      A Usable Pastis a book of unusual scope, touching on such topics as political thought and historiography, metaphysical and practical conceptions of order, the relevance of Renaissance humanism to Protestant thought, the secularization of European culture, the contributions of particular professional groups to European civilization, and the teaching of history. The essays inA Usable Pastare unified by a set of common concerns. William Bouwsma has always resisted the pretensions to science that have shaped much recent historical scholarship and made the work of historians increasingly specialized and inaccessible to lay readers. Following Friedrich Nietzsche, he argues that since history is a kind of public utility, historical research should contribute to the self-understanding of society.<br>

Ernest Renan, for example, maintains in his influential 1882 lecture, “

The questioning of the ethnographer’s presence has frequently led to text-based reading being substituted for fieldwork experience, with a corresponding focus on textual representation; the questioning of the ethnographer’s power has led to demands for collaboration and dialogue, which in turn often emphasize righteous<br>

However, unlike for example the raging discussions over the Muslim pillar of faith known asjihād, scholars of the ancient Iranian religion named Zoroastrianism, after its founder Zarathushtra, have rarely broached the issues of just and unjust violence and of holy and sacrilegious war. Combat when examined both by the faith’s practitioners and by scholars is largely understood in terms of theodicy and eschatology linked to the human condition.<br>

  Abstract: News from afar sometimes seems to bear an uncanny resemblance to one’s own remembered past. This is not because of the banal redundancy of events but because of memory’s interpretive reach and its inclination to refurbish itself in contemporary designs and novel images. In 1994, when I was collecting these stories, horrifying pictures of ethnic violence from around the world seemed to appear nightly on the television news. In central Africa, roadways were filled with thousands of starving, desperate people traveling toward unknown destinations. This made a big impression on my Karo informants. “That’s exactly how it was here,” they<br>

  Abstract: Perceptions of places are socially constructed and profoundly influential, shaping understandings of the past and thus also expectations for the future. Fourth-century Antioch is a particularly rich site of spatial construction and change, in part because of its complex history during late antiquity, when religious and political upheavals altered the cityscape, in part because of its prominence within empirewide conversations, and in part because so much textual evidence regarding Antioch survives. Thanks to Libanius, John Chrysostom, and Theodoret, it is possible to investigate these decades of Antioch’s history in much more depth and from more perspectives than is usually possible<br>

They accomplish this revolt by insisting that sonnets contain events, instead of simply reporting on the already past happening of those events or advocating for or prophesying their future occurrence. In this sense, Milton’s sonnets attempt to treat events as free happenings in the present, as opposed to an impotent retrospective postulation<br>

Within this rite, the problem of identity emerges through the poet’s explorations of his personal history, a history that in time is set against the wider historical horizon of Heaney’s cultural past. Paradoxically, what gives his work continuity is his willingness to face discontinuity over again with each return to the source. Still, Heaney’s reliance on what has been called disparagingly a poetic of identity would appear to confirm Anthony Easthope’s criticism that Heaney’s poetry is “resolutely premodernist in its commitment to a<br>

  Book Title: Crossover Queries: Dwelling with Negatives, Embodying Philosophy's Others-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): WYSCHOGROD EDITH<br>
  Abstract: Exploring the risks, ambiguities, and unstable conceptual worlds of contemporary thought, Crossover Queries brings together the wide-ranging writings, across twenty years, of one of our most important philosophers.Ranging from twentieth-century European philosophy-the thought of Heidegger, Foucault, Derrida, Levinas, Janicaud, and others-to novels and artworks, music and dance, from traditional Jewish thought to Jain andBuddhist metaphysics, Wyschogrod's work opens radically new vistas while remaining mindful that the philosopher stands within and is responsible to a philosophical legacy conditioned by the negative.Rather than point to a Hegelian dialectic of overcoming negation or to a postmetaphysical exhaustion, Wyschogrod treats negative moments as opening novel spaces for thought. She probes both the desire for God and an ethics grounded in the interests of the other person, seeing these as moments both of crossing over and of negation. Alert to the catastrophes that have marked our times, she exposes the underlying logical structures of nihilatory forces that have been exerted to exterminate whole peoples. Analyzing the negationsof biological research and cultural images of mechanized and robotic bodies, she shows how they contest the body as lived in ordinary experience.Crossover Queries brings together important essays on a remarkable range of topics by one of our most insightful cultural critics. Commenting on philosophical and theological issues that have shaped the recent past as well as scientific and technological questions that will preoccupy us in the near future, Wyschogrod consistently alerts us to the urgency of problems whose importance few recognize. To avoid the challenge these essays pose is to avoid responsibility for a future that appears to be increasingly fragile.-Mark C. Taylor, Columbia University<br>

  Book Title: Committing the Future to Memory: History, Experience, Trauma-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Clift Sarah<br>
  Abstract: Whereas historical determinacy conceives the past as a complex and unstable network of causalities, this book asks how history can be related to a more radical future. To pose that question, it does not reject determinacy outright but rather seeks to explore how it works. In examining what it means to be "determined" by history, it also asks what kind of openings there might be in our encounters with history for interruptions, re-readings, and re-writings. Engaging texts spanning multiple genres and several centuries from John Locke to Maurice Blanchot, from Hegel to Benjamin Clift looks at experiences of time that exceed the historical narration of experiences said to have occurred in time. She focuses on the co-existence of multiple temporalities and opens up the quintessentially modern notion of historical succession to other possibilities. The alternatives she draws out include the mediations of language and narration, temporal leaps, oscillations and blockages, and the role played by contingency in representation. She argues that such alternatives compel us to reassess the ways we understand history and identity in a traumatic, or indeed in a post-traumatic, age.<br>

  Abstract: To argue for a rigorous reading of the “end” of historical time in Hegel is, in some sense, the condition for thinking the experience of narrative time in a mode other than that of the simple linearity of continuous progression. In Chapter 3, we demonstrated how Hegel’s complex mode of narrating the pastness of “art in its highest determination” generates an understanding of past and future that goes beyond the notion of two distinct moments on a temporal continuum and conceives narrative temporality in terms of how an aspect of futurity is at work in it, not as a horizon<br>

  Book Title: Terms of the Political: Community, Immunity, Biopolitics-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Campbell Timothy<br>
  Abstract: Terms of the Political: Community, Immunity, Biopolitics presents a decade of thought about the origins and possibilities of political theory from one of contemporary Italy's most prolific and engaging political theorists, Roberto Esposito. He has coined a number of critical concepts in current debates about the past, present, and future of biopolitics-from his work on the implications of the etymological and philosophical kinship of community (communitas) and immunity (immunitas) to his theorizations of the impolitical and the impersonal. Taking on interlocutors from throughout the Western philosophical tradition, from Aristotle and Augustine to Weil, Arendt, Nancy, Foucault, and Agamben, Esposito announces the eclipse of a modern political lexicon-"freedom," "democracy," "sovereignty," and "law"-that, in its attempt to protect human life, has so often produced its opposite (violence, melancholy, and death). Terms of the Political calls for the opening of political thought toward a resignification of these and other operative terms-such as "community," "immunity," "biopolitics," and "the impersonal"-in ways that affirm rather than negate life. An invaluable introduction to the breadth and rigor of Esposito's thought, the book will also welcome readers already familiar with Esposito's characteristic skill in overturning and breaking open the language of politics.<br>

  Abstract: Among the thinkers of the past century who offer themselves to the future for its reflection, Santayana must stand out as a singular figure, one whose thought is dedicated to the overarching possibility of the spiritual life undertaken without religious faith or metaphysical dogma. Among the throngs that fill the philosophical bestiary of the twentieth century, Santayana may be the one genuine contemplative of note. The majority of doctrines dominant in the century have been directed either toward the goal of action (Marxism, pragmatism, existentialism) or the problem of knowledge, truth, and meaning (pragmaticism, positivism, analytic philosophy, phenomenology).

  Book Title: Written Voices, Spoken Signs-Tradition, Performance, and the Epic Text<br>
  Publisher: Harvard University Press<br>
  Author(s): KAHANE AHUVIA<br>
  Abstract: These innovative essays by leading scholars of Homer, oral poetics, and epic invite us to rethink some key concepts for an understanding of traditional epic poetry. Egbert Bakker examines the epic performer's use of time and tense in recounting a past that is alive. Tackling the question of full-length performance of the monumental
         Iliad, Andrew Ford considers the extent to which the work was perceived as a coherent whole in the archaic age. John Miles Foley addresses questions about spoken signs and the process of reference in epic discourse, and Ahuvia Kahane studies rhythm as a semantic factor in the Homeric performance. Richard Martin suggests a new range of performance functions for the Homeric simile. And Gregory Nagy establishes the importance of one feature of epic language, the ellipsis. These six essays centered on Homer engage with fundamental issues that are addressed by three essays primarily concerned with medieval epic: those by Franz BÃƒÂ¤uml on the concept of fact; by Wulf Oesterreicher on types of orality; and by Ursula Schaefer on written and spoken media. In their Introduction the editors highlight the underlying approach and viewpoints of this collaborative volume.Reviews of this book:"Despite its wide range of topics and approaches, the volume has a clear thematic focus. All contributors seek to leave behind the more formal concerns of past generations of scholars and aim instead at an understanding of orality as that which is (conceptually or actually) close, immediate, or performed. In their joint search for the new picture, classicists, linguists, and medievalists discover a range of different 'oralities'."<br>

  Abstract: The question whether the Greek epic tradition is a matter of truth or of fiction remains a central issue in Homeric scholarship, and any answer to it betrays one’s stance with regard to a host of other issues, such as text, tradition, and authorship. Opinions are divided as to whether the Homeric rendition of the heroic past is wholly traditional and so “objective,” or allows of fictional, “original” admixture by an individual poet. What is less often asked is whether the notion of truth itself, in the sense of an acknowledged correspondence between a statement and a state of affairs<br>

This metaphor serves a good purpose in suggesting the wide diversity of materials and comparative questions which fall within the historian’s responsibility.

This debate echoes similar debates over the past twenty years about the prospects for defenses of human rights in various non-Western traditions of ethical reflection. In this essay, I show that recent defenses offered by Buddhist philosophers share an important feature: they are all based on the indirect and contingent benefits of institutionalized rights rather than the direct or intrinsic moral value of rights.

  Book Title: Gender and Nation in Meiji Japan-Modernity, Loss, and the Doing of History<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Karlin Jason G.<br>
  Abstract: Gender and Nation in Meiji Japan is a historical analysis of the discourses of nostalgia in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Japan. Through an analysis of the experience of rapid social change in Japan’s modernization, it argues that fads (ryūkō) and the desires they express are central to understanding Japanese modernity, conceptions of gender, and discourses of nationalism. In doing so, the author uncovers the myth of eternal return that lurks below the surface of Japanese history as an expression of the desire to find meaning amid the chaos and alienation of modern times. The Meiji period (1868–1912) was one of rapid change that hastened the process of forgetting: The state’s aggressive program of modernization required the repression of history and memory. However, repression merely produced new forms of desire seeking a return to the past, with the result that competing or alternative conceptions of the nation haunted the history of modern Japan. Rooted in the belief that the nation was a natural and organic entity that predated the rational, modern state, such conceptions often were responses to modernity that envisioned the nation in opposition to the modern state. What these visions of the nation shared was the ironic desire to overcome the modern condition by seeking the timeless past. While the condition of their repression was often linked to the modernizing policies of the Meiji state, the means for imagining the nation in opposition to the state required the construction of new symbols that claimed the authority of history and appealed to a rearticulated tradition. Through the idiom of gender and nation, new reified representations of continuity, timelessness, and history were fashioned to compensate for the unmooring of inherited practices from the shared locales of everyday life. This book examines the intellectual, social, and cultural factors that contributed to the rapid spread of Western tastes and styles, along with the backlash again~<br>

The acceleration of history and endless renewal of fashion created a sense of disjuncture and difference that allowed Meiji Japan to imagine itself as the victim of a deformative process of cultural loss and foreign invasion. Fashion is above all else a ritual of forgetting that celebrates novelty and obliviousness to the past.¹ Pierre Nora argues that a memorial consciousness emerges under just such conditions wherein society becomes deeply absorbed in its own transformation and renewal.

  Book Title: Intention Interpretation-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): ISEMINGER GARY<br>
  Abstract: "...an excellent and comprehensive discussion of a debate that was initiated in this century in William Wimsatt's and Monroe C. Beardsley's influential article 'The Intentional Fallacy.'...this is a splendidly conceived and very useful collection of essays. Readers will want to take issue with the arguments of individual authors, but this is to be expected in a volume at the cutting edge of a fertile philosophical controversy." --David Novitz, The Philosophical Quarterly "What is the connection, if any, between the author's intentions in (while) writing a work of literature and the truth (acceptability, validity) of interpretive statements about it?" With this question, Gary Isminger introduces a literary debate that has been waged for the past four decades and is addressed by philosophers and literary theorists in Intention and Interpretation. Thirteen essays discuss the role of appeals to the author's intention in interpreting works of literature. A well-known argument by E.D. Hirsch serves as the basic text, in which he defends the appeal to the author's intention against Wimsatt and Beardsley's claim that such an appeal involved "the intentional fallacy." The essays, mostly commissioned by the editor, explore the presuppositions and consequences of arguing for the importance of the author's intentions in the way Hirsch does. Connections emerge between this issue and many fundamental issues in metaphysics and the philosophy of mind as well as in aesthetics. The (old) "New Criticism" and current Post-Structuralism tend to agree in disenfranchising the author, and many people now are disinclined even to consider the alternative. Hirsch demurs, and arguments like his deserve the careful attention, both from critics and sympathizers, that they receive here. Literary scholars and philosophers who are sympathetic to Continental as well as to Anglo-American styles of philosophy are among the contributors.

  Book Title: Rhetoric and the Writing of History, 400-1500-  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kempshall Matthew<br>
  Abstract: This book provides an analytical overview of the vast range of historiography which was produced in western Europe over a thousand-year period between c.400 and c.1500. Concentrating on the general principles of classical rhetoric central to the language of this writing, alongside the more familiar traditions of ancient history, biblical exegesis and patristic theology, this survey introduces the conceptual sophistication and semantic rigour with which medieval authors could approach their narratives of past and present events, and the diversity of ends to which this history could then be put. By providing a close reading of some of the historians who put these linguistic principles and strategies into practice (from Augustine and Orosius through Otto of Freising and William of Malmesbury to Machiavelli and Guicciardini), it traces and questions some of the key methodological changes that characterise the function and purpose of the western historiographical tradition in this formative period of its development.<br>

Perhaps contrary to the expectations of many westerners, Cairenes are becoming more religiously observant and more consciously Muslim, than they were in the 1940s, 1950s, or 1960s.

In each case there is a radical and violent irruption in time that is not erased by the apparent movement into the “post-” period, but which instead continues to define time like an inescapable shadow so that any sense of a future truly liberated from the past (however that may be conceived of) remains hanging, suspended, in<br>

  Abstract: The landscape tells – or rather is – a story. It enfolds the lives and times of predecessors who, over the generations, have moved around in it and played their part in its formation. To perceive the landscape is therefore to carry out an act of remembrance, and remembering is not so much a matter of calling up an internal image, stored in the mind, as of engaging perceptually with an environment that is itself pregnant with the past (Ingold, 1993, p. 152).<br>

However, in the past twenty-five years, the Chinese people have shown an increasing interest in Christianity, in ways nev er before experienced. Will this fifth encounter between Christianity and modern China succeed? While we can only speculate, it is very clear after so many failures, that the encounter will not succeed if the church turns back on the road of confrontation. Only by persevering in dialogue<br>

But if form criticism embodies an essential insight, it will continue. If it is to continue in the reflective and thinking world of academic scholarship, the attraction that triggered its rise, the flaws that caused its fall, and the aspects that assure its future all need to be analysed.

  Book Title: Time-A Vocabulary of the Present<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Elias Amy J.<br>
  Abstract: Featuring twenty essays that reveal what we talk about when we talk about time today, especially in the areas of history, measurement, and culture, each essay pairs two keywords to explore the tension and nuances between them, from "past/future" and "anticipation/unexpected" to "extinction/adaptation" and "serial/simultaneous." Moving beyond the truisms of postmodernism, the collection newly theorizes the meanings of temporality in relationship to aesthetic, cultural, technological, and economic developments in the postwar period. This book thus assumes that time-not space, as the postmoderns had it-is central to the contemporary period, and that through it we can come to terms with what contemporaneity can be for human beings caught up in the historical present. In the end,
      Timereveals that the present is a cultural matrix in which overlapping temporalities condition and compete for our attention. Thus each pair of terms presents two temporalities, yielding a generative account of the time, or times, in which we live.<br>

In Australia, 250 languages were spoken in the late eighteenth century. At the outset of the twenty-first century, there were about 30 still regularly spoken, and few of them seemed likely to survive for another generation in Australia.

  Abstract: Ireland Beyond Boundaries provides an authoritative, up-to-date account of the development of Irish Studies over the past two decades. The fourteen contributors examine some of the key debates that have underpinned recent scholarship and analyse critical concerns that have shaped the subject’s remarkable growth. The book is divided into two parts. Part One traces the institutional fortunes of Irish Studies in Ireland, the USA, Canada, Australia and Britain. Part Two features in-depth critical accounts of specific trends and themes within Irish historiography, literary criticism, religion, migration, music, cultural geography, sport and media culture. Throughout the collection there is a recurring engagement with the role of interdisciplinary approaches within Irish Studies and its impact on teaching and research. Combining synoptic overviews with informed analyses, Ireland Beyond Boundaries is an essential text for all those working in the field.<br>

Secondly, sensing that we are on the cusp of change, having recently crossed the threshold into a new century, what precisely are the difficulties in defining and analysing the nature of an Irish mediascape? The study of media institutions, texts and audiences in and about Ireland is a relatively new sub-field that has emerged piecemeal from diverse disciplinary origins, a second-generation of scholarship within what has come to be called Irish Studies.<br>

  Author(s) BIRD ROBERT<br>
  Abstract: Theory vs. history; form vs. content; artistry vs. ideology; close reading vs. contextualization: these dichotomies are intrinsic to the way literary scholars have come to think of their subject, especially within the—now globally influential—U.S. academy. This volume explores a critical tradition, known as Historical Poetics, that offers a way of negotiating between these familiar oppositions, blending literary theory, history of poetic forms, cultural history, philosophy of history, and (often less overtly) philosophical aesthetics. In the following chapters, this exploration is undertaken on four different fronts—new translations that make available important theoretical work from the past, contributions to<br>

  Abstract: Most of the histories examined in the last chapter reconstruct origins and memory with present socio-political ends in mind. All derive from nostalgia for a past and present home, and seek to establish roots and legitimacy by reconstituting a New Caledonian history that guarantees their community its own place, cultural specificity, and centrality. The dialectic between literature and history, between European and New Caledonian homes, refashions the sense of history in these texts: a (hi)story that is more about a distinctive (group), a political message, and an ethical vision of the future than a faithful reproduction of a past society<br>

Modernist writers converge in St. Petersburg and Rio de Janeiro, Moscow and São Paulo, as in Paris, London, Lisbon, Prague, New York and other cities whose contours filter into their fictions. These cities concentrate publication venues, a reading public and the political and critical establishments that redefine modern literary production.

  Book Title: South African performance and archives of memory-  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): HUTCHISON YVETTE<br>
  Abstract: This book explores how South Africa is negotiating its past in and through various modes of performance in contemporary theatre, public events and memorial spaces. It analyses the Truth and Reconciliation Commission as a live event, as an archive, and in various theatrical engagements with it, asking throughout how the TRC has affected the definition of identity and memory in contemporary South Africa, including disavowed memories. Hutchison then considers how the SA-Mali Timbuktu Manuscript Project and the 2010 South African World Cup opening ceremony attempted to restage the nation in their own ways. She investigates how the Voortrekker Monument and Freedom Park embody issues related to memory in contemporary South Africa. She also analyses current renegotiations of popular repertoires, particularly songs and dances related to the Struggle, revivals of classic European and South African protest plays, new history plays and specific racial and ethnic histories and identities.<br>

  Abstract: I turn now from these performances of memory by state or cultural institutions to look at embodied repertoires in the public sphere and in theatres. While the TRC clearly attempted to hear hidden stories and renegotiate the perceptions and values of South Africans, its effect was limited because a state of mind, values, and peoples’ views cannot be easily changed. Thus the extent to which the creative arts can facilitate further dialogue on the past and what the ‘rainbow nation’ means for individual people are important insofar as the arts can reach local communities in spaces outside of everyday reality.<br>

  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Bakiner Onur<br>
  Abstract: Since the 1980s a number of countries have established truth commissions to come to terms with the legacy of past human rights violations, yet little is known about the achievements and shortcomings of this popular transitional justice tool. Drawing on research on Chile's National Truth and Reconciliation Commission and Peru's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and exploring the scholarship on thirteen other transitional contexts, Onur Bakiner evaluates the success of truth commissions in promoting policy reform, human rights accountability, and the public recognition of human rights violations. He argues that although political elites often see a truth commission as a convenient way to address past atrocities, the findings, historical narratives, and recommendations of such commissions often surprise, upset, and discredit influential political actors. Even when commissions produce only modest change as a result of political constraints, Bakiner contends, they open up new avenues for human rights activism by triggering the creation of new victims' organizations, facilitating public debates over social memory, and inducing civil society actors to monitor the country's human rights policy.<br>

  Abstract: Thirty years ago nobody could have anticipated that a slightly modified inquiry commission, now called
                  truth commission, would have become among the most widely used political-institutional mechanisms to come to terms with the legacies of violent and divisive periods. They have outlived the transitional justice paradigm, as consolidated democracies and nontransitioning regimes began to opt for truth commissions, too. Calls for subnational, national, and international truth commissions to investigate an ever-expanding list of past violations and injustices are found everywhere. In many countries, the supporters and opponents of a past truth commission still argue bitterly about its achievements and shortcomings<br>

  Book Title: Chora 7-Intervals in the Philosophy of Architecture<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Parcell Stephen<br>
  Abstract: For over twenty years, the Chora series has received international acclaim for its excellence in interdisciplinary research on architecture. The seven volumes of Chora have challenged readers to consider alternatives to conventional aesthetic and technological concepts. The seventy-eight authors and eighty-seven scholarly essays in the series have investigated profound cultural roots of architecture and revealed rich possibilities for architecture and its related disciplines. Chora 7, the final volume in the series, includes fifteen essays on architectural topics from around the world (France, Greece, Iran, Italy, Korea, and the United States) and from diverse cultures (antiquity, Renaissance Italy, early modern France, and the past hundred years). Thematically, they bring original approaches to human experience, theatre, architectural creation, and historical origins. Readers will also gain insights into theoretical and practical work by architects and artists such as Leon Battista Alberti, Peter Brook, Douglas Darden, Filarete, Andy Goldsworthy, Anselm Kiefer, Frederick Kiesler, Claude-Nicolas Ledoux, and Peter Zumthor. Contributors to Chora 7 include Anne Bordeleau (University of Waterloo), Diana Cheng (Montreal), Negin Djavaherian (Montreal), Paul Emmons (Washington-Alexandria Architecture Center of Virginia Tech), Paul Holmquist (McGill University), Ron Jelaco (McGill University), Yoonchun Jung (Kyoto University), Christos Kakalis (Edinburgh School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture), Lisa Landrum (University of Manitoba), Robert Nelson (Monash University), Marc J Neveu (Woodbury University), Alberto Pérez-Gómez (McGill University), Angeliki Sioli (Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education), Nikolaos-Ion Terzoglou (National Technical University of Athens), and Stephen Wischer (North Dakota State University).<br>

  Book Title: Recognizing the Gift-Toward a Renewed Theology of Nature and Grace<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortres<br>
  Author(s): Rober Daniel A.<br>
  Abstract: Recognizing the Gift puts twentieth-century Catholic theological conversations on nature and grace, particularly those of Henri de Lubac and Karl Rahner, into dialogue with Continental philosophy, notably the thought of Jean-Luc Marion and Paul Ricoeur. It argues that a renewed theology of nature and grace must build on the accomplishments of the recent past while acknowledging that an engagement with the political is unavoidable for theology. Ultimately, the aim is to revive and broaden discussion of nature and grace by drawing together the insights of contemporary theologians and Continental philosophers. Too often these areas of inquiry remain quite separate, in part due to differing priorities. This work tries to open that conversation, in part by critically pointing out, in dialogue with Ricoeur, the need in Marion’s work for an acknowledgment of recognition, reciprocity, and the political. It thus argues for a theology of nature and grace in terms of recognition of the gift, drawing out the reciprocal and political nature of gift and givenness in opposition to those, including Marion, who would seek to avoid politics and reciprocity as a proper avenue of inquiry for theology.<br>

  Abstract: This book is a contribution to hermeneutical theology in the twenty-first century. It offers a critical analysis of this important movement within twentieth-century Protestant theology. The purpose of the analysis is not to assign this movement a place within the history of theology, thus consigning it to the past as theology moves on to face changing issues and new challenges. Rather, it is to make its concerns understandable and to point out their validity for the present. Hermeneutical theology in all of its versions has never attempted to adapt to the trends and fashionable topics of the time, but has<br>

  Book Title: Walter Benjamin and Theology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SYMONS STÉPHANE<br>
  Abstract: In the Arcades Project, Walter Benjamin writes that his work is "related to theology as blotting pad is related to ink. It is saturated with it." For a thinker so decisive to critical literary, cultural, political, and aesthetic writings over the past half-century, Benjamin's relationship to theological matters has been less observed than it should, even despite a variety of attempts over the last four decades to illuminate the theological elements latent within his eclectic and occasional writings. Such attempts, though undeniably crucial to comprehending his thought, remain in need of deepened systematic analysis. In bringing together some of the most renowned experts from both sides of the Atlantic, Walter Benjamin and Theology seeks to establish a new site from which to address both the issue of Benjamin's relationship with theology and all the crucial aspects that Benjamin himself grappled with when addressing the field and operations of theological inquiry.<br>

However, political culture is not a passive given. Political culture is inherited from the past but it is adapted and built on by political institutions which in this way help shape a society’s attitudes to politics. In the case of the French Communist Party (Parti communiste français: PCF), it successfully picked up and used aspects of a pre-existing political culture but it also added its own components.<br>

  Abstract: Since the 1980s, France has experienced a vigorous revival of interest in its past and cultural heritage. This has been expressed as part of a movement of remembering through museums and festivals as well as via elaborate commemorations, most notably those held to celebrate the bi-centenary of the Revolution in 1989 and can be interpreted as part of a re-examinaton of what it means to be French in the context of ongoing Europeanization. This study brings together scholars from multidisciplinary backgrounds and engages them in debate with professionals from France, who are working in the fields of museology, heritage and cultural production. Addressing subjects such as war and memory, gastronomy and regional identity, maritime culture and urban societies, they throw fresh light on the process by which France has been conceptualized and packaged as a cultural object.<br>

  Abstract: By the end of 1977 antitotalitarianism clearly dominated the politics of the noncommunist intellectual Left. Intellectuals, fearing the worst from the parties of the Left in power, found threats of totalitarianism in all but the most impotent political projects. The political logic of their critique of the PCF and of the Union of the Left favored analyses that were focused on ideology and divorced from the concrete realities of contemporary France or Soviet history. While unconsciously drawing on resources within French republican political culture to combat the supposed totalitarian threat, they asserted that the apparent past blindness of French intellectuals<br>

  Abstract: My relationship with Shirley and Edwin Ardener began in 1977 when I came to Oxford as a Human Sciences undergraduate. My first glimpse of Shirley was in the quad at St John’s College when one of my friends pointed her out as one of our anthropology tutors. I blinked and she was gone. For the next few months, the same thing happened. She either flew or zoomed past me on her bike or on foot.

  Abstract: In significant ways, legal texts produce a narrative of national identity. They weave stories about who we are, what we are committed to, and what we expect of one another, individually and collectively. Certain foundational fictions, like “We the People,” provide the glue that over time binds a people to its past and to one another as a nation. But should law play the same role with respect to other aspects of human identity? I think not. Current debates surrounding affirmative action, congressional redistricting, the Million Man March, and the appointment of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court all represent<br>

  Book Title: Religion: Beyond a Concept-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): de VRIES HENT<br>
  Abstract: What do we talk about when we talk about religion? Is it an array of empirical facts about historical human civilizations? Or is religion what is in essence unpredictable-perhaps the very emergence of the new? In what ways are the legacies of religion-its powers, words, things, and gestures-reconfiguring themselves as the elementary forms of life in the twenty-first century?Given the Latin roots of the word religion and its historical Christian uses, what sense, if any, does it make to talk about religionin other traditions? Where might we look for common elements that would enable us to do so? Has religion as an overarching concept lost all its currency, or does it ineluctably return-sometimes in unexpected ways-the moment we attempt to do without it? This book explores the difficulties and double binds that arise when we ask What is religion? Offering a marvelously rich and diverse array of perspectives, it begins the task of rethinking religionand religious studiesin a contemporary world. Opening essays on the question What is religion?are followed by clusters exploring the relationships among religion, theology, and philosophy and the links between religion, politics, and law. Pedagogy is the focus of the following section. Religion is then examined in particular contexts, from classical times to the present Pentacostal revival, leading into an especially rich set of essays on religion, materiality, and mediatization. The final section grapples with the ever-changing forms that religionis taking, such as spirituality movements and responses to the ecological crisis.Featuring the work of leading scholars from a wide array of disciplines, traditions, and cultures, Religion: Beyond a Concept will help set the agenda for religious studies for years to come. It is the first of five volumes in a collection entitled The Future of the Religious Past, the fruit of a major international research initiative funded by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research.<br>

  Abstract: The question of God certainly does not begin with metaphysics. But it seems—or at least it managed to appear—that, since metaphysics was coming to an end, being completed, and disappearing, the question of God was also coming to a close. Throughout the past century, everything happened as if the question of God would have to make common cause, whether positively or negatively, with the destiny of metaphysics. Everything also happened as if, in order to keep the question of God open so as to permit a “rational worship” of him (Rom. 12:1), it was absolutely necessary to stick<br>

  Abstract: Describing feelings is a notoriously difficult thing to do. The problem is enhanced when those who do so use a language that is not their vernacular, and even more so when that language is part of sacred scriptures, which are understood as paradigmatic and as informing or teaching some sublime forms of experience that took place in the glorious past. Caught between the artificiality of the language and the authority of the sacred texts, the dimension of personal experience is often attenuated and sometimes even obliterated. Clichés, models, paragons, rituals, and ideals canonized in the ancient past are powerful obstacles<br>

In the essay entitled “The Realistic Oriole: A Study of Wallace Stevens” from 1957, Frye makes clear why Stevens’s poetry perhaps situates itself so well among the other contexts explored throughout this study for gauging the extraordinary achievement of his work in the century past. Specifically, Frye remarks on the “anti-‘poetic’ quality” of Stevens in contrast, say, to T.S. Eliot<br>

  Book Title: Archaeology and Memory-  Publisher: Oxbow Books<br>
  Author(s): Borić Dušan<br>
  Abstract: Memory can be both a horrifying trauma and an empowering resource. From the Ancient Greeks to Nietzsche and Derrida, the dilemma about the relationship between history and memory has filled many pages, with one important question singled out: is the writing of history to memory a remedy or a poison? Recently, a growing interest in and preoccupation with the issue of memory, remembering and forgetting has resulted in a proliferation of published works, in various disciplines, that have memory as their focus. This trend, to which the present volume contributes, has started to occupy the dominant discourses of disciplines such as sociology, philosophy, history, anthropology and archaeology, and has also disseminated into the wider public discourse of society and culture today. Such a condition may perhaps echo the phenomenon of a melancholic experience at the turn of the millennium. Archaeology and Memory seeks to examine the diversity of mnemonic systems and their significance in different past contexts as well as the epistemological and ontological importance of archaeological practice and narratives in constituting the human historical condition. The twelve substantial contributions in this volume cover a diverse set of regional examples and focus on a range of prehistoric and classical case studies in Eurasian regional contexts as well as on the predicaments of memory in examples of the archaeologies of 'contemporary past'. From the Mesolithic and Neolithic burial chambers to the trenches of World War I and the role of materiality in international criminal courts, a number of contributors examine how people in the past have thought about their own pasts, while others reflect on our own present-day sensibilities in dealing with the material testimonies of recent history. Both kinds of papers offer wider theoretical reflections on materiality, archaeological methodologies and the ethical responsibilities of archaeological narration about the past.<br>

An examination of quotidian mnemonic processes offers an opportunity for us to explore the ways in which local peoples negotiated, influenced, and responded to imperial social climates. The Roman Empire provides a salient framework for exploring memory because it was the iconic ancient empire, inscribing its control over a vast range of territories and peoples, each with its own distinct history and identity.

  Abstract: All aspects of archaeology, including environmental archaeology and subdisciplines within it, are ultimately about people in the past. Archaeology has been good at studying the material world that humans have produced and the items they have made, but less good at attempting to understand the people themselves. Attempts to get into the minds of people long gone or to attempt in some small way to engage with their feelings and life styles have often been considered unscientific and unhelpful. Yet humans are a part of the natural world, and they modify it and act as communities within in. Their actions<br>

As Alasdair McIntyre observed in
                     After Virtue, the apodictic use of moral principles serves only to put an end to the ethical dialogue itself. In other words, the broad convergence on ethics in public debate almost never translates into ethical consensus.<br>

No doubt, some might hold that this description is already misleading since metaphysics has never been absent, only confusedly and ruinously neglected metaphysics has acted as avia absconditafrom which we have taken but a short hiatus.

  Book Title: Hope and the Longing for Utopia-Futures and Illusions in Theology and Narrative<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Boscaljon Daniel<br>
  Abstract: At present the battle over who defines our future is being waged most publicly by secular and religious fundamentalists. 'Hope and the Longing for Utopia' offers an alternative position, disclosing a conceptual path toward potential worlds that resist a limited view of human potential and the gift of religion. In addition to outlining the value of embracing unknown potentialities, these twelve interdisciplinary essays explore why it has become crucial that we commit to hoping for values that resist traditional ideological commitments. Contextualized by contemporary writing on utopia, and drawing from a wealth of times and cultures ranging from Calvin’s Geneva to early twentieth-century Japanese children’s stories to Hollywood cinema, these essays cumulatively disclose the fundamental importance of resisting tantalizing certainties while considering the importance of the unknown and unknowable. Beginning with a set of four essays outlining the importance of hope and utopia as diagnostic concepts, and following with four concrete examples, the collection ends with a set of essays that provide theological speculations on the need to embrace finitude and limitations in a world increasingly enframed by secularizing impulses. Overall, this book discloses how hope and utopia illuminate ways to think past simplified wishes for the future.<br>

In response to this modernist divorce between theological disciplines, the theological interpretation of Scripture attempts to explain how Scripture functions as the “soul of sacred theology,” by articulating how Scripture operates as a locus of God’s ongoing self-communicative action, and why scriptural reading must be primarily an activity performed by the church and for<br>

  Book Title: Making Memory-Jewish and Christian Explorations in Monument, Narrative, and Liturgy<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Vincent Alana M.<br>
  Abstract: The twentieth century has been called a "century of horror". Proof of that, designation can be found in the vast and ever-increasing volume of scholarly work on violence, trauma, memory, and history across diverse academic disciplines. This book demonstrates not only the ways in which the wars of the twentieth century have altered theological engagement and religious practice, but also the degree to which religious ways of thinking have shaped the way we construct historical narratives. Drawing on diverse sources - from the Hebrew Bible to Commonwealth war graves, from Greek tragedy to post-Holocaust theology - Alana M. Vincent probes the intersections between past and present, memory and identity, religion and nationality. The result is a book that defies categorization and offers no easy answers, but instead pursues an agenda of theological realism, holding out continued hope for the restoration of the world.<br>

  Abstract: This is a book about living with the past—not about memory itself
                  per se, but about the process of constructing cultural memory, about the negotiation, implicit or explicit, between what is remembered, transmuted into narrative, handed on from generation to generation, and what is forgotten, unspoken, overlooked. My underlying assumption is that the understanding of the past generated by such a process plays an essential role in shaping attitudes and actions of individuals and societies in the present. This understanding (“memory”) is at times difficult to distinguish from the process of its formation (“memorialization”); the former is often the<br>

  Abstract: After the Second Vatican Council (1962–65), Catholic theologians discussed among themselves how to interpret the doctrinal evolution that had taken place. They all felt that in response to the conditions of modernity, the Church, in fidelity to the Gospel, had reinterpreted its teaching in a certain discontinuity with the past. During a discussion at the board of directors of the review

  Abstract: Surprisingly and in repeatedly unexpected ways, historians have continued to debate in recent decades the central question of their craft: how can the past be described and explained? At each stage of the debate, the answers to this question have reflected and contributed to larger epistemological discussions across the disciplines. The following discussion examines selected aspects of the twists and turns of recent historical debate by using the example of research on census enumerations. From the time of the “new social history” of the 1960s and 1970s to the cultural history of the 1980s and 1990s, scholars have focused on<br>

Irish-Canadian literature has, on the one hand, been formative in the creation of a national aesthetic, creating and responding to the pressure to assimilate. On the other hand, it has reacted to the multiculturalist urge to diversify, broadening the spectrum of genres and post-colonial voices, and moving away from<br>

Why is Ukrainian Canadian literature rarely studied by literary scholars? Why are Ukrainian Canadian literary texts largely absent from classroom syllabi?

  Abstract: As this volume demonstrates, distribution of vampires and zombies across time and space has revealed these undead figures to carry multiple meanings. Of all monsters, vampires and zombies seem to be the trendiest-the most regularly incarnate of the undead and the monsters most frequently represented in the media and pop culture. Moreover, both figures have experienced radical reinterpretations. If in the past vampires were evil, blood-sucking exploiters and zombies were brainless victims, they now have metamorphosed into kinder and gentler blood-sucking vampires and crueler, more relentless, flesh-eating zombies.<br>

  Abstract: Drawing on the expertise of sixteen scholars who are at the forefront of rewriting the history of American economic development,

Approaching the study of slavery as the originating catalyst for the Industrial Revolution and modern capitalism casts new light on American credit markets, practices of offshore investment, and understandings of human capital. Rather than seeing slavery as outside the institutional structures of capitalism, the essayists recover slavery's importance to the American economic past and prompt enduring questions about the relationship of market freedom to human freedom.<br>

  Book Title: An Archaeology of Prehistoric Bodies and Embodied Identities in the Eastern Mediterranean-  Publisher: Oxbow Books<br>
  Author(s): PAPADATOS YIANNIS<br>
  Abstract: In the long tradition of the archaeology of the eastern Mediterranean bodies have held a prominent role in the form of figurines, frescos, or skeletal remains, and have even been responsible for sparking captivating portrayals of the Mother-Goddess cult, the elegant women of Minoan Crete or the deeds of heroic men. Growing literature on the archaeology and anthropology of the body has raised awareness about the dynamic and multifaceted role of the body in experiencing the world and in the construction, performance and negotiation of social identity. In these 28 thematically arranged papers, specialists in the archaeology of the eastern Mediterranean confront the perceived invisibility of past bodies and ask new research questions. Contributors discuss new and old evidence; they examine how bodies intersect with the material world, and explore the role of body-situated experiences in creating distinct social and other identities. Papers range chronologically from the Palaeolithic to the Early Iron Age and cover the geographical regions of the Aegean, Cyprus and the Near East. They highlight the new possibilities that emerge for the interpretation of the prehistoric eastern Mediterranean through a combined use of body-focused methodological and theoretical perspectives that are nevertheless grounded in the archaeological record.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1ggjkqm">An Archaeology of Prehistoric Bodies and Embodied Identities in the Eastern Mediterranean</a><br>
  Author(s) Kotsakis Kostas<br>
  Abstract: Following the premise of embodiment theory that “bodily experience is understood to be the existential ground of culture and self” (Csordas 1994, 269), this paper discusses the embodied identities that were generated in connection with the use of metal accoutrements and jewellery in prehistoric Cyprus. Proponents of an embodiment approach in archaeology have generally argued that the study of past identities should focus on the recovery of individuals and their diverse and subjective bodily experiences that cannot be accounted for by broad collectives (Knapp and Meskell 1997, 186; Meskell 2000, 13, 21; Knapp and van Dommelen 2008, 23–4).

  Abstract: So the melancholy that speaks from the pages of Benjamin’s essays—private depressions, professional discouragement, the dejection of the outsider, distress in the face of a political and historical nightmare—searches the past for an adequate object, for some emblem or image at which, as in religious meditation, the mind can stare itself out, in which it can find momentary, if only aesthetic, relief. It finds it: in the Germany of the Thirty Years’ War, in the Paris “capital of the nineteenth century.” For they are both—the Baroque and the modern—in their very essence allegorical, and they match<br>

  Author(s): Garber Marjorie<br>
  Abstract: As a break from their ordained labors, what might the Muses today do on their lunch hour? This collection of witty, shrewd, and imaginative essays addresses interdisciplinary topics that range widely from Shakespeare, to psychoanalysis, to the practice of higher education today. With the ease born of deep knowledge, Marjorie Garber moves from comical journalistic quirks (GÇ£Fig LeavesGÇ¥) to the curious return of myth and ritual in the theories of evolutionary psychologists (GÇ£Ovid, Now and ThenGÇ¥)._x000D_ Two themes emerge consistently in GarberGÇÖs latest exploration of symptoms of culture. The first is that to predict the GÇ£next big thingGÇ¥ in literary studies we should look back at ideas and practices set aside by a previous generation of critics. In the past several decades we have seen the reemergence ofGÇöfor exampleGÇötextual editing, biography, character criticism, aesthetics, and philology as GÇ£hotGÇ¥ new areas for critical intervention. The second theme expands on this observation, making the case for GÇ£cultural forgettingGÇ¥ as the way the arts and humanities renew themselves, both within fields and across them. Although she is never represented in traditional paintings or poetry, a missing MuseGÇöwe can call her AmnesiaGÇöturns out to be a key figure for the creation of theory and criticism in the arts.<br>

  Abstract: Conceived as a second edition to Kawakami's acclaimed A Self-Conscious Art, which was the first full-length study in English of Patrick Modiano’s work, this book has been comprehensively updated with two new chapters, notably discussing the author's recent work and his Nobel Prize win. Kawakami shows how by parodying precursors such as Proust or the nouveau romanciers, Modiano's narratives are built around a profound lack of faith in the ability of writing to retrieve the past through memory, and this failure is acknowledged in the discreet playfulness that characterises his novels. This welcome update on the work of one of the most successful modern French novelists will be essential reading for scholars working on contemporary French writing.<br>

  Abstract: As memories of slavery re-emerge in recent historiographies of the transatlantic slave trade, contemporary visual culture from Francophone Africa is participating in this reassessment of the past as part of an on-going discussion of ‘development’ in present-day Africa. By engaging with the history of the slave trade and exploring its connections with the use of African labour in contemporary modes of production in West Africa, recent art works from the region that once formed the heartland of the French slave trade can be seen to offer a discursive platform on which to foreground ‘alternative memorial practices and forms of memory-making’<br>

Nowadays, the building stands abandoned.

  Abstract: Boorer explores the theology of an originally independent Priestly narrative (Pg), extending through Genesis-Numbers, as a whole. In this book she describes the structure of the Priestly narrative, in particular its coherent sequential and parallel patterns. Boorer argues that at every point in the narrative's sequential and parallel structure, it reshapes past traditions, synthesizing these with contemporary and unique elements into future visions, in a way that is akin to the timelessness of liturgical texts. The book sheds new light on what this material might have sought to accomplish as a whole, and how it might have functioned for, its original audience.<br>

  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Yaeger Patricia<br>
  Abstract: How has our relation to energy changed over time? What differences do particular energy sources make to human values, politics, and imagination? How have transitions from one energy source to another—from wood to coal, or from oil to solar to whatever comes next—transformed culture and society? What are the implications of uneven access to energy in the past, present, and future? Which concepts and theories clarify our relation to energy, and which just get in the way? Fueling Culture offers a compendium of keywords written by scholars and practitioners from around the world and across the humanities and social sciences. These keywords offer new ways of thinking about energy as both the source and the limit of how we inhabit culture, with the aim of opening up new ways of understanding the seemingly irresolvable contradictions of dependence upon unsustainable energy forms. Fueling Culture brings together writing that is risk-taking and interdisciplinary, drawing on insights from literary and cultural studies, environmental history and ecocriticism, political economy and political ecology, postcolonial and globalization studies, and materialisms old and new.

  Book Title: Supper at Emmaus-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): OLSEN GLENN W.<br>
  Abstract: Supper at Emmaus traces various important intellectual topics from the ancient world to the modern period. Generally, as in its treatment of the question of whether the long-standing contrast between cyclical and linear views of history is helpful, it introduces important thinkers who have considered the question. A preoccupation of the book is the appearance and reappearance across the centuries of patterns used to organize temporal and cultural experience. After an opening essay on transcendental truth and cultural relativism, the second chapter traces a distinction, common in historical writings during the past two centuries, between an alleged ancient classical "cyclic" view of time and history, used to describe the claimed repetitiveness of and similarities between historical events ("nothing is new under the sun"), and a contrasting Jewish-Christian linear view, sometimes described as providential in that it moves through a series of unique events to some end intended by God. In the latter, history is "about something," the education of the human race or the redemption of humankind. As in each of the remaining essays, the book then attempts to draw out the limitations of what the current consensus on this topic has become. It does this for such things as our current understanding of religious toleration, humanism, natural law, and teleology. Some of the essays, such as those on debate about Augustine's understanding of marriage or the concluding illustrated essay on the baroque city of Lecce, are published for the first time. Others are based on previously published contributions to the scholarly literature, though generally each of these chapters concludes with a postscript that engages with current scholarly debate on the subject.<br>

  Abstract: Mainstream public memory is traditionally understood as an intentional recollection of quantifiable facts of the historical past that then constitute collective identity. Because of its suppressed nature, queer memory is flimsier: while mainstream public memory is solidly supported institutionally by politics and history, queer memory is more symbolic, derived from what is implied by exclusion rather than inclusion. By uncovering previously hidden gay and lesbian experiences, queer historians have initiated a type of cultural rebellion, juxtaposing queer memory with hetero-normative histories. The production of this alternative history has evoked a renewed engagement with memory because more traditional methodological approaches to<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter, I will provide an overview of the Cruciform Hermeneutic, which I will further nuance in the following chapter by placing it in the context of the contemporary Theological Interpretation of Scripture (TIS) movement. Since all theological reflection must be done in dialogue with others, past and present, I will first set the stage for my development and defense of the Cruciform Hermeneutic by briefly discussing the views of six scholars whose thinking, to one degree or another, reflects foundational aspects of this hermeneutic.³ I will then proceed to outline three closely related distinctive aspects of the Cruciform<br>

  Book Title: Memories of Asaph-Mnemohistory and the Psalms of Asaph<br>
  Publisher: Fortress Press<br>
  Author(s): Jacobson Karl N.<br>
  Abstract: Although the Psalms of Asaph (Pss. 50, 73‒83) contain a concentration of historical referents unparalleled in the Psalter, they have rarely attracted sustained historical interest. Karl N. Jacobson identifies these Psalms as containing cultic historiography, historical narratives written for recitation in worship, and explores them through mnemohistory, attending to how the past is remembered and to the rhetorical function of recitation in the cultic setting. Asaph “remembers" the past as a movement from henotheism to Yahwism as the core memory that informs a new historical situation for worship participants.<br>

  Book Title: Sin and Evil-Moral Values in Literature<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): PAULSON RONALD<br>
  Abstract: The confusion of sin and evil, or religious and moral transgression, is the subject of Ronald Paulson's latest book. He calls attention to the important distinction between sin and Evil (with a capital E) that in our times is largely ignored, and to the further confusion caused by the term "moral values." Ranging widely through the history of Western literature, Paulson focuses particularly on American and English works of the eighteenth through twentieth centuries to discover how questions of evil and sin-and evil and sinful behavior-have been discussed and represented.The breadth of Paulson's discussion is enormous, taking the reader from Greek and Roman tragedy, to Christian satire in the work of Swift and Hogarth, to Hawthorne's and Melville's novels, and finally to twentieth-century studies of good and evil by such authors as James, Conrad, Faulkner, Greene, Heller, Vonnegut, and O'Brien. Where does evil come from? What are "moral values"? If evil is a cultural construct, what does that imply? Paulson's literary tour of sin and evil over the past two hundred years provides not only a historical perspective but also new ways of thinking about important issues that characterize our own era of violence, intolerance, and war.<br>

  Abstract: In its global approach the book is part of the new shift toward "big history," in which traditional period divisions are challenged in favor of looking at the entire past of the world from start to end. The approach is thematic. The result is a view of world history in which outcomes are shown to be explicable, once they happen, but not necessarily predictable before they do. This book will inform the work of historians of all periods and at all levels, and contributes to the current reconsideration of traditional period divisions (such as Modernity and Postmodernity), which the author finds outmoded.<br>

Yet the nature of this knowledge has varied from one period to another. Ancient writers, both classical and biblical, assumed that the essential patterns of life remained identical and therefore that history provided lasting models for instruction and imitation. Hence the search for historical prototypes of current customs and institutions. Legendary founders of cities, ancestors of existing professions, prehistorical legislators, and establishers of rituals were believed to grant them legitimacy.

  Author(s): SNYDER H. GREGORY<br>
  Abstract: A central figure in the reconception of early Christian history over the last three decades, Wayne A. Meeks offers here a selection of his most influential writings on the New Testament and early Christianity. His essays illustrate recent changes in our thinking about the early Christian movement and pose provocative questions regarding the history of this period.Meeks explores a fascinating range of topics, from the figure of the androgyne in antiquity to the timeless matter of God's reliability, from Paul's ethical rhetoric to New Testament pictures of Christianity's separation from Jewish communities. Meeks' introduction offers a retrospective on New Testament studies of the past thirty years and explains the intersection of these studies with a variety of exploratory and revisionist movements in the humanities, embracing social theory, history, anthropology, and literature. In an epilogue the author reflects on future directions for New Testament scholarship.<br>

  Book Title: Freedom and Time-A Theory of Constitutional Self-Government<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): RUBENFELD JED<br>
  Abstract: Should we try to "live in the present"? Such is the imperative of modernity, Jed Rubenfeld writes in this important and original work of political theory. Since Jefferson proclaimed that "the earth belongs to the living"-since Freud announced that mental health requires people to "get free of their past"-since Nietzsche declared that the happy man is the man who "leaps" into "the moment-modernity has directed its inhabitants to live in the present, as if there alone could they find happiness, authenticity, and above all freedom.But this imperative, Rubenfeld argues, rests on a profoundly inadequate, deforming picture of the relationship between freedom and time. Instead, Rubenfeld suggests, human freedom-human being itself--necessarily extends into both past and future; self-government consists of giving our lives meaning and purpose over time. From this conception of self-government, Rubenfeld derives a new theory of constitutional law's place in democracy. Democracy, he writes, is not a matter of governance by the present "will of the people"; it is a matter of a nation's laying down and living up to enduring political and legal commitments. Constitutionalism is not counter to democracy, as many believe, or a pre-condition of democracy; it is or should be democracy itself--over time. On this basis, Rubenfeld offers a new understanding of constitutional interpretation and of the fundamental right of privacy.<br>

  Book Title: Bearing Witness-Perspectives on War and Peace from the Arts and Humanities<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Johnstone Tiffany<br>
  Abstract: As the centenary of the Great War approaches, citizens worldwide are reflecting on the history, trauma, and losses of a war-torn twentieth century. It is in remembering past wars that we are at once confronted with the profound horror and suffering of armed conflict and the increasing elusiveness of peace. The contributors to Bearing Witness do not presume to resolve these troubling questions, but provoke new kinds of reflection. They explore literature, the arts, history, language, and popular culture to move beyond the language of rhetoric and commemoration provided by politicians and the military. Adding nuance to discussions of war and peace, this collection probes the understanding and insight created in the works of musicians, dramatists, poets, painters, photographers, and novelists, to provide a complex view of the ways in which war is waged, witnessed, and remembered. A compelling and informative collection, Bearing Witness sheds new light on the impact of war and the power of suffering, heroism and memory, to expose the human roots of violence and compassion. Contributors include Heribert Adam (Simon Fraser University), Laura Brandon (Carleton University), Mireille Calle-Gruber (Université La Sorbonne Nouvelle), Janet Danielson (Simon Fraser University), Sandra Djwa (emeritus, Simon Fraser University), Alan Filewod (University of Guelph), Sherrill Grace (University of British Columbia), Patrick Imbert (University of Ottawa), Tiffany Johnstone (PhD Candidate, University of British Columbia), Martin Löschnigg (Graz University), Lauren Lydic (PhD, University of Toronto), Conny Steenman Marcusse (Netherlands), Jonathan Vance (University of Western Ontario), Aritha van Herk (University of Calgary), Peter C. van Wyck (Concordia University), Christl Verduyn (Mount Allison University), and Anne Wheeler (filmmaker).<br>

  Book Title: Constructing Constructive Theology-An Introductory Sketch<br>
  Publisher: Fortress Press<br>
  Author(s): Wyman Jason A.<br>
  Abstract: To date, constructive theology hasn’t been viewed or conceptualized as a movement or trend in theology on its own as a whole. Questions arise as to what constructive theology is, where it came from, why it considers itself “constructive," and why constructive is something different from the ways in which theology has been done in the past. This book traces the overall historical arc of constructive theology, from proto-movement through the present. Inklings of constructive theology emerged well before it began to take any formalized shape. At the same time, an important shift occurred when a group of theologians decided to create the Workgroup on Constructive Theology. Further, even as the workgroup continues to work collectively, producing textbooks, statements, and methodologies concerning theology, many theologians who are not part of the workgroup or may not even know it exists have adopted the moniker of “constructive theologian." The book also considers the term “constructive" itself, offering possible reasons and historical contexts that led to this distinction being made in contrast to “systematic" theology and its subcategories. Constructive theology speaks to a very specific, historically situated emergence in the academy generally and in theology’s attempts to engage those shifts specifically.<br>

  Abstract: Theology, as an academic discipline, has found a comfortable place as a “systematic” endeavor. Responding to the rigors of the academy, historical philosophies, and the Enlightenment and modernity, theology has for the most part produced works systematically, using classic theological doctrinal loci one by one in order to arrive at a coherent, rigorous whole, either through dogmatic theology or systematic theology. Yet in recent years, such a preoccupation hasn’t sustained talk about God as it has in the past. Within theological work, there has always been a constructive element or phase of doing theology; recently, however, a methodological trend has<br>

  Abstract: “Grandfather was not a problem but a solver of problems.”¹ That may be too optimistic a picture of old age in the past. In preliterate societies, the old were valued as “the libraries of the people.” But once societies became literate and devised more efficient means of information retrieval, the elderly no longer had a secure cultural niche. Individuals who retained control of significant resources—active politicians and intellectuals, for example—might be treated with respect. But the common lot of the elderly, in agricultural and industrial societies, was sometimes closer to the cruel marginalization depicted, for example, in Zola’s<br>

  Book Title: Red Legacies in China-Cultural Afterlives of the Communist Revolution<br>

  Author(s): Zhang Enhua<br>
  Abstract: What has contemporary China inherited from its revolutionary past? How do the realities and memories, aesthetics and practices of the Mao era still reverberate in the post-Mao cultural landscape? The essays in this volume propose “red legacies" as a new critical framework from which to examine the profusion of cultural productions and afterlives of the communist revolution in order to understand China’s continuities and transformations from socialism to postsocialism. Organized into five parts—red foundations, red icons, red classics, red bodies, and red shadows—the book’s interdisciplinary contributions focus on visual and performing arts, literature and film, language and thought, architecture, museums, and memorials. Mediating at once unfulfilled ideals and unmourned ghosts across generations, red cultural legacies suggest both inheritance and debt, and can be mobilized to support as well as to critique the status quo.<br>

The Hui regard themselves as an ethnic group, however, and the Chinese state registers them as an official nationality. The Hui are also beginning to play an increasingly important role in the Chinese state’s domestic affairs and in international ethnopolitics. The Hui thus pose an interesting problem<br>

  Abstract: Museums and archives share an inherent objective: to keep memories alive for the future by preserving objects from the past (Pearce, 1995: 249). To realise this goal, they endeavour to prevent the decay – or further decay – of their artefacts by, first, treating these objects with extreme caution and trying, as much as possible, to limit the destructive impact of environmental factors (Pomian, 1988: 14); and, second, cleaning and restoring them, repairing the damage that inevitably accrues over time. Both of these activities can be categorised as part of the ‘preservation process’.<br>

But what in our divided and fragmented world governs our visions or perceptions of the past?

  Book Title: Negative Cosmopolitanism-Cultures and Politics of World Citizenship after Globalization<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): TOMSKY TERRI<br>
  Abstract: From climate change, debt, and refugee crises to energy security, environmental disasters, and terrorism, the events that lead nightly newscasts and drive public policy demand a global perspective. In the twentieth century the world sought solutions through formal institutions of international governance such as the United Nations, the International Criminal Court, and the World Bank, but present-day responses to global realities are often more provisional, improvisational, and contingent. Tracing this uneven history in order to identify principal actors, contesting ideologies, and competing rhetoric, Negative Cosmopolitanism challenges the Kantian ideal of cosmopolitanism as the precondition for a perpetual global peace. Uniting literary scholars with researchers working on contemporary problems and those studying related issues of the past – including slavery, industrial capitalism, and corporate imperialism – essays in this volume scrutinize the entanglement of cosmopolitanism within expanding networks of trade and global capital from the eighteenth century to the present. By doing so, the contributors pinpoint the ways in which whole populations have been unwillingly caught up in a capitalist reality that has little in common with the earlier ideals of cosmopolitanism. A model for provoking new and necessary questions about neoliberalism, biopolitics, colonialism, citizenship, and xenophobia, Negative Cosmopolitanism establishes a fresh take on the representation of globalization and modern life in history and literature.

  Book Title: The Forgiveness to Come-The Holocaust and the Hyper-Ethical<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Berkowitz Roger<br>
  Abstract: Accompanied by Jacques Derrida's thought of forgiveness of the unforgivable, and its elaboration in relation to crimes against humanity, the book undertakes close readings of literary, philosophical, and cinematic texts by Simon Wiesenthal, Jean Améry, Vladimir Jankélévitch, Robert Antelme and Eva Mozes Kor. These texts contend with the idea that the crimes of the Nazis are inexpiable, that they lie beyond any possible atonement or repair. Banki argues that the juridical concept of crimes against humanity calls for a thought of forgiveness-one that would not imply closure of the infinite wounds of the past. How could such a forgiveness be thought or dreamed?

  Book Title: The Origin of the Political-Hannah Arendt or Simone Weil?<br>

  Author(s): Williams Gareth<br>
  Abstract: In Esposito's account Arendt and Weil emerge "in the inverse of the other's thought, in the shadow of the other's light," to "think what the thought of the other excludes not as something that is foreign, but rather as something that appears unthinkable and, for that very reason, remains to be thought." Moving slowly toward their conceptualizations of love and heroism, Esposito unravels the West's illusory metaphysical dream of peace, obliging us to reevaluate ceaselessly what it means to be responsible in the wake of past and contemporary forms of war.<br>

Drawing on insights from anthropology and psychiatry as well as from cognitive psychology, Hunt argues that there are many types of dreams, and he classifies them systematically for the first time.<br>

  Abstract: Nobody admits to liking rhetoric very much. But almost everyone admits to having occasionally been seized and transported by a discourse which changed or influenced their life and priorities. It is a commonplace that such discourse is rare, the exception that proves our (usually untested) rule. But all practices need to have outstanding exemplars, touchstones of accomplishment. And virtually by definition, such outstanding cases will be rare. It is probably not possible to determine whether great or eloquent rhetoric is rarer now than it was in the various golden ages of the past. Nor do I think that the determination,<br>

However, most of these green rereadings have put special emphasis on Dickinson’s and Whitman’s rendition of local areas and people’s steady ties to their environs.

  Abstract: Three things may be said about the lifelong polemic of Maxim Gorky (1868–1936) with Dostoevsky. First, it had deep psychological roots in a confrontation with aspects of his own nature; overcoming Dostoevsky, for Gorky, was a process of self-overcoming. Second, this process of self-overcoming became linked with a central effort of Gorky’s literary and cultural writings—the task of overcoming Russian history, the painful legacy of violence and disorder in Russian man and life, all that he once called “our most implacable enemy—our past.”² And third, this overcoming ultimately took on the dimensions of a struggle between worldviews,<br>

  Book Title: Signs and Society-Further Studies in Semiotic Anthropology<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Parmentier Richard J.<br>
  Abstract: Brilliantly articulating the potent intersections of semiotic and linguistic anthropology, Signs and Society demonstrates how a keen appreciation of signs helps us better understand human agency, meaning, and creativity. Inspired by the foundational contributions of C. S. Peirce and Ferdinand de Saussure, and drawing upon key insights from neighboring scholarly fields, noted anthropologist Richard J. Parmentier develops an array of innovative conceptual tools for ethnographic, historical, and literary research. His concepts of "transactional value," "metapragmatic interpretant," and "circle of semiosis," for example, illuminate the foundations and effects of such diverse cultural forms and practices as economic exchanges on the Pacific island of Palau, Pindar's Victory Odes in ancient Greece, and material representations of transcendence in ancient Egypt and medieval Christianity. Other studies complicate the separation of emic and etic analytical models for such cultural domains as religion, economic value, and semiotic ideology. Provocative and absorbing, these fifteen pioneering essays blaze a trail into anthropology's future while remaining firmly rooted in its celebrated past.<br>

While this focus on the injustices perpetrated against the Palestinians and the need for restitution is tempting, it leaves little room for critical reflection on the experience itself.

  Book Title: The Spirits of Crossbones Graveyard-Time, Ritual, and Sexual Commerce in London<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hausner Sondra L.<br>
  Abstract: Every month, a ragtag group of Londoners gather in the site known as Crossbones Graveyard to commemorate the souls of medieval prostitutes believed to be buried there-the "Winchester Geese," women who were under the protection of the Church but denied Christian burial. In the Borough of Southwark, not far from Shakespeare's Globe, is a pilgrimage site for self-identified misfits, nonconformists, and contemporary sex workers who leave memorials to the outcast dead. Ceremonies combining raucous humor and eclectic spirituality are led by a local playwright, John Constable, also known as John Crow. His interpretation of the history of the site has struck a chord with many who feel alienated in present-day London. Sondra L. Hausner offers a nuanced ethnography of Crossbones that tacks between past and present to look at the historical practices of sex work, the relation of the Church to these professions, and their representation in the present. She draws on anthropological approaches to ritual and time to understand the forms of spiritual healing conveyed by the Crossbones rites. She shows that ritual is a way of creating the present by mobilizing the stories of the past for contemporary purposes.<br>

Or better, groups construct themselves and others against historical frames that produce culture in the present, and that simultaneously reconstruct the events of the past. That is to say: our narratives about the past explain the way we find ourselves circumscribed in the present. History is constructed to explain the present; historical trajectories determine the cultural or symbolic terms of engagement through which group identities are articulated and against which they are defined.

By interpreting the significance of disparate events and integrating them into a coherent account, the disciplinary approaches of history typically assume a formal conception of time, in which a linear chronology can be represented by consciousness. In other words, past events are treated as intentional objects. This synchronization of time entails generalizing from people’s experiences, selectively emphasizing certain elements<br>

Like episcopal law, liturgy also provided a deep connection of the Frankish bishops to the ancient past of the church.

  Author(s) NOVAK MICHAEL<br>
  Abstract: Unless many recent conversations around the country mislead me, intelligent Catholics in significant numbers seem not to be on the same wavelength as Pope John Paul II. In some ways this is odd, because intelligent Catholics usually like an intelligent and articulate pope, and this one is perhaps the most intellectually original, articulate, and prolific pope of the past one hundred years. Some of this discordance results (those who don’t cotton to him sometimes suggest) from their very different reading of Vatican II. Some of it results, they say, from very strong feelings of disagreement about particular questions such as<br>

  Author(s) O’Herron Paul<br>
  Abstract: Metaphors of language sometimes express a reality that stricter and more modest conceptions do not express so well. Moreover, some striking metaphors, such as the “death of God,” can give expression to real conditions in our culture. The intention of this essay is to sketch a current problematic—the widespread acceptance of the absence of God in the cultures of technologically advanced societies of the so-called Western type¹—and to suggest a strategy for a metaphysical intervention in that problematic. The temporal field within which the paper moves is the 
                  process of modernization over the past four hundred years, principally<br>

The mapping of contemporary social organization onto events of the past and the invocation of mythic histories to explain the contemporary relations of social groups is significant in attempting to explain the apparent rank ordering of the social groups.

  Abstract: The theory of the Axial Age is the creation of philosophers and sociologists, not of historians and philologists on whose research the theory is based. It is the answer to the question for the roots of modernity. When and where did the modern world begin as we know and inhabit it? The historian investigates the past for the sake of the past. The quest for the roots of modernity, however, is not interested in the past as such but only as the beginning of something held to be characteristic of the present.

While these countries have had poor growth performance over the past two decades, improvement in access to natural resources is one area where there is potential for significant economic gains. This paper argues that subsistence affluence is non-existent in these countries and that their future prosperity depends on engagement in international trade, including inflows of foreign investment capital.

  Book Title: Aquinas, Feminism, and the Common Good-  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): DeCrane Susanne M.<br>
  Abstract: To dismiss the work of philosophers and theologians of the past because of their limited perceptions of the whole of humankind is tantamount to tossing the tot out with the tub water. Such is the case when feminist scholars of religion and ethics confront Thomas Aquinas, whose views of women can only be described as misogynistic. Rather than dispense with him, Susanne DeCrane seeks to engage Aquinas and reflect his otherwise compelling thought through the prism of feminist theology, hermeneutics, and ethics. Focusing on one of Aquinas's great intellectual contributions, the fundamental notion of "the common good"-in short, the human will toward peace and justice-DeCrane demonstrates the currency of that notion through a contemporary social issue: women's health care in the United States and, specifically, black women and breast cancer. In her skillful re-engagement with Aquinas, DeCrane shows that certain aspects of religious traditions heretofore understood as oppressive to women and minority groups can actually be parsed, "retrieved," and used to rectify social ills.
      Aquinas, Feminism, and the Common Goodis a bold and intellectually rigorous feminist retrieval of an important text by a Catholic scholar seeking to remain in the tradition, while demanding that the tradition live up to its emphasis on human equity and justice.<br>

  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Shain Yossi<br>
  Abstract: Only recently have international relations scholars started to seriously examine the influence of collective memory on foreign policy formation and relations between states and peoples. The ways in which the memories of past events are interpreted, misinterpreted, or even manipulated in public discourse create the context that shapes international relations.
      Power and the Pastbrings together leading history and international relations scholars to provide a groundbreaking examination of the impact of collective memory. This timely study makes a contribution to developing a theory of memory and international relations and also examines specific cases of collective memory's influence resulting from the legacies of World War II, the Holocaust, and September 11. Addressing concerns shared by world leaders and international institutions as well as scholars of international studies, this volume illustrates clearly how the memory of past events alters the ways countries interact in the present, how memory shapes public debate and policymaking, and how memory may aid or more frequently impede conflict resolution.<br>

  Abstract: In sharp reversal of the monolithic imagination of national identity projected for so long by the culturally levelling discourses of Francoism, Spanishness, for the past two decades, has been actively constructed in terms of multiplicity and synchronicity. Any location of identity thus rests on the historically contingent axes of temporal and spatial parts. In this scattered and fragmented cultural landscape, the modern imagination of nation necessarily cedes to a more ambivalent vision of collective identity, one that allows for a more adept navigation through the disjuncture of postmodernity. Ironically, therefore, this has meant the return to the concept of community.<br>

  Book Title: The Uncertain Sciences-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mazlish Bruce<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging book one of the most esteemed cultural historians of our time turns his attention to major questions about human experience and the attempts to understand it "scientifically." Bruce Mazlish considers the achievements, failings, and possibilities of the human sciences-a domain that he broadly defines to include the social sciences, literature, psychology, and hermeneutic studies. In a rich and original synthesis built upon the work of earlier philosophers and historians, Mazlish constructs a new view of the nature and meaning of the human sciences.Starting with the remote human past and moving through the Age of Discovery to the present day, the author discusses what sort of knowledge the human sciences claim to offer. He looks closely at the positivistic aspirations of the human sciences, which are modeled after the natural sciences, and at their interpretive tendencies. In an analysis of scientific method and scientific community, he explores the roles they can or should assume in the human sciences. Mazlish's approach is genuinely interdisciplinary, and he draws on an array of topics, from civil society to globalization to the interactions of humans and machines, to inform his thought-provoking discussion of historical consciousness.<br>

  Author(s): Evdokimova Svetlana<br>
  Abstract: This book explores the historical insights of Alexander Pushkin (1799-1837), Russia's most celebrated poet and arguably its greatest thinker. Svetlana Evdokimova examines for the first time the full range of Pushkin's fictional and nonfictional writings on the subject of history-writings that have strongly influenced Russians' views of themselves and their past. Through new readings of his drama,
      Boris Godunov; such narrative poems asPoltava, The Bronze Horseman,andCount Nulin; prose fiction, includingThe Captain's DaughterandBlackamoor of Peter the Great; lyrical poems; and a variety of nonfictional texts, the author presents Pushkin not only as a progenitor of Russian national mythology but also as an original historical and political thinker.Evdokimova considers Pushkin within the context of Romantic historiography and addresses the tension between Pushkin the historian and Pushkin the fiction writer . She also discusses Pushkin's ideas on the complex relations between chance and necessity in historical processes, on the particular significance of great individuals in Russian history, and on historical truth.<br>

  Book Title: Rhetorical Invention and Religious Inquiry-New Perspectives<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): OLMSTED WENDY<br>
  Abstract: This exceptional collection of writings offers for the first time a discussion among leading thinkers about the points at which rhetoric and religion illuminate and challenge each other. The contributors to the volume are eminent theorists and critics in rhetoric, theology, and religion, and they address a variety of problems and periods.Together these writings shed light on religion as a human quest and rhetoric as the origin and sustainer of that quest. They show that when pursued with intelligence and sensitivity, rhetorical approaches to religion are capable of revitalizing both language and experience. Rhetorical figures, for example, constitute forms of language that say what cannot be said in any other way, and that move individuals toward religious truths that cannot be known in any other way. When firmly placed within religious, social, and literary history, the convergence of rhetoric and religion brings into focus crucial issues in several fields-including philosophy, psychology, history, and art-and interprets relations among self, language, and world that are central to both past and present cultures.<br>

  Book Title: Faces of History-Historical Inquiry from Herodotus to Herder<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): KELLEY DONALD R.<br>
  Abstract: In this book, one of the world's leading intellectual historians offers a critical survey of Western historical thought and writing from the pre-classical era to the late eighteenth century. Donald R. Kelley focuses on persistent themes and methodology, including questions of myth, national origins, chronology, language, literary forms, rhetoric, translation, historical method and criticism, theory and practice of interpretation, cultural studies, philosophy of history, and "historicism."Kelley begins by analyzing the dual tradition established by the foundational works of Greek historiography-Herodotus's broad cultural and antiquarian inquiry and the contrasting model of Thucydides' contemporary political and analytical narrative. He then examines the many variations on and departures from these themes produced in writings from Greek, Roman, Jewish, and Christian antiquity, in medieval chronicles, in national histories and revisions of history during the Renaissance and Reformation, and in the rise of erudite and enlightened history in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Throughout, Kelley discusses how later historians viewed their predecessors, including both supporters and detractors of the authors in question.The book, which is a companion volume to Kelley's highly praised anthology
      Versions of History from Antiquity to the Enlightenment,will be a valuable resource for scholars and students interested in interpretations of the past.<br>

  Abstract: The Middle Ages, which was itself a terminological creation of Renaissance humanism, had a strong sense of the past, as the work of Dante, torn between pagan and Christian Rome (and wanting to enjoy the best of both worlds), abundantly illustrates. Scholars in the Middle Ages also had an appreciation of classical historiography, including the rhetorical forms and values on which this rested. Yet this historical sense was selective and subordinated to deep religious commitments and inhibitions which frustrated both a discriminating perspective on the ancient world and a clear perception of the differences that separated a remote “antiquity” from<br>

Like the phenomenon of time, the question is itself at once familiar and obscure. We are all conversant with the experience of living in the present, as distinct from having existed in the past and being about to do so in the future, barring some unexpected accident. Let us say that the lived present has a certain thickness or what Bergson called

  Abstract: Increasingly sophisticated research methods promise results from systematic investigations that are more psychoanalytically significant than those of past investigations. However, systematic investigation in psychoanalysis is unfortunately associated in many analysts’ minds, and also in the minds of many friends and foes of psychoanalysis, with a long history of fault finding. This attitude is epitomized in the criticisms of Eysenck (1952, 1966), Hook (1959), Grünbaum (1984, 1994), and Crews and colleagues (1995).

With the former, there is a significant caveat. Qohelet is part of a mode of literature called wisdom literature. By its very nature, wisdom literature is resistant to such investigation.¹ That is because it is focused not on recording and interpreting events in the past but rather on the cognitive and moral development of its audience.

  Abstract: In French-language Maghrebi literature, the relationship between Jews and Muslims is a question of particular resonance, in that the colonial past weighs heavily on contemporary history. Both Jewish and Muslim writers have achieved fame in the field, weaving, in the same language, connections based on places that, despite antagonisms, have sometimes shaped shared spaces. Since the conflictual alterity of the 1950s, that literature has evolved toward new dialogical expressions imposed by the rise of the different fundamentalisms, by way of the trials of nationalism in the 1960s and the international issues associated with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

  Book Title: Shattered Voices-Language, Violence, and the Work of Truth Commissions<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Phelps Teresa Godwin<br>
  Abstract: Following periods of mass atrocity and oppression, states are faced with a question of critical importance in the transition to democracy: how to offer redress to victims of the old regime without perpetuating cycles of revenge. Traditionally, balance has been restored through arrests, trials, and punishment, but in the last three decades, more than twenty countries have opted to have a truth commission investigate the crimes of the prior regime and publish a report about the investigation, often incorporating accounts from victims. Although many praise the work of truth commissions for empowering and healing through words rather than violence, some condemn the practice as a poor substitute for traditional justice, achieved through trials and punishment. There has been until now little analysis of the unarticulated claim that underlies the truth commissions' very existence: that language-in this case narrative stories-can substitute for violence. Acknowledging revenge as a real and deep human need,
      Shattered Voicesexplores the benefits and problems inherent when a fragile country seeks to heal its victims without risking its own future. In developing a theory about the role of language in retribution, Teresa Godwin Phelps takes an interdisciplinary approach, delving into sources from Greek tragedy toHamlet, from Kant to contemporary theories about retribution, from the Babylonian law codes to the South African Truth and Reconciliation Report. She argues that, given the historical and psychological evidence about revenge, starting afresh by drawing a bright line between past crimes and a new government is both unrealistic and unwise. When grievous harm happens, a rebalancing is bound to occur, whether it is orderly and lawful or disorderly and unlawful.Shattered Voicescontends that language is requisite to any adequate balancing, and that a solution is viable only if it provides an atmosphere in which storytelling and subsequent dialogue can flourish.

Unlike the Latin American commissions, which were rebuilding moral and political communities that had at least in theory preexisted the periods of oppression, the South African commission was creating an entirely new and hitherto inconceivable state that had never existed on the southern cape of Africa. The postapartheid South African government was committed to building a bridge between the past and the present, a link that fully acknowledged the harms that had occurred during the reign of apartheid and the new society that embraced equality.

  Book Title: Homo Narrans-The Poetics and Anthropology of Oral Literature<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Niles John D.<br>
  Abstract: It would be difficult to imagine what human life would be like without stories-from myths recited by Pueblo Indian healers in the kiva, ballads sung in Slovenian market squares, folktales and legends told by the fireside in Italy, to jokes told at a dinner table in Des Moines-for it is chiefly through storytelling that people possess a past. In
      Homo NarransJohn D. Niles explores how human beings shape their world through the stories they tell. The book vividly weaves together the study of Anglo-Saxon literature and culture with the author's own engagements in the field with some of the greatest twentieth-century singers and storytellers in the Scottish tradition. Niles ponders the nature of the storytelling impulse, the social function of narrative, and the role of individual talent in oral tradition. His investigation of the poetics of oral narrative encompasses literary works, such as the epic poems and hymns of early Greece and the Anglo-SaxonBeowulf, texts that we know only through written versions but that are grounded in oral technique. That all forms of narrative, even the most sophisticated genres of contemporary fiction, have their ultimate origin in storytelling is a point that scarcely needs to be argued. Niles's claims here are more ambitious: that oral narrative is and has long been the chief basis of culture itself, that the need to tell stories is what distinguishes humans from all other living creatures.<br>

  Abstract: Special EURO 10,- discount for our ABG readers: now EURO 24,50 instead of EURO 34,50Performing the Past is an investigation of the multiple social and culture practices through which Europeans have negotiated the space between their history and their memory over the past 200 years. In museums, in opera houses, in the streets, in the schools, in theatres, in films, on the internet and beyond, narratives about the past circulate today at a dizzying speed. Producing and selling them is big business; if the past is indeed a foreign country, there are tens of thousands of tourist agents, guides, and pundits around to help us on our way, for a fee, to be sure.This collection of essays by renowned scholars from, among others, Yale, Columbia, Amsterdam Oxford, Cambridge, New York University and the European University Institute in Florence, is essential reading for anyone interested in today's memory boom. Drawing on different national and disciplinary traditions, the authors ultimately engage us with the ways in which Europeans continue a venerable tradition of finding out who they are, and where they are going, by performing the past.<br>

  Book Title: Sound Souvenirs-Audio Technologies, Memory and Cultural Practices<br>
  Publisher: Amsterdam University Press<br>
  Author(s): van Dijck José<br>
  Abstract: In recent decades, the importance of sound for remembering the past and for creating a sense of belonging has been increasingly acknowledged. We keep "sound souvenirs" such as cassette tapes and long play albums in our attics because we want to be able to recreate the music and everyday sounds we once cherished. Artists and ordinary listeners deploy the newest digital audio technologies to recycle past sounds into present tunes. Sound and memory are inextricably intertwined, not just through the commercially exploited nostalgia on oldies radio stations, but through the exchange of valued songs by means of pristine recordings and cultural practices such as collecting, archiving and listing. This book explores several types of cultural practices involving the remembrance and restoration of past sounds. At the same time, it theorizes the cultural meaning of collecting, recycling, reciting, and remembering sound and music. This title is available in the OAPEN Library - http://www.oapen.org.<br>

  Abstract: There is a tendency to think of sound souvenirs, whether recorded sounds, music, or song lyrics, as having the ability to produce memory effects in the listeners. Sound technologies, too, are often conceived as “metaphors of memory” and new technologies can generate nostalgia for superseded formats (Draaisma 2000). In these instances, the construction of sounds as offering traces of the past depends on external, physical objects. In what follows, however, I propose to examine the role of sound within personal and social contexts of remembering. Despite recent attempts to address witnesses as embodied subjects (Brison 1999; Young 2003), the common<br>

  Book Title: Poetry as Survival-  Publisher: University of Georgia Press<br>
  Author(s): ORR GREGORY<br>
  Abstract: Intended for general readers and for students and scholars of poetry, Poetry as Survival is a complex and lucid analysis of the powerful role poetry can play in confronting, surviving, and transcending pain and suffering. Gregory Orr draws from a generous array of sources. He weaves discussions of work by Keats, Dickinson, and Whitman with quotes from three-thousand-year-old Egyptian poems, Inuit songs, and Japanese love poems to show that writing personal lyric has helped poets throughout history to process emotional and experiential turmoil, from individual stress to collective grief. More specifically, he considers how the acts of writing, reading, and listening to lyric bring ordering powers to the chaos that surrounds us. Moving into more contemporary work, Orr looks at the poetry of Sylvia Plath, Stanley Kunitz, and Theodore Roethke, poets who relied on their own work to get through painful psychological experiences. As a poet who has experienced considerable trauma--especially as a child--Orr refers to the damaging experiences of his past and to the role poetry played in his ability to recover and survive. His personal narrative makes all the more poignant and vivid Orr's claims for lyric poetry's power as a tool for healing. Poetry as Survival is a memorable and inspiring introduction to lyric poetry's capacity to help us find safety and comfort in a threatening world.<br>

  Book Title: Political Creativity-Reconfiguring Institutional Order and Change<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Hattam Victoria<br>
  Abstract: Drawing on the rich cache of antidualist theoretical traditions, from poststructuralism and ecological theory to constructivism and pragmatism, a diverse group of scholars probes acts of social innovation in many locations: land boards in Botswana, Russian labor relations, international statistics, global supply chains, Islamic economics in Algeria, Islamic sects and state authority in Senegal, and civil rights reform, colonization, industrial policy, and political consulting in the United States. These political scientists reconceptualize
         agencyas a relational process that continually reorders the nature and meaning of people and things,orderas an assemblage that necessitates creative tinkering and interpretation, andchangeas the unruly politics of time that confounds the conventional ordering of past, present, and future.Political Creativityoffers analytical tools for reimagining order and change as entangled processes.<br>

  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Fraleigh Sondra<br>
  Abstract: Fraleigh's brilliantly inventive fusions of philosophy and movement clarify often complex philosophical issues and apply them to dance history and aesthetics. She illustrates her discussions with photographs, dance descriptions, and stories from her own past in order to bridge dance with everyday movement. Seeking to recombine the fractured and bifurcated conceptions of the body and of the senses that dominate much Western discourse, she reveals how metaphysical concepts are embodied and presented in dance, both on stage and in therapeutic settings.<br>

  Book Title: A Self-Conscious Art-Patrick Modiano’s Postmodern Fictions<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): KAWAKAMI AKANE<br>
  Abstract: A Self-Conscious Art is the first full-length study in English to attempt to deal with the formal complexities of Modiano’s work, by reading ‘against the grain’ of his self-professed ingenuousness. A detailed examination of his narratives shows the deeply postmodern nature of his writing. Parodying precursors such as Proust or the nouveau romanciers, his narratives are built around a profound lack of faith in the ability of writing to retrieve the past through memory, and this failure is acknowledged in the discreet playfulness that characterises his novels. This book is a timely introduction to the work of one of the most successful modern French novelists.<br>

Chapters and paragraphs frequently start with a date reference: ‘Hier, 1er octobre de dix-neuf cent quatre-vingt quatorze, je suis revenu chez moi, de la place d’Italie, par le mètro.’¹ Or: ‘J’ai connu Francis Jansen quand j’avais dix-neuf ans, au printemps de 1964 . . .’² These are especially useful given that Modiano’s novels all deal with explorations into the past, various levels of the past, made accessible through long flashbacks.<br>

After all, the action of taking one step forward, two steps back can be understood in temporal as well as spatial terms, and in Carson’s writing the past typically manifests itself as ‘a trail of moments/Dislocated, then located’ (

  Abstract: Over the past two decades, postcolonial studies – or postcolonial theory – has firmly established itself within the Anglophone academy. In France, however, the perception of this critical body of thought labours under a certain number of misconceptions that have rendered the development of an equivalent ‘hexagonal’ movement deeply problematic, and have given rise instead to a determined opposition in the general ‘intellectual field’. By ‘intellectual field’ we mean the broad domain constituted by publications and debates in the social sciences, particularly sociology, history, political sciences and, more marginally, anthropology.

  Book Title: Translating Life-Studies in Transpositional Aesthetics<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): STEAD ALISTAIR<br>
  Abstract: This volume brings together eighteen substantial essays by distinguished scholars, critics and translators, and two interviews with eminent figures of British theatre, to explore the idea and practice of translation. The individual, but conceptually related, contributions examine topics from the Renaissance to the present in the context of apt exploration of the translation process, invoking both restricted and extended senses of translation. The endeavour is to study in detail the theory, workings and implications of what might be called the art of creative transposition, effective at the level of interlingual transcoding, dynamic rewriting, theatrical and cinematic adaptation, intersemiotic or intermedial translation, and cultural exchange. Many of the essays focus on aspects of intertextuality, the dialogue with text, past and present, as they bear on the issue of translation, attending to the historical, political or cultural dimensions of the practice, whether it illuminates a gendered reading of a text or a staging of cultural difference. The historic and generic range of the discussions is wide, encompassing the Elizabethan epyllion, Sensibility fiction, Victorian poetry and prose, modern and postmodern novels, but the book is dominated by dramatic or performance-related applications, with major representation of fresh investigations into Shakespeare (from A Midsummer Night’s Dream to The Tempest) and foregrounding of acts of self-translation on stage, in the dramatic monologue and in fiction. Contributions from theatre practitioners such as Sir Peter Hall, John Barton and Peter Lichtenfels underscore the immense practical importance of the translator on the stage and the business of both acting and directing as a species of translation.<br>

  Abstract: The subtitle of Hazlitt’s
                  Liber Amoris; or, the New Pygmalion, published anonymously in 1823, promises a retelling of Ovid’s Augustan myth of transformation set in Regency England, a translation from classical to modern times. Unlike Ovid’s poetic invention of a distant mythological past, Hazlitt’s prose version takes place in the quotidian world of London’s lodging houses. However, early nineteenth-century London has no pagan Venus who can effect the metamorphosis required by Hazlitt’s narrator. Obviously, like Mary Shelley’sFrankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus(1818), the subtitle is ironic, and questions the pertinence of classical mythology to the modern world. There is<br>

  Abstract: Over the past two decades, we have witnessed what Françoise Lionnet has termed the ‘becoming-transnational’ of French Studies.¹ French and the other modern languages had originally been constructed as academic subjects around the framework of the nineteenth-century European nation-state but, as the primacy of the nation state has come to be challenged in the era of globalisation, this structure has been increasingly questioned by scholars working from transnational, global and postcolonial perspectives.² The prominent North American critic Lawrence Kritzman has been prompted to ask, in light of these developments, whether the very existence of French Studies is now in question:<br>

  Book Title: The Allure of the Archives-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Davis Natalie Zemon<br>
  Abstract: Arlette Farge's
      Le Goût de l'archiveis widely regarded as a historiographical classic. While combing through two-hundred-year-old judicial records from the Archives of the Bastille, historian Farge was struck by the extraordinarily intimate portrayal they provided of the lives of the poor in pre-Revolutionary France, especially women. She was seduced by the sensuality of old manuscripts and by the revelatory power of voices otherwise lost. InThe Allure of the Archives, she conveys the exhilaration of uncovering hidden secrets and the thrill of venturing into new dimensions of the past.Originally published in 1989, Farge's classic work communicates the tactile, interpretive, and emotional experience of archival research while sharing astonishing details about life under the Old Regime in France. At once a practical guide to research methodology and an elegant literary reflection on the challenges of writing history, this uniquely rich volume demonstrates how surrendering to the archive's allure can forever change how we understand the past.<br>

In doing so, they take an important step toward creating a society that reconciles scientific inquiry with the human spirit. This book, which marks the one hundredth anniversary of The Terry Lecture Series, offers a unique perspective for anyone interested in the debate between science and religion in America.<br>

  Abstract: Genre Fusion opens with a straightforward overview of the relationships among history, fiction, and memory in contemporary culture. While providing an up-to-date context for scholarly debates about Spain’s historical memory, Genre Fusion also expands the contours of the discussion beyond the specialized territory of Hispanic studies. To demonstrate the theoretical necessity of genre fusion, Brenneis analyzes pairs of interconnected texts (one a work of literature, the other a work of historiography) written by a single author. She explores how fictional and nonfictional works by Montserrat Roig, Carmen Martín Gaite, Carlos Blanco Aguinaga, and Javier Marías unearth the collective memories of Spain’s past.<br>

  Author(s) Toyoko Izutsu<br>
  Abstract: In Japan the category “twentieth-century philosophy” is reserved by and large for philosophical thought as it is found in Europe and the United States, and for Japanese engagement with it. When writing of their own intellectual history, Japanese scholars tend to follow the same divisions as Japanese history in general. This means that philosophers of the past hundred years are located either in the imperial era in which they flourished (Meiji, Taishō, Shōwa, Heisei); in their relationship to Japanese “modernity” (the establishment of Japan as a modern nation dating from the
                  Charter Oath, a proto-Constitution promulgated in 1868); or, in<br>

How do I academically distinguish between Joe’s emotions, my emotions and the biography? How do I write over and around my own emotional responses? And on the other hand—on the Maori hand—should I? With its appreciation of subjectivity, does Maori scholarship seek some connection. . . . But then,<br>

  Book Title: Relative Histories-Mediating History in Asian American Family Memoirs<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Davis Rocío G.<br>
  Abstract: Relative Histories focuses on the Asian American memoir that specifically recounts the story of at least three generations of the same family. This form of auto/biography concentrates as much on other members of one’s family as on oneself, generally collapses the boundaries conventionally established between biography and autobiography, and in many cases—as Rocío G. Davis proposes for the auto/biographies of ethnic writers—crosses the frontier into history, promoting collective memory. Davis centers on how Asian American family memoirs expand the limits and function of life writing by reclaiming history and promoting community cohesion. She argues that identity is shaped by not only the stories we have been told, but also the stories we tell, making these narratives important examples of the ways we remember our family’s past and tell our community’s story. In the context of auto/biographical writing or filmmaking that explores specific ethnic experiences of diaspora, assimilation, and integration, this work considers two important aspects: These texts re-imagine the past by creating a work that exists both in history and as a historical document, making the creative process a form of re-enactment of the past itself. Each chapter centers on a thematic concern germane to the Asian American experience: the narrative of twentieth-century Asian wars and revolutions, which has become the subtext of a significant number of Asian American family memoirs (Pang-Mei Natasha Chang’s Bound Feet and Western Dress, May-lee and Winberg Chai’s The Girl from Purple Mountain, K. Connie Kang’s Home Was The Land of Morning Calm, Doung Van Mai Elliott’s The Sacred Willow); family experiences of travel and displacement within Asia in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which unveil a history of multiple diasporas that are often elided after families immigrate to the United States (Helie Lee’s Still Life With Rice, Jael Silliman’s Jewish Portraits, Indian Frames, Mira Kamdar’s M~<br>

  Book Title: Making Transcendents-Ascetics and Social Memory in Early Medieval China<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Campany Robert Ford<br>
  Abstract: By the middle of the third century B.C.E. in China there were individuals who sought to become transcendents (xian)—deathless, godlike beings endowed with supernormal powers. This quest for transcendence became a major form of religious expression and helped lay the foundation on which the first Daoist religion was built. Both xian and those who aspired to this exalted status in the centuries leading up to 350 C.E. have traditionally been portrayed as secretive and hermit-like figures. This groundbreaking study offers a very different view of xian-seekers in late classical and early medieval China. It suggests that transcendence did not involve a withdrawal from society but rather should be seen as a religious role situated among other social roles and conceived in contrast to them. Robert Campany argues that the much-discussed secrecy surrounding ascetic disciplines was actually one important way in which practitioners presented themselves to others. He contends, moreover, that many adepts were not socially isolated at all but were much sought after for their power to heal the sick, divine the future, and narrate their exotic experiences.

A gulf separates these cultures from those Steven Shapin and Peter Burke have recently argued arose only in early modern times (in Europe at least), wherein truth-telling and the art of civil conversation among gentlemen formed the basis of a new epistemological decorum, and where lying and secrecy came to be seen as violations of a code of honor.¹ Over the past century scholars beginning with<br>

  Book Title: The Subject in Crisis in Contemporary Chinese Literature-  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Cai Rong<br>
  Abstract: Post-Mao China produced two parallel discourses on the human subject in the New Era (1976–1989). One was an autonomous, Enlightenment humanist self aimed at replacing the revolutionary paragon that had dominated under Mao. The other was a more problematic subject suffering from either a symbolic physical deformity or some kind of spiritual paralysis that undermines its apparent normalcy. How do we explain the stubborn presence, in the literature of the 1980s and 1990s, of this crippled agent who fails to realize the humanist autonomy envisioned by post-Mao theorists? What are the anxieties and tensions embedded in this incongruity and what do they reveal? This illuminating and original critical study of the crippled subject in post-Mao literature offers a detailed textual analysis of the work of five well-known contemporary writers: Han Shaogong, Can Xue, Yu Hua, Mo Yan, and Jia Pingwa. The author investigates not only the literary characters within the texts, but also their creators—real subjects in history, Chinese writers whose own agency was being tested and established in the search for a new subjectivity. She argues that, reenacting the Maoist legacy, the literary search failed to provide a viable model for a postrevolutionary China. In addition, the deficiency and inadequacy of the subject cannot always be contained in the Communist past—a history to be transcended in the design of modernity after Mao. The representation of the problematic subject thus punctured post-Mao optimism and foreshadowed the eventual abandonment of the move to rethink subjectivity in the 1990s. By diving beneath the euphoria of the 1980s and the confusion and frustration of the 1990s, these critical readings offer a unique perspective with which to gauge the complexity of China’s quest for modernity and a fuller understanding of the self’s multifaceted experience in the post-Mao era.<br>

  Book Title: Heian Japan, Centers and Peripheries-  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): MATSUMOTO STACIE<br>
  Abstract: The first three centuries of the Heian period (794–1086) saw some of its most fertile innovations and epochal achievements in Japanese literature and the arts. It was also a time of important transitions in the spheres of religion and politics, as aristocratic authority was consolidated in Kyoto, powerful court factions and religious institutions emerged, and adjustments were made in the Chinese-style system of ruler-ship. At the same time, the era’s leaders faced serious challenges from the provinces that called into question the primacy and efficiency of the governmental system and tested the social/cultural status quo. Heian Japan, Centers and Peripheries, the first book of its kind to examine the early Heian from a wide variety of multidisciplinary perspectives, offers a fresh look at these seemingly contradictory trends. Essays by fourteen leading American, European, and Japanese scholars of art history, history, literature, and religions take up core texts and iconic images, cultural achievements and social crises, and the ever-fascinating patterns and puzzles of the time. The authors tackle some of Heian Japan’s most enduring paradigms as well as hitherto unexplored problems in search of new ways of understanding the currents of change as well as the processes of institutionalization that shaped the Heian scene, defined the contours of its legacies, and make it one of the most intensely studied periods of the Japanese past.<br>

A final essay examines why this advocate of a "tranquil universal philosophy" ended up being burned at the stake as a heretic by the Roman Inquisition. While the essays take many different approaches, they are united by a number of assumptions: that, although well versed in magic, Bruno cannot be defined primarily as a Renaissance Magus; that his aim was to articulate a new philosophy of nature; and that his thought, while based on ancient and medieval sources, represented a radical rupture with the philosophical schools of the past, helping forge a path toward a new modernity.<br>

If “sacred literature” could not be rejected, only interpreted, hermeneutical strategies had to be devised to accommodate Biblical texts to an ascetic agenda: through delicate mining, recalcitrant passages would yield up treasures for the ascetic program.

To this end, the original essays by leading experts are retained and revised, and supplemented by contributions from a new generation of Brahms scholars. Together, they consider such topics as Brahms's relationship with Clara and Robert Schumann, his musical interactions with the "New German School" of Wagner and Liszt, his influence upon Arnold Schoenberg and other young composers, his approach to performing his own music, and his productive interactions with visual artists.<br>

                  notwish to recall. Sometimes if one is quick and nimble enough, one can even catch the process of “reconstructing” one’s past in memory on the hop, that is, one can recall the original impression and also the gradual way in which it began to fade, shift, and be transformed. Very occasionally, the original experience is so vivid, one cannot help thinking it is preserved in the mind in a form that excludes serious error or uncertainty<br>

  Book Title: The Skeptic Disposition-Deconstruction, Ideology, and Other Matters<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Goodheart Eugene<br>
  Abstract: Eugene Goodheart examines the skeptic disposition that has informed advanced literary discourse over the past generation, arguing that the targets of deconstructive suspicion are fundamental humanistic values. "[This book] is a fair-minded, generous critique of the deconstructionist theories of Jacques Derrida, Paul de Man, and their followers. These writers have argued that language is so inherently slippery it can never express a speaker's intended meaning. The critic's role, in their view, is to explore the contradictions, subtexts, and metaphorical byways of works that may be most radically deceptive when they appear simple. Critics have castigated this language-centered skepticism as a form of nihilism geared to multiply numbingly similar readings of already familiar texts. Mr. Goodheart's objection is more subtle. He suggests that the philosophical orientation of deconstructive critics leads them to overemphasize the tricky propositional sense of words at the expense of the broader impact of literature--its power to wound, thrill, or transform us."--Morris Dickstein, The New York Times Book Review<br>

Perhaps most important, recent anthropological writing has called into question the legitimacy with which we represent the “Other” in cultural written accounts. Indeed, insights gained into the nature of representation and power relations have made impossible the comfortable assumption that other cultures can be grasped, categorized, and put on paper.

  Abstract: Since the 1960s, social ethics has assumed increasing importance in the theological education, pastoral practice, and ministry of the Christian churches. One of the reasons for this development is the recognition that in the past the churches tended to identify themselves, consciously or unconsciously, with the societies in which they lived and, more especially, with the ruling powers or dominant ideologies. Although individual Christians and critical Christian movements gave prophetic witness in their societies, the churches as a whole tended to remain silent in the face of the injustices practised by their societies.

Munro, like Gallant, insists that the past must be evaluated and re-evaluated and that memory — though not equivalent to truth — is the most important source of knowledge, of a necessarily fictional truth. Gallant’s characters often learn very little of the lessons she urges her readers to learn; we acquire insights about memory, history, truth, and writing by interpreting the ironic narrative stance employed in her fiction.<br>

  Book Title: Popular Historiographies in the 19th and 20th Centuries-Cultural Meanings, Social Practices<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Paletschek Sylvia<br>
  Abstract: Popular presentations of history have recently been discovered as a new field of research, and even though interest in it has been growing noticeably very little has been published on this topic. This volume is one of the first to open up this new area of historical research, introducing some of the work that has emerged in Germany over the past few years. While mainly focusing on Germany (though not exclusively), the authors analyze different forms of popular historiographies and popular presentations of history since 1800 and the interrelation between popular and academic historiography, exploring in particular popular histories in different media and popular historiography as part of memory culture.<br>

  Author(s) Brüggemeier Franz-Josef<br>
  Abstract: The nineteenth century has many names: the century of the bourgeoisie, the century of nations, the century of industrialization, and the century of natural science and technology.¹ However, it might just as well be called the century of history. From the late eighteenth century on, the engagement with the past, and particularly with ‘patriotic’ history (
                  vaterländischer Geschichte), was an important means of shaping individual and collective identity. After the collapse of theAlte Reich(the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation) in 1803–1806, and following the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the German states in their new patchwork<br>

  Abstract: For France, the quarter-century between the end of World War II and the early 1970s was a period of extremely rapid social change – economic, political and demographic – which informed the lived experience of millions of individuals. These years were characterised particularly by the strong pull of a new modernity, in difficult and often acute tension with the past. The new emerged, but strongly informed by the old, as well as by the progressive and oppressive possibilities of a new, fast-moving, consumerised culture that expanded in the context of a remarkable and sustained economic boom.

  Abstract: In the past twenty-five years, the custom has developed to memorialize victims of tragedy and disaster by the creation of spontaneous shrines or performative memorials at or near the site, which has today become so common that Erica Doss calls the phenomenon “memorial mania” (Doss 2008b). Because of the emotional intensity of the context in which they are created, these shrines express the immediate prevailing local worldview. Generally, they are anonymous, communal creations that conform to community standards and mores. As one researcher remarked about the Columbine shrines, “Memorials are only as powerful as the community they seek to honor<br>

First, I oppose the strong separation of material and symbolic that appears to be the parochial inheritance of Cartesianism in social anthropology, and regard it as an intellectual proxy for relegating certain groups of people into past time or primitive status—Fabian’s (1983) “allochronism.” However much some of our colleagues seek to avoid the problem by waggling apostrophe-like fingers every time they use the taboo word “primitive,” they do not avoid the problem by ironizing it or by seeming to bury it in a self-deprecating gesture: it is apparently as hard to<br>

  Book Title: Protest Beyond Borders-Contentious Politics in Europe since 1945<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Romanos Eduardo<br>
  Abstract: The protest movements that followed the Second World War have recently become the object of study for various disciplines; however, the exchange of ideas between research fields, and comparative research in general, is lacking. An international and interdisciplinary dialogue is vital to not only describe the similarities and differences between the single national movements but also to evaluate how they contributed to the formation and evolution of a transnational civil society in Europe. This volume undertakes this challenge as well as questions some major assumptions of post-1945 protest and social mobilization both in Western and Eastern Europe. Historians, political scientists, sociologists and media studies scholars come together and offer insights into social movement research beyond conventional repertoires of protest and strictly defined periods, borders and paradigms, offering new perspectives on past and present processes of social change of the contemporary world.<br>

  Abstract: The protean notion of ‘people’s history’ has multiple meanings in North American culture. It can refer to a narrative whose subject is ‘the people’, i.e. the masses – in contrast to political, economic and social elites – and thus carry a relatively explicit oppositional ideological orientation. It carries this message in Howard Zinn’s

  Abstract: In the soapbox speeches of politicians, references to Europe have until recently functioned as an institutionalized appeal to overcome the nationstate.

In order to build a common identity on the basis of history beyond ‘a bunch of national narratives and legends,’ he argues ‘the Europeans need to learn and understand European history.’¹ Even the past chairman of the Association of German Historians Johannes Fried warns that<br>

  Book Title: Academic Anthropology and the Museum-Back to the Future<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Bouquet Mary<br>
  Abstract: The museum boom, with its accompanying objectification and politicization of culture, finds its counterpart in the growing interest by social scientists in material culture, much of which is to be found in museums. Not surprisingly, anthropologists in particular are turning their attention again to museums, after decades of neglect, during which fieldwork became the hallmark of modern anthropology - so much so that the "social" and the "material" parted company so radically as to produce a kind of knowledge gap between historical collections and the intellectuals who might have benefitted from working on these material representations of culture. Moreover it was forgotten that museums do not only present the "pastness" of things. A great deal of what goes on in contemporary museums is literally about planning the shape of the future: making culture materialize involves mixing things from the past, taking into account current visions, and knowing that the scenes constructed will shape the perspectives of future generations. However, the (re-)invention of museum anthropology presents a series of challenges for academic teaching and research, as well as for the work of cultural production in contemporary museums - issues that are explored in this volume.<br>

  Abstract: The museum boom, with its accompanying objectification and politicisation of culture, finds its counterpart in expanding social scientific interest in the musealisation of culture. There is ample evidence that anthropologists are among those whose imaginations have been fired by the museum, over the past fifteen to twenty years.¹ However, this current of anthropological interest in museums is fairly recent (
                  seeAmes 1992), and it is certainly not evenly distributed around the academic world. Away from the mainlands of museum anthropology, there are still remote islands that appear to be untouched by these developments (cf. Gerholm and Hannerz 1983). The (re-)<br>

  Abstract: As we’ve often said in the past, historical research presents certain problems for the behavioural sciences. When we think about the history of education, can it, as the title of this book seems to suggest, be conceived of simply as a subdivision of educational research? And does the argumentative structure that is developed in this domain of knowledge automatically give rise to the construction of ‘one’, let alone, ‘the’ language of education? In our opinion, the history of education, if it wants to be valid, must in any event bear the stamp of what Michel de Certeau once called the<br>

  Book Title: Islam & Europe-Challenges and Opportunities<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): TIBI Bassam<br>
  Abstract: Dedicated to increasing our knowledge and awareness of the ever-growing diversity and pluralism of global society, Forum A. & A. Leysen has initiated an annual debate/lecture series, beginning with a focus on Islam in today's world and in Europe in particular. Seven well-known influential authorities - each an active participant in the public debate on the global role of Islam past, present and future - recently presented papers at the first Intercultural Relations Conference sponsored by Forum A.& A. Leysen. These important contributions, on the topic Islam and Europe: Challenges and Opportunities, are reprinted in this volume. Although each contributor speaks from his own distinctive point of view, a common message emerges from all seven texts: only dialogue - on the one hand between the West (countries that manifest themselves as Western Democratic constitutional states) and Islam, and on the other hand within and among societies historically identified with Islam- will overcome entrenched confrontation and negative animosity, engender new possibilities and understandings, and, by encouraging free and critical thinking, pave the way to social equity and the scientific innovation that, potentially, can lead to more prosperity. In the course of the conference all seven talks led to fascinating debates. This book includes the most important questions asked and the speakers' responses. Although the question of how to actually construct the dialogue remains unsettled, this ground-breaking book takes a giant step toward an answer.<br>

  Book Title: Transcendent in America-Hindu-Inspired Meditation Movements as New Religion<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Williamson Lola<br>
  Abstract: Yoga, karma, meditation, guru - these terms, once obscure, are now a part of the American lexicon. Combining Hinduism with Western concepts and values, a new hybrid form of religion has developed in the United States over the past century. In Transcendent in America, Lola Williamson traces the history of various Hindu-inspired movements in America, and argues that together they constitute a discrete category of religious practice, a distinct and identifiable form of new religion.Williamson provides an overview of the emergence of these movements through examining exchanges between Indian Hindus and American intellectuals such as Thomas Jefferson and Ralph Waldo Emerson, and illuminates how Protestant traditions of inner experience paved the way for Hindu-style movements' acceptance in the West.Williamson focuses on three movements - Self-Realization Fellowship, Transcendental Meditation, and Siddha Yoga - as representative of the larger of phenomenon of Hindu-inspired meditation movements. She provides a window into the beliefs and practices of followers of these movements by offering concrete examples from their words and experiences that shed light on their world view, lifestyle, and relationship with their gurus. Drawing on scholarly research, numerous interviews, and decades of personal experience with Hindu-style practices, Williamson makes a convincing case that Hindu-inspired meditation movements are distinct from both immigrant Hinduism and other forms of Asian-influenced or New Age groups.<br>

  Book Title: 22 Ideas to Fix the World-Conversations with the World's Foremost Thinkers<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Sakwa Richard<br>
  Abstract: The aftershocks of the 2008 financial crisis still reverberate throughout the globe. Markets are down, unemployment is up, and nations from Greece to Ireland find their very infrastructure on the brink of collapse. There is also a crisis in the management of global affairs, with the institutions of global governance challenged as never before, accompanied by conflicts ranging from Syria, to Iran, to Mali. Domestically, the bases for democratic legitimacy, social sustainability, and environmental adaptability are also changing. In this unique volume from the World Public Forum Dialogue of Civilizations and the Social Science Research Council, some of the world's greatest minds - from Nobel Prize winners to long-time activists - explore what the prolonged instability of the so-called Great Recession means for our traditional understanding of how governments can and should function. Through interviews that are sure to spark lively debate,22 Ideas to Fix the Worldpresents both analysis of past geopolitical events and possible solutions and predictions for the future.The book surveys issues relevant to the U.S., Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Speaking from a variety of perspectives, including economic, social, developmental, and political, the discussions here increase our understanding of what's wrong with the world and how to get it right. Interviewees explore topics like the Arab Spring, the influence of international financial organizations, the possibilities for the growth of democracy, the acceleration of global warming, and how to develop enforceable standards for market and social regulation. These inspiring exchanges from some of our most sophisticated thinkers on world policy are honest, brief, and easily understood, presenting thought-provoking ideas in a clear and accessible manner that cuts through the academic jargon that too often obscures more than it reveals.22 Ideas to Fix the Worldis living history in the finest sense - a lasting chronicle ~<br>

  Abstract: In the eyes of most scientists, and of educated laypeople, understanding is a central goal of science. In the past centuries scientific research has enormously increased our understanding of the world. Indeed, it seems a commonplace to state that the desire for understanding is a chief motivation for doing science. But despite the prima facie plausibility of these claims, it is not so clear what their precise content is. What do we mean when we say that scientists understand, for example, global climate change? What is involved in achieving scientific understanding of phenomena, be they the origin of the universe,<br>

  Abstract: The iconography of Barcelona is bound up with performance. The city has been conceptualized – as the epigraph, from the
                  New York Times, makes clear – around performative paradigms. While all cities, as the director Tim Etchells notes, function in the same mode as theatre, as a model of ‘dynamic relativism … where everything means more than one thing’ (2009, p. xii), in Barcelona performance serves as a mode of conceptualizing self and other, of reinforcing the transformative potential of the city – not insignificant in a city that has re-envisaged its own architectural landscape in the past thirty years.<br>

  Abstract: After the amnesia of the immediate aftermath of decolonisation, France’s overseas empire has become, in recent decades, an object of study amongst French academics, as well as a more accepted part of public discourse.¹ Whilst debates on the nature and legacies of French colonial rule in both scholarly and popular spheres remain contentious, France’s imperial ventures are now firmly part of the nation’s history. Yet, whilst France’s empire may be part of the historical record and, as such, part of our memory of the French past, the same cannot be said for the spaces beyond France’s traditional spheres of colonial<br>

The crux here is the extent to which history itself which history itself (or a species of history) comes to an end with the return of the son of prophecy. That is, does the temportality of prophyecy, in its collapse of present, past and future, necessarity imply a theological reading or a<br>

It is a contribution to the strand within medical history that seeks to move beyond the social historical towards the cultural historical in an attempt to make an account of the past that places the experience of disease and medicine proportionally as an aspect of life and not its whole.

  Abstract: Over the past generation, performance studies has largely transformed how we think about the contemporary stage, expanding our idea of serious theatre to include such “lowbrow” forms as mixed media, vaudeville, and monologue.¹ The “happenings” of the 1960s and 1970s serve as the immediate precursor to much contemporary art, as more distantly do the Dadaist and surrealist exhibitions of the 1910s and 1920s. These avant-garde beginnings are notable because, like the performance artists of today, the Dadaists and surrealists challenged the idea that life and art are distinct and autonomous spheres, unambiguously separated by a stage proscenium.² Yet, as we<br>

  Abstract: In the absence of an institutional Catholic Church in England after the Reformation, lay piety loomed particularly large in the English recusant community’s efforts to sustain a sense of religious identity and culture. Though scholars of early modern Catholicism once disagreed about whether early modern Catholic culture was characterized by the survival of late medieval traditions or the influence of missionary priests, recent work on both English and Continental Catholicism has shown that it was in fact defined by complex interactions between the two, as the traditions of the past and the spiritual directives of the Counter-Reformation merged, clashed, and<br>

In the desire to narrate was discovered a source of the sacred, a spiritual quality intrinsic to the act of selfdisclosure. In my analysis of the poet’s use of antithesis, I showed how this trope belied the stereotype of psychological inertia and became a source of eurhythmic harmony.

In the past, Catholic philosophy has been dominated and distorted by an essentialist, Cartesian interpretation of St. Thomas and many have come to regard him as a Christianized Aristotle and his philosophy as a completely idealist, rationalistic and closed system. The dominant place given to atheism and freedom in Sartre’s writings can only be fully understood as a reaction against this essentialist Thomism. In contrast to such<br>

As the narrative approach has become more prominent it has, predictably, attracted its share of criticism, and there has been a fairly strong reaction against the idea that our lives can profitably be understood in narrative terms. The most common and forceful objection to this approach is often formulated as a kind of dilemma: either narrative theories really mean to claim that our lives are significantly like literary narratives or these views<br>

  Abstract: Theo Angelopoulos began his film career as a sombre political modernist. His early films offer biting critiques of Greece’s past and present, yet always with the distant hope that Greece’s future could be prosperous, and that the faults of its recent past could be remedied by a potentially glorious future. The earlier films do have melancholic endings, but in their melancholy the endings are signals or appeals for change: they are attempts to transform melancholy into hope. This outlook soon began to change, and the seeds of a more deep-seated pessimism were sown in Ο Μεγαλέξανδρος (

From the disciplinary perspective of Anglo-American film studies, it is a belated intervention indeed. For the question of the spectator is the terrain upon which many of the most significant disciplinary battles over the politics of film theory have been waged over the past three decades.

I have suggested several times already that narrative theory shows a preoccupation with memory, retrospect and the archiving of past events, and has an undeveloped potential to address questions about the present and future. The significance of the notions of ‘anticipation’ and ‘prolepsis’ is that, in different ways, they refer to this relation between the present and actual or possible futures.

If this element of language has aroused such interest, it is because there has been increasing recognition that all of our concepts are framed within metaphorical terms. Rather than a model of language based upon the linguistic sign (a model which implies that words designate things in the world outside of language), linguists today are more inclined to accept that there exists a figurative substructure to concepts.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r2bq2">Scandalous Knowledge</a><br>
  Author(s) McQuillan Martin<br>
  Abstract: Evolutionary psychology, a recently constituted but already broadly extended programme in the study of human behaviour, is notable for, among other things, the unusually pre-emptive character of its claims. According to its major proponents, ‘reverse engineering’, the method that defines and distinguishes evolutionary psychology, permits identification of the underlying, innate mental mechanisms that govern all human behaviour, from incest-avoidance and femaleadolescent anorexia to past-tense formation and a taste for Victorian novels. In supplying these identifications, it is said, evolutionary psychologists provide genuinely scientific explanations for human behaviours and cultural practices that, up to now, have been improperly or inadequately explained<br>

  Abstract: Torgovnick’s literary analysis of primitivism in Freud, Malinowski and Mead suggests that the impulse to record ‘other’ cultures represents a means of ‘handling, through displacement, the series of dislocations that we call modernity and postmodernity’.¹ While archivists have collected and classified, the better to re-present the past for contemporary consumption, the socio-historical critique of heritage and ‘museumry’ has properly castigated selective and ethnocentric interpretation.² Cultural studies includes among its nostrums the need to ‘honour the plurality of perspectives’³ in a world where ‘above all, and directly contrary to the form in which they are constantly invoked, identities are constructed through,<br>

  Book Title: Memory and the Moving Image-French Film in the Digital Era<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): McNeill Isabelle<br>
  Abstract: A vital rethinking of memory and the moving image for the digital age, Isabelle McNeill investigates the role of the moving image in cultural memory, considering the impact of digital technologies on visual culture. Drawing on an interdisciplinary range of theoretical resources and an unusual body of films and moving image works, the author examines the ways in which recent French filmmaking conceptualises both the past and the workings of memory. Ultimately the author argues that memory is an intersubjective process, in which filmic forms continue to play a crucial role even as new media come to dominate our contemporary experience.Memory and the Moving Image:*Introduces new ways of thinking about the relation between film and memory, arising from a compelling, interdisciplinary study of theories and films*Subtly explores the French context while drawing theoretical conclusions with wider implications and applicability*Provides detailed and illuminating close readings of varied moving image works to aid theoretical explorations*Moves away from auteurist approaches, examining work by canonical directors including Jean-Luc Godard, Chris Marker and Agnès Varda alongside that of less well-known filmmakers such as Claire Simon and Yamina Benguigui*Brings together thinkers such as Bergson, Deleuze, Bazin and Barthes with, for example, Rodowick and Mulvey, in an engaging interweaving of theories.Works considered include Jean-Luc Godard's Histoire(s) du Cinéma (1989-98), Yamina Benguigui's Mémoires d'Immigrés (1997), Chris Marker's CD-ROM Immemory (1998), Claire Simon's Mimi (2003), Michael Haneke's Caché (2005) and Agnès Varda's multi-media exhibition, L'Île et Elle (2006).<br>

  Abstract: In Chapter 2 I explored filmic strategies that offer alternatives to reconstruction in attempting to render the past on screen. Filmed objects were seen to contain potential pasts that generate circuits of virtuality, creating the possibility of both a temporal and spatial overflowing of the filmic text.

  Book Title: Material Inscriptions-Rhetorical Reading in Practice and Theory<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Warminski Andrzej<br>
  Abstract: This monograph provides readings of literary and philosophical texts that work through the rhetoric of tropes to the material inscription at the origin of these texts. The book focuses on the practice and pedagogical value of rhetorical reading. Its readings follow an itinerary from poetic texts (such as those by Wordsworth and Keats) through theoretical or philosophical texts (by Descartes and Nietzsche) to narrative fiction (by Henry James). The book also contains two essays on Paul de Man and literary theory and an interview on the topic of "Deconstruction at Yale." All three of these latter texts are explicitly about the inescapable function and importance of the rhetoric of tropes for any critical reading or literary study worthy of the name. As Andrzej Warminski demonstrates, ‘rhetorical reading’ is a species of ‘deconstructive reading’—in the full ‘de Manian’ sense—but one that, rather than harkening back to a past over and done with, would open the texts to a different future. Key Features: New readings of texts by Wordsworth, Keats, Descartes, Nietzsche, and Henry James Essays and an interview on Paul de Man and ‘Deconstruction at Yale’ Reflects on and exemplifies the pedagogical value of ‘de Manian’ rhetorical reading Attempts to open a future for 'deconstructive' or 'de Manian' reading<br>

  Book Title: Post-beur Cinema-North African Émigré and Maghrebi-French Filmmaking in France since 2000<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Higbee Will<br>
  Abstract: Since the early 1980s and the arrival of Beur cinema filmmakers of Maghrebi origin have made a key contribution French cinema's representation of issues such as immigration, integration and national identity. However, they have done so mostly from a position on the margins of the industry. In contrast, since the early 2000s, Maghrebi-French and North African émigré filmmakers have occupied an increasingly prominent position on both sides of the camera, announcing their presence on French screens in a wider range of genres and styles than ever before. This greater visibility and move to the mainstream has not, however, automatically meant that these films have lost any of the social or political relevance. Indeed in the 2000s many of these films have increasingly questioned the boundaries between national, transnational and diasporic cinema, whilst simultaneously demanding, either implicitly or explicitly, a reconsideration of the very difference that has traditionally been seen as a barrier to the successful integration of North African immigrants and their descendants into French society. Through a detailed study of this transformative decade for Maghrebi-French and North African émigré filmmaking in France, this book argues for the emergence of a 'Post-Beur' cinema in the 2000s that is simultaneously global and local in its outlook. Its key features include: A comprehensive overview of the key developments in Maghrebi-French and North African émigré filmmaking in France since the 2000s: counter-heritage cinema and the memorialisation of France’s colonial past; journey narratives and the myth of return; the ‘mainstreaming’ of Maghrebi-French directors and stars; representations of Islam. Detailed case studies of key films from the 2000s that have yet to receive scholarly attention, such as Hors-la-loi, Dernier maquis and Vénus noire.

To this end, in class and elsewhere (see Vannatta, Schleifer, and Crow 2005, 2010), we have attempted to arrive at—or at least circumscribe—a working definition of knowledge in the “humanistic sciences” in relation to what we are (with others) calling “narrative knowledge.” Such knowledge<br>

  Abstract: Early modern romance is a Janus-faced genre. It looks nostalgically backward, to the medieval past and the tales that accrete around English and Continental chivalric heroes: Arthur, Amadis, Guy, Bevis, Roland. At the same time, it pushes the leading edge in generic experimentation, engendering radically new forms, hybrid species such as tragicomic drama, and developing the mode that would ultimately dominate fiction making, the long prose narrative, which became the novel. Evidence that early seventeenth-century English readers themselves regarded romance as participating in such a duality of past and present, traditionalism and modernity, is present in the language of early<br>

  Author(s) Roselle Laura<br>
  Abstract: The symbolic representation of collective identity—an essential communicative element of nationalism—invariably involves the strategic deployment of narratives. An archetypical example in this regard is the creation and transmission of master commemorative narratives. In the nexus of Chinese domestic politics and foreign relations, such historical accounts are central to the internal and external legitimation of the nondemocratic state. By bestowing determined meanings upon the past, which is causally related to the present and future of the Chinese nation-state, this sort of strategic narrative defines the identity role of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in China’s sociopolitical development and projects<br>

  Book Title: Traces of the Past-Classics between History and Archaeology<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Bassi Karen<br>
  Abstract: What are we doing when we walk into an archaeological museum or onto an archaeological site? What do the objects and features we encounter in these unique places mean and, more specifically, how do they convey to us something about the beliefs and activities of formerly living humans? In short, how do visible remains and ruins in the present give meaning to the human past? Karen Bassi addresses these questions through detailed close readings of canonical works spanning the archaic to the classical periods of ancient Greek culture, showing how the past is constituted in descriptions of what narrators and characters see in their present context. She introduces the term protoarchaeological to refer to narratives that navigate the gap between linguistic representation and empirical observation-between words and things-in accessing and giving meaning to the past. Such narratives invite readers to view the past as a receding visual field and, in the process, to cross the disciplinary boundaries that divide literature, history, and archaeology.Aimed at classicists, literary scholars, ancient historians, cultural historians, and archaeological theorists, the book combines three areas of research: time as a feature of narrative structure in literary theory; the concept of "the past itself" in the philosophy of history; and the ontological status of material objects in archaeological theory. Each of five central chapters explores how specific protoarchaeological narratives-from the fate of Zeus' stone in Hesiod's Theogony to the contest between words and objects in Aristophanes' Frogs-both expose and attempt to bridge this gap. Throughout, the book serves as a response to Herodotus' task in writing the Histories, namely, to ensure that "the past deeds of men do not fade with time."<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapters, I have defined protoarchaeological narratives as those in which the past is conceptualized in a negotiation between empirical observation and linguistic representation in a variety of ancient Greek genres. I have also suggested that reading—both as a conceptual category and as a practice—functions within these narratives as an acknowledgment that the past is constituted in what can no longer be seen. To return again to Herodotus’ metaphor, reading refers to the past as a congeries of narrativized objects and events that fades with time. In this epilogue, I explore the ontological and epistemological implications<br>

  Abstract: The archive appears to have taken the place of historical narrative as a key locus for critical historical reflection.

For one, it draws attention from the closed authoritative historiography to the multiplicity of texts involved in documenting the past and to their open potential for generating future histories.¹ Besides the historian-author, many other actors—archivists, informants, donors, and researchers of various kinds—are revealed to animate the archive. This sociality contrasts sharply with the stereotype of the archive as solitary and lifeless. The archive is also characterized by<br>

  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Blocker Jane<br>
  Abstract: Is there such a thing as contemporary art history? The contemporary, after all-as much as we may want to consider it otherwise-is being made history as it happens. By what means do we examine this moving target? These questions lie at the center of Jane Blocker's
         Becoming Past. The important point is not whether there is-or should be-contemporary art history, Blocker argues, but how.<br>

  Book Title: Exchanging Clothes-Habits of Being II<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): RABINOWITZ PAULA<br>
  Abstract: The second in a four-part series charting the social, cultural, and political expression of clothing, dress, and accessories,
         Exchanging Clothesfocuses on the concept of transnational "circulation and exchange"-not only the global exchange of material commodities across time and space but also of the ideas, images, colors, and textures related to fashion. Essays examine the parade of heroes past, from Homer and Virgil to Dante and Ariosto, wearing armor or nothing; the social power of a tie or of a safety pin sprung from punk fashion to the red carpet; a Midwestern thrift store, from cheap labor to cheap purchase, as a microcosm of global circulation; and lesbian pulp fiction as how-to-dress manuals.<br>

  Book Title: Commemorating and Forgetting-Challenges for the New South Africa<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): MURRAY MARTIN J.<br>
  Abstract: How is the historical past made to appear in the present? In addressing these questions, Murray reveals how collective memory is stored and disseminated in architecture, statuary, monuments and memorials, literature, and art-"landscapes of remembrance" that selectively recall and even fabricate history in the service of nation-building. He examines such vehicles of memory in postapartheid South Africa and parses the stories they tell-stories by turn sanitized, distorted, embellished, and compressed. In this analysis,
      Commemorating and Forgettingmarks a critical move toward recognizing how the legacies and impositions of white minority rule, far from being truly past, remain embedded in, intertwined with, and imprinted on the new nation's here and now.<br>

  Abstract: Heritage and history are like twins separated at birth: while their origins are identical, the trajectories of their distinct life-courses are quite dissimilar. As communicative devices, history and heritage rely on antithetical modes of persuasion. Heritage does not pretend to present a genuinely authentic, and reasonably plausible, account of some past but is a declaration of faith in that which came before.¹ While some observers celebrate heritage as a complementary or alternative way of mediating the past to popular audiences, critics dismiss it as little more than counterfeit history, packaged for commercial consumption.² “While it looks old, heritage is actually<br>

It gives rise, year after year, at predetermined dates and in predetermined places, to appeals for forgiveness, symbolic gestures of reconciliation, just as, here and there, it is used to recall unpaid debts and persistent misapprehensions, as well as absolutions that wait enduringly upon unuttered pleas for forgiveness.

  Book Title: Heidegger and Criticism-Retrieving the Cultural Politics of Destruction<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Pease Donald E.<br>
  Abstract: In Heidegger and Criticism: Retrieving the Cultural Politics of Destruction, William Spanos examines the controversy, both in Europe and the United States, surrounding Heidegger and recent disclosures about his Nazi past. Not intended as a defense or apology for Heidegger’s thought, Spanos instead affirms the importance of Heidegger’s “antihumanist” interrogation of the modern age, its globalization of technology, and its neo-imperialist politics. The attack on Heidegger’s “antihumanist” discourse (by “liberal humanists” who have imported the European debated into the United States) aligns ideologically with the ongoing policing operations of William Bennett, Allan Bloom, E.D. Hirsch, Roger Kimball, Dinesh D”Souza, and others in the spheres of higher education and cultural production. Throughout his arguments, Spanos focuses not so much on Heidegger the historical subject as on the transformative cultural political discourses and practices, implicit in and enabled by Heidegger’s interrogations of Being and Time, that have led to the contemporary emergence of the multiplicity of resistant “Others” colonized by hegemonic discursive formations, all the while reminding us that Heidegger’s philosophic interrogations eventually generate a diverse body of transgressive writing and an oppositional intellectual climate in the West.<br>

  Abstract: Atavism demonstrates, sometimes quite poignantly, that the body does not coincide with its present. It dramatizes the past as in communication with the present; it insists that the past and the present are temporal spheres fused in continuity. By making manifest a disordered temporality, the atavistic body demonstrates something of the nature of cultural preoccupations in late modernity. At the same time, the epistemological projects orbiting around this body demonstrate something of the nature of the formal procedures exercised in the scientific pursuit of corporeal mastery.

We are actually witnessing a perplexing evolution characterized by the always more profound denial of the very essence of the Freudian discovery and its foundation—namely, the existence of the images created by autoerotic sexuality, i.e., the unconscious (infantile) images—Bild[er]—that shape the dream as well as the neurotic symptom, and even psychosis.

  Book Title: Philosophy Beside Itself-On Deconstruction and Modernism<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Marshall Donald<br>
  Abstract: The writings of French philosopher Jacques Derrida have been the single most powerful influence on critical theory and practice in the United States over the past decade. But with few exceptions American philosophers have taken little or no interest in Derrida’s work, and the task of reception, translation, and commentary has been left to literary critics. As a result, Derrida has appeared as a figure already defined by essentially literary critical activities and interests. Stephen Melville’s aim in Philosophy Beside Itself is to insist upon and clarify the distinctions between philosophy and criticism. He argues that until we grasp Derrida’s philosophical project as such, we remain fundamentally unable to see his significance for criticism. In terms derived from Stanley Cavell’s writings on modernism, Melville develops a case for Derrida as a modernist philosopher, working at once within and against that tradition and discipline. Melville first places Derrida in a Hegelian context, the structure of which he explores by examining the work of Heidegger, Lacan, and Bataille. With this foundation, he is able to reappraise the project of deconstructive criticism as developed in Paul de Man’s Blindness and Insight and further articulated by other Yale critics. Central to this critique is the ambivalent relationship between deconstructive criticism and Lacanian psychoanalysis. Criticism—radical self-criticism—is a central means through which the difficult facts of human community come to recognition, and Melville argues for criticism as an activity intimately bound to the ways in which we do and do not belong in time and in community. Derrida’s achievement has been to find a new and necessary way to assert that the task of philosophy is criticism; the task of literary criticism is to assume the burden of that achievement. Stephen Melville is an assistant professor of English at Syracuse University, and Donald Marshall is a professor of English at the University of Iowa.<br>

  Abstract: In the sixth and final section of his

It seems to him that the reason most philosophers fail to understand him is because they are so entrenched in the past, unable to free themselves from the shackles of philosophical convention or relax their rigid doctrines. He describes the struggle with his philosophical opponents in quite an exceptional manner:<br>

  Abstract: When reminiscing about his student days in Frankfurt during the 1950s, Habermas has occasionally mentioned Horkheimer’s worries that he and other young leftist students would get hold of old copies of the
                  Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung, safely locked away in the cellar of the Institute for Social Research apparently in order to repress the memory of its radical past. Although the young Habermas had already read Marx, Lukács, Bloch, andDialectic of Enlightenmentbefore coming to Frankfurt, he admits he initially had little knowledge of the interdisciplinary Hegelian-Marxist research program that the institute had brilliantly pioneered in the 1930s (Dews 1986,<br>

  Abstract: “In order to have a sense of who we are,” writes Charles Taylor, “we have to have a notion of how we have become, and of where we are going” (47). The unconscious (in psychoanalytic terms) bears traces of early experience; clinical practice moves from present experience to its roots in the recent or distant past. For these reasons and others, Jarrell’s poems often seek a past self within present experience, or a child within an adult. With help from concepts central to psychoanalysis, and from literary sources such as Wordsworth and Proust, his characters try to understand themselves as<br>

  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): BROWN SASKIA<br>
  Abstract: Our presentist present is by no means uniform or clear-cut, and it is experienced very differently depending on the position we occupy in society. We are caught up in global movement and accelerated flows, or else condemned to the life of casual workers, living from hand to mouth in a stagnant present, with no recognized past, and no real future either (since the temporality of plans and projects is inaccessible). The present is therefore experienced as emancipation or enclosure, and the perspective of the future is no longer reassuring, since it is perceived not as a promise, but as a threat. Hartog's resonant readings show us how the motor of history(-writing) has stalled and help us understand the contradictory qualities of our contemporary presentist relation to time.<br>

Through a case study of Sikhism, he launches an extended critique of religion as a cultural universal.

  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Obeyesekere Gananath<br>
  Abstract: Throughout his career, Obeyesekere has combined psychoanalysis and anthropology to illuminate the relationship between personal symbolism and religious experience. In this book, he begins with Buddha's visionary trances wherein, over the course of four hours, he witnesses hundreds of thousands of his past births and eons of world evolution, renewal, and disappearance. He then connects this fracturing of empirical and visionary time to the realm of space, considering the experience of a female Christian penitent, who stares devotedly at a tiny crucifix only to see the space around it expand to mirror Christ's suffering. Obeyesekere follows the unconscious motivations underlying rapture, the fantastical consumption of Christ's body and blood, and body mutilation and levitation, bridging medieval Catholicism and the movements of early modern thought as reflected in William Blake's artistic visions and poetic dreams. He develops the term "dream-ego" through a discussion of visionary journeys, Carl Jung's and Sigmund Freud's scientific dreaming, and the cosmic and erotic dream-visions of New Age virtuosos, and he defines the parameters of a visionary mode of knowledge that provides a more elastic understanding of truth. A career-culminating work, this volume translates the epistemology of Hindu and Buddhist thinkers for western audiences while revitalizing western philosophical and scientific inquiry.<br>

  Abstract: Drawing on a vast and diverse archive in theory, testimony, and image and on such thinkers as Karl Marx, Walter Benjamin, Theodor W.

Yet hidden within this melancholic tradition are the resources for a renewed challenge to prevailing regimes of historicity, a passion that has the power to reignite the dialectic of revolutionary thought.<br>

  Book Title: After Christianity-  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): D’Isanto Luca<br>
  Abstract: When Vattimo was asked by a former teacher if he still believed in God, his reply was, "Well, I believe that I believe." This paradoxical declaration of faith serves as the foundation for a brilliant exposition on Christianity in the new millennium -- an age characterized by a deep uncertainty of opinion -- and a personal account of how Vattimo himself recovered his faith through Nietzsche and Heidegger. He first argues that secularization is in fact the fulfillment of the central Christian message, and prepares us for a new mode of Christianity. He then explains that Nietzsche's thesis concerns only the "moral god" and leaves room for the emergence of "new gods." Third, Vattimo claims that the postmodern condition of fragmentation, anti-Eurocentrism, and postcolonialism can be usefully understood in light of Joachim of Fiore's thesis concerning the "Spiritual Age" of history. Finally, Vattimo argues for the idea of "weak thought." Because philosophy in the postmetaphysical age can only acknowledge that "all is interpretation," that the "real" is always relative and not the hard and fast "truth" we once thought it to be, contemporary thought must recognize itself and its claims as "weak" as opposed to "strong" foundationalist claims of the metaphysical past. Vattimo concludes that these factors make it possible for religion and God to become a serious topic for philosophy again, and that philosophy should now formally engage religion.<br>

  Author(s): BASSO ELLEN B.<br>
  Abstract: An especially comprehensive study of Brazilian Amazonian Indian history, The Last Cannibals is the first attempt to understand, through indigenous discourse, the emergence of Upper Xingú society. Drawing on oral documents recorded directly from the native language, Ellen Basso transcribes and analyzes nine traditional Kalapalo stories to offer important insights into Kalapalo historical knowledge and the performance of historical narratives within their nonliterate society. This engaging book challenges the familiar view of biography as a strictly Western literary form. Of special interest are biographies of powerful warriors whose actions led to the emergence of a more recent social order based on restrained behaviors from an earlier time when people were said to be fierce and violent. From these stories, Basso explores how the Kalapalo remember and understand their past and what specific linguistic, psychological, and ideological materials they employ to construct their historical consciousness. Her book will be important reading in anthropology, folklore, linguistics, and South American studies.<br>

While these efforts illuminate our knowledge of the past, they leave out aggregates of individual and collective experiences that also contribute to the signification of the works.

  Book Title: The Political Unconscious-Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): JAMESON FREDRIC<br>
  Abstract: Jameson supports his thesis by looking closely at the nature of interpretation. Our understanding, he says, is colored by the concepts and categories that we inherit from our culture's interpretive tradition and that we use to comprehend what we read. How then can the literature of other ages be understood by readers from a present that is culturally so different from the past? Marxism lies at the foundation of Jameson's answer, because it conceives of history as a single collective narrative that links past and present; Marxist literary criticism reveals the unity of that uninterrupted narrative.<br>

  Abstract: The Marxian vision of history outlined in the previous chapter has sometimes, as we have observed, been described as a “comic” archetype or a “romance” paradigm.¹ What is meant thereby is the salvational or redemptive perspective of some secure future, from which, with William Morris’ Time Traveller, we can have our “fill of the pleasure of the eyes without any of that sense of incongruity, that dread of approaching ruin, which had always beset me hitherto when I had been among the beautiful works of art of the past.”² In such a future, indeed, or from its perspective, our own<br>

  Abstract: Antigone provides the figure for a style of mourning politics in which claims for recognition disrupt the disavowals and silences of the status quo. Unruly, mournful voices mobilize on the basis of shared grief in order to challenge the norms that have made their suffering unrecognizable or their lives impossible. Yet these insistent mourning voices circulate within, attempt to influence, and implicitly acknowledge a broader struggle of narration over the meaning of historical suffering and enduring traumas.¹ Here the most prominent voices are often the official discourses and rituals that seek to memorialize the past in ways that reinforce common<br>

  Abstract: Many observers have described Western intellectual and legal histories as moving from notions of fixed and assigned status to notions of individual freedom and rights. Sir Henry Maine’s famous dictum defined progress as the movement from status to contract.¹ Such broadly gauged summaries risk oversimplification and insensitivity to the variety and contestability of understandings of the past. Nonetheless, the contrast between legal orders premised upon status and those premised upon state-guaranteed rights helps to locate notions of abnormal persons and rights analysis as ways for dealing with differences. And as a historical matter, rights analysis in some ways is a<br>

                  Mnemosyne is largely divorced from iconology as practiced by Warburg’s chief successors, who turn rather to his earlier work for their methodological inspiration.¹ Briefly put, iconology aims to explicate the significance of an individual artwork through the interpretation of the symbolic values attached to compositional or iconographic features. To decipher these contingent features, imbricated as they are in a medieval or humanist culture long since past, great erudition is usually demanded. Yet to grasp next the meaning of the work’s symbolic values, interpretation becomes mostly an intuitive act. This is because iconology tends to regard the individual<br>

  Book Title: Meaning, Truth, and Reference in Historical Representation-  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Ankersmit Frank<br>
  Abstract: At the heart of Ankersmit's project is a sharp distinction between interpretation and representation. The historical text, he holds, is first and foremost a representation of some part of the past, not an interpretation. The book's central chapters address the concept of historical representation from the perspectives of reference, truth, and meaning. Ankersmit then goes on to discuss the possible role of experience in the history writing, which leads directly to a consideration of subjectivity and ethics in the historian's practice. Ankersmit concludes with a chapter on political history, which he maintains is the "basis and condition of all other variants of historical writing." Ankersmit's rehabilitation of historicism is a powerfully original and provocative contribution to the debate about the nature of historical writing.<br>

  Abstract: Throughout this book my compass has been the claim put forward in chapter 3 that representation/aesthetics is prior to interpretation/hermeneutics and that it is better to investigate the writing of history from the perspective of representation than from that of interpretation. Interpretation is something one does with texts that already exist, and the phrase “interpreting 
                  the past ” can therefore never be more than a deconstructivist metaphor. So when the linguistic (or, rather, rhetorical) turn in contemporary philosophy of history put a premium on interpretation at the expense of representation, the result was what one might call an “etherealization” of<br>

  Abstract: The study of the reception of and influences on literature is relatively new and, for the works of many authors, has hardly begun. Current literature tends to receive the most attention. In the past, literary works were often co-opted for ideological reasons and in the process misinterpreted and distorted; this was the case with Johann Gottfried Herder through the nineteenth and well into the twentieth century. Ultimately, Herder was discredited by nationalist perversion of his works during the National-Socialist era.

  Book Title: Edinburgh German Yearbook 9-Archive and Memory in German Literature and Visual Culture<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Osborne Dora<br>
  Abstract: In recent years, the discourse of memory - and of German memory culture in particular - has become increasingly concerned with questions of the archive. An archive can refer to a physical place, the material found there, or the system that orders this material; in its broadest sense, it might refer to something public (records housed in a municipal building), or something private (photographs in a family album). The material and documentary qualities of the archive confer on it an authenticating function attributed only cautiously to memory, but theories of the archive have questioned the status of material, documentary vestiges of the past. Memory and the archive are inextricably linked, but how does this affect the mediation of the past? This volume explores the changing relationship between memory and the archive in German-language literature and culture since 1945. Contributions approach this topic from a range of perspectives (film, visual culture, urban culture, digital technology, as well as literature) and offer illuminating studies of Harun Farocki, Anselm Kiefer, Thomas Demand, Bernd and Hilla Becher, Jürgen Fuchs, Stefan Wolter, and Sasa Stanisic.

  Book Title: Secret Police Files from the Eastern Bloc-Between Surveillance and Life Writing<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Petrescu Corina L.<br>
  Abstract: The communist secret police services of Central and Eastern Europe kept detailed records not only of their victims but also of the vast networks of informants and collaborators upon whom their totalitarian systems depended. These records, now open to the public in many former Eastern Bloc countries, reflect a textually mediated reality that has defined and shaped the lives of former victims and informers, creating a tension between official records and personal memories. Exploring this tension between a textually and technically mediated past and the subject/victim's reclaiming and retrospective interpretation of that past in biography is the goal of this volume. While victims' secret police files have often been examined as a type of unauthorized archival life writing, the contributors to this volume are among the first to analyze the fragmentary and sometimes remedial nature of these biographies and to examine the subject/victims' rewriting and remediation of them in various creative forms. Essays focus, variously, on the files of the East German Stasi, the Romanian Securitate (in relation to Transylvanian Germans in Romania), and the Hungarian State Security Agency.

  Book Title: Medievalist Enlightenment-From Charles Perrault to Jean-Jacques Rousseau<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Montoya Alicia C.<br>
  Abstract: Literary medievalism played a vital role in the construction of the French Enlightenment. Starting with the Quarrel of the Ancients and Moderns, it influenced movements leading to the Romantic rediscovery of the Middle Ages, and helped to shape new literary genres, from the epistolary novel to the fairy tale and opera. Indeed, the dominant mode of the early Enlightenment, 'galanterie', was of medievalist inspiration. Moreover, the academic study of medieval texts underlay modern ideals of scholarship, institutionalized at the royal academies. The Middle Ages polemically functioned as an alternative site, allowing authors to rethink their age's political and social ideologies. At the centre of these debates was the notion of historical progress. Was progress possible, as the 'philosophes' held, or was human history a process of degeneration, with the Middle Ages as a lost Golden Age? From the re-evaluation of the medieval thus emerged not only the seeds of a new poetics, but also the central questions that preoccupied Enlightenment thinkers from Montesquieu to Rousseau. This book shows how, in order to understand the aesthetic and intellectual transformations that marked modernity, it is essential to examine how this period conceived of the past, and particularly those "Dark Ages" that served as the defining foil for the modern Age of Light.

  Book Title: Christians and Jews in Angevin England-The York Massacre of 1190, Narratives and Contexts<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Watson Sethina<br>
  Abstract: The mass suicide and murder of the men, women and children of the Jewish community in York on 16 March 1190 is one of the most scarring events in the history of Anglo-Judaism, and an aspect of England's medieval past which is widely remembered around the world. However, the York massacre was in fact only one of a series of attacks on communities of Jews across England in 1189-90; they were violent expressions of wider new constructs of the nature of Christian and Jewish communities, and the targeted outcries of local townspeople, whose emerging urban politics were enmeshed within the swiftly developing structures of royal government. This new collection considers the massacre as central to the narrative of English and Jewish history around 1200. Its chapters broaden the contexts within which the narrative is usually considered and explore how a narrative of events in 1190 was built up, both at the time and in following years. They also focus on two main strands: the role of narrative in shaping events and their subsequent perception; and the degree of 'convivencia' between Jews and Christians and consideration of the circumstances and processes through which neighbours became enemies and victims.

  Book Title: Representing the "Good German" in Literature and Culture after 1945-Altruism and Moral Ambiguity<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Schönfeld Christiane<br>
  Abstract: In the aftermath of the Second World War, both the allied occupying powers and the nascent German authorities sought Germans whose record during the war and the Nazi period could serve as a counterpoint to the notion of Germans as evil. That search has never really stopped. In the past few years, we have witnessed a burgeoning of cultural representations of this "other" kind of Third Reich citizen - the "good German" - as opposed to the committed Nazi or genocidal maniac. Such representations have highlighted individuals' choices in favor of dissenting behavior, moral truth, or at the very least civil disobedience. The "good German's" counterhegemonic practice cannot negate or contradict the barbaric reality of Hitler's Germany, but reflects a value system based on humanity and an "other" ideal community. This volume of new essays explores postwar and recent representations of "good Germans" during the Third Reich, analyzing the logic of moral behavior, cultural and moral relativism, and social conformity found in them. It thus draws together discussions of the function and reception of "Good Germans" in Germany and abroad.

  Abstract: Though there is little evidence that it was used in the 
                  immediate aftermath of the Second World War, the term “Stunde Null,” or “Zero Hour,” was often at the core of later West German narratives about 1945.¹ As a concept it has been a much disputed one. For some, Germany’s destruction, misery, and shame was so complete that a tabula rasa situation existed in the aftermath of the Third Reich, one in which a completely new set of institutions and values that could not in any way be rooted in the Nazi past had to be developed for German society.<br>

  Book Title: Archaeology, the Public and the Recent Past-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): DALGLISH CHRIS<br>
  Abstract: Heritage, memory, community archaeology and the politics of the past form the main strands running through the papers in this volume.The authors tackle these subjects from a range of different philosophical perspectives, with many drawing on the experience of recent community, commercial and other projects. Throughout, there is a strong emphasis on both the philosophy of engagement and with its enactment in specific contexts; the essays deal with an interest in the meaning, value and contested nature of the recent past and in the theory and practice of archaeological engagements with that past. Chris Dalglish is a lecturer in archaeology at the University of Glasgow.

  Author(s) Jones Siân<br>
  Abstract: In his seminal work, 
                  The Past is a Foreign Country, David Lowenthal not only captures the inseparable nature of past and present, but also advocates that we embrace the production of a useable past in a shifting present. Today, few archaeologists would dispute that our understandings of the past are a product of the present. Moreover, most accept that archaeology is a public concern with political, ethical and social implications in wider society. Indeed, as this volume demonstrates, they actively seek to produce an engaged and engaging past. Yet this has not always been the case. For much of the<br>

  Book Title: Edinburgh German Yearbook 3-Contested Legacies: Constructions of Cultural Heritage in the GDR<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Rolle Sabine<br>
  Abstract: Established, commissioned, and edited by the Department of German at the University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh German Yearbook encourages and disseminates lively and open discussion of themes pertinent to German Studies, viewed from all angles but with particular interest in problems arising out of politics and history. No other yearbook covers the entire field while addressing a focused theme in each issue. Coinciding with the twentieth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, volume 3 re-directs current debates on memory and tradition, opening up fresh perspectives on the cultural history of the GDR and exploring how the nation's cultural discourses entered into a productive but often problematic dialogue with the values of the past and with the German cultural inheritance. Topics include the compositional engagement with musical heritage; industrial design and cultural politics; the establishment of antifascist monuments and their use as sites of resistance; constructions of a cultural heritage in architecture; the influence of cultural politics on literary scholarship; continuities and breaks with tradition in visual and literary culture; and engagement with the past in the works of Konrad Wolf, Irmtraud Morgner, and Anna Seghers.

  Abstract: Narratives of the past are inevitably subjective. They reflect prevailing structures of power and encode the social and cultural discourses in which they are conceived. This is particularly the case where cultural canons are concerned. Canons embody contemporary values and effectively function, as Paul Lauter observes, as “a means by which culture validates social power.”¹ This phenomenon can be perceived clearly in the constructs of the musical canon that pervaded in the early years of the German Democratic Republic. Portrayals of composers such as Bach, Handel and Beethoven as precursors of socialism reinforced official narratives of the GDR as the<br>

Despite the increase in the amount of published Schmidt research over the past ten years in Germany, his works have never attracted a large readership.

The two tropes, of violence and nature, provide an entry point for a discussion of the development of the use of the idea of the African citizen in constructing national identity in Cuba.

  Abstract: It seems impossible today to discuss Quebec literature without considering its institutions and, in particular, its institutionalization over the past century. This predicament explains Gilles Marcotte’s (1925–) remarks on “Institution et courants d’air” (1989), in which he observes that “the literary institution is not a new topic in Quebec literature. On the contrary, it is our

The narrator of Catherine Mavrikakis’s (1961–) novel Deuils cannibales et mélancoliques (2000) makes a similar statement: “In Quebec, there are more literary prizes than books published. . .<br>

  Book Title: Arturo Pérez-Reverte: Narrative Tricks and Narrative Strategies-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): WALSH ANNE L.<br>
  Abstract: The writings of Arturo Pérez-Reverte, one of Spain's most renowned contemporary authors, have been described as a minefield. This monograph examines the complexities behind the narrative technique employed in creating such a minefield, including an analysis of the role played by both male and female characters, the relevance of the past as a motif, and aspects of the role of storytelling in creating mystery where none should exist. Both Revertian novels and journalistic writing are seen to be part of an over-all game which is played between their author and his readers. Film, too, forms part of the material reviewed as, though Pérez-Reverte is not a script writer, many films have been based on his novels. The text-centred analysis concludes that the themes of interest in all Revertian output revolve around two main areas: the significance of the past, whether historical, cultural, or literary, and the role of the written word in communicating, in rescuing and in challenging versions of that past in order to combat what Pérez-Reverte terms 'dismemory'.

  Abstract: In recent years, museums have staged a number of ‘exhibitions of exhibitions’.

Some have reproduced assemblages that were first exhibited two centuries ago, while others have remounted exhibitions from the recent past. The motivations of the curators and artists responsible for these diverse projects have included the desire to mark famous anniversaries, to recuperate long-forgotten shows, to examine the effects of different modes of display and spectatorship, and to construct an archive of the immaterial<br>

  Abstract: Scholars maintain that a major source of work-family conflict is the lack of sufficient time in the day to meet work and family obligations (see, for example, Hochschild 1997; Parcel 1999). This time crunch is exacerbated by the increase in work hours over the past thirty years, especially for professional and managerial workers and for women (Jacobs and Gerson 2004). Work-family researchers generally see long work hours as negative consequences of employer demands or increased competition wrought by globalization and industry consolidation (Schor 1992; Hochschild 1997; Jacobs and Gerson 2004; Blair-Loy and Jacobs 2003; Fraser 2001).

  Abstract: This essay traces the evolution of the views on the communist takeover in Bulgaria (September 9, 1944), the “people’s democracy” (1944–1948), and socialism for the duration of the regime and after its fall. The communist regime shaped and strictly controlled knowledge about itself, its genesis, and its past. The regime’s ideologically distorted self-image is of interest to historiography as an extreme case in which historical knowledge is subject to direct politicization and ideologization in legitimating power. At first sight, notions about the past would seem to be fixed once and for all. But precisely because knowledge of the past<br>

  Abstract: Remembering Communism examines the formation and transformation of the memory of communism in the post-communist period. The majority of the articles focus on memory practices in the post-Stalinist era in Bulgaria and Romania, with occasional references to the cases of Poland and the GDR. Based on an interdisciplinary approach, including history, anthropology, cultural studies and sociology, the volume examines the mechanisms and processes that influence, determine and mint the private and public memory of communism in the post-1989 era. The common denominator to all essays is the emphasis on the process of remembering in the present, and the modalities by means of which the present perspective shapes processes of remembering, including practices of commemoration and representation of the past.<br>

Two of these—the Museum of Occupations (Tallinn, Estonia, established in 2003) and The Museum of the Occupation of Latvia (Riga, 1993)—linked the Nazi and Soviet periods together to present a history of continuous national subjugation and suffering at the hands of foreign powers, lasting from 1940 to 1991. The third—the Museum of Genocide Victims (Vilnius, Lithuania, 1992)—dealt solely with the terrors of the communist period, despite being placed in a building with<br>

  Abstract: The central theme of these lectures was inspired, obviously enough, by current discussions of cultural hybridity, themselves a response to recent trends such as globalization, mass migration, and debates about multiculturalism. As the world changes, historians come to look at the past from different angles and to ask different questions about it from their predecessors. This point is as true of the Renaissance as it is of (say) the French Revolution. In the last generation, a number of studies of the Renaissance, and especially studies of the reception of the Renaissance, from Jan Białostocki to Thomas Kaufmann, from Fernando Marías<br>

  Abstract: In December 2010, the BBC Ukrainian Book of the Year prize was awarded to writer Serhiy Zhadan for his novel
                     Voroshylovhrad. Four years later, in December 2014,Voroshylovhradwas named the BBC Book of the Decade. This literary work interlaces black humor and uncensored language (peoplespeak) with the harsh realities of post-Soviet life. The result is a collection of adroitly forthright reflections on today’s Ukraine, in all its complexities and contradictions. Among these complexities, the country’s past plays a key role.<br>

  Book Title: Imperfection and Defeat-The Role of Aesthetic Imagination in Human Society<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Nemoianu Virgil<br>
  Abstract: Literature is defined in a challenging way as the "science" of imperfection and defeat, or else as a type of discourse that deals with defeat, loss, uncertainty in social life, by contrast with virtually all disciplines (hard sciences or social sciences) that affirm certainties and wish to convince us of truths. If in real history most constructive attempts end up in failure, it follows that we ought to have also a field of research that examines this diversity of failures and disappointments, as well as the alternative options to historical evolution and progress. Thus literature serves an indispensable role: that of gleaning the abundance of past existence, the gratuitous and the rejected being placed here on an equal level with the useful and the successful. This provocative and unusual approach is illustrated in chapters that deal with the dialectics between literary writing and such fields as historical writing, or religious discourses, and is also illustrated by the socio-historical development of East-Central Europe.<br>

  Book Title: Constitutions, Courts, and History-Historical Narratives in Constitutional Adjudication<br>

  Author(s): Uitz Renáta<br>
  Abstract: Emphasizes the role history and historical narratives play in constitutional adjudication. Uitz provocatively draws attention to the often-tense relationship between the constitution and historical precedence highlighting the interpretive and normative nature of the law. Her work seeks to understand the conditions under which references to the past, history and traditions are attractive to lawyers, even when they have the potential of perpetuating indeterminacy in constitutional reasoning. Uitz conclusively argues that this constitutional indeterminacy is obscured by 'judicial rhetorical toolkits' of continuity and reconciliation that allow the court's reliance on the past to be unaccounted for. Uitz' rigorous analysis and extensive research makes this work an asset to legal scholars and practitioners alike.<br>

  Abstract: Chapter Four began an exploration of the normative premises underlying courts’ reliance on historical narratives in constitutional cases. The examination targeted the rhetoric of continuity, inquiring how judge-made continuity rhetoric takes shape and, also, how such continuity rhetoric contributes to shaping identities in polities operating under constitutions with troubled founding myths. In addition to constructing constitutional continuity, justices entrusted with applying such constitution myths often invoke historical narratives in order to settle accounts with the past (reconciliation). Building on these previous findings, Chapter Five seeks to unravel the effect of reconciliation rhetoric on the relationship between the constitutional text and<br>

The communist past as experienced by those who lived it is largely a foreign concept to the majority of art historians in the West, who thus tread hesitantly over its uncanny terrain.

Abstract: This article aims (1) to analytically disaggregate agency into its several component elements (though these are interrelated empirically), (2) to demonstrate the ways in which these agentic dimensions interpenetrate with forms of structure, and (3) to point out the implications of such a conception of agency for empirical research. The authors conceptualize agency as a temporally embedded process of social engagement, informed by the past (in its “iterational” or habitual aspect) but also oriented toward the future (as a “projective” capacity to imagine alternative possibilities) and toward the present (as a “practical‐evaluative” capacity to contextualize past habits and future projects within the contingencies of the moment).<br>

Abstract: Lacey examines the question of whether science is value free in a manner making his book a good classroom tool to use alongside past positivistic philosophy of science or more contemporary work. He couches the question in terms of theory acceptance: are they evaluated impartially, executed neutrally, within an autonomous discipline—complete with a distinction between contexts of discovery and justification (pp. 232–33)? Broadening the book’s scope are chapters considering challenges from feminist and grassroots empowerment approaches, and Lacey’s careful arguments are worth discussion particularly since, surprisingly, he concludes that science is not value free after all.<br>

Author(s): Vidal Fernando<br>
Abstract: In short, our present brains enclose another brain, destined to develop in the afterlife and to restore our identity, personality, and body together.
         112Since the resurrected body will be spiritual and incorruptible, the “small human body” hidden in the seat of the soul must be physically different from our bodies of flesh. Indeed, it is “that spiritual body which Revelation contrasts to the animal body that is only its envelope.”113But differences are secondary. Althoughbodyas such is essentially for identity, it is not through the numerical sameness of terrestrial and spiritual bodies that human beings will prolong their earthly past. Hence the limits of psycho‐theology. “The psychologist,” Bonnet wrote of himself, “who treats of human permanence [after death] must investigateanalyticallyhow the future state will relate to the past state, and by what physical means man will conserve his personality and all the knowledge [connaissances] he acquired in his terrestrial state” (

Abstract: Another approach to collective representations searches for shared “binary codes” of public discourse (Alexander
            2001; Alexander and Smith1993; Kane1997; Jacobs1996; Battani et al.1997). From their analysis of U.S. legislative crises over the past 200 years, Jeffrey Alexander and Philip Smith (1993; Alexander2001) argue that a specific set of binary codes has continuously organized debate in large U.S. political forums. These implicit, binary civic codes work, the authors say, to divide good and bad. U.S. legislators designate political actors “good” by declaring them “active, not passive,” “autonomous, not dependent,” “rational, reasonable and realistic, not irrational and hysterical”; the legislators impute “goodness” to social relations by calling them “open, trusting, truthful and straightforward” (Alexander and Smith1993, pp. 162–63; see also Alexander2001). The codes are the sturdy scaffolding of public discourse upon which people build arguments to justify why a person, policy, or institution is good or bad for the country.<br>

Abstract: Ahearn, always a perceptive writer, brings out a fear that many linguistic anthropologists have but rarely expressthe fear of being assimilated to sociocultural anthropology and thus losing their identity through the forfeiting of their specificity. This is the flip side of William Labovs original wish that sociolinguistics might disappear once linguistics agreed to see language as a social phenomenon (that this has not happened is both an indictment of linguistics narrowmindedness and a validation of Labovs and other sociolinguists efforts to develop sociolinguistics into a vibrant independent field). The question then arises why we should worry about being assimilated. Shouldnt we, on the contrary, welcome such a possibility, to be seen as a validation of our work or as the mainstreaming of our concerns? The problem is not in the future, which cannot be predicted, but in the past. Everything we know from our earlier experiences warns us that an anthropology without a distinct group of language specialists is likely to be an anthropology with a nave understanding of communication. We have seen it happen already. When anthropology departments decide not to have a linguistic subfield, thinking that they dont need one, their students tend to take language for granted, identifying it with a vague notion of discourse. It is for this reason that we need to sharpen our historical, theoretical, and methodological understanding of what it means to study language as culture. We owe it first to our students.<br>

Abstract: As the memory of the sufferings of Puritans and Dissenters faded into the distant past, it was important to maintain the strength of Dissenting loyalties among each new generation by keeping their history alive. Joshua Toulmin, Dissenting minister, historian, and editor of the 1790s edition of Neal, commented: “The youth of the present day grow up at a great distance of time from the transactions and events, under the immediate and lively impressions of which their ancestors were formed to support, with enlightened minds and consistent firmness, the character of Protestant Dissenters and Advocates of Religious Liberty.”
      63But, Toulmin advises, there is no shortage of appropriate works of history to keep on the shelves of the family library, and it would encourage younger members of Dissenting families if some of the shorter and more readable of them were “always lying on the table in the parlour.”64<br>

Abstract: The actions of Camus’s schoolteacher were not circumscribed or constrained by geography: they were the political decisions made from an assent or acquiescence to “dogma, compliance, and cowardice.”
         124Because Braudel, always the schoolteacher, so emphasized his brief against biographical history, critics have often claimed that the delineation of limits and constraints inThe Mediterraneandevalues politics and events and leaves the book devoid of individual freedom.125Such misrepresentations distort the history that Braudel really presented: “The dangers of a social history are clear to us all, and in particular the danger of forgetting, in contemplation of the deep currents in the lives of men, each separate man grappling with his own life and his own destiny; the danger of forgetting, perhaps even of denying, the inimitable essence of each individual.”126For Braudel, the lessons of World War II demanded remembering both the forces acting upon each individual and individual acts freely chosen.127Braudel’sMéditerranéewas a call to arms: “The catastrophes and revolutions, dramas and surprises” of his time revealed “the social reality, the fundamental reality of man … in an entirely new light,” which in turn required a new history, a problem‐oriented and global, total history.128It was a new history slow to be understood, little to be appreciated, and rarely to be practiced in the Anglo‐American world remembering a different past and fighting different battles in the 1950s and 1960s. On the question of individual freedom, however, Braudel’s history of the sixteenth‐century Mediterranean is very similar to the work of its most brilliant contemporary political analyst, Machiavelli. We might recall the wily Florentine exile’s astute judgment when we reread the last words of Braudel’s penultimate paragraph in the second edition: “I would conclude with the paradox that the true man of action is he who can measure most nearly the constraints upon him, who chooses to~<br>

Abstract: If this essay might belong informally to one of these disciplinary domains, I must also distinguish the kind of analysis offered here from what is sometimes called rhetorical, as in “the rhetoric of science.” The latter enterprise, however worthy, is usually programmatically interested in calling into question the epistemic claims of knowledge discourses. This is just what I am not doing. Although I have made recourse freely to rhetorical concepts, the analysis I have undertaken might be more appropriately called an exercise in poetics. Such an analysis should be possible for any genre of writing, though it is currently underdeveloped for genres other than the literary and the scientific. For an important exception, see Anthony Grafton’s recent studies of the scholarly essay in

Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: By affirming the constructive aspect of comparison and its heuristic value, comparative theology avoids falling into the trap of casting an imaginatively constructed link as a natural or historical connection in a vain effort to lend “scientific” legitimacy to the former.
         51Thus disencumbered of the scientific prejudice that would tempt us into assuming a preexisting, objective foundation for every illuminating parallel, comparative theology is not committed to any dubious assumptions regarding a culturally independent experience of reality allegedly shared by the world’s faiths in order to justify its comparisons. Nor is its field of application restricted to those traditions for which there are established historical links.52Far from constituting a metalevel of discourse that simply records and analyzes past historical encounters, comparative theology itself represents a constitutive moment in an ongoing process of cross‐cultural transformation. Whether the imaginatively forged links of comparative theology overcome their arbitrary character and attain historical reality depends on whether they are supported by larger, historical forces through which the compared cultures effectively encounter each other. Without this support, these tenuous, imaginative links remain historically inert, confined to the mind of the scholar.53With it, they function performatively in the context of an effective encounter in the course of which the insights of one tradition become a constitutive part of another.<br>

Abstract: An example of refiguration is the capacity to make a narrative or invent a new plot from the same events but to lead to different actions; for example, a person who reads a book may subsequently refigure important events in her life to achieve a new synthesis involving connections not made before. Ricoeur emphasizes that the spiral of narrative making is endless because we are able to “carry the mediation past the same point a number of times, but at different altitudes” [

Abstract: In an interesting argument for analogy as a vehicle for a cross‐cultural epistemology, Stafford writes, “Analogizing has the virtue of making distant peoples, other periods, and even diverse contemporary contexts part of our world. Only by making the past or the remote or the foreign proximate can we hope to make it intelligible to us” (
         1999, 51). While Stafford is right in suggesting that analogizing creates a familiarization of otherness, a familiarization we might well argue is preferable to the absolute difference postulated in colonial discourse, we also need to ask who is doing the analogizing and to what purposes. Whose “our world” and “us” is Stafford referring to? Should we (nonindigenous peoples), for instance, be able to understand Native American concepts of land through analogies from Euro‐American Lockean individualism and capitalist relations? Should we (Westerners) be entitled to interpret subject formation within, say, Indian joint families through familiar Western Oedipal narratives?3I suggest that the analogizing move within white feminist theory, working similarly through assimilation and the incorporation of racial difference, may constitute a neocolonial moment more dangerous than the earlier absence of race and, thus, may need close scrutiny.<br>

Date: 10 2005<br>
Author(s): Lee Hyo‐Dong<br>
Abstract: Taking my cue from Homi Bhabha’s twofold thesis that the colonial and postcolonial history has been characterized by the colonizers’ construction of a binary opposition between pure, homogeneous, and culturally superior Europe and the equally homogeneous but inferior and decadent other of Europe and that the traditionalist, nativist, and nationalist movements of anticolonial resistance have all more or less bought into that binary scheme repressive of hybridity and internal heterogeneity, I suggest the following sociopolitically concrete reformulation of the dialectic.
         42First of all, any claim of pure and homogeneous religious identity made today must initially be put within its proper postcolonial‐neocolonial context via a hermeneutic of suspicion and examined in regard to the degree to which it may or may not be stained with the enduring impact of the centuries‐long imposition of economic, political, and cultural master‐slave relations. For example, when today a European or Euro‐American Christian community calls for a return to the “pure,” “orthodox” tradition in total opposition to modernity—variously called “the world,” “the liberal nation‐state,” “the secular humanistic culture,” and so forth—and castigates feminist and other liberationist voices of resistance springing up both within itself and outside for having been contaminated by modernity, it is apropos to ask if that gesture of repudiation and return is an attempt to maintain an originary myth of pure and homogeneous identity in another package after modernity’s totalizing binary opposition of Europe and Other has been discredited and condemned. Especially, if that community today asserts once more the long‐standing Christian view that Christianity is the only true way, one is all the more drawn to wonder whether that assertion now camouflages a lingering residue of and an effort to perpetuate by other means the sense of culturally superior identity it enjoyed for so long, being at the center ~<br>

Issue: jr.2005.85.issue-4<br>
Date: 10 2005<br>
Author(s): Maggi Armando<br>
Abstract: According to Tesauro, the two parts of the shroud lend themselves to a number of tropological readings. If the back side may represent the Old Testament (a divine figure turning his back to the present), the front side is the New Testament (a divine presence approaching the viewer).
      54The source of Tesauro’s comparison could be the Dominican Camillo Balliani’s lengthyRagionamenti della Sacra Sindone(first ed. 1610).55Tesauro also states that in the shroud we may recognize a figure that falls and one that arises, symbols of Christ’s death and resurrection. Finally, the figure that looks at us and the one that moves away may signify the embrace of those justified by the Word’s grace and the rejection of the sinners.56If all things came into being through the Word (John 1:3), the shroud is the final disclosure of the Word’s compassion. The shroud “forewarns that last day” when God will open the “divine book of the shroud” and “will force the Enemy of Christ and the damned souls to read their condemnation written in the characters of blood.”57As Paleotto’sEsplicationehad already stated, the shroud fore‐signifies the apocalypse. At Doomsday, our bodies will see their eternal condition reflected in the shroud. Like the incarnate Word’s, our lives will acquire the stillness of “emblematic [imprese],” at once memorials of a personal past and hieroglyphics of God’s justice.<br>

Abstract: A far more urgent issue for Christian interpretation is the unpredictable consequences of learning the “language” of the Jewish tradition, including the nearest Jewish equivalent to Christian literal reading. To discover Midrash in all its subtlety and breadth of options and to understand
            peshat(the traditional sense) may well be to begin to repair a series of contacts established and broken time and again, whenever linguistic and textual Old Testament issues become pressing in intra‐Christian debate. Perhaps the future may be better than the past as a result of the intervening period of liberal scholarship and the persuasion that the two religions, even though closely intertwined, are quite distinct, each with its own integrity. The convergence of distinctness and commensurability between them has yet to be discovered, and attention to Midrash and to the literal sense may play a significant part in the discovery.53<br>

Abstract: Perspective exchange.—The idea that perspective exchange differs from information exchange, as well as the fact that it is essential for interreligious dialogue, crops up only sporadically in the theology of religions. There are three possible reasons: philosophical, civilizational, and religious reasons. Concerning the first reason: following a period of modern subject philosophy and ego psychology the insight in the “other as other,” “the other astotaliter aliter” in postmodern philosophy, has influenced people in such a manner that the simple fact of perspective exchange, as the basis of all relationships and communication of (higher animal species and) people, may have been lost. This is actually depressing, because the concept already has a long history. It emerged for the first time in American pragmatism, specifically in the symbolic interactionism of G. H. Mead.43Since then there has been a lot of research in both developmental and social psychology, and it has become a standard textbook concept.44In the past twenty years we have witnessed intensified interest in this concept, specifically in cognitive science, including cognitive psychology and cognitive anthropology, whether these disciplines use different, traditional, or new terms like role taking, social attribution, empathy, and “theory of the mind.”45According to research in these disciplines, perspective exchange seems to be a natural disposition of (higher animal species and) people; it starts developing at a very young age, and its roots lie in the functioning of the brain. Expressed negatively, the concept refers to the socioemotional disposition that enables people to step out of their own perspective in which they experience and interpret situations, other people, and themselves. It indicates, moreover, their ability to let go of their own desires, preferences, intentions, plans, and expectations. Expressed positively, it is the socioemotional disposition that enables people to switch to the per~<br>

Abstract: Whatever normative conclusions may be drawn in the end, theological ethicists ignore the unique situation of children and childhood at their own peril. Neglecting such marginalized groups as women and minorities weakened the voice of theological ethics in the past, both by silently playing into larger social wrongs and by failing to learn and grow from those silenced. Childhood in the United States and the world presents theological ethics today with a new and different but just as acute social challenge. Methodologically, since children cannot speak up as fully as can adults for themselves, theological ethicists should engage as deeply as possible with children’s actual social experiences, including through the sophisticated observational work of the human sciences, in order more creatively to understand and respond. Substantively, childhood demands at the very least renewed attention to the asymmetrical tensions of human moral responsibility, the senses in which others demand of those around them creative self‐transformation. This childist gesture of responsiveness and self‐critique has already begun to animate the human sciences. How much more, then, should it be welcomed and deepened further by Christian ethicists, who in one way or another trace a transformed world to the possibilities incarnated in an infant’s birth.<br>

Abstract: Richard Kearney has recently developed a poetic phenomenology in which moral life is understood as narrative in a similarly radical sense. Kearney argues that human relations call for constant narrative undoing and retelling because they are inherently fragile, finite, and in need of disruption by others. “Our very existence is narrative, for the task of every finite being is to make some sense of what surpasses its limits—that strange, transcendent otherness which haunts and obsesses us, from without and from within.”
         27Ethical narration expresses a core human capability for making coherent meaning within the actual limits, strangers, mysteries, and possibilities of one’s surrounding world. “The challenge,” according to Kearney, “is to envisage the existence of a narrative self prepared to work through the pain of the past in dialogue with its Others … [forming] a narrative identity woven from its own histories and those of others.”28(Note here the somewhat Freudian language again of “working through.”) The moral task involves an endless narrative “interlacing of alterities” into new and more fully shared narratives of an ever more radically loving and hopeful kind.29<br>

Author(s): Popkin Jeremy D. <br>
Abstract: While acknowledging the genre’s limitations, Popkin also insists that the best achieve literary excellence by dramatizing the humdrum rhythms of academic research into meaningful stories—about physical and emotional experiences in the archives, for instance, or the links between historical research and larger issues. Such autobiography thus enriches the understanding of both the human condition and the past. Popkin argues in an excellent chapter that historians’ memoirs of the Holocaust are both transformative texts, through which authors question their “earlier senses of self” (224), and sources of original historical understanding. By defining themselves as scholars rather than as Jews alone, their authors suggest that all survivors did not come out of the war with strengthened Jewish identities. Whether one agrees or not that autobiographies alone could have yielded such insights, the chapter’s broader claim—that the genre illuminates dimensions that conventional scholarship may have missed—is tenable. But one wonders what exactly Popkin is driving at. Should historians simply grant the genre more respect? Engage in it? Use it less fearfully as a source?<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 509555<br>
Date: 10 2007<br>
Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: With respect to academic arguments over the New Testament’s historicity, philosopher Mary Warnock has argued that the debates “show a failure to understand the full part that imagination plays not only in religion but in literature, history and in life itself, lived as it is through time, yet demanding a constant effort to make sense of time, to turn events into stories.”
         94Analogously, it can be said that the nature and function of Smith’s texts can best be understood not in terms of historical veracity but as a means to “make sense of time,” specifically biblical time. Or, in terms of narrative theory, Smith’s mythmaking may be best understood in terms of its capacity to make “human time,” that combination of what is already (our past) with what is anticipated (our future) to comprise the reality out of which we act in the present.95Thus, by maintaining the narrative function of the Bible in his own writings, Smith made more than a claim to history. He gave his believing readers a sense of what was experientially real, not merely philosophically true. Wittgenstein’s observation about Christianity is equally true of Mormonism. “Christianity is not,” he said, “based on a historical truth; rather it offers us a (historical) narrative and says: now believe! But not, believe this narrative with the belief appropriate to historical narrative, rather … make a quite different place in your life for it.”96Attention to narrative function furthers Wittgenstein’s point by positing that the believing reader’s commitment is not partial. The reader does not make “a place” for the narrative but enters—takes his or her life experience—into the narrative as a world of possibility.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 509555<br>
Date: 10 2007<br>
Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: Regarding Śaṅkara’s Advaitic perspective as internally constituted by the realistic discourse that it spins makes unnecessary many of the speculative hypotheses proposed to account for the presence of realistic elements in Śaṅkara’s thought. I am thinking in particular of the attempts on the part of scholars such as Paul Hacker and Tilmann Vetter to correlate the realist and illusionist tendencies in Śaṅkara’s thought to different stages in his philosophical development.
         71Along the lines of John Taber’s hypothesis that such developmental theories are often proposed in default of an adequate philosophical understanding of Śaṅkara’s texts,72I suspect that such theories partly reflect a failure to acknowledge the double‐voiced character of Śaṅkara’s thought.73They effectively pull apart the dialectical unity of Śaṅkara’s double‐voiced, commentarial discourse by assigning the voices to different phases in his career. According to Hacker’s well‐known conversion theory, for example, the realist elements of Śaṅkara’s oeuvre stem from a pre‐Advaita phase of his career when he wrote as an adherent of Yoga.74Yet realist elements stubbornly persist in Śaṅkara’s postconversion, Advaita works. Hacker’s explanation of these as mere survivals from Śaṅkara’s yogic past, as lapses into old habits of thought,75might appear as a makeshift intended to rescue a dubious theory from the evidence. That these realist elements cannot be so easily dismissed is indicated by the fact that at least one other scholar, Srinivasa Rao, makes them the basis for a realist interpretation of Śaṅkara.76In what appears to be an attempt to rescue the great name of Śaṅkara from orientalist and Christian apologetic critiques of “Hindu” quietism and world negation, Rao argues—somewhat unconvincingly in my view—that Śaṅkara never taught that the world was unreal.77Such a view appears only later among Śaṅkara’s followers.78Although the interpretations of Hacker and Rao differ radically with respect to~<br>

Abstract: How, then, are we to get out of the impasse and return a sense of vision to re‐vision? If rewriting is indeed change (see Moraru
         2001, 144), is change a positive value in itself? In his discussion of what he terms “radical typology,” Laurence Coupe emphasizes what he sees as myth’s “permanent possibility,” its “dynamic tension between the already and the not yet” (Coupe1997, 106). As Coupe argues, “all myths presuppose a previous narrative, and in turn form the model for future narratives” (108). In consequence, it is not toward demythologization (which is, after all, oriented toward the past and works, as Coupe points out, “in terms of closure” [108]) but toward remythologization that rewriting as re‐vision ought to aspire: to work toward disclosure, opening narratives to ever new re‐visions, and thus to “evade the stasis of doctrine” (110). “Permanent possibility,” “narrative dynamism”—Coupe’s terms echo distinctly with Bauman’s liquidity and should therefore be regarded with similar suspicion. More crucially, Coupe’s understanding of myth (derived from Paul Ricoeur) relies on a sense of utopia that is external to the rewriting it informs. As he explains, myth “is synonymous with a ‘social imagination’ which functions by virtue of a dialectic between ‘ideology’ and ‘utopia.’ … Without [ideology], we would have no sense of society or tradition; without [utopia], we would simply equate the given society and tradition with eternal truth” (1997, 96). The question remains: in the absence of utopia, what role for re‐vision?<br>

Abstract: How could a historicist point of view be used as a foundation for the question of truth in librarianship? The answer is that the suspension of truth is necessary for the growth of knowledge. Without this suspension of truth in librarianship, the accumulation of past and present knowledge could be compromised. This compromise can take various forms, such as eliminating whole collections or suppressing information that does not share the present majority view, be that view scientific, religious, or political. Although historicism negates the Enlightenment notion that there is a progression to humanity’s understanding of itself and the world, a librarian can personally affirm this teleological view concerning the growth of knowledge and still employ historicism’s suspension of truth.<br>

New York: Cam- bridge University Press. 2003. Pp. xiii, 527. $60.00. In reviewing for this journal the first two volumes of J. G. A. Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters. Gibbon's readers had to wait until 1781 for the story to pick up again. Exposition of this "first decline and fall" in fact occupies only the ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility.

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives.

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 589491<br>
2008<br>
Author(s): Stewart Garrett<br>
Abstract: Yet the nagging fact remains, lodged right at the generic crux of ethics and epistemology. For there is no denying that the withheld truth would have had a decisive ethical charge, removing the unearned guilt of years, releasing the unloved son to a different autobiographic consciousness altogether. The promissory morality of soul mates as helpmates in the novel's last paragraph—they are returned to a society that has previously contributed to their exclusion, to perform what service they now can—is of course stationed to outbid all epistemological regret. Yet to the supposed selflessness of this social ethic, the self-knowledge of the hero has been entirely sacrificed. What might have done him good is subsumed to his doing good. A logic like this does have its own communal morality, of course, but only if articulated. Instead, we get, unadmitted, a sublimation of the sexual into the social subject. In this way the closural immanence of form within the compromises of Dickens's story is neither providential nor evidentiary but merely and remorselessly conventional. I say merely, because conjugal love has been unfleshed into duty by an ideology of the so-called work ethic; remorselessly, because the pace of closure excludes all talking back from within the plot; but not seamlessly, because the false notes remain, jangling, reverberant. They remain, that is, for the reader to read—and this as a certain lingering discord that outlasts plot itself. In what we've stumbled over in the novel's final paragraph the discrepancy between knowledge and desire takes the form of a verbal deviance writ small, a mere glitch or two at the level of agreement, a predication no longer justified in the linguistic sense nor in the ethical and the epistemological senses, given that it implies a not only vaguely morbid but a downright deceptive variant of the marital two-made-one.

Abstract: In his notion of involuntary memory, Marcel corrects the Aristotelian principle that an object of the imagination that is imprinted in memory cannot coincide with the present experience of the object itself, because “there is no such thing as memory of the present.” Although he espouses the Aristotelian principle that “one can only imagine what is absent,” Marcel sees this principle as invalidated whenever the essential character of a presently experienced sensation coincides with that of a sensation imprinted in memory. In such an instance, one can enjoy the impression of the present sensation to the fullest; thanks to the intensifying “application” of one’s imagination of it, one enjoys, in other words, the impression that a sensation or event from the past is being concretely resuscitated in the here and now. This imaginative appreciation of the present throws one into the bliss of a dimension “emancipated from the order of time” (affranchie de l’ordre du temps) and makes one oblivious of or indifferent to the squalor of one’s “directly felt reality.” Aristotle, “On Memory,” in

Abstract: The remembrance of death and the love of life, which I have explored today, are in fact etched into the structures of our everyday, lived reality. Forty years ago this week, riots broke out at Columbia University and other institutions of higher learning and then, in May, throughout the United States and Europe over the war in Vietnam. Martin Luther King Jr. was shot. We are still at war but now on a global scale. And the killing of the just and innocent continues. Years ago some farsighted people grasped the massive danger we posed to our planet’s environment and forms of life, and we this week celebrate Earth Week in order to counter that danger. The past months have been scarred by an onslaught of murders in our city, especially against children. The remembrance of death surrounds us. Yet this week is also one of freedom and life. Jews around the world during Passover look back and reenact those events that led to their liberation from bondage. Christians look forward to Pentecost and the rush of new life in the spirit. Other religions also celebrate life in its many forms. People of good will around the world struggle against the onslaught of poverty, oppression, and dehumanization in the name of human dignity and also the fragile goodness of finite life.<br>

Author(s): Zimmerman Virginia<br>
Abstract: The centrality of excavations and traces reappears in the discussion of archaeology, which focuses on London and Pompeii, and Zimmerman once again emphasizes the need for an authoritative writer to interpret remains in order to give them meaning. Charles Roach Smith is an important figure here, as is Henry Layard, and Zimmerman also explores the correlations between geology and archaeology, both of which she characterizes as excavatory sciences dependent on careful fieldwork and interpretive narrative reconstruction. The examination of Pompeii looks at Victorian efforts to reanimate Pompeii through historical writing, fictional or otherwise, concentrating on the works of Edward Bulwer-Lytton, and also at Victorian recreations of Pompeian daily life, which blended past and present. It is, however, the regeneration of Victorian London, which revealed the urban archaeological sites so important to Roach Smith, that leads into the discussion of Dickens's
      Little DorritandOur Mutual Friend. Zimmerman explores and explains how, in both of these works, Dickens uses explicitly archaeological language and his characters endeavor to excavate the past in order to understand and control the present. Though not all Dickens's characters can master the march of time, those who do achieve their happy ending, as did Ida and the Prince inThe Princess. Even so, Dickens does not give his plots the completion and closure that the reader might expect, and the characters are sometimes unable to excavate their own pasts completely.<br>

Abstract: Here is why. Technological media may generally strive for and promise immediacy,
         66but cinema quickly became—and, at its most interesting, still remains—an object of gaps and absences. From the outset, cinema's remarkable psychological and cultural voltage has been built on delay and slippage. What I have dubbeddécalagelies at the heart of the medium and of each particular film, a gap between here and there as well as now and then.67This French term connotes discrepancy in space and deferral or jumps in time. At the most primary level, the film image leaps from present to past, for what is edited and shown was filmed at least days, weeks, or months earlier. This slight stutter in its articulation then repeats itself in the time and distance that separates filmmaker from spectator and spectators from each other when they see the same film on separate occasions. The gap in each of these relations constitutes cinema's difference from television and new media. Films display traces of what is past and inaccessible, whereas TV and certainly the internet are meant to feel and be present. We live with television as a continual part of our lives and our homes; sets are sold as furniture. Keeping up a twenty‐four‐hour chatter on scores of channels, TV is banal by definition. In contrast, wego outto the movies, leaving home to cross into a different realm. Every genuine cinematic experience involvesdécalage, time‐lag. After all, we are taken on a flight during and after which we are not quite ourselves.<br>

Abstract: One of the dominant trends in Buddhist studies and in the study of religion more broadly during the past few decades has been the increasing focus on the significance of the material dimensions of religion. This emphasis on materiality is commonly advocated as a corrective to earlier scholarship that tended to privilege the intellectual, spiritual, and textualized forms of religion, and the effects of this reorientation can be seen in the increasing volume of scholarship devoted to material culture and religious ritual, ranging from studies that attend to the built environments within which religious practices take place and to the material objects employed by practitioners, to analyses of the complex interactions of embodied agents engaged in ritual practice. Feminist scholars of religion have contributed greatly to the turn to the material by drawing out the interpretive implications of the fact that those ritual agents are generally embodied as either males or females, as are the scholars who observe, analyze, and, in many cases, participate in those rituals.<br>

Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: Dupré complements this account with an attentiveness to cultural continuities between the Enlightenment and preceding periods. Although historical thought during the eighteenth century tended to privilege the possibilities of the future over obligations to the past, at least some measure of faith in distant origins informs works such as Bossuet's
         Histoire universelleand even Vico'sScienza nuova, the latter imploring readers to preserve the “poetic wisdom” of the ancients or else sacrifice their present to a meaningless rationalism. Nor did eighteenth-century historians unanimously profess a belief in progress. Vico, for instance, viewed providence as a cyclical pattern of advancement and decline. Edward Gibbon, the century's most illustrious historian, went even farther in his refusal to accept Enlightenment claims of progress at face value. Despite his commitment to the idea that material and intellectual improvements could forestall decline, the imposing shadow of Rome cast doubt on the possibility that vast empires could avoid its fate in the end. Dupré's interpretation on this point differs from that of J. G. A. Pocock, who argues in his massive study ofThe Decline and Fallthat Gibbon usually resisted the temptation to equate Rome's landed empire with Britain's maritime, commercial network of colonies. Both Pocock and Dupré agree, however, that Gibbon's work effectively removed Christian ends from narratives of the past, thereby facilitating what Pocock calls “an emancipation of secular history from sacred” (Dupré, 187–228, quote on 195).43<br>

Abstract: However, the Aristotelian topos of the “sagacity of bees,” found in Bartholomeus Anglicus, Albertus Magnus, Vincent of Beauvais, and Thomas Aquinas, was adopted to signify the wonder of nature.
      70Thus, whether in their natural environment, as parallel to an idealized monastic setting, or linked with the “celestial realm,” bees, as the least animal-like creatures who were deemed closest to the heavenly sphere, offered Dante an image for an idealized golden age, an eschatological future already realized in the natural world. Dante's transfigured golden age, however, is not in the past but in the immanent present of the actions of bees, which as nonhuman creatures most like angels, and as poetic vehicles, make transcendence visible in the immanent world of nature. But there is more here, because Dante's use of the nonhuman animal simile places the immanent creature outside itself, and knowledge of self, and makes this a condition of blessedness to which humans might aspire. This has both an aesthetic and heuristic function because it poses a question about the philosophical boundaries that place man above all other creatures. The fact that the poet chooses insects, bees, birds, or fish and avoids mammals (except of course the lamb) as his vehicles to convey this insight suggests these creatures are more analogous to this “blessed” condition than wolves or other predatory creatures. Mammals, in Dante's bestiary, tend to fall easily into the static allegory/personification realm, in step with the “common association” notion of the metaphor, whereas Dante's similes with insects, bees, birds, or fish show how a close observation of nature can become the poetic means for making the immanent transcendent and the transcendent present in the immanent.<br>

Abstract: Various features come to the fore. First, there is the formal aspect of time as present. Since its integral nature would seem to make time look like eternity, and since eternity has got everything to do with the “present of the present,” it is important to keep the two apart while at the same time honoring their affinity. In its capacity of enduring attention, it can be reduced neither to a point nor to the uncertainties of historicity pure and simple: it passes in a point. Second, the absence of a
      distinctio realisof future, present, and past inside the flux of time eliminates any possible chain of cause and effect. Thus the will can never be seen to establish a future for its own sake, since such a move presupposes a distinctness that would never allow that future to turn into atemps perduas if there were a real distance between past and future. Third, it would be wide of the mark to conclude from this “foregrounding” of temporality that the dimensions of the future and the past would be flattened. Rather, the contrary may be the case. Precisely in this prism of the present, “contingent events” break into myriads of presents, futures, and pasts. As for this “foregrounding” of time, what obtains for Joyce and Proust does so a fortiori for Augustine. Fourth, there is the issue of consciousness, for, far from floating in the air, time for Augustine is firmly embedded in consciousness: “All [manifestations of] time [alle Zeiten] are subjected to the movement, never to come to rest, of the actual flux of consciousness and are to flow into each other uninterruptedly.” To put it in Augustine's own words: “So, it is in you, my mind, that I measure periods of time.”
            Quite. But to be able to establish a link between, respectively, life as gift, time as the shift between future, present and past, and a sustained arrogation of voice, no allowances can be made for even the slightest gaps between those manifestations of time and of consciousness as if consciou~<br>

Article Title: Why Devils Came When Faustus Called Them<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 660269<br>
Date: 08 2011<br>
Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: Faustus's rejection of faith is both producer and product of his sense that salvation will entail his own erasure, because it alienates him from his soul by alienating him from God; it is both producer and product of his determination not to read “past” what is material and embodied to what is intangible, because it gives him the sense that the intangible will turn out to be nothing. Yet Faustus's lack of faith does not enable him to feel that there is in fact no life after death. On the contrary, Faustus is obsessed with the afterlife and with hell specifically, about which he repeatedly questions Mephistopheles. Not that Faustus believes what Mephistopheles tells him about hell, however: he scoffs, “come, I think hell's a fable” (2.1.130) when the devil informs him that “hell hath no limits, nor is circumscribed / In one self place; for where we are is hell, / And where hell is, must we ever be” (2.1.124–26). Faustus will not imagine hell as a universally diffused, Augustinian state of privation; rather, he insists on imagining hell as an extension or reproduction of the university where he currently resides. In response to Mephistopheles' insistence that he himself is “damned, and…now in hell” (2.1.140), Faustus impatiently replies, “how now, in hell? Nay, and this be hell, / I'll willingly be damned here! What, walking, disputing, / etc.” (2.1.141–43). “Damned here…walking, disputing, etc.”: Faustus reveals how much it matters to him that hell be a place, and not a state of the soul. Faced with a salvation that seems to entail his annihilation in the disappearance or dissolution of his body, Faustus is comforted by the idea of a hell where he will walk and dispute, where he can have reading groups with the “old philosophers” (1.3.62) and where “the infernal spirits” will “swarm” (1.1.117) to his lectures. Imagining hell as a continuation of his brilliant academic career, Faustus simply sees damnation as the better choice.<br>

Author(s): Bowman Sharon<br>
Abstract: First, it is not clear that Larmore’s evidence for mimetism (chap. 2) shows anything more than Charles Taylor or Wittgenstein have argued concerning meaning in general: our efforts to shape a practical identity must employ a shared language (32). That deliberation by reflection “consists in comparing ourselves to someone else” only seems evident if it amounts simply to Mead’s or Habermas’s point that reasons are dialogical or intersubjective (41), which Larmore repeatedly affirms (34). The thesis becomes dubious if instead it means that all persons are primarily motivated by tuitive motives such as envy, desire for status, or comparative advantage or that our achieving reputation in the eyes of others is fundamental to us, as Larmore’s examples often suggest (31, 46). Second, following “models” need not amount to “heteronomy” (35) since all plausible conceptions of personal autonomy admit sources of agentive capacities that influence a child in her upbringing without her choosing them; these are the educative processes that enable self-determination to start. Third, the theory of mimetism that Larmore reconstructs from René Girard seems to make any radical innovation in the history of ideas impossible. How then could the Troubadours have introduced the concept of romantic love (35)? How could cultures grow or develop if nothing is not copied from the past? Fourth, rejecting a latent self that subsists “deep inside us … unsullied by all that we have borrowed from others” (37) implies that unreflective emoting and action (or ‘flow’) is not more likely to constitute an experience of “being wholly ourselves” (55). Yet Larmore retains a version of Stendhal’s idea that completely unreflective experience is more “natural” (27) and provides one kind of authenticity since it leaves out the perspective of others that reflection always brings (64). This negative definition does not allow us to distinguish authentic spontaneity from merely careless or thoughtless ways of being ~<br>

Abstract: In addition to developing a theological anthropology, Regan lays the groundwork for a human rights praxis of “just memory,” drawing on the work of Paul Ricoeur. Situating human rights discourse between the memory of suffering and the hope for a better future, Regan develops an ethics toward just memory, which includes allowing individuals to face the scars and wounds of memory in order to work through the past (101), enabling the pragmatic use of memory throughout a community through construction of narrative (101–2), and articulating an ethical-political duty of remembrance for purposes of preventing destructive tendencies, allowing the possibility of forgiveness, and retaining a heritage of victimization to counter the historical tendency to celebrate victors (102). Regan discusses the report of human rights violations and their individual and societal impacts, produced by the Office of the Catholic Archdiocese of Guatemala, as an example of how such an ethic can be put into practice.<br>

Author(s): Csordas Thomas<br>
Abstract: We can make one more pass over the terrain of witchcraft, however, to offer a specific cross-cultural example of how taking account of evil might contribute to an anthropological approach to morality. This reflection originates with the recent observation by Jenkins (
         2013) that in contemporary Zuni society witchcraft remains a problem, that moreover some witches are children, and that it appeared that the witches were becoming younger all the time. There is evidence that even in earlier times it was known that a Zuni child could decide to learn witchcraft (Ellis1989:196), but the idea that children might not only require protection from witchcraft but also be accused of it is disturbing. Unfortunately, the Zuni are not unique. The idea of child witchcraft appears to have been introduced to the subarctic Athabaskan Kaska around the turn of the twentieth century, whereupon a pattern of witch-killing ensued in which a child was blamed for someone’s serious illness and often “confessed to the crime which he did not understand” (Honigmann1989:29). Harsh punishment and execution of child witches was common among Arawak-speaking peoples of the Peruvian Amazon until around 1970 (following mass conversions to Christianity) but resurfaced in the 1990s in the context of intense political violence; the accused do not protest their innocence because they feel that the accusation itself constitutes proof regardless of their intentions or awareness of any occult powers (Santos-Granero2004). In the past several years an epidemic of child witchcraft in Africa has been reported both in the scholarly literature (de Boeck2005; Ranger2007) and in popular press reports from the Congo (Dowden2006; Harris2009) and the Niger Delta in Nigeria (Harrison2008; Houreld2009). Children are subjected to brutal exorcisms, abandoned to the streets, or murdered, often by pastors in the name of fundamentalist Christianity. Again, children “can be persuaded to accept it’s their fault. They tel~<br>

Author(s): Fisher Cass<br>
Abstract: Cass Fisher has set for himself a noble goal: “to reframe the debate about the role of theology in Judaism and Jewish studies by proposing a new model for understanding Jewish theological language” (2). The impetus for this project is the awareness that although the discipline of Jewish studies has thrived in the past half century, theology is still marginal because of the mistaken perception that “there is no Jewish theology” (3) or that “Judaism has produced the wrong kind of theology” (4). Fisher correctly and persuasively argues that such perception not only is historically incorrect but also ignores a thriving “post-Holocaust theology, feminist theology, exegetical theology, and covenantal theology” (3), a list that could have included environmental theology. To appreciate the degree to which theological thinking is central to Judaism, a new and more appropriate understanding of theology is in order. Theology is not to be reduced to propositional speculations about God but should rather be understood as belief-forming activities that are an integral part of Jewish religious practice, including exegesis, hermeneutics, rational discourse on divine perfection, and religious experience.<br>

Abstract: But even as the play frustrates our understanding, it requires our response. This requirement is especially acute in the case of Cordelia, for the king is not the only one caught up in the face-to-face encounter with her. As the drama draws to a close, Lear exhorts every person in the theater to cast eyes on his daughter: “Do you see this? Look on her. Look, her lips, / Look there, look there” (5.3.285–86).
      
            In performance, it is not uncommon for the actor playing Lear to turn his body and speak these lines directly to the audience, rotating and elevating Cordelia’s inert form so as to present it to the seated spectators. The staging feels right, for in his last lines the king offers to each of us the daughter who has repeatedly offered herself to him. Yet what do we see if we obey Lear’s injunction and look? We see, to be sure, a beloved daughter who is dead, but we also see an actor who is dressed up and dissimulating. “Beholders are asked to see what may not exist,” Holahan writes, “for this is and is not Cordelia. Her character now appears only in an actor’s body’s mimicry of a past life—a striking union of death and theatrical illusion.”48
         
            The “Cordelia” we are asked to consider is a theatrical construct: a person masked in a dramatic character. To what degree, then, can we live up to Lear’s final command and look on, lament, and love this virtuous girl? Is it even possible for us to submit ourselves to a simulation?49<br>

Abstract: But while Eve merely adopts the style of satanic speech, Adam in fact speaks for the devil—imagining how Satan might verbally respond to the fall of man. And while Raphael gives us speech that Satan might have said in the past, Adam gives us a future conditional form of satanic speech—what the devil might say in the future. As Adam is quick to point out, however, this is a “matter of scorn not to be giv’n the foe”; that is, even as he pronounces these “satanic” words, Adam admits that these are not and never can be the devil’s own words. God, Adam thinks, will never allow the universe to be such that Satan will be able to utter these words (he is wrong of course—God will allow the universe to be such that Satan could utter such words; God simply will not allow them to be true). With his final line then, Adam retroactively erases the quotation marks most editors place around these lines. What begins as quotation ends as pure creation.<br>

Article Title: From Religionless Christianity to Immanent Grace: Bonhoeffer’s Legacy in Badiou<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 677726<br>

Author(s): Urbaniak Jakub<br>
Abstract: In traditional (Augustinian) terms, it means that ecclesia must be
      semper reformanda, which is to say, it needs to preserve a constant potential for radical reformation that can be drawn only from the novelty of evental grace. The church, like every institution, is susceptible to the tendency of withdrawing into a particularism of its own that can easily lead to its becoming parochial and eventually degenerate into a private but harmless eccentricity of a minority. That is why Badiou’s emphasis on the uniqueness of evental grace as the only source of the subject’s identity appears to be so relevant. Christ’s resurrection summons ecclesia to become a “new Israel,” and not a “second Israel,” that is, another particular community alongside Israel and many others; it engenders the courage to be constantly people on the way, boldly crossing all borders, instead of turning the faith in the Resurrected into a “heritage of the fathers,” an inherited property that reduces the “Father of Jesus Christ” to the “God of the fathers.” Put briefly, from the very beginning Christianity has been established as a religion that would surpass religion.
               (Isn’t this what Bonhoeffer means when he states that “Christ does not bring a new religion; rather, he brings God”?178
            
               ). Halík points out that such a position is a radical emulation of Saint Paul who presents Christianity, not as an aspect of some orthodoxy or orthopraxis, but as a faith capable of dissociating itself from its past, ridding itself of old customs and certainties, rejecting particularity, and going to others.179
            
               In this context, “Paul’s crossing of the borders of Israel and setting out for the ‘people’ (the pagans) should be a paradigm for the entire history of the church.”180
            
               Christians must not make light of the Gospel’s novelty by clinging to the past and remaining in the narrow confines of particular traditions fun~<br>

Abstract: Peperzak’s account of philosophy as conversation emphasizes a few key themes. First, he defends the view that the history of philosophy is an integral part of the practice of philosophy. A tradition in his account is a living conversation in which philosophical sources are not simply transmitted but transformed in the process. Speaking to his fellow Catholic philosophers, Peperzak at once defends the legitimacy of appeal to the historical traditions of communities for citizens of the “Republic of philosophy” (176) and insists that tradition cannot simply canonize past thinkers but must become part of the ongoing conversation of the present. Second, Peperzak emphasizes more than most philosophers the significance of philosophical style. For him, style is the particularization of philosophical tradition and thematics in lived conversations. It marks my individual way of offering my voice to a philosophical companion—a unique event, even if what is Said may repeat inherited propositions (90–91).<br>

Author(s): Popkin Jeremy D.<br>
Abstract: The value of Popkin's approach becomes clear in his chapter on two historians whose autobiographies have been included in the literary canon for many years: Edward Gibbon and Henry Adams. By reading them as historians, Popkin offers new insights to an already great body of literature on these authors, for instance by showing that both Gibbon and Adams believed that their personal experiences helped them in understanding the past. Not all 327 autobiographers listed in the bibliography are discussed in depth, and in chapters on vocation and career their works serve to sketch an impression of the historical profession in the twentieth century. Bookish children from middle‐class backgrounds, as most historians have been, often picked up their vocation from parents or teachers. They were also often inspired by children's books like those by Jules Verne and Karl May, which is interesting, because despite these literary models they chose to write nonfiction. For Popkin this is a telling detail, as he concludes that historians are obviously motivated by a wish to tell stories. With few exceptions historians are reluctant to write about their careers. Most are silent about their academic successes, failures, and frustrations, and few pages are spent on the daily life of teaching courses and doing administrative work. On the contrary, most authors want to show that they had another life besides their profession. Therefore they often describe their own lives against the background of great events. Since Jean‐Jacques Rousseau's
      Confessions, autobiography has been seen as a genre that should focus on the innermost experience and not world events, but many historians simply could not cast off their professional background. Often only those historians who were involved in politics became aware of how little an individual could accomplish, or lost faith in the ideas they once had believed. Holocaust memoirs are discussed in a separate chapter, in which Popkin concludes that t~<br>

Abstract: In Book XI of his
      Confessions, Augustine formulated the dialectic between historical time and eternity: “Some such different times [past, present, future] do exist in the mind, but nowhere else that I can see. The present of past things is the memory; the present of present things is direct perception; and the present of future things is expectation. If we speak in these terms, I can see three times and I admit that they exist.” According Mooij, “for Augustine … the dependence of time on the soul or mind was only partial” (pp. 68, 78).<br>

Abstract: 3. Jessica Tiffin points out that “from the moment he enters the village, and despite his characterization both in heroic motif and active, masculine past tense, the cyclist's historical nature is subsumed into the unreal space of fairy tale and the Gothic” (85). The shift from the descriptions of the countess in the present tense to the narrative past begins with the words, “One hot, ripe summer day in the pubescent years of the present century, a young officer in the British army, blond, blue-eyed, heavy-muscled, visiting friends in Vienna, decided to spend the remainder of his furlough exploring the little-known uplands of Romania” (Carter, 97).<br>

Abstract: Benjamin also notes: “Every present day is determined by the images that are synchronic with it: each ‘now’ is the now of a particular recognizability. In it, truth is charged to the bursting point with time. (This point of explosion, and nothing else, is the death of the
            intentio, which thus coincides with the birth of authentic historical time, the time of truth.) It is not that what is past casts its light on what is present, or what is present its light on what is past; rather, image is that wherein what has been comes together in a flash with the now to form a constellation” (2002, N3,1). The two great related demands made by T. S. Eliot in “Tradition and the Individual Talent” will also be recalled here: his call for the exercise of the “historical sense” as a juxtaposition of significant events from discontinuous times, which in turn produces an “impersonal” (nonintentional) effect. These demands define the representation of history in works such asThe Waste Landand Pound’s early cantos.<br>

Article Title: Poetics of Conspiracy and Hermeneutics of Suspicion in Tacitus's<br>
Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: ca.2013.32.issue-1<br>
Date: 04 2013<br>
Abstract: This article argues that the end of Tacitus's
         Dialogus de Oratoribusis inconclusive in ways that draw attention to the difficulty of interpretation not onlyofthe dialogue, as by modern scholars, but alsointhe dialogue, as by its leading characters. The inconclusiveness is especially marked by a commonly noted, but little discussed, feature of the end: when the rest of the characters laugh at the point of departure, Tacitus himself does not. Arguing that this difference of affective response on the part of the characters prefigures differences in interpretive response on the part of readers, the article identifies different strains in recent scholarship: pessimistic and optimistic. Both forms of response entail an attribution of a “poetics of conspiracy” (Hinds) to the ultimate speaker of the dialogue, the author Tacitus, and a “hermeneutics of suspicion” (Ricoeur) to its reader. At the same time, the author's double-position, as character and author, between narrated event and narration of the event to the reader, suggests that the other characters in the dialogue may, like the author and reader, also exercise such poetics and hermeneutics on one another and themselves. The article ends with thecomparandumof the first satire of Tacitus's near contemporary, Juvenal, suggesting that, in the case of these works that can look with hindsight on the social and political past of the Early Empire, their modes of transmission and reception may be politically determined (e.g., as conspiratorial, suspicious) but may also demonstrate, within the restrictions of social and political determinations, a high degree of contingency, reflexivity, and autonomy. Such possibilities suggest that the text itself is part of a pragmatic and performative tradition of the kind enacted by its characters, in addition to a tradition of the production of (comparatively static and unfree) “literary” works.<br>

Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: jams.2004.57.issue-3<br>
Date: February 2005<br>
Author(s): Higgins Paula<br>
Abstract: Within the theoretical framework of Roland Barthes's writings on myth and ideology, this essay seeks to expose the historical legitimation project through which the mythmaking, universalizing rhetoric of musical genius that has long surrounded the figure of Ludwig van Beethoven came to infiltrate scholarship on Josquin des Prez, culminating in his late twentieth-century apotheosis. Contextualizing the composer's reception history with respect to the debates between Joseph Kerman and Edward Lowinsky in 1965 and especially the 1971 Josquin Festival-Conference, the author suggests that the ideological refashioning of Josquin in the image of Beethoven has simultaneously shaped and derailed the intellectual trajectory of early music scholarship in the past thirty years. By privileging a discourse of musical genius in the service of which, among other concerns, the canon of works attributed to the composer is being decimated beyond historical recognition, the richness and complexity of the musical culture of which he was a vital part risks being overshadowed and obfuscated by the disproportionate amount of attention invested in his singular accomplishments. The essay advocates a resolute historicization of sixteenth-century discourses of creative endowment, a critical reassessment of the role of authentication scholarship in Josquin studies, and a renewed sensitivity to the imbrication of mythologies of musical genius in music historiographies of both the past and the present.<br>

Abstract: In chapter three, “Temporality,” Wu deploys Paul Ricoeur’s concepts of time as an analytical tool to great advantage.
      
            Wu writes that images within the tomb such as star maps and animals associated with the cardinal directions align the deceased with the underlying structure of the cosmos in what Ricoeur would call “cosmic time.” In contrast, personal objects buried with the dead represent a “lived time.” These embody two different forms of time: at the funeral they evoke the past life of the deceased, but once buried in a tomb they cater to the needs of the soul in the present and future. A third kind of time, “historical time,” represented by textual and pictorial biographies of the deceased and narratives of important historical figures, reconstructs his or her public persona. And finally, the frequent depiction of chariots on tomb walls represents a journey that enables the deceased to move through time within the tomb.1<br>

Abstract: Walter Pater's theoretical "come-back" over the past forty years or so has been dominated by the competing claims of the new historicism and deconstruction, both of which discover prescient forerunners of their own, seemingly mutually exclusive, theoretical concerns in Pater's aesthetic criticism and in his historical novel Marius the Epicurean (1885). Yet despite their obvious differences, both critical approaches share one thing in common: the same post-humanist denigration of the trope of metaphor in favor of the seemingly more ethically responsive (because inclusive) trope of metonymy. In this essay I observe how the new historicism's and deconstruction's privilegings of metonymy as the prime trope of difference poses an immediate problem for ethical thought that, largely under the influence of Alain Badiou, has become increasingly cognizant of the need for a workable conception of sameness (or universality), traditionally supplied by metaphor. Accordingly, this close reading of the metaphorical dialectic of one of Pater's surprisingly underread Imaginary Portraits, "Sebastian van Storck" (1887), explores the basic charge against metaphor-namely, that it is an essentially "theological" trope insofar as it invariably pre-posits the "identity" that it modestly claims to have merely discovered. Employing the central figure of Sebastian's idealism- equation-I venture that, once rethought as a relation not of identity but of equivalence, metaphor is capable of shouldering the rhetorical burden of similarity without relinquishing its ethical claim as a primary producer of new differences in the world and is, hence, deserving of a central place in a post-deconstructive ethics.<br>

Author(s): Abbott Don Paul<br>
Abstract: AbstractBeginning with Roland Barthes' “The Old Rhetoric: an aide-mémoire” (1964–65), semioticians have shown a remarkable interest in the history of rhetoric. Writers like Barthes, Tzevtan Todorov, Gérard Genette, and Paul Ricoeur have offered accounts of rhetoric's past that invariably concluded with rhetoric's demise and its replacement with semiotics. These writers typically portray rhetoric's history as one of a brief rise followed by a very long decline, a pattern, says Todorov, of “splendor and misery.” This essay examines the semioticians' predictions of rhetoric's demise as well as semiotics' attempt to claim elements of rhetoric as its own. The essay concludes by considering the present state of semiotics' aspiration to supersede rhetoric as a theory of language and human affairs.<br>

Article Title: Text and Temporality: Patterned-Cyclical and Ordinary-Linear Forms of Time-Consciousness, Inferred from a Corpus of Australian Aboriginal and Euro-Australian Life-Historical Interviews<br>
Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: si.1999.22.issue-2<br>

Abstract: It is argued that autobiographical texts, such as life-historical interviews, provide the richest possible source of information about a person's temporality and a culture's historical past. It is proposed that time-consciousness can be inferred from such texts. To this end, ethnographic and other studies of Australian Aboriginal time-consciousness were used to construct a seven-part model of patterned-cyclical time-consciousness. Turning these seven attributes of patterned-cyclical time-consciousness into their opposites yields seven features of one-dimensional, ordinary-linear time-consciousness, thereby establishing a structured temporal polarity. A lexical-level, content-analytic methodology, Neurocognitive Hierarchical Categorization Analysis (NHCA), is introduced, in which folk-concepts of time from
         Roget's International Thesauruswere used to construct wordlist indicators for 9 of the 14 definitional components. Then, using NHCA for a comparative analysis of texts consisting of life-historical interviews, earlier results of an empirical study were brieflv re-presented. Australian Aborigines, compared to Euro-Australian controls, used a significantly smaller proportion of words for an index of ordinary-linear time but a higher proportion of words for an index of patterned-cyclical time, indicating a time-consciousness that is primarily patterned-cyclical rather than linear. Females were less linear and more patterned-cyclical than males in both cultures. These cross-cultural results contribute predictive validity to the proposed polarity of time-consciousness. Implications for the culture-and-cognition paradox and its resolution in dual-brain theory are addressed.<br>

Abstract: An assumed link between language and experience prompted the narrative collection and mutual interpretation of data between me and an immigrant from Iran whom I taught ESL. An underlying theme of the study was the quest for a helpful image of language. Realizing that dictionary meanings were inadequate in the meaning-making process, we concentrated on illustrative examples for the meaning of words. We exploited mininarratives implicit in such examples-incipient stories based on the speaker's past, present, and imaginatively projected experiences. As we expanded these "experiential narratives," the student's personal practical knowledge emerged and helped clarify troublesome words and sentences. Viewing language as experiential narrative demonstrated the importance of the context of acquisition. It increased opportunities for the negotiation of meaning and highlighted the notion of agency in the constitution of meanings.<br>

Article Title: Formal Fascinations and Nagging Excerpts: The Challenge of the Arts to Curriculum and Inquiry<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers, Inc.<br>
Issue: i250466<br>
Date: 4 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): White Marcy Singer<br>
Abstract: This article examines challenges to discourses of curriculum research and practice by the growing fascination with alternative forms of representation. The author takes as a starting point a cluster of exchanges with students that were situated in a study of a classroom in which music and image joined word and number as essential sources for learning about a context irreducibly distant from students' own: the past. In the study, what seemed to make painting, photography, film, and poetry potent sources of understanding was their capacity to bridge the gap between a remote, textbook past, and the sensory world of the students' present; these forms expressed to students not only the outline of events, but also what the events signified and felt like. Yet, in juxtaposing students' comments against discourses of historiography, philosophical aesthetics, and history teaching and learning, one soon recognizes that the very ability of the arts to communicate a sense of immediacy and human intention is what makes them problematic as sources of historical insight: in pushing out the boundaries of "acceptable" forms beyond discursive text, one also pushes up against assumptions about the nature and purposes of knowledge and inquiry. While the starting point of this article is historical inquiry, the author argues that the difficulties of representing experiences of persons in contexts removed in time or space, and of making sense of others' representations, are relevant to other forms of inquiry; the challenge of the arts to historical inquiry is paralleled in other fields, and no less in educational research.<br>

Abstract: Archaeological periodization constructs narratives with beginnings, middles and ends. But the material culture on which such narratives are built is also involved in narratives according to which past agents lived their lives. According to Ricoeur, such lived narratives are also related to agents' practical experience of time. As archaeologists we have to 'read' past narratives through the rhetoric by which they were expressed. While Hayden White's scheme for temporal cycles of rhetoric is rejected, the sequence of material culture at Sitagroi is examined in order to explore the relationships between the plots written by archacologists and those lived by past agents at the site. Past and present concepts of time are embedded in different narratives and expressed through different rhetorics, but some interaction between the two is possible.<br>

Publisher: Butterworth-Heinemann<br>
Issue: i262155<br>
Date: 8 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Kramer Réjean<br>
Abstract: As a basis for the professionalization of their field, architectural historians have assumed the autonomy and verifiability of historical knowledge. Central to these premises is the view that the archives and monuments of the past are the primary sources of the discipline. The historian's task is conceived as the gathering, selection, and verification of facts, the interpretation of which is presented in "literary" form for the sake of communicability. As such, a separation of form from content is assumed. However, recent studies in historiography insist on the determinant role played by the language of the historian upon the representation of history. In these works, critical insights developed in the fields of linguistics, rhetoric, and literary theory are brought to bear upon the analysis of historical accounts, pointing to the other "source" of history: discourse and rhetoric. This article reassesses the link among history, literature, and language. It raises the issue of the nature and authority of historical narratives and encourages rethinking their role within the discipline of architecture.<br>

Article Title: Is Zoroastrianism Dualistic or Monotheistic?<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263718<br>
Date: 12 1, 1961<br>
Author(s): Zaehner Donald A.<br>
Abstract: The question raised in the title has been much debated by past and present interpreters of Zoroastrianism. In the first two parts of this paper we present some dualistic and monotheistic interpretations of the religion. The interpretations can be labeled as follows: 1. DUALISTIC INTERPRETATIONS 1. The View That Angra Mainyu Is Primordial But Lacks Omnipotence And Omniscience (Dhalla, Henning) 2. The View That Angra Mainyu Is Primordial But Lacks A Physical Nature (Shaked, Boyce) II. MONOTHEISTIC INTERPRETATIONS 1. The Created Spirits View (Zaehner, Fox, Gershevitch) 2. The Transformationist (Maskhiyya) View 3. The Zurvānite View 4. The View That Good And Evil Are Coeternal Only In A Logical Sense (Moulton, Bode and Nanavutty, Duchesne-Guillemin) We present each of these views and discuss it critically in light of the following criteria: (1) textual evidence; (2) the continuity of the religion throughout its history, including the present time; (3) philosophical cogency; and (4) religious satisfaction. Our conclusion is that each of the above positions, despite its elements of strength, falls seriously short of one or more of these criteria, and hence that there is need for a more adequate interpretation of Zoroastrianism than any of them can offer. Accordingly, we present another interpretation in order to provoke further discussion and, hopefully, to advance the cause of trying to gain a more precise grasp of the teachings of this remarkable religion. In brief, the interpretation we favor is that Zoroastrianism combines cosmogonic dualism and eschatological monotheism in a manner unique to itself among the major religions of the world. This combination results in a religious outlook which cannot be categorized as either straightforward dualism or straightforward monotheism, meaning that the question in the title of this paper poses a false dichotomy.

Abstract: Recent study of the nature of textuality as such opens new insights for the study of the Bible. Although individual parts of the Bible have oral antecedents, the Bible as a whole has existed only as a text, and a unique kind of text, folded back on itself out of communal memory as no other book has been. A text is a monument. Textuality establishes a special relationship between discourse and death. Spoken words are exchanges between living persons. The text presents its message as well if its author is dead as it does if he or she is alive. Print is even more bound to death than writing is. In comparison with oral performance-delivery of an oration, song-a text physically has certain special alliances with past time. All texts come out of the past. Literature as text is psychologically retrospective: its effects typically include an element of nostalgia. Because of its future orientation, culminating in the closing words of Revelation, "Come, Lord Jesus" (as against typical narrative closes such as "They lived happily ever after"), the Bible has an unusual relationship to textuality: it is not literature in the way other texts are. Typical narrative plot structures existence retrospectively: the story is organized back from the conclusion. This retrospective organization is maximized by writing, which tightens plot and makes more of re-cognition, a kind of return to the beginning (the past) and hence a cyclic pattern. In addition to being related intimately to death, writing and print are also limitlessly fecund, the central forces in the evolution of consciousness, once they appear. The fecundity of writing and print, like other fecundity in human existence, is achieved by passage through death. "Unless the grain of wheat dies." The Word of God in the Person of Jesus Christ is conceived of by analogy with the spoken word. The Father speaks the Word, the Son (eo verbum quo filius); he does not write the Word, who would then by biblical attestation be not life but d~<br>

Abstract: Augustine's De Trinite: "As regards things past one means by memory that which makes it possible
for them to be recalled and thought over again; so as regards something present, which is what the
mind is to itself, one may talk without absurdity of memory as that by which the mind is available
to itself, ready to be understood by its thought about itself, and for both to be conjoined by its love
of itself' (1991c: 14.3.14)<br>

Abstract: Creativity is seen as inherent in the developmental potential of the individual and of society as well. This "yen for becoming" is felt at all ages, and is in fact recognized as associated with the realization of the profoundest aspirations of man. Its origin is detected in early childhood. It is deeply rooted in the associative trend of thought and action, a trend which tends to perpetuate itself in the direction of unending abundance and novelty. The process assumes passage from awareness to memory, and even to the subconscious. The thought of the moment dips into the past, awakens memories, even those seemingly forgotten, reactivates all that is pertinent for the creation of new structures. It is believed that this tendency is essentially dynamic, endowed with energy which drives toward endless realizations. Nothing dies in the subconscious, as Freud pointed out. Each past experience is apt to return into consciousness and engage in a double process of homogenization and heterogenization, of convergent and divergent currents. Here the combinations, or commutations and permutations, are indefinite, an array which defies any computer. Creativity calls into play all energized experiences, present and stored, cognitive and affective, perceptual and conceptual, sensory and motoric, verbal and non-verbal, taxonomic and functional, real and symbolic; it constantly provokes new patterns. The richer the content of experience, the greater the possibility of innovation. The creative construction starts with the activation of readily available knowledge, the elements of which trigger related material in the memory and the subconscious. The movement is derived from active associations that continue to connect the units, and is oriented toward specific goals, leading to eventual syntheses, which may be expressed in either action or discourse. Here we face an unfurling, which coincides with interpretation, the unlocking of the new meaning built from the past upon the first mean~<br>

Abstract: According to a school of thought that has been gaining ground for about a century, the social sciences are best conceived as styles of humanistic inquiry akin to hermeneutics rather than as branches of naturalistic inquiry paralleling the natural or physical sciences. In the past decade or so, advocates of this position have been active in providing critiques of educational research. It is argued that, although the case has some merit, the prognosis is mistaken--traditional naturalistic inquiry in education and the social sciences will continue to have an important and strong role. /// D'après une école de pensée qui gagne du terrain depuis environ un siècle, les sciences sociales devraient être considérées comme des enquêtes humanistes apparentées à l'herméneutique plutôt que comme des disciplines cherchant à comprendre la nature des choses comme le font les sciences naturelles. Au cours de la dernière décennie, les partisans de ce point de vue ont multiplié leurs critiques à l'endroit de la recherche en éducation. On affirme que, même si ce point de vue est valable à certains égards, le pronostic donné est erroné: les recherches en éducation cherchant à élucider la nature même de son objet d'étude et les sciences sociales continueront à jouer un rôle clé. /// Eine geistige Richtung, die sich seit etwa einem Jahrhundert stärker durchsetzt, sieht die Socialwissenschaften am ehesten als Arten humanistischer Untersuchung, die mit der Hermeneutik verwandt sind, denn als Zweige der naturalistischen Untersuchung, die den Natur- oder Physik-Wissenschaften gleichen. In den letzten zehn Jahren etwa waren Vertreter dieser Schule aktiv damit beschäftig, kritische Abhandlungen über erziehungswissenschaftliche Forschung vorzubringen. Es wird argumentiert, daß die gestellte Prognose falsch ist, wenngleich die Sache einen gewissen Wert hat--traditionelle naturalistiche Forschung in den Erziehungs--und Sozialwissenschaften wird weiterhin eine wichtige und starke Rolle spielen. ///~<br>

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i208500<br>

Abstract: This commentary article focuses on a crucial moment in the formation of Peruvian Creole nationalism: the 1836-9 Peruvian-Bolivian Confederation. Nationalist sentiments expressed through the anti-confederationist press, satiric poetry and pamphlets, glorified the Inca past while spurning the Indian present. During this period, a nationalist, essentially racist, rhetoric whose roots can be traced to the late eighteenth century, took shape. This rhetoric would provide the foundations of an ideology which has prevailed in Peruvian history. This rhetoric reached its peak in the twentieth century, while evolving into a historiographical discourse instrumental to the exercise of power and which is now in crisis.<br>

Author(s): Brockelman Paul<br>
Abstract: The new scientific cosmology which has emerged over the past forty years seems to be forcing philosophers and theologians alike to rethink the traditional theistic conception of God in which God is pictured as a First Cause designer of the universe in favor of what Joseph Campbell more mystically calls an "immanent ground of being, transcendent of conceptualization." The central thrust of these reflections is that we encounter that "immanent ground of being" through the experience of wonder and awe. Since actual experience is involved, then a phenomenological description of exactly what it is in the new cosmology (and the universe) which induces such wonder is possible. The basic thesis is that we experience wonder in the face of the remarkable and transcendent (beyond finite predicates and understanding) coming-into-being of nature over twelve to fifteen billion years. Wonder is the human reaction to and appreciation for the astounding fact that nature and all of its parts actually are. It is; we are; such is the ineffable beyond in our midst.<br>

Author(s): de Lame Danielle<br>
Abstract: Rwanda became a Belgian trusteeship under mandate of the Société des Nations after the first World War. With churches playing a prominent role in the political evolution of Rwanda, the two countries were closely bound together. After the 1959 revolution in Rwanda and independence in 1962, development cooperation with strong NGO input still linked them. While the genocide still has tragic influence on the new Rwanda, Belgium has undergone a political process leading to a federal state. The colonial past refers to a national past. Changes in Rwanda and Belgium question any collective attempt of mourning for a past that is very different for all parties involved. /// Le Rwanda devint une possession de la Belgique sous le mandat de la Société des Nations après la Première Guerre Mondiale. La conséquence du rôle proéminent des églises dans l'évolution politique du Rwanda fut la création de liens étroits entre les deux pays. Après la révolution de 1959 au Rwanda et l'indépendance en 1962, la coopération de développement avec l'impact des ONG ont maintenu ces liens entre les deux pays. Alors que le génocide a aujourd'hui toujours des conséquences sur le Rwanda moderne, la Belgique a, elle, a vécu une transformation politique menant à la formation d'un état fédéral. Le passé colonial se mire dans le passé national. Les transformations du Rwanda et de la Belgique mettent en question toute tentative collective de faire l'expérience du deuil d'un passé commun, vécu de manière très différente par les deux cultures.<br>

Abstract: Over the past two decades, monetary crises have played a key role in spurring increased monetary cooperation. From one, materialist, vantage, such crises appear as exogenous shocks, which matter primarily as they alter the material incentives to cooperation. However, such frameworks obscure the importance of debates over the meaning of crises, monetary understandings, and state interests themselves. I therefore offer a constructivist theory of crises, and trace the post-1980s evolution from New Classical interpretations of crises, which stressed domestic policy errors and obscured interests in cooperation, to subsequent New Keynesian interpretations, which have stressed market instabilities and legitimated greater cooperation.<br>

Abstract: In this introduction to a selection of case studies on the theme "the past in music" I offer a few thoughts on the nature of the past and the role of memory in constructing historical narrative, with reference to the way in which these concepts have been theorized by historians, archaeologists, anthropologists and ethnomusicologists. In reviewing the different ways in which echoes of the past can still be heard in the music of the present, I consider the capacity of music to evoke, embody and transform the past and, by so doing, to act as a medium for history and its interpretation.<br>

Publisher: Taylor & Francis<br>
Issue: i20184534<br>
Date: 6 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Bithell Caroline<br>
Abstract: This paper focuses on the revival and reconstruction of polyphonic settings of the Latin Mass in selected villages in Corsica. Many such mass settings, often unique to a single village and preserved only in oral tradition, fell into disuse during the first half of the 20th century for a variety of reasons that are briefly explored. In some cases, however, fragments remained in the memories of surviving singers or on old recordings and these were to provide the seeds for the repertoire's later renaissance. My account of the processes of retrieval, reconstruction and re-absorption of the musical material itself is balanced by an examination of the different motives and ideologies of the various parties involved, together with an exploration of the broader theoretical implications of the enterprise of reclaiming the musical patrimony and, in particular, what it reveals about attitudes towards the past, authenticity, ownership and local identity. In the course of my analysis I draw on a series of metaphors and paradigms from the fields of archaeology and heritage conservation. Ultimately, I argue that the renewed practice of singing the mass in the "old way" should be viewed as an authentic part of the Corsican present.<br>

Publisher: M. E. Sharpe<br>
Issue: i20628279<br>
Date: 4 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Curry Jane L.<br>
Abstract: In this article, the author uses the concept of "transitional justice"—defined as the way societies or groups elect to deal with the past as they establish a new system—to examine the manner in which political behavior in postauthoritarian states both manifests and modifies aggressor—victim memory. Comparing the cases of transition from authoritarianism to democracy in South Africa, El Salvador, and Poland, she contrasts the positive outcomes of the open confrontation with "silent memory" in South Africa with the failure of Poland and El Salvador, in different ways, to deal conclusively and consistently with the past. In the case of Poland, the initial silence turned the past into a political football that soured the citizenry on political participation. In the case of El Salvador, the author posits that "boomerang justice" stimulated by outside interests has split the population and alienated both sides from effective political action. The article thereby advances an interpretation of political behavior as a locus for collective memory in nation-states, with the conclusion for postauthoritarian states that transitional justice can free political behavior from the trappings of the past, but only if aggressors and victims confront one another and move toward reconciliation.<br>

Author(s): Capps Donald<br>
Abstract: This article focuses on the personal experience of regret and the importance of coming to terms with our regrets. It begins with a sermon preached by the first author in which the issue of regret is explored by means of a summary of the film The Big Kahuna, continues with a discussion of recent articles (Tomer and Eliason, Existential and spiritual issues in death attitudes, 2008; Mannarino et al., Existential and spiritual issues in death attitudes, 2008) on the concept of regret formulated by Landman (Landman, Regret: A theoretical and conceptual analysis, 1987; Regret: The persistence of the possible, 1993), and on regret therapy, and concludes with a pastoral care case in which a dying woman expresses both future-related and past-related regrets. The case is interpreted in light of regret therapy's emphasis on parabolic experiences and reframing techniques.<br>

Abstract: En este artículo se estudian las memorias sobre 1968 en el espacio público mexicano en los últimos cuarenta años. Si desde 1969 se puede ubicar una memoria de denuncia de la represión asociada al 2 de octubre, es sólo a mediados de los años ochenta que puede localizarse una memoria de elogio del movimiento estudiantil en su conjunto que considera que buscó abrir cauces hacia la democratización del país. El artículo analiza en qué presente se narra, se recuerda, y cuál es el pasado recuperado; para ello las memorias públicas son historizadas desde los distintos presentes políticos desde los cuales son enunciadas. This article studies the memories in the Mexican public space over the past forty years. Although it of 1968 is possible to find a memory of the denunciation of repression associated with October 2 since 1969, it is only from the mid-1980s that we can locate a memory of praise of the student movement as a whole, since it is considered to have paved the way for democratization of the country. The article analyzes what present narratives are enunciated and events recalled, and what kind of past is recovered. Whit this purpose public memories are historicized from the various political presents from which they are expressed.<br>

Abstract: Unquestionable as history may seem, there are all the same quite different readings and disparate inferences despite the same series of facts. This goes to show that even professional historians can sometimes be overcome by meditations on past possibilities of bifurcations. As to "alternatives to actual history," is serves well to bear in mind that few are plausible, but that belief in a predeterminative universe of necessities would certainly be misplaced. Whereas some occurrences are clear-cut enough to make us understand which components would have had to be changed in order to get a different outcome, others are of such a high degree of complexity that attempts to imagine an alternative course and divergent results remain rather illusory: the examples of Midway (the former type) and the defeat of France in 1940 (intricately overdetermined) clearly show that it pays in any case, in defiance to all complexities, to consider past potential. It is prerequisite for choosing between future options in more reasonable and efficient ways than hitherto.<br>

Article Title: The Making of a Social Theory: Anthony Giddens' Theory of Structuration<br>
Publisher: North Central Sociological Association<br>
Issue: i20831390<br>
Date: 4 1, 1986<br>
Author(s): Dickie-Clark Hamish F.<br>
Abstract: In this paper I try to show what kind of theory Giddens' theory of structuration is. I do so by first listing what Giddens accepts and what he rejects in his assessments of functionalism, hermeneutics, structuralism, and the writings of Marx. For what I think are good reasons, most of this part is given over to the use Giddens makes of Gadamer's hermeneutic philosophy. Next I set out my understanding of Giddens' view of theory as primarily concerned "with reworking conceptions of human being and human doing, social reproduction and social transformation" (Giddens 1984:xx). I seek to show the crucial implications of this for the way that theory enters directly into and helps to consitute social life. Taken together, these two steps lead to the conclusion that Giddens' theory is neither an attempt at an over-arching "Grand Theory," nor an imposition of new orthodoxy in place of the old. Instead I suggest that his avowed eclecticism is closely akin to the hermeneutic goal contained in Gadamer's concept of the "fusion of horizons." This notion recognizes the never-to-be-completed, but basic, human activity of creatively questioning what has been handed down from the past. It is questioned so that it may be applied — incomplete as it is — to the changed situation of the present with its different interests and problems. That those who can and do question it are themselves the products of past tradition, calls for a kind of social theory that is in some ways different from that modeled on the explanatory "laws" of natural science. I contend that Giddens' theory of structuration is such a theory. (For an introductory overview of the theory itself, see Dickie-Clark, 1984).<br>

Abstract: Jusqu'à Totalité et Infini compris, la temporalité aura été essentiellement pensée par Lévinas, au seuil de l'événement qu'est l'Autre, comme ouverture d'un avenir pur, jusqu'à la rémission d'un présent, qui nous relèverait alors de notre passé. À partir de sa méditation toujours plus insistante de la « Trace de l'Autre », Lévinas est toutefois amené à repenser cette ouverture elle-même depuis un passé toujours déjà passé et dont nous aurions à jamais à répondre, échapperait-il à toute expérience dans l'entre-temps de son passage. Du Visage à la Trace — jusqu'au visage comme trace —, l'avenir ne s'ouvrirait à nous que dans la déchirure de notre réponse à ce passé immémorial d'où l'Autre nous appellerait sans cesse, déjà parti avant d'être venu. Arrachés à nous-mêmes, nous voici, dans la « honte de survivre », ordonnés à l'avenir par l'accusation d'un passé qui toujours se dérobe, sans qu'il nous soit jamais possible de nous y dérober. À partir de sa pensée de la trace de l'Autre et de sa mortalité, Lévinas inscrit sa propre méditation du temps et de l'histoire dans la trace de l'immémorial — impossible mémoire, à la mémoire de l'impossible, dont la signifiance éthique ne saurait se réduire à un improbable « devoir de mémoire ». « Une voix vient de l'autre rive. Une voix interrompt le dire du déjà dit », qui nous voue, à présent, à ce qui ne cesse de venir, selon une vocation, une dévotion, qui est le temps lui-même. Up to and including Totality and Infinity, temporality has been thought by Levinas, on the threshold of this incident which is the Other, as the opening of a pure future, up to the remission of the present, which would then recover us from our past. Nevertheless, from his more and more insistent meditation upon the « Trace of the Other », Levinas has been led to re-examine that opening itself from a past for ever past and for which we would be answerable, were it to escape our experience in the interval of its crossing. From the Face to the Trace — up to~<br>

Abstract: Across cultures, narrative emerges early in communicative development and is a fundamental means of making sense of experience. Narrative and self are inseparable in that narrative is simultaneously born out of experience and gives shape to experience. Narrative activity provides tellers with an opportunity to impose order on otherwise disconnected events, and to create continuity between past, present, and imagined worlds. Narrative also interfaces self and society, constituting a crucial resource for socializing emotions, attitudes, and identities, developing interpersonal relationships, and constituting membership in a community. Through various genres and modes; through discourse, grammar, lexicon, and prosody; and through the dynamics of collaborative authorship, narratives bring multiple, partial selves to life.<br>

Abstract: What role do emotions play in the way in which young people confront the history of the Holocaust? This article examines memorial sites and video interviews of survivors as interfaces of the representation and appropriation of the past. These contact zones satisfy the need for emotional participation and for information. Videos uploaded by youngsters on the internet following their visit to memorial sites, and short films extracted by pupils from survivor's video interviews, were used as examples in order to examine emotional strategies. These products of involvement point to stored images and ideas mediated by mass media. This repertoire of cultural knowledge and feelings can serve as a template for understanding how young people process the Holocaust emotionally.<br>

Abstract: How does a generation without personal memory begin to grapple with its urban past in a nation that has silenced its memories? Moreover, how are symbolic sites of memory recovered and represented by such a generation? Much recent scholarship on post-war Lebanon has studied the memory culture of the decades following the declared end of civil war in 1990. This scholarship deals with the implications of Lebanon's 'amnesiac' political culture on the social and political landscape. In the meantime, Lebanon—and especially Beirut's—urban landscape has been altered beyond recognition by post-war reconstruction, mostly by private real estate holding companies, the most notorious of which is Solidere. In the early 2000s, as Solidere's activity picked up speed, a slew of historical novels about Lebanon and especially Beirut was published in both Arabic and French. In this article, I will focus exclusively on the strategies of urban commemoration in Rabīʿ Jābir's trilogy. I argue that the genre of historical fiction is used in these novels to re-create the downtown life of Beirut in and around Martyrs' Square from the 19th and early 20th century, a commemoration of a cityscape and an urban lifestyle that its author recreates using the tools of the archive (documents, bibliographies, etc.). This post-memorial fiction—here, I use Marianne Hirsch's definition of postmemory as "second-generation memories of cultural and collective traumas and experience" (22)—attempts to recover Beirut's repressed Ottoman urban history, and to re-write Solidere's narrative of the city center. By intertwining downtown Beirut's past with its present, in a clever back-and-forth palimpsestic act that superimposes the historical city upon the present city—site of capitalist consumption—Jābir's novels map out the old upon the new, and thus refuses the erasure of the ancient city by its newest urbanists. In Jābir's novels, a new, contestatory commemorative narrative of Beirut's history and—more significa~<br>

Abstract: This study builds on the premise that local knowledge of limestone—and its workable characteristics—was foundational to landscape inhabitation in the Puuc region of Yucatán, México. Classic Maya architecture of the northern Yucatán generally is considered to represent the apogee of Maya construction prowess with extensive use of core-veneer masonry and the creation of tall, wide corbelled vaults. Less commonly discussed is the variable distribution of high-quality limestone across the Yucatán, the social matrix that undergirds the quarrying, transporting, and working of limestone, and the pronounced social differences materialized in stone architecture. This study explores these three topics by bringing to bear Yucatec Mayan linguistic evidence and excavation data from the archaeological site of Sayil, in the hilly Puuc region of Yucatán. That information provides a basis for understanding the development of a sprawling residential complex, the role that variable limestone quality played in its expansion, and serves as an index of intra-compound social difference. Late additions to the dwellings indicate that recognition of the cultural value of carved stone persisted long after masonry skills became attenuated. The durability of stone renders it a particularly effective—if underutilized—medium for interpreting social landscapes of the past. Este estudio amplifica la premisa de que el conocimiento de la piedra caliza—y sus propiedades arteseanales—fue una base fundamental para la ocupación del paisaje de la Región Puuc, Yucatán, México. En general, la arquitectura de los mayas de la época Clásica del norte de Yucatán se considera representativa del apogeo de su proeza arquitectónica con el uso extensivo de núcleos de piedra burda recubiertos de piedra labrada y la creación de habitaciones con bóvedas altas y anchas. Menos mencionados son la distribución geográfica variable de piedra caliza de alta calidad a través de Yucatán, la matriz social que permite la explotac~<br>

Abstract: This essay analyzes the contemporary culture of memory in Buenos Aires. The development of this culture since the democratic transition — and since Nestor Kirchner's turn in government in particular — is investigated. Data come from field-work research during the period of Cristina Kirchner's election victory in 2007. The official explanation of the duty to remember in order to re-establish the nation's democratic basis is shown through an analysis of Buenos Aires's urban landscape, and the building of such places of memory as the Museum of Memory and the Park of Memory, coinciding respectively with Nestor Kirchner's first election, and with Cristina Kirchner's election. The analysis of contemporary collective sensibility about the past dictatorship introduces an interview with a Madre de Plaza de Mayo, suggesting the task of watching over memory, and of coping with its current multiple interpretations.<br>

Abstract: Controlling for insecurities depends on a capacity to make inferences on the basis of experiences about the past, yet the use of knowledge about the past for anticipating and predicting future threats is highly problematic. This article examines the problem of governing individuals on the basis of what is available about their past deeds and social networks in governmental and commercial archives. It highlights the tension between administrative and private narratives about individuals, the former being constructed on the basis of minute details collected and stored about individuals since birth, and the latter referring to the accounts individuals offer of themselves. By applying the notions of ipse and idem identity developed by Paul Ricoeur, the article examines the two-way flow between memory and identity and the consequent concern that administrative narratives are blind to the ethical renewal of individuals, to the capacity of Man to extricate himself from the shackles of his past. To prepare the ground, the article considers some inherent limitations of biopolitics, pointing out that although biopolitics was classically concerned to govern both individual bodies and the body politic, administrative and governmental limitations have led states to govern the "average citizen" rather than individuals in their "individuality."<br>

Abstract: This commentary reflects on the first official visit made by a British monarch to Ireland since its independence. Focusing on three key moments of Queen Elizabeth's itinerary — the Garden of Remembrance, the Irish National War Memorial, Islandbridge, and the state banquet, Dublin Castle — I suggest that efforts to simultaneously honour rebels/soldiers in acts of public remembrance sought to re-position the past between these two islands in ways which recognised conflict but also aspired towards reconciled understandings of how that past could be more peacefully calibrated.<br>

Abstract: The present paper is an analysis of the functioning of memory, selective memory and oblivion (or to put it differently—the game of remembering, partial remembering and forgetting) in Poland during the period of democratic transformation which, after long years of dictatorship and the hibernation of public discourse, ensures freedom of speech and encourages expression of different beliefs as well as articulation of divergent interests. It defines two distinct layers of memory and oblivion and, consequently, two main types of hidden or repressed elements which may be dubbed "skeletons in the nation's history closet." One is linked with the pre-communist past (before 1945), while the other is connected with the communist past (1945-1989). The latter is linked to political differences—within the same ethnic group—which presently constitute a very hot issue but are less likely to be inherited over more than two generations. The former comprises mostly nationwide skeletons, related mainly to contacts between the Polish and other ethnic groups and involving the sense of collective identity, collective pride, collective guilt, and collectively suffered injustice. On the one hand, these skeletons are currently still more willingly kept in the closet because they can be detrimental to the perception and self-perception of the national group as a whole, but on the other hand the memory of these ethnic and religious conflicts is more likely to be inherited and internalized by future generations for much longer. The question of how to facilitate the process of removing the nationwide skeletons from the national memory closet seems, therefore, all the more important.<br>

Abstract: Remonstrances (jian ﻿諫) reveal a great deal about the writing of history in China during the Eastern Zhou. As represented in the Zuozhuan and Guoyu, remonstrances, like other speeches, are normally delivered in court and address questions of official policy. They tend to test contemporary phenomena against the lessons of the past, especially as those lessons have been formulated in the Shijing, the Shangshu, aphorisms, and other forms of what I term "inherited speech." Remonstrances also have the support of the third-person historical narrative which surrounds them; the ruler who ignores a remonstrance always suffers for his obstinacy. After briefly discussing the importance of speeches in the Zuozhuan and Guoyu, I outline the structure of a remonstrance and examine four passages in which critical speech, including remonstrance, is said to have circulated freely in the courts of an idealized early period. Next I show how remonstrances match observed historical particulars with fragments of inherited speech. The famous remonstrance of Gong zhi Qi, an exemplary episode, shows how this application of inherited speech guides rhetorical choices and establishes Traditionalist or Confucian terms as the keys to historical intelligibility. Finally, I examine a set of remonstrances which are exceptional in that they do not include overt citations of inherited speech. Among these, military remonstrances can genuinely eschew explicit citation of lessons of the past, while others borrow the authority of inherited speech without seeming to do so. In one case, a brief remonstrance has apparently acquired the status of an aphorism, so that already when it is first uttered it qualifies as a sort of inherited speech. In another case, a precursor of the indirect remonstrances (fengjian ﻿諷諫) of later periods, remonstrators use a theatrical combination of actions and speech to criticize their superior's departure from correct ways. As texts in which the speakers (and behind them the aut~<br>

Abstract: By incorporating the battle of Waterloo into the events of their novels, Hugo and Stendhal create a portrait of its principal protagonist, Napoléon ler. Associated in one case with a spatial prison out of time and in the other case with a temporal exile out of space, the image of the emperor is that of a figure of power deprived of time and, consequently, of its legitimacy. Stendhal imprisons his character in the present to deny the reality of Napoleon's defeat. Hugo, on the other hand, exiles his character from the present to link the past to the future and propose a new model of heroism.<br>

Signaling multiple times, easily accomplished in historiographic narratives, posed a challenge to historical painters. Delaroche utilized innovative approaches to representing time in his works, which were praised by contemporary historians and art critics as visual parallels to modern historical literature. In this essay I argue that Delaroche's repeated visual quotation of works from the Bowyer Historic Gallery enabled him to represent a doubled moment in his historical paintings. I examine his approach to temporality in Jane Grey (1834), Assassination of the duc de Guise (1834), a suite of watercolors (c.1825) on an episode in Rousseau's Confessions (1782), and Cromwell (1831). The latter was one of several works by Delaroche inspired by Chateaubriand's Les Quatre Stuarts (1828), an insistently multi-temporal text which compared Stuarts and Bourbons, written to ensure the stability of the newly restored Bourbon dynasty.<br>

Abstract: I had the honor of interviewing Clifford Geertz at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, USA, on October 18, 2000. The interview focused on Geertz's theoretical conceptions, the tradition on which he draws, the critique he has encountered, and on interpretive anthropology's future development. Of particular interest was the clarification of his much-debated method, his definition of symbol and his famous definition of religion as a cultural system. Geertz emphasizes his attempt to exercise an applied pragmatic phenomenological and hermeneutical method without any general theory (or philosophy) of meaning, phenomenology, or culture. He maintains that he only has a conceptual framework inspired by different scholars, which nevertheless has consistent focus and perspective, i.e., meaning and symbol. In relationship to this, Geertz defines his symbol within the Peircean semiotic tradition. Therefore, the term symbol is understood as a sign (an index for example), which becomes a symbol via a cultural interpretation. Furthermore, his definition of religion as a cultural system is, in his view, a non-essentialistic definition and therefore is not—as Talal Asad claims—ethnocentric. Although it is Geertz's opinion that interpretive anthropology has been influenced by postmodernism, he predicts that interpretive anthropology's future development will be in reasonable continuity with its past. In my closing comments I tentatively suggest that Geertz may have a theory of interpretation because of his definition of the symbol, his unavoidable assumptions, and his unique method, which has the capacity of grasping the cultural specific in a general way.<br>

Abstract: What is the direction of South African theological ethics as that country moves out of the apartheid era into a new democratic future? Following its struggle against apartheid, how will theology respond to the new challenge of making clear its distinctive stance in a democratic, multi-faith society with a secular constitution? A danger, similar to that previously discussed in the United States, exists in South Africa as theology evolves from a mode of resistance to that of compliance and accommodation, especially under the guise of "nation-building." The essay plots a trajectory by means of a consideration of four works representing nonracial liberationist theology which emerged at key points in the past fifteen years—the Kairos Document (1985), and works by Albert Nolan (1988), Charles Villla-Vicencio (1992), and James Cochrane (1999). For all their contextual sensitivity and strength, these works appear to offer little of a distinctively theological nature, and little of Christian substance to church and society. The way lies open for the development of an African Christian ethics.<br>

Abstract: Il est souvent refusé à la philosophie de tenir un discours d'affirmation de Dieu. Face à des objections d'hier et d'aujourd'hui aussi diverses que contradictoires, on veut montrer ici la légitimité d'un tel discours. Celui-ci suppose une double rupture: rupture avec une conception minimal ou formaliste de la raison qui refuse de se prononcer sur le principe de la vie; rupture avec une métaphysique intemporelle qui manque le nécessaire enracinement anthropologique de la question de Dieu. Philosophy is often denied discourse regarding the affirmation of God. Confronting the diverse and contradictory objections of the past and today, an attempt is made to show the legitimacy of such discourse. It supposes a double rupture: with the minimal or formalist conception of reason that refuses to pronounce on the principle of life; and with an untemporal metaphysic that lacks the necessary anthropological roots in the question of God.<br>

Abstract: Recent desistance research has emphasized the importance of shifts in offenders' identities to explain cessation from crime. Explanatory weight is given to how the agent reflects and acts upon relevant social circumstances rather than seeing desistance as the product of greater control exerted by the obligations of new roles. This kind of self-reflexivity is achieved through an internal moral conversation that is often couched in terms of agents' ultimate concerns and their relationship with others. In so doing, desisters fashion a narrative identity, which acknowledges yet disclaims past actions and commits them to an ideal future self.<br>

Abstract: What does it means to legacy in politics? That's the main question of this contribution. The author, in a first part, proposes a definition of the concept of legacy in political parties in general. In a second time, he analyzes the policies of legacy in the Italian and French Communist parties. These CP have a different relation with their past because they choose different strategies: strategy of breakdown with Communist experience in Italy and, on the opposite, strategy of continuity for the French Communist party.<br>

Abstract: The antipositivist movement of the past two decades or so in economics, economic history, and history reveals the scope for a rapprochement, a growth of mutual respect and understanding, and perhaps even more active collaboration between the practitioners of these disciplines. The emergence of a more open-minded and flexible approach to economic methodology, and a more sophisticated awareness of the nature of historical explanation underlie this process. And the economists' increasing preoccupation with problems of time, expectations, uncertainty, and limited information provides substantive incentives for the widespread and varied efforts to break out of the confines of conventional static equilibrium theorizing.<br>

Abstract: Dans les sociétés occidentales, la temporalité religieuse a imposé au temps social un modèle linéaire, largement tributaire des traditions eschatologiques judéo-chrétiennes, produit d'une lente élaboration forgée à partir d'influences diverses, dont celle du zoroastrisme. Cette perception d'un temps univoque est construite sur un paradoxe en liant cette progression continue à une mise en acte du processus eschatologique au moyen de rites inscrits dans la périodisation cyclique du calendrier. Cette actualisation par le rite des mythes qui le sous-tendent impose ainsi au présent, au passé et au futur de se rejoindre périodiquement au gré de la célébration de fêtes calendaires. In western societies, Judeo-Christianity imposed on time a linear model, born from eschatological traditions formed through diverse influences, including zoroastrianism. This perception of time as univocal is built upon a paradoxical view binding this continual progress to an enactment of the eschatological process through rituals inscribed in the cyclical periodization of the calendar. This actualization through rites of myths subtending them impose to the present, past and future to join periodically according to calendar celebrations. La temporalidad religiosa ha impuesto al tiempo de las sociedades occidentales un modelo lineal, ampliamente tributario de las tradiciones escatológicas judeo-cristianas, producto de una lenta elaboración forjada a partir de influencias diversas, entre ellas la del zoroastrismo. Esta percepción de un tiempo unívoco se construye sobre una paradoja que liga esta progresión continua a una puesta en acto del proceso escatológico por medio de ritos inscriptos en la periodización cíclica del calendario. Esta actualización por el rito de los mitos que subyacen a él impone así al presente, al pasado y al futuro una reunión periódica al ritmo de la celebración de las fiestas del calendario.<br>

Abstract: This article interprets John Sayles' 1996 film Lone Star as a reflection on how a community whose history is steeped in violence, such as the US, should seek to manage its difficult cultural memory. A conceptual triad of love, justice, and tragedy utilised to interpret the film's last line, 'Forget the Alamo.' It is concluded that the memory of a troubled past can only serve as the basis for responsible public life when we, like the characters in Lone Star, choose to remember with a charity that liberates both our ancestors and our selves from having to play out the roles of hero or villain.<br>

Abstract: Der Politischen Theologie kann man sich auf drei Arten nähern, wobei sich diese hermeneutischen Zugänge nach ihrem jeweiligen Verhältnis von Politikwissenschaft und Theologie unterscheiden lassen: ein erster Zugang betont die substantielle Beziehung zwischen den beiden Disziplinen und ihrem jeweiligen Gehalt; ein zweiter Zugang unterstreicht die begriffsgeschichtliche Abkunft der Politikwissenschaft von der Theologie; und ein dritter Zugang legt Wert auf das rhetorische Moment innerhalb der Politischen Theologie. Während die ersten beiden Ansätze in der Vergangenheit in großem Maße Aufmerksamkeit auf sich gezogen haben, wurde das rhetorische Moment nur selten Gegenstand eingehender Untersuchungen. Der vorliegende Aufsatz betont dagegen die rhetorische Dimension der Politischen Theologie und verweist auf deren häufige Versuche, mittels metaphorischer Bezüge auf »Theologie« im politischen und wissenschaftlichen Streit zu obsiegen. There are three hermeneutical approaches to Political Theology, each of which points towards a distinct relationship between Political Science and Theology: the first approach stresses the substantial links between the two disciplines and their respective contents; the second approach emphasises the dimension of conceptual history, claiming that concepts of Political Science have their roots within Theology; the third approach points towards the rhetorical moment within Political Theology. While the first two approaches have been the object of considerable research in the past, the third has been rather neglected. This article highlights the rhetorical dimension of Political Theology. It points to numerous attempts in which »Theology« has been used metaphorically in order to bolster arguments within political and scholarly debates.<br>

Abstract: Le terme de Monarchomaque renvoie à cinq critères: le rejet de la tyrannie, la double alliance, la souveraineté du peuple, l'obéissance conditionnelle, enfin le droit de résistance armée. A partir de là, il est possible d'établir un corpus monarchomaque composé de dix textes. Ce corpus permet de conduire une étude des liens entre théorie politique et représentation du temps. Celle-ci porte à la fois sur les origines de la monarchie et sur les traces du passé dans le présent (Etats). The monarchomach theory is based on five criteria: the rejection of tyranny, the mutual alliance, the sovereignty of the people, limited obedience, and finally the right to armed resistance. Such a definition leads to the establishment of a corpus of ten monarchomach treatises. This corpus allows us to study the links between political theory and the representation of time. This latter subject involves both the origins of the monarchy and the traces of the past in the present (the Estates). Der Begriff von «Monarchomaque» verweist auf fünf Kriterien: die Ablehnung der Tyrannei, die verdoppelte Allianz, die Souveränität des Volkes, der bedingte Gehorsam, schließlich das Recht bewaffneten Widerstandes. Von daher ist es möglich, ein aus zehn Texten zusammengesetztes «monarchomaque» Corpus aufzustellen. Dieser Bestand erlaubt, eine Studie der Verbindungen zwischen politischer Theorie und Darstellung der Zeit zu führen. Sie bezieht sich sowohl auf die Ursprünge der Monarchie als auch auf die Spuren der Vergangenheit in der Gegenwart (Staaten).<br>

Abstract: Before any significant attempt is made to read Negro-African history, the first task is to conquer its field of research. The critical works of Frobenius, Westermann and Bauman, Delafosse, Homburger, Murdock, Leakey and Cheikh Anta Diop provide us with appropriate means of investigation (which still require to be refined) in order to obtain a profound, inner knowledge of the Negro-African social tradition. Prehistory must become a major science in the teaching profession — especially in Africa — because it offers man a general outline of the first consequences of his past before the appearance of writing. No Africanist or African historian can allow himself to by-pass this branch of study. The same applies to Egyptology and to African linguistics, sociology and ethnology. Diop has used the last three sciences to retrace the migrations of African peoples, to establish their cultural unity and to rediscover the continuity of Negro-African history. The study of African, Greco-Roman, Arab and European documents (whether oral or written, archaeological, linguistic or sociological) gives us information concerning the appearance of homo faber in Africa about 5,500,000 years ago, the Egypto-Nubian civilizations, the African Neolithic worlds, pre-colonial Africa, the Arab invasions, the slave-trade, colonization and the present-day national liberation struggles and the formation of new States. The African cultural world has its roots in the Tertiary Period and it is beyond doubt that the biological substratum of humanity is Negro or Negroïd (C.A. Diop and the discovery of Asselar Man by the Augiéras-Draper Saharan expedition in December 1927), that Negroes were in Europe during the Upper Paleolithic and Neolithic periods and helped in the formation of today's Europoïd races. The author uses the social structures of the Pharaonic Ancient Empire (2778 - 2423 B. C.) as models to describe the history of Negro-African societies in their ensemble and contrasts the former with thos~<br>

Author(s): Serra Alice Mara<br>
Abstract: The concept Deckerinnerung (en. screen-memory), which appeared in Freud's work in 1899, points towards the important epistemological question about the possibility of adequation or coincidence (Deckung) between past experience and the current act that is being presentified. This can take the form of remembering as such or be conceived as fantasy. In order to clarify the differences between fantasy and memory, or rather their interconnection in the Deckerinnerung, they need to be looked at phenomenologically, and in doing so various aspects should be analysed, such as: the character of positional and neutralised acts of presentification; the interference of conscious attention and the phenomenon of inhibition in the act of presentification; the state of memories in the unconscious and the possibilities of their association between themselves or modification by other current acts. While Freud introduces the subject without further analysing it, Husserl's theories offer a valuable contribution here. In this context, there is first a need to outline the way in which Husserl's investigations into memory come close to Freud's discourse, in the sense that they lead to a "Phenomenology of the Unconscious" (Hua XI; Mat. VIII).<br>

Author(s): Ruderer Stephan<br>
Abstract: El artículo analiza la historia del Patio 29 en el marco de las políticas del pasado en Chile. El Patio 29 es un lugar del Cementerio General de Chile donde se enterraron más de cien víctimas de la dictadura. Durante la transición a la democracia en los años noventa, estas víctimas fueron exhumadas, identificadas y sus restos entregados a sus familiares. En el año 2006 salió a la luz que las identificaciones se habían hecho de manera errónea, por lo que, para los familiares, las víctimas de la dictadura "desaparecieron" por segunda vez. El artículo retrata las interdependencias entre las políticas del pasado en Chile y la historia trágica del Patio 29 con la finalidad de determinar las dificultades que existen en el establecimiento de una memoria sobre el pasado. Usando el concepto de "memoria emblemática" de Steve Stern, se muestra que en el caso del Patio 29 se llegó a una "eternización" del trauma y de la desconfianza de los familiares de las víctimas. De esta manera, a cuarenta años del golpe, no sólo siguen existiendo distintas versiones sobre el pasado, sino también memorias excluidas de las narraciones oficiales sobre la historia. The article analyzes the history of the Patio 29 in the context of the politics of the past in Chile. In the Patio 29, an area in the General Cemetery of Santiago, were buried more than 100 victims of the Pinochet dictatorship. During the transition to democracy, these victims were exhumed, identified and given to their families. In 2006, it came out that almost all identifications were wrong. The families of the victims had to go through the "disappearance" of their loved ones for a second time. The article traces the interdependencies between the politics of the past in Chile and the tragic history of the Patio 29, aiming to determinate the problems that exist in Chile to establish a memory about the past. Referring to Steve Stern's concept of "emblematic memory", the paper shows that, in the case of the Patio 29, there is an "ete~<br>

Abstract: By establishing a parallel between the cycle of Lumière films and the Age of the Enlightenment ("siècle des lumières"), the author identifies the pensive character of the films' images as well as the aesthetic of the visible world they display. She then examines the transformation of a time-image into a memory-image in the Lumière films, arguing that the films are not only offer time-images, that is, residual images of the past, but have become images-as-memory in the contemporary spectator's mind.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i24439058<br>
Date: 7 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): KEARNEY RICHARD<br>
Abstract: This article explores the crisis of narrative in contemporary culture. It begins by examining the challenge represented by the mass media for the continuing art of storytelling. Taking up Walter Benjamin's warning that we are moving from an age of narrative experience to an age of instant information, it analyses the implications of the post-modern 'cult of simulation' for education, historiography and ethics. The paper concludes by advocating a critical hermeneutic approach as the most apt response to this contemporary dilemma. Only by means of such hermeneutic retrieval, inspired by the work of Ricoeur and Gadamer, can we avoid the current reduction of temporal experience to a 'depthless present' without past or future, thereby reaffirming the crucial narrative dimensions of historical memory and hope.<br>

Issue: i24465904<br>
Date: 6 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Kilroy-Marac Katie<br>
Abstract: This article considers two revenants – a man and a ghost – who haunt the Fann Psychiatric Clinic in Dakar, Senegal. Following Derrida's assertion that haunting is historical, I take seriously the concept of haunting and insist upon its relevance to anthropological inquiry. As a mode of storytelling that comes from a particular way of apprehending the world, I argue that anthropology might give credence to specters as social figures and assign ethnography the task of chasing after ghosts, not simply for the poetic spaces they may open up but out of a concern for justice and responsibility in the past, present, and future. My own ethnographic encounter with the two revenants described here has generated questions about the often taken-for-granted equivalence of the real and the true. Likewise, it has encouraged me to interrogate the unpredictable (and oftentimes uneasy) cohabitation of memory and history, both within the Fann Clinic and beyond.<br>

Abstract: Les monuments voués à la guerre abondent en Russie, comme dans de nombreux autres pays. Ils font partie du paysage, tout en le caractérisant. Ces monuments font appel au passé et aux souvenirs. Ce faisant, ils définissent l'appartenance. Et tout en remémorant le passé, ils cherchent également à déterminer l'avenir. Le fait de se souvenir d'une guerre est un acte politique en soi. On se souvient, et en se souvenant on se définit au sein de sa communauté, de son pays et du monde. À tout le moins, c'est le cas dans l'Europe de l'Est et la Russie. Le territoire a été envahi maintes fois au cours des derniers siècles et cela a entrainé le développement d'une mémoire sélective, une « curation » de la nation. Nous étudions ici les souvenirs de la Russie afin de démontrer comment les monuments et les musées de guerre définissent non seulement le passé, mais également le présent et les rêves que l'on forge pour l'avenir. War monuments are abundant in Russia; they are part of the landscape, while defining the terrain. Calling to the past and bringing forth memories, they define belonging, commemorating the past while shaping the future. Remembering a war is a political act and, in remembering, we define our place in our community, country and the world. Such is the case in Eastern Europe and Russia whose territories have been invaded many times over the centuries, which has led to development of a selective memory, the "curation" of the nation. This article explores memories of Russia to demonstrate how monuments and museums of war define the past, present and dreams for the future.<br>

Abstract: Since their arrival in France in the early 1960s, former settlers of Algeria have developed an array of private and public "sites of memory" projects that have remained unnoticed in wider French society or have been interpreted uncharitably. This article offers a new perspective on these projects. Informed by Maurice Halbwachs' concern with the material supports for collective memory and Sigmund Freud's insights on loss, I reinterpret them as stages in a work of mourning, and offer new insights on the wider question of France's relationship to its colonial past.<br>

Publisher: Wiley Periodicals, Inc.<br>
Issue: i24542986<br>
Date: 10 1, 2013<br>
Author(s): Grethlein Jonas<br>
Abstract: This book examines Greek engagements with the past as articulations of memory formulated against the contingency of chance associated with temporality. Based on a phenomenological understanding of temporality, it identifies four memorializing strategies: continuity (tradition), regularity (exemplarity), development, and acceptance of chance. This framework serves in pursuing a twofold aim: to reconstruct the literary field of memory in fifth-century BCE Greece; and to interpret Greek historiography as a memorializing mode. The key contention advanced by this approach is that acts of memory entailed an "idea of history" that was articulated not only in historiography, but also in epinician poetry, elegy, tragedy, and oratory. The book offers a rich account of poetic conventions and contexts through which each of these genres counterbalanced contingency through the use of exemplary and traditional modes of memory. This fine analysis highlights the grip of the present on the past as a significant feature of both historiographical and nonhistoriographical genres. The essay argues that this work fills a disciplinary gap by extending the reflection on memory to a new period, Greek antiquity. The retrospective positioning of this period at the outset of Western historical thought brings Grethlein's investigation to the center of debates about memory, temporality, and the meaning history. In engaging with the book's argument, the essay suggests that historiographical memory emerged in Greece not as a first-order encounter with time, but as a second-order encounter with forgetting. This confrontation marked a certain separation of historiography from other memorializing genres. Whereas poetic and rhetorical memories were posited against contingency, historiography sought to retrieve those aspects of the past that may otherwise have been irretrievably lost and forgotten. In doing so, it formulated the historiographical imperative as a negation of forgetting that problematized~<br>

Abstract: Cette étude se propose d'analyser certains aspects du soubassement historiographique de la pensée politique de François Guizot. S'il est certain que sa politique scolaire est largement fondée sur une vision progressiste de l'histoire, on n'a peutêtre pas assez souligné la part qui revient à la rhétorique dans l'élaboration de cette pensée du progrès. Ainsi, l'exposé de 1828 peut-il non seulement se lire comme un cours d'histoire, mais également s'entendre comme une injonction politique à effet immédiat. Le sens de cet article est de repérer les voies par lesquelles l'évocation du passé peut ainsi se conjuguer au présent. This paper intends to study some aspects of the historiographic fundaments of François Guizot's political thought. Surely enough, Guizot's educational policy was based on a progressist view of history but one has tended to overlook the part played by rhetorics in the elaboration of this view of progress. The 1828 account may be read as a lecture on history but may also be understood as a political injunction compelling immediate effects. The aim of this paper is to discover the ways through which the evocation of the past can thus be conjugated in the present tense.<br>

Abstract: Au Bénin, depuis les débuts des années 1990, le processus institutionnel de connexion mémorielle entre le passé de l'esclavage et les pratiques cultuelles vodun a été scandé par le Festival Ouidah 92 et le lancement, sous l'égide de l'Unesco, de l'itinéraire intercontinental de la Route de l'Esclave. Les notions de l'oubli et du retour mises en exergue sur la Route par les deux Arbres éponymes montrent comment cet itinéraire, à la fois monumental et rituel, devrait permettre aujourd'hui à une histoire tragique de se « racheter » sous forme de discours mythique. Dans les diverses versions de ce mythe, où un lien mémoriel partagé entre oubli et retour est raconté et donné à voir, les récits locaux de l'esclavage font surface en se métamorphosant dans l'actualité patrimoniale et politique de la situation. De tels récits n'adhèrent pas pourtant aux diverses rhétoriques internationales et nationales, officielles et diasporiques, prônant, en quelque sorte, une pacification et une démocratisation de l'histoire. Since the early 1990s in Benin, the institutional process of connecting through memorials the past of slavery and the practices of voodoo has been highlighted by the Ouidah 92 Festival and the launching, under the auspices of Unesco, of the intercontinental itinerary of the Slave Route. Two eponymous trees on this road draw attention to the concepts of oblivion and return, thus showing how, thanks to this monumental and ritual itinerary, a tragic history should be able to « redeem » itself in the form of a mythical discourse. In the various versions of this myth, which tells about and visually presents a shared link between forgetting and remembering, local accounts of slavery rise to the surface while being metamorphosed in the patrimonial and political relevance of the situation. Such accounts do not adhere to international or national forms of rhetoric, whether from officials or from the diaspora, that tend to advocate a pacification and democratization of histor~<br>

Abstract: Les liens entre anthropologie et histoire, qui ont été très forts depuis les années 1960, semblent parfois se distendre depuis deux décennies. À partir d'un point de vue localisé, celui d'un historien des derniers siècles du Moyen Âge, cet article cherche à s'interroger sur la réalité actuelle des formes d'échange scientifique entre les deux disciplines. Tout en rappelant l'importance de l'anthropologie historique et des objets de recherche partagés par les historiens et les anthropologues, il cherche à mettre en évidence une autre perspective de travail, en montrant comment les interrogations des anthropologues sur l'historicité, sur la forme et le statut de l'information recueillie durant leur travail de terrain, ou sur leur propre engagement subjectif par rapport à ce terrain, offrent aux historiens, qui sont confrontés à des questionnements parallèles, des ressources nouvelles pour prolonger la fécondité des échanges interdisciplinaires. The links between anthropology and history have been very tight since the 1960s but seem to have loosened during the past two decades. From a very « localized » viewpoint as a historian of the latter part of the Middle Ages, questions are raised about the current reality of forms of scientific exchanges between these two disciplines. While recalling the importance of historical anthropology and of subjects of research shared by historians and anthropologists, another perspective of work is opened by showing how anthropologists' interrogations about historicity, the form and status of the information gathered during fieldwork, or about their own subjective commitments in relation to the field, provide historians, who face parallel interrogations, with new resources for fertilizing multidisciplinary exchanges.<br>

Author(s): GOLDBERG SYLVIE ANNE<br>
Abstract: This article explores the reception of Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi in France in light of the many and diverse reactions his books and lectures engendered at major conferences and meetings. It describes how the American scholar became one of the leading figures among French intellectuals after the first translation of his book Zakhor in 1984 and his first lecture at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in 1987, which resulted in a series of annual lectures over the next ten years. Following the readings of Jacques Derrida, Paul Ricœur, Pierre Vidal-Naquet, and François Furet, among other intellectuals, the eminent standing achieved by Yerushalmi coincided with a special "moment." At a time when doubt was cast on the testimonies of living witnesses and when the words of Holocaust deniers and of members of the French Resistance were treated on equal terms, the politics of memory challenged the status of history and historians. This paper aims to recover the atmosphere of these past decades and to elucidate how Yerushalmi's name has become inseparable from the issues linked with the debates about history and memory.<br>

Abstract: However, J.M. Keynes had something serious in mind when he coined this phrase: 'The
long run is a misleading guide to current affairs. In the long run we are all dead. Economists
set themselves too easy, too useless a task if in tempestuous seasons they can only tell us that
when the storm is past the ocean is flat again.' Harrod (1972, 402) quotes from Λ Tract on
Monetary Reform (1923).<br>

Author(s): Vassilicos Basil<br>
Abstract: In Matter and Memory, Bergson examines the relationship between perception and memory, the status of consciousness in its relation to the brain, and more generally, a possible conjunction of matter and mind. Our reading focuses in particular on his understanding of the evanescent presence of the present and of its debt vis-à-vis the "unconscious" consciousness of a "virtual" past. We wish to show that the Bergsonian version of a critique of "the metaphysics of presence" is, for all that, an offshoot of a Platonic type of metaphysics. It is true that Bergson departs from traditional stand-points on the side of a self-sufficient and original present and a form of presence to which the transparency of consciousness would confer the character of immediate evidence. All the same, it can hardly be claimed that his rehabilitation of the past and the unconscious opens up new perspectives on how forgetting and death are bound up with the work of memory.<br>

Abstract: In her lecture "The Place of Imagination" (1994) Roberts confesses that her return to her figures of
mother and daughter is meant to evoke part of her childhood in France, a time which she recreates as paradise:
"They stand in, these images of lost bliss, as images of something even more specific than childhood: she who
is paradise itself for the baby, the growing child: the mother" ([1994] 1998, 20). For a thorough review of
this topic in Roberts's fiction, see Laura Lojo's recent article on the notion of the maternal body as paradise in
Robert's short story "Charity" (1994). She claims that this perspective is adopted by a narrator who positions
herself as a child, and whose vision is "dependant on language, memory and mythic reconstructions of her own
past" (Lojo 2012, 33).<br>

Abstract: Afrikaans writers have often found themselves in a marginal position. During the time of apartheid, they vehemently criticised racial discrimination, thus dissociating themselves from the centre of power. After the demise of apartheid, Afrikaans writers were marginalised in a different way, when the Afrikaans language lost its previous dominant position and truly became a minority language. They were then forced to reexamine their past and reinterpret their present. In this article, recent Afrikaans writers' radical reinvention of the ideological significance of the Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902) is discussed. One novel about the War, Ingrid Winterbach's Niggie ("Cousin") is analysed in detail as an example of the search for meaning from a marginal position. The novel has a special relevance for Afrikaners in their painful adaptation to a new South Africa, but it is also linked to general themes like trauma, despair and hope.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i342990<br>
Date: 10 1, 1976<br>
Author(s): Nipperdey Lucian<br>
Abstract: This article argues for the establishment of a new, "annalistic" model of history and historical investigation. This implies a new concept of historical event: instead of being seen as an element within a historical narrative, the historical event is defined as the common reference point of many narratives that can be told about it. The annalistic model also implies a new concept of historical change: instead of being defined as the change of an "object" within a set of given historical parameters, historical change has to be perceived as the change of parameters related to a given historical object. A new concept of history follows from the annalistic model: instead of history being a metaphysical unity of space and time (the destiny of mankind, the positivist's world of facts), in which everything is linked to everything, it is instead the product of historical judgment carried out by those who design stories about their own past, present, and future. To the "annalist" a world is imaginable in which no history has existed, exists, or will exist. The article analyzes three aspects of the concept of historical time: it demonstrates the huge variety of temporal structures in history; it argues for the foundation of the representation of historical time in linguistic concepts; and it discusses the relationship of fictionality and reality in historical discourse. Finally, the annalistic model is compared to the traditional concept of history established by historicism in the nineteenth century.<br>

Abstract: K. E. Brashier analyzes the symbolic discourse surrounding a prominent image in many Chinese ancestral stone memorials, namely an ornate tree beside a pavilion where a figure is receiving homage. He traces the arboreal image back to the ancient poem "Birchleaf Pear," which exhorts future generations to safeguard the tree because the Duke of Shao had rested there. He then shows that, in Han literary texts justifying the building of ancestral memorials, the tree stands for long-lived physical things that survive into the present. Symbols can conflate allusions. The central figure within the pavilion is the tomb dedicatee as a Duke of Shao, and the shrine is to be preserved just as the Duke's tree was never to be felled. Past hero and present shrine dedicatee merge into a single icon.<br>

Abstract: Societies, like individuals, strive to have positive self-concepts. They endow stories of their origin and associate their course through history with ethical principles that attest to who they are and how they want to be seen. Such principles define the society for its members and for the world at large. But all societies must at some time confront evidence of actions undertaken in their name that violate their fundamental principles and conflict with their desired self-image. Following a glance at the basic elements of the politics of history and identity, the author suggests two sources of the tensions between "bad acts" and positive self-concepts. Both relate to shifts in developmental time. First, actions not considered wrong when they were undertaken in the past are inconsistent with current expectation. Second, transsocietal differences in normative frameworks lead to cross-boundary criticisms of behavior in which the critics' societies likely engaged at an earlier time. Accusations or criticisms generally meet with defensive, often hostile responses. Hypocrisy tends to rule in most cases, with little or no normative learning.<br>

Abstract: Envisagée dans une perspective discursive et énonciative, l'opération historiographique se révèle être une mise en discours du passé et de son espace. En tant que configuration et représentation, elle se fonde sur différents types de mémoire individuelle et collective qu'elle configure par différents moyens discursifs et rhétoriques. Suffisamment compréhensive, elle contribue à l'institution de régimes et de logiques de spatio-temporalité qui, eux-mêmes marqués dans le temps et dans l'espace, correspondent à des régimes de vérité pratique, ayant une efficacité discursive dans le présent. Éloignées dans l'espace et dans le temps comme c'est le cas pour la Grèce antique ou plus proches de nous, ces opérations d'" historiopoiésis " reposent sur des approches anthropologiques. /// From the discursive perspective of speech acts, the writing of history turns out to be the working out of a discourse about the past and its space. As a configuration and representation, it has grounds in various types of individual and collective memories that it configures using diverse discursive and rhetorical means. Sufficiently comprehensive, it helps institute spatiotemporal systems and "logics" that, with markers of time and space, correspond to systems of practical truth with discursive effectiveness in the present. Whether remote in space and time (as in the case of Ancient Greece) or close to us, these "historiopoiesis" operations rely on anthropological approaches.<br>

Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
Issue: i25167549<br>
Date: 4 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Harb Sirène<br>
Abstract: This article explores how Gayl Jones's "Corregidora" constructs, through the journey of its main protagonist Ursa Corregidora, a viable model for dealing with the painful legacy of slavery, oppression and haunting by the past. The process of self-redefinition in which Ursa engages is based on the reconfiguration of family and sexuality and the hybridization of her relationship to individual as well as collective narratives. After probing Ursa's complex psychological journey, the article examines the main elements mediating the reinscription of her life narrative into a broader context of métissage involving sexual and historical resistance, anchored in the story of Palmares as a Brazilian maroon community (quilombo). Finally, the article analyzes the implications and resonances of this model of revision/reclamation for Gayl Jones and her theorization of the interconnectedness of struggles against oppression in Brazil and the United States.<br>

Abstract: The continuing fallout from the theory wars, evident not least in the nostalgic after-theory narrative that is still in vogue, has dissipated critical energy in contemporary literary studies. Rejecting that narrative, this essay calls for a review of the legacy of theory and the polemical oppositions that set it against other scholarly enterprises, like book history. In particular, it suggests that the theoretical interrogation of the category of literature in the past forty years fruitfully intersects with book history's investigation of the material conditions of literary production, opening up new possibilities for literary historiography, while also imposing new demands on it. The essay identifies two traditions of antiessentialist thought (the skeptical and the enchanted), considers the ontology of the printed literary text, and examines the legacies of, among others, Jacques Derrida and Pierre Bourdieu.<br>

Author(s): Broadbent Philip<br>
Abstract: Contemporary Berlin novels commonly anchor representations of post-unification Berlin within an ethics of remembering in which the city's mottled topography is frequently portrayed as a historically saturated site. Invariably, this historical focus is supported by an aesthetics in which representing Berlin is concomitant with an ethical obligation to address in some form the city's pasts. It is argued in this paper that through an engaged comparison of Walter Benjamin's theory of critical pedestrianism with Nietzsche's "The Uses and Disadvantages of History for Life," Dutch novelist Cees Nooteboom's novel "All Souls Day" questions the possibility of representing the city as a discursive space in which the past and the present can mutually co-exist. Nooteboom's text offers a singular and unique perspective on the ethical burden the recently unified cities faces in the post-unification era, namely the obligation to remember the division and pre-division German pasts, by questioning whether it is at all possible for the city to fulfill this duty of historical remembering.<br>

Abstract: Drawing on G. H. Mead and Merleau-Ponty, this paper aims to extend our understanding of self-reflexivity beyond the notion of a discursive, abstract, and symbolic process. It offers a framework for embodied self-reflexivity, which anchors the self in the reflexive capacity of bodily sensations. The data consist of two years of ethnographic observations and in-depth interviews of vipassana meditation practitioners in Israel and the United States. The findings illustrate how bodily sensations are used as indexes to psychological states, emotions, and past experiences, while constant awareness of embodied responses is used as a tool for self-monitoring. The paper follows the interaction between discursive and embodied modes of reflexivity and the attempt to shift from one mode to the other. I suggest that currently popular practices of embodied awareness, from meditation to yoga, are based on embodied self-reflexivity and are part of the postindustrial culture of self-awareness.<br>

These films are re-enactments, not in the sense of offering re-creations of specific historical events, but in the sense of involving spectators in an experience that offers them a feeling for the past.<br>

Abstract: It has become commonplace to describe Machado de Assis's characters and narrators as deeper than those of his contemporaries, and his novels as representations more creatively ambiguous than most literary depictions of nineteenth-century Brazil. In this essay I argue that throughout his novels psychological depth is a function of moral imagination; and a troubled moral imagination is a necessary condition for the literary representation of the modern self. Machado's protagonists are able to fashion the public presentation of their selves by imagining alternatives to their origins, desires, and social predicaments. They have in their pasts a burden they need to overcome, and while doing so they find themselves in conditions of freedom and harm. Evil then arises as a consequence of moral dynamism, in so far as it becomes a project for undoing the other. The genesis of a radical conception of free will and evil in Machado's narratives goes back to his translation of Victor Hugo's The Toilers of the Sea (1866). His concern with a more meticulous characterization of inwardness deepens between Iaiá Garcia (1878) and Dom Casmurro (1899), when adopting the structure of a confessional narrative he arrives at a balance between disguised motives (malice), double chronology (nostalgia), and human life as an unfolding, reversible, and self-aware process (metamorphosis). To frame Machado's strategy for depicting moral change, I take from Augustine's Confessions the suggestion that retrospection is the only way of restoring the identity of someone whose self is marked by his or her sense of dissimilarity with the past. Finally, from Kant and Paul Ricoeur I draw the elements for a further consideration of evil as an invitation to think differently about seeing, judging, and narrating human life.<br>

Abstract: The optimistic assessment that the future of classical music will be dominated by Chinese (or Asian) artists motivates a re-evaluation of twentieth-century music in the context of "reflexive" cultural globalisation. The term classical music itself is inappropriate when describing the complex intercultural foundation of the past century of art music in East Asia. Drawing on theories by Ricœur, Taylor, Bhabha, and Samuels, "alterity" and "narrativity" are introduced here as key concepts for an interpretation of works that combine Chinese and European instruments or sounds from the 1930s until the present. Earlier concepts of musical narratives approaching alterity and interlinkage of Asian and Western musical discourses such as reform (Liu Tianhua), coexistence (Yamada Kōsaku, Hashimoto Kunihiko), integration (Shi Yongkang, Chinese "conservatory style"), and individualization (Takemitsu Tōru) were closely related to socio-political processes in East Asia. Recent compositions that employ bicultural instrumentation exhibit more specific and reflexive forms of musical narrativity; in these, four modes in which gestural types and structural processes intersect can be discerned: interaction (Chen Xiaoyong), polarity (Tan Dun), stratification (Zhu Jian'er), and hybridity (Chaya Czernowin). Cognitive constraints in the listening process might limit the communicability of several aspects in these narrative concepts.<br>

Abstract: Este artículo ofrece aportes para un balance de uno de los más ambiciosos y debatidos proyectos de antropología aplicada en América Latina, el Proyecto Perú-Cornell, que se desarrolló en la Comunidad de Vicos, en los Andes peruanos, entre 1952 y 1966. Lo más valioso de estos aportes es que son fruto del trabajo con los propios pobladores de Vicos, que durante un año se embarcaron en un intenso proceso reflexión y diálogo intergeneracional en el marco de una investigación participativa enfocada en las memorias locales del pasado comunal, y las implicancias de ese pasado para el presente y futuro de Vicos. Además de presentar a la Comunidad de Vicos, los antecedentes del Proyecto Perú-Cornell y el marco teórico y metodológico del proyecto de investigación participativa, este artículo ofrece una selección de testimonios de los pobladores de Vicos así como algunas reflexiones a modo de conclusión. Particularmente, destaca el potencial de los procesos colectivos de reflexión sobre el pasado como mecanismos de consolidación de la identidad y subraya la importancia de incluir a los actores locales en la reflexión y análisis de su pasado, no como «datos» o testimonios aislados, sino como productores de sentidos sobre ese pasado. This essay offers contributions for evaluating one of the most ambitious and debated projects of applied antropology in Latin America, the Project Perú-Cornell, that was developed at Vicos community, in the Peruvian Andes, between 1952 and 1966. What is most valuable of these contributions is that they are a fruit of work with Vicos' dwellers, who were embarked during a year on an intense process of reflection and dialogue between generations in the frame of a participative research focused on local memories of communal past, and its implications for Vicos present and future.

Abstract: Los historiadores porfían en encontrar la verdad y defender la libertad de interpretarla. Las diversas «verdades» conllevan la construcción permanente de la historia, para lo cual nos vemos en la necesidad de insistir en la inagotable búsqueda de los rastros y restos del pasado. Tanto historiadores como historiados, se encuentran en la misma condición de recordar acompañados. Ello nos compele a saber escuchar para entender las formas de olvido y contribuir a que la memoria aflore y estimule el ejercicio mnemotécnico. Como advertía Frances Yates, la memoria es un arte, y por tanto, el historiador asume que frente al el proceso destructor del olvido, la historia logra reconstruirse, siempre y cuando exista una memoria que perviva. Historians insist on finding truth and defending the freedom to interpret it. The different «truths» entail the permanent building of history, to which end we need to keep endlessly on looking for traces and remains of the past. Historians, as well as their subjects, find themselves in the situation of remembering accompanied. This compels us to know how to listen to forms of oblivion and to contribute to bring memory to the surface and stimulate the mnemonic exercise. As Frances Yeats warned, memory is an art, and therefore the historian assumes that, before the destructive process of oblivion, history achieves its reconstruction as long as there is a memory surviving.<br>

Abstract: En el artículo se reflexiona sobre las diversas formas de relación con el pasado que lo hacen contemporáneo del presente. El autor aborda tres temas que permiten discutir diversas propuestas teóricas y presenta ejemplos sacados de sus más recientes investigaciones. Estos temas son en primer lugar la construcción del pasado por las obras literarias, particularmente teatrales; luego, la presencia del pasado de la literatura misma en cada momento del presente de la escritura literaria y, finalmente, la competencia entre las representaciones del pasado producidas por la ficción narrativa y la construcción del saber histórico propuesto por la operación historiográfica. Semejante trayectoria permitirá la discusión de los conceptos de «energía social», de «campo cultural» y de «representancia» tal como los proponen Stephen Greenblatt, Pierre Bourdieu y Paul Ricœur. In this article, the various forms of relationship with the past which make it contemporary of the present are approached. The author deals with three subjects that allow various theoretical proposals and present examples drawn from his more recent researches. These subjects are first the construction of past by literary works, particularly theatrical; then, the presence of past of literature itself in every moment of present in literary writing, and, finally, the competence between representations of past produced by narrative fiction and construction of historical knowledge proposed by historiography operation. A trajectory such as this will allow discussion of concepts of «social energy», «cultural field», and «representance», as are proposed by Stephen Greenblatt, Pierre Bourdieu y Paul Ricœur.<br>

Abstract: El dominio de una memoria generalizada crea un conflicto entre memoria e historia. La modesta memoria de la historia oral tiene que convivir con una orgullosa memoria oficial que toma el lugar de la historia. Esta memoria se convierte en un obstáculo para los testimonios. El conflicto se puede superar si esas dos vías de aproximación al pasado reconocen sus limitaciones comunes: Ambas son una visión parcial del pasado. Esto es una obligación porque sus complementariedades son necesarias para el estudio de la violencia extrema del siglo XX. The domination of generalised memory creates a conflict between memory and history. The modest memory of oral history has to live with a proud and official memory which takes the place of history. This memory becomes an obstacle to witnesses' testimonials. The conflict can be overcome if these two ways of approaching the past acknowledge their common limitations: both of them are a partial vision of the past. This is compulsory because their complementarities are necessary to study XX century extreme violence.<br>

Abstract: This article reflects on the question of the disappearance of the individual subject of experience in Beckett's writing, and its gradual replacement by an anonymous subject. After The Unnamable, the voice becomes increasingly ambiguous or plural. It can no longer be ascribed to any distinct individual. In the light of Paul Ricœur's analysis of narrative identity, I intend to show how Beckett's work gradually goes, through the notion of alterity, beyond the problematic of subjectivity. By suspending the question who, the Beckettian text appears to be more and more organized by a missing presence, and moves toward a gradual reinforcement of the notion of past.<br>

Abstract: This paper demonstrates how, in a southern Irish setting, differences based on the historic struggles between Protestantism and Catholicism are perpetuated and communicated. It outlines the background and identifies modes of speech indicating unexamined assumptions grounded in the collective memory of the past. It analyses the ways in which the irruption into everyday communication of this emotional legacy reproduce difference, and examines Protestant perceptions that Catholics see them as incapable of possessing an authentic national identity. It shows how the process results in Protestant exclusion from the imagined nation and the category of 'Irishness'.<br>

Abstract: Las migraciones masivas de población, en particular a Europa, siempre han generado conflictos; pero si además estas ocurren bajo una profunda crisis económica, se crea un ambiente propicio para las expresiones xenófobas o racistas. Para aliviar esta tensión, desde finales del siglo pasado se implementa, con mayor énfasis en Estados Unidos, Canadá y Japón, un modelo de convivencia, el de la multiculturalidad, algo así como un "juntos pero no revueltos", que sobrevalora lo exótico de los inmigrantes, pero que, a pesar de sus aciertos, responde de forma limitada a los retos actuales. Este artículo presenta un modelo que sugiere la liberación de buena parte de la pesada carga que conlleva toda identidad con el fin de transformar a los individuos en seres plurales, abiertos a las transferencias de las identidades de los otros, ya sean estos nativos o foráneos. Mass migrations of people, particularly into Europe, have always created conflict; however, if they are also taking place in the middle of a profound economic crisis, an atmosphere conducive to xenophobic and racist expression is created. To alleviate this tension, since the end of the past century (and with particular emphasis in the United States, Canada and Japan) a model of coexistence has been implemented — that of multiculturality, which can be loosely translated as "together but not intimately involved". In spite of its success, this model (which overestimates the exotic nature of immigrants), only deals with current challenges in a limited manner. This article presents a model that suggests the freeing-up of much of the heavy load that any identity entails with the aim of transforming individuals into plural beings, which are open to the transparencies of others' identities, whether they are native inhabitants or foreigners.<br>

Abstract: I take up the question of political identity as the continuity of a community across time. In particular, I examine what it means to think of a political community as the subject of attribution across generations, that is, what is meant when it is made the bearer of responsibility for the past and a custodian of the future. In doing that, I focus on identity, memory, and responsibility and discuss that cluster of concepts using as an illustrative example the idea of constitutional patriotism and its relationship to the past.<br>

Abstract: Frank writes: "It is generally held that economic development occurs in a succession of capitalist stages and that today's underdeveloped countries are still in a stage through which now-developed countries passed long ago. Yet even a modest acquaintance with history shows that the underdevelopment is not original or traditional and that neither the past nor the present of the underdeveloped countries resemble in any important respect the past of the now-developed countries. The now-developed countries were never underdeveloped, though they may have been undeveloped. It is also widely believed that the contemporary underdevelopment of a country can be understood as the product of reflection solely of its own economic, political, social, and cultural characteristics of structure.

Abstract: Twelve years after the genocide, nothing has been forgotten in Rwanda. The country resembles a multiplicity of experiences, words and silences. The aim of the article is to reflect on the representations – or absence of representations – of the past. The approach is based on the ambivalence of any reference to the past. It is not a question of making a judgement in the abstract about the more or less legitimate character of the attitudes observed, but to understand the dynamics at work. The analysis is divided into three parts. The first part recalls the specific aspects of the case under study. The second examines the silences that weigh upon Rwandan society. The third notes the main accounts of the past.<br>

Abstract: According to recent analyses, we are said to be witnessing in the West a « naturalisation » of filiation. The present article challenges this hypothesis, based on anthropological and historical analyses of old “parallel” kinships and the new forms of family configurations. It recalls the longstanding reference to nature in the representations and uses of kinship and the existence of a metaphorical and symbolic world characterised both in the past and today by the plurality of meanings given to kinship relations.<br>

Abstract: This paper deals with the manner of negotiating the relation to its colonial past of France in the Maghreb, concentrating on a key episode in the national historical account, the battle held to have taken place at Poitiers in 732. The creation, near Châtellerault, of a memorial site for that battle, and the annual commemoration which takes place there, constitute the substance of this paper, unfolding in three phases: firstly, an archeology of the genesis of the “Site of 732” situated in the context of the years from 1960 to 1970; secondly, an analysis of the contents of the site as seen through the typology of the discourses constructing the museum project; finally, clearly setting out the social issues involved in memorialisation, through observation and using the survey carried out on visitors to the site.<br>

Abstract: Freud, 'The Uncanny', XVII, p. 220. There is, of course, a vast literature on Freud' s
concept of the uncanny, most of which is not concerned with the self-civilization relation
that is explored in this essay. Julia Kristeva, for example, examines the uncanny in the
context of the self-other relation. 'The uncanny strangeness', she writes, 'allows for
many variations: They all repeat the difficulty I have in situating myself with respect to
the other.' See Julia Kristeva, Strangers to Ourselves, trans. Leon S. Roudiez (New York,
1991), p. 187. While Kristeva's interpretation underscores the place of the uncanny in
human intercourse, Samuel Weber finds the uncanny important in forming a correct
theory of knowledge, one that does not hold to the Cartesian illusion of an objectivizing,
insulated and reliable cognition. 'Whereas for Descartes the essential condition for
attaining certitude was the subject's withdrawal from a world that in its alterity could no
longer be relied on, it is precisely the discovery that such withdrawal is a fata morgana,
an unsustainable construct that informs the misrecognition, that constitutes the uncanny. '
See Samuel Weber, The Legend of Freud (Stanford, CA, 2000), p. 20. For a political
interpretation of the concept, see Derrida's brief but illuminating discussion of the
uncanny element in Marxism, in Jacques Derrida, Specters of Marx (New York, 1994),
pp. 172-5. For a general discussion of Freud's theory of memory, see Richard Terdiman,

Author(s): Zigurs Marshall Scott<br>
Abstract: The past decade has brought advanced information technologies, which include electronic messaging systems, executive information systems, collaborative systems, group decision support systems, and other technologies that use sophisticated information management to enable multiparty participation in organization activities. Developers and users of these systems hold high hopes for their potential to change organizations for the better, but actual changes often do not occur, or occur inconsistently. We propose adaptive structuration theory (AST) as a viable approach for studying the role of advanced information technologies in organization change. AST examines the change process from two vantage points: (1) the types of structures that are provided by advanced technologies, and (2) the structures that actually emerge in human action as people interact with these technologies. To illustrate the principles of AST, we consider the small group meeting and the use of a group decision support system (GDSS). A GDSS is an interesting technology for study because it can be structured in a myriad of ways, and social interaction unfolds as the GDSS is used. Both the structure of the technology and the emergent structure of social action can be studied. We begin by positioning AST among competing theoretical perspectives of technology and change. Next, we describe the theoretical roots and scope of the theory as it is applied to GDSS use and state the essential assumptions, concepts, and propositions of AST. We outline an analytic strategy for applying AST principles and provide an illustration of how our analytic approach can shed light on the impacts of advanced technologies on organizations. A major strength of AST is that it expounds the nature of social structures within advanced information technologies and the key interaction processes that figure in their use. By capturing these processes and tracing their impacts, we can reveal the complexity of technology-organization r~<br>

Publisher: Carfax Publishing, Taylor and Francis Ltd.<br>
Issue: i324979<br>

Author(s): Dube David<br>
Abstract: The essay challenges the strongly teleological emphasis in the construction of black South African literary history, which has elided many of the aesthetic, historical and political complexities of the literature. It argues that many of the literary texts written in the `mission' ethos are marked by forms of aesthetic hybridity and subtextual ambiguity which require serious interpretation. A common feature of this writing is its desperate struggle with a sense of accelerated time. It is suggested that written narrative was undertaken as a mode of reprisal which sought to limit and, in some instances, transform the effects of an alien modernity. This undertaking is studied in two groups of texts: those which tell the story of Christian `emergence' amongst indigenous communities, and those which re-create the traditional past. In the case of the `Christian' texts, the subtext is found to be more secular than is often assumed, with writers using the theme to develop an active relationship with the historical effects and ideological content of modernity. Similarly, narratives about traditional society (or early colonial encounters) involve attempts to relocate modern subjects in revised versions of the past, or to elicit principles around which alternative models of modernity or even civil society might develop.<br>

Article Title: The Cage of Nature: Modernity's History in Japan<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i345907<br>
Date: 2 1, 1986<br>
Author(s): Jameson Julia Adeney<br>
Abstract: "The Cage of Nature" focuses on the concept of nature as a way to rethink Japanese and European versions of modernity and the historical tropes that distance "East" from "West." This essay begins by comparing Japanese political philosopher Maruyama Masao and his contemporaries, Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno. Both sets of authors define modernity as the moment when humanity overcomes nature, but Maruyama longs for this triumph while Horkheimer and Adorno deplore its consequences. Maruyama insists that Japan has failed to attain the freedom promised by modernity because it remains in the thrall of nature defined in three ways: as Japan's deformed past, as the mark of Japan's tragic difference from "the West," and as Japan's accursed sensuality, shackling it to uncritical bodily pleasures. In short, Maruyama sees Japan as trapped in the cage of nature. My argument is that Maruyama's frustration arises from the trap set by modern historiography, which simultaneously traces the trajectory of modernity from servile Nature to freedom of Spirit and at the same time bases the identity of the non-Western world on its closeness to nature. In other words, nature represents both the past and the East, an impossible dilemma for an Asian nationalist desirous of liberty. By revising our historical narratives to take into account the ways in which Western modernity continued to engage versions of nature, it becomes possible to reposition Japan and "the East" within modernity's history rather than treating them as the Other.<br>

Abstract: Le problème de la représentation du passé ne commence pas avec l'histoire mais avec la mémoire qui a le privilège de la reconnaissance intuitive et directe des images gardées de l'impression en nous de la marque du passé, avec toutes les difficultés liées à la fiabilité relative de la mémoire. Le problème chemine à travers tous les stades de l'opération historiographique: témoignage et archive, — explication/compréhension —, représentation narrative et rhétorique au niveau du texte final de l'historien. Entre la mémoire et l'histoire, l'ordre de priorité reste indécidable. /// The problem of the representation of the past does not begin with history, but with memory. Memory has the capacity to recognize intuitively and directly the images we keep of the impression the past makes on us, with all the uncertainties stemming from its questionable reliability. This problem concerns all stages of the historiographic process: testimony and archives — explanation/comprehension — narrative and rhetorical representation during the writing of the historian's final text. But one thing remains certain, it is impossible to give priority to either memory or history.<br>

Abstract: Unification in 1990 intensified the latent preoccupation with memory in Germany. Günter Grass' recent novels testify to the divisive nature of collective remembrance, which is also reflected in the debate surrounding the Berlin Holocaust Memorial. Grass describes a number of derailed monumental endeavors, such as the memorial cemeteries of Unkenrufe, the Fontane statue in Ein weites Feld, and the neo-Nazi Web site of Im Krebsgang. These texts suggest that a memory culture which cultivates monumental representation can be coopted for political purposes. In Grass' literary world, the search for immortality in materiality ultimately eclipses any self-reflective perspective on the past.<br>

Abstract: With the portrayal of local resentment towards the massive influx of Silesian refugees after WWII in the GDR in his novel Landnahme, Christoph Hein expands the literary representation of history he began earlier in Horns Ende, again using the fictional small town of Guldenberg as paradigmatic for the GDR, extended here over time to include unified Germany. Bernhard Haber's epic, but unscrupulous struggle to overcome the will of his neighbors for him to fail provides the backdrop for Hein's depiction of how the past unavoidably writes the future and how the collective process of socialization shapes meanings and values. Using five narrators, Hein applies his earlier concept of social autobiography to trace historical developments in the acquired collective attitudes of Germans towards Gypsies, Poles, the handicapped, and African and Vietnamese workers left behind after unification, all of whom were subjected to the same abusive language and discrimination directed at the refugees.<br>

Issue: i27749757<br>
Date: 1 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Bird Frederick<br>
Abstract: Typically people make ethical judgments with reference to unchanging principles, standards, rights, and values. This essay argues that such an ahistorical approach to ethics should be supplemented by a due regard for history. Invoking precedents by authors such as Jonsen and Toulmin, McIntyre, Niebuhr, Weber, De Tocqueville, Machiavelli and others, this essay explores several important ways in which a due regard for history can and should shape the practice of business ethics. Thus a due regard for history helps us both to cultivate fitting appreciation of cultural mores and to understand how current problems and issues have developed as they have; it helps us to gauge current responsibilities with respect legacies of problems inherited from the past; it helps us to develop a lively sense of what is possible in the present, given current contingencies and past experiences; and it moves us to rethink the practice of ethical auditing: not just as a backward-looking effort to gauge compliance but as a forward-looking way of learning from actual experiences and developing fitting responses.<br>

Abstract: This essay is a reflection on the sense of trust, based on Niklas Luhman's pioneering work, and on the sense of history making, based on personal reflections as well as those from other authors, such as Nietzsche, Nadin, Ortega y Gasset, Castells and Fernández-Martorell. The central proposition is that trusting may be considered as synonymous with history making, as both acts are possible only thanks to the existence of a future, the only time really at our disposal, and both are based on past experiences. Besides, the text also examines historical periodization and the importance of the present digital revolution.<br>

Abstract: En este artículo se abordan algunas de las cuestiones metodológicas que plantea el análisis de la violencia de los hombres contra las mujeres en la historia, como contrapunto a la existencia de este tipo de violencia en nuestra sociedad. En primer lugar se exponen las diferentes fórmulas que se utilizan para nombrarla —«violencia de género», «violencia sexista», «violencia sexual», «violencia doméstica o familiar», «violencia de pareja», «violencia machista»...—, sus significados y connotaciones políticas, y su validez conceptual para la investigación histórica; a continuación se tratan algunos de los problemas que surgen al estudiar la violencia contra las mujeres a partir de las fuentes documentales históricas, y, finalmente, se analiza cómo puede repercutir en el presente el análisis histórico de la violencia de los hombres contra las mujeres. This essay considers some of the methodological issues raised by the analysis of male violence against women in the past, as a counterpoint to the persistence of this kind of violence in our society. In the first place, the author examines the different expressions used to name this kind of violence —«gender violence», «sexist violence»,«sexual violence», «domestic violence or violence in the family», «partner violence in couples», «macho violence»...—,their meaning and political connotations. Some of the problems posed by the study of violence against women based on historical documentary sources are considered thereafter, to finish analyzing the possible effects on the present situation of an historical analysis of male violence against women.<br>

Abstract: La stèle du Bronzo est gravée d'un oiseau "levé", en plein vol, la tête tournée vers l'extérieurs, superposé à un filon de quartz blanc; une crosse, également traitée en champlevé, lui barre le passage. En première lecture, une identification plausible du genre volatile semblait prévaloir et le colombidé emportait notre adhésion. Mais une analyse plus posée et un effort de déconstruction graphique du motif permettront cette fois de reprendre et d'affiner la reconnaissance, en décrivant les différents filtres autorisant tel ou tel rejet de catégorie ou d'espèce, pour ne conserver en dernier ressort que les meilleurs prétendants à la seule confrontation possible, celle qui oppose les corvidés aux colombidés. La représentation du Bronzo est en définitive équivalente en substance et en structure aux scènes figurées sur les stèles voisines dans lesquelles un phallus s'oppose qu tranchant d'une lame de hache (Mané Rutual), tandis qu'un cachalot affronte la coalition des animaux et des outils de l'homme (Table des Marchand). A "flushed" bird is engraved on the Bronzo stela, in full flight, its head turned to the exterior, superposed over a white quartz vein; a crook, equally treated in cut-away engraving, bars its passage. At a first reading, a plausible identification of the bird seemed to prevail and the Columbidae met with our approval. However, more deliberate analysis and an effort at the graphic deconstruction of the motif allows the identification to be reconsidered and improved, by describing the various filters authorising the rejection of such or such a category, finally preserving the best claimants to the only possible confrontation, opposing Corvidae to Columbidae. The Bronzo representation is equivalent in substance and in structure to the scenes on the neighbouring stelae where a phallus is opposed to the sharp edge of an axe blade (Mané Rutual), while a sperm-whale confronts the coalition of animals and human tools (Table des Marchand). However Bronzo is a ~<br>

Author(s): Hodder Ian<br>
Abstract: This paper seeks further to define the processes of the interpretation of meaning in archaeology and to explore the public role such interpretation might play. In contrast to postmodern and poststructuralist perspectives, a hermeneutic debate is described that takes account of a critical perspective. An interpretive postprocessual archaeology needs to incorporate three components: a guarded objectivity of the data, hermeneutic procedures for inferring internal meanings, and reflexivity. The call for an interpretive position is related closely to new, more active roles that the archaeological past is filling in a multicultural world.<br>

Abstract: Ce texte est une réaction contre la racialisation croissante des phénomènes sociaux qui est opérée aujourd'hui dans la société française en général et dans les sciences sociales en particulier. Une tendance dont l'émergence d'une « question noire » et d'un des principaux corollaires de celle-ci (au moins pour ce qui est des populations des départements d'Outre-mer), l'activation d'une mémoire de l'esclavage des « nègres », sont ici considérées comme un exemple des plus significatifs. Cette tendance se développe au risque que soient occultés ou, pour le moins, travestis les enjeux, les stratégies et les mécanismes proprement sociaux qui sont au fondement des discriminations racistes qu'affrontent effectivement les « Noirs » en France et que soient finalement brisées — sous le poids de la concurrence de victimes de l'histoire exigeant réparation — les solidarités transcommunautaires de diverses sortes qui, seules, peuvent enrayer ces discriminations et les dynamiques les déterminant. Elle a pour un de ses principaux moteurs des stratégies d'élites qui, toutes, consistent à constituer le racialisme en un moyen d'ascension sociale. Des stratégies dans lesquelles et pour lesquelles des groupes d'individus — convenablement dotés en capitaux de différentes sortes (économique, culturel et « racial ») — se révèlent donc particulièrement aptes à capter à leur seul profit les mobilisations identitaires ou mémorielles qu'ils ont souvent contribué à déclencher mais dont d'autres, moins bien dotés, forment la grande masse des fantassins. Concernant les populations des départements d'Outre-mer, les stratégies en question sont portées par des élites nationalistes ou indigénistes en mal de reconnaissance et renvoient à une même logique argumentative qui, sous couvert d'une dénonciation de l'aliénation coloniale (sous les espèces de « l'aveuglement à la couleur » ou de « l'oubli généralisé de l'esclavage »), est opposée à tous ceux qui, désireux de construire une citoyenneté français~<br>

Abstract: Over the past few years, the relationship between landscape and the body as two physical entities mutually informed through performance has been increasingly interrogated by cultural geographers. Similar issues about memory, embodiment and performativity have been raised in the social sciences, yet often obliterating the material specificities of place and landscape. This paper reconsiders the relationship between landscape and memory in terms of embodied, visual and spatial practice, rather than as a contested cultural politics of heritage and identity (as it has been generally understood in cultural geography after the so-called 'cultural turn'). Drawing on Nora's 'memory places' and on the Deleuzian notion of 'ontological past', as well as on recent writing on historical geographies of exploration and travel, the paper explores the spatial re-activation of Classical historical memory by nineteenth-century British officers and travellers to Aegean mountain peaks through their embodied and site-located practices of climbing, surveying or simply 'gazing'.<br>

Abstract: After some initial remarks on the ongoing historiographic debates regarding experience as an analytical category, the article first tries to show, through a concise survey of J. G. Herder's essays on Ossian and Shakespeare, that Herder cannot be claimed as a source for the notion of historical experience in the sense of an immediate access to the past, as the theorist of history F. R. Ankersmit has stated. Instead, this article argues, experience can be understood as one of the key terms of Herder's historical view of modernity, whose development he describes as involving a paradigmatic change in the character of human experience itself. For Herder, the shift from primary to secondary experience in the modern historical process results in the necessity of an aestheticization of historiography. In this respect, the article briefly concludes, Herder inspired 19thcentury historians such as G. G. Gervinus.<br>

Date: 4 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Simons Karen<br>
Abstract: Willa Cather's famous Virgilian epigraph to My Ántonia alerts the reader to the novel's deep engagement with the Georgics. This paper advocates a positive interpretation of the relationship between the two by exploring the role of the poem in the life and "memoirs" of Jim Burden, the novel's narrator. In contrast to currently received notions about the poem's "pastoralizing" influence, it argues that the Georgics illumines the Nebraska prairie and the farmers who toiled there, enabling Jim to perceive and articulate their vitality and worth. Through Jim's story of remembrance and return, Cather ultimately presents the literary tradition, and the Georgics in particular, as a beneficent force capable of creating connections among human beings, the natural world, the past and present.<br>

Author(s): Witt Janet<br>
Abstract: Contemporary African American followers of Sunni Islam are self-consciously articulating a form of eating that they see as liberating them from the heritage of slavery, while also bringing them into conformity with Islamic notions of purity. In so doing, they participate in arguments about the meaning of "soul food," the relation between "Western" materialism and "Eastern" spirituality, and bodily health and its relation to mental liberation. Debates within the African American Muslim community show us how an older anthropological concern with food taboos can be opened up to history and to the experience of the past reinterpreted in terms of the struggles of the present.<br>

Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i370165<br>
Date: 12 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): Zilberfein Carol A.<br>
Abstract: Despite the abundance of psychological studies on trauma related ills of descendants of historical trauma, and the extensive scholarly work describing the memory politics of silenced traumatic pasts, there has yet to emerge a critical analysis of the constitutive practices of descendants of historical trauma. This article presents an ethnographic account of a support group for descendants of Holocaust survivors, proposing that the discursive frame of intergenerational transmission of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and support group based narrative practices allow descendants to fashion their sense of self as survivors of the distant traumatic past. The discursive frame of transmitted PTSD acts as both a mnemonic bridge to the past and a mechanism of identity making, as participants narratively reemplot their life stories as having been personally constituted by the distant past. A close ethnographic reading of on-site discursive practices points to how culture ferments to produce narratives, practices and ultimately carriers of memory to both sustain and revitalize historical grand narratives and the cultural scenarios they embed.<br>

Author(s): WolfAbstract: For the past twenty-five years, a sub-branch of biblical studies has engaged, sometimes rather vigorously, in the pursuit of using sociological methods to understand the Bible. These, often autodidact biblical scholars, have taken over a branch of sociology of religion. The methods they follow in their pursuit of the strange world of the Bible can teach sociology how to retrieve a more critical sociology. The questions they ask would be helpful more generally to sociology of religion.<br>

Abstract: En quoi le western, ce genre cinématographique si typiquement américain, peut-il aider les historiens à réfléchir sur leurs propres méthodes? En comparant les œuvres de John Ford et de Michael Cimino, Christian Delage nous invite à revenir sur la question des temporalités et des représentations de la durée. /// The filmmaker reconstructs the past rather than reconstituting it, and thus meets the historian. The analysis of two major works by John Ford and Michael Cimino shows how the cinema historicizes a past event through the indirect agency of the narrative. In the fiction presented to the audience, the filmmaker, like the historian, faces representations inscribed in general history, while simultaneously modifying its meaning. American cinema carries on an almost ontological relation with duration and time; the question of its truthfulness presents the same methodological challenge as that driving contemporary historical research.<br>

Issue: i290825<br>
Date: 3 1, 1898<br>
Author(s): Michelet François<br>
Abstract: Pour dépasser les termes du dialogue contemporain sur le "couple mémoire/histoire", pour prolonger aussi la méditation sur le travail de Paul Ricœur qu'il vient de publier dans la Revue historique (n° 619, juillet-septembre 2001), François Bédarida met ses pas dans ceux de Péguy. Un Péguy pour qui "l'histoire et la mémoire forment un angle droit". Tout l'article montre pourtant que Péguy-Janus, fidèle à Bergson, a aussi promis la réconciliation de Mnémosyne et Clio, comme il se doit entre mère et fille. Dans un passage célèbre de Clio, Péguy, on le sait, a soutenu que "l'histoire et la mémoire forment un angle droit". L'article dit l'origine de cette distinction, à l'heure du retournement historiographique conduit par la nouvelle Sorbonne, par Laville, Langlois et Seignobos, ennemis juré du patron des Cahiers de la Quinzaine, grand pourfendeur du "parti intellectuel" et de "l'histoire historisante". Il signale aussi, et très fortement, que Péguy, en bon et fidèle bergsonien, a constamment tenté de dépasser les fausses oppositions entre histoire et mémoire au nom de l'affrontement fécond entre Clio et Chronos, entre le passé et la vie, et qu'il n'a pas cessé de rappeler la haute responsabilité de l'historien dans la compréhension du monde. /// It is well known that in a famous passage in Clio, Péguy said "history and memory form a right angle." The article details the origin of this distinction during the historiographic reversal led by the new Sorbonne, Laville, Langlois and Seignobos, sworn enemies of the director of the Cahiers de la Quinzaine, great destroyer of the "intellectual party" and "historicizing history". It also says that Péguy, the good and faithful Bergsonian, constantly tried to overcome the false oppositions between history and memory in the name of the productive clash between Clio and Chronos, between the past and life, and he never stopped recalling the historian's enormous responsibility in the comprehension of the world.<br>

Author(s): Felman François<br>
Abstract: Dans ce plaidoyer argumenté en faveur de l'histoire du temps présent, François Bédarida lève une à une les objections faites à ce champ historiographique regardé, quelquefois encore, avec suspicion. Cette notion de temps présent est définie dans une mise en perspective avec le passé et l'avenir. En définitive, l'historien, confronté à la mémoire immédiate des témoins, trouve dans le temps proche un terrain à la fois fragile et fécond. Depuis une vingtaine d'années, l'histoire du temps présent contribue au renouvellement du champ historiographique, tant par le regard qu'elle permet d'offrir sur la notion d'historicité que par la mise en œuvre de pratiques particulières. Les objections formulées à son égard sont cependant nombreuses: absence de recul, manque ou, au contraire, surabondance des sources, incomplétude de l'objet, flou sur la définition même du champ d'études. Or l'intérêt de l'étude du très contemporain réside justement dans la complexité des liens que le présent entretient avec le passé et l'avenir: un temps présent qui fait figure de trait d'union entre ces différentes temporalités à l'image d'un passeur ou d'un traducteur. Mais bâtir une histoire du temps récent ne consiste pas à faire œuvre de mémoire: si l'historien se nourrit des témoignages de ses contemporains, il exerce son regard critique sur eux et, tâche tout à fait inconfortable, fait œuvre d'explication en fonction d'un présent dont il est à la fois l'acteur et l'interprète. /// Over the last twenty years, the history of the present has renewed historiography through the vision it provides on the notion of historicity as well as by the implementation of particular practices. But there are many objections to it: a lack of distance; either a lack of or too many sources; the lack of completion of the object, blurriness about the very definition of the field of study. Nevertheless, the author suggests that the interest in the study of the contemporary dwells in the complexity of the links the pr~<br>

Issue: i290830<br>
Date: 6 1, 1974<br>
Author(s): de Certeau François<br>
Abstract: "Aucune existence du présent sans présence du passé, et donc aucune ludicité du présent sans conscience du passé. Dans la vie du temps, le passé est à coup sûr la présence la plus lourde, donc possiblement la plus riche, celle en tout cas dont il faut à la fois se nourrir et se distinguer." La réflexion de Michel de Certeau sur l'histoire est parente de celle à laquelle invitait, en ces termes, Alphonse Dupront, le 22 février 1964. Et la fécondité qu'elle conserve, en notre temps si préoccupé des rapports entre histoire et mémoire, explique une actualité éditoriale dont François Dosse nous aide à apprécier l'importance. L'article vise à éclairer l'actualité de la pensée et de l'œuvre de Michel de Certeau, attestée par la réédition en 2002 de ses livres les plus importants. Sa définition de "l'opération historiographique" reste précieuse en ce qu'elle conçoit celle-ci comme le produit d'un lieu social déterminé, comme une pratique et une écriture. Il récuse avec Paul Ricœur la fausse alternative entre l'histoire-science et l'histoire-récit. Sa lecture de Freud aide à penser le lien entre histoire et mémoire, qu'elle entend protéger contre le ressassement du passé. Par delà son apport à une "anthropologie du croire", Michel de Certeau invite les historiens à assumer, dans la recherche de chemins à travers les temporalités, tout à la fois l'humilité et l'esprit braconnier. /// This article provides an update on the thinking and works of Michel de Certeau. A new edition of his most important books came out in 2002. His definition of a "historiographic operation" remains very useful as it considers this operation as the product of a defined social place, a practice and a style. Like Paul Ricœur, he rejects the false alternative between history as science and history as narrative. His reading of Freud helps to make the link between history and memory, this same memory that has to be protected against the regrets of the past. Beyond his contribution to an "anthropology of ~<br>

Abstract: Memory, persistence, and cultural transmission are hot topics in anthropology today. Contributing to an increasing anthropological interest in youth agency, in this article I invite readers to look at youth as a crucial site for understanding issues of religious memory and cultural transmission. In the past five decades, Bulongic people (Guinea-Conakry) have undergone significant religious changes caused by the introduction of Islam, which has led to the official disappearance of pre-Islamic rituals. In this article, I explore how young Bulongic remember a pre-Islamic past that they have never experienced. I argue that, to understand how they assimilate and perpetuate this religious heritage, one must examine the subtle processes of intergenerational transmission through which their memories are dynamically shaped.<br>

Author(s): Žižek Sergei<br>
Abstract: The literary epic Lāčplēsis, written in the nineteenth century, was a conscious attempt to create a cultural frame of reference for the emerging Latvian nation. In this article, which examines how poet Andrejs Pumpurs imagined his community, Kruks compares the Latvian epic hero with his Estonian counterpart, Kalevipoeg, who was invented at the same time under similar conditions of domination by Russians and Baltic Germans. Kruks's narrative analysis demonstrates the different frameworks through which social bonds are constructed for the heroes. Kalevipoeg is a pragmatic actor with an explicitly formulated duty; he errs, but he recognizes his personal responsibility. The Latvian hero Lāčplēsis, on the other hand, is not given a clearly formulated duty; he is simply a hero by destiny and definition. As a resource of symbols that feed contemporary discourses, the epic impedes the construction of a modern national identity capable of engendering a civic society through active pragmatic participation. For past generations, Lāčplēsis explained unjust foreign domination. Kruks argues that contemporary Latvian society now seeks a new frame of cultural reference that will permit the construction of a future-oriented national identity.<br>

Author(s): Krondorfer Björn<br>
Abstract: "Forgetting" plays an important role in the lives of individuals and communities. Although a few Holocaust scholars have begun to take forgetting more seriously in relation to the task of remembering--in popular parlance as well as in academic discourse on the Holocaust--forgetting is usually perceived as a negative force. In the decades following 1945, the terms remembering and forgetting have often been used antithetically, with the communities of victims insisting on the duty to remember and a society of perpetrators desiring to forget. Thus, the discourse on Holocaust memory has become entrenched on this issue. This essay counters the swift rejection of forgetting and its labeling as a reprehensible act. It calls attention to two issues: first, it offers a critical argument for different forms of forgetting; second, it concludes with suggestions of how deliberate performative practices of forgetting might benefit communities affected by a genocidal past. Is it possible to conceive of forgetting not as the ugly twin of remembering but as its necessary companion?<br>

Author(s): Wall John<br>
Abstract: Challenging a long-standing assumption of the separation of ethical from poetic activity, this essay develops the basis for a theory of moral life as inherently and radically creative. A range of contemporary post-Kantian ethicists--including Ricoeur, Nussbaum, Kearney, and Gutiérrez--are employed to make the argument that moral practice requires a fundamental capability for creative transformation, imagination, and social renewal. In addition, this poetic moral capability can finally be understood only from the primordial religious point of view of the mystery of Creation as such. Humanity as an image of its Creator is called to the endless impossible possibility of the re-creation of its own complex, plural, and fallen social world. Such a perspective is opposed to views of moral life as the application of law-like principles or the recovery of past moral histories. Without a better understanding of moral life's radically creative imperative, we miss a vital element of social relations' distinctive humanity.<br>

Abstract: This essay considers the persistence of collective and corporate models of literary authority within late-Victorian literature and print culture. While modern critics often understand Victorian authorship to be individually centered and governed by a dynamic of secrecy and disclosure, the periodical debates about anonymity that intensified in the fin de siècle suggest that Victorian readers and writers embraced a more flexible, collective notion of authorship. The plot, language, and paratext of Mary Elizabeth Hawker's pseudonymously published Mademoiselle Ixe, as well as the author-publisher correspondence concerning the novel, offer a representation of the corporate and collective interpretive modes that would have been familiar to late-Victorian readers, if not to recent critics. Hawker's text and the archival material it brings to light also suggest that modern readers might productively turn to the Victorian past to expand the definitions of authorship that circulate throughout nineteenth-century scholarship today.<br>

Abstract: Developing more effective teaching and learning approaches is an important aspect of disciplinary practice and will require archaeologists to undertake a scholarly exploration of educational theory and methods, areas as yet unfamiliar to most. Here, I argue for this undertaking through an exploration of the role of narrative in teaching and learning. Although often undefined, the term 'narrative' has been addressed by archaeologists from a range of theoretical persuasions to argue for different research and interpretive perspectives as well as to acknowledge the value of narrative for developing public awareness of archaeology. However, such projects are primarily aimed outside the discipline: to provide socially responsible information about the past and to generate and maintain public support. There has been a dearth of attention given to the possible ways that narrative can be used to educate archaeologists to better equip them to engage with their professional responsibilities. Here, I outline theoretical considerations for the use of narrative in education and suggest some research approaches for improved teaching and learning in archaeology.<br>

Article Title: Classical Otherness: Critical Reflections on the Place of Philology in Gadamer's Hermeneutics<br>
Publisher: Faculdade de Filosofia<br>
Issue: i40014488<br>
Date: 12 1, 2000<br>
Author(s): Renaud François<br>
Abstract: Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics rests largely on the concept of the classical. According to Gadamer, the classical stands for the continuity and the truth claim of the tradition, as transmitted by the written word. The normative character of the classical is directed against the neutrality and relativism of historicism: understanding does not occur primarily through distancing or methodological reconstruction but through belongingness to, and participation in, the past. The article shows how, given the central importance of dialogue and otherness in Gadamer's theory, the philosopher does not seem to fully do justice to the critical intention of its own dialogical and philological dimensions. On the other hand, it shows also how Gadamer's hermeneutical practice, notably in his rehabilitation of Plato, stresses the learning from otherness more explicitly than does his own theory, thus correcting, as it were, the latter. The article aims, finally, at demonstrating how, by unduly emphasizing the continuity (and sameness) in the encounter between past and present, Gadamer's theory undermines the importance of reconstructing the otherness and specificity of the classical text. /// A hermenêutica filosófica de Gadamer, entendida como uma defesa das humanidades, assenta essencialmente sobre o conceito de clássico. Segundo Gadamer, o clássico representa a continuidade e a pretensão à verdade da tradição tal como nos é transmitida pela palavra escrita. O carácter normativo do clássico em Gadamer constitui assim uma resposta crítica à neutralidade e ao relativismo do historicismo: a compreensão não acontece primariamente graças a um processo de distanciação ou reconstrução metódica, mas sim pelo facto de, desde logo, reconhecermos que temos pertença activa no passado. O presente artigo demonstra como, dada a importância central do diálogo e da alteridade na teoria de Gadamer, ofilósofo acaba por não fazer inteiramente justiça à intenção crítica inerente à dimensão dialógi~<br>

Author(s): Tilliette Xavier<br>
Abstract: O enigma do mal, o escândalo do mal em todas as suasformas, não cessa de inquietar a consciência humana, revelando-se hoje como obstáculo principal à crença em Deus e assunindo proporções tais que as teodiceias do passado, por vezes heróicas, deixaram mesmo de ser possíveis. O presente artigo não as pretende justiflcar, nem sequer desculpar Deus. O seu ponto de partida está antes na consciência de que não se pode separar o mal e os maus, a maldade e o sofrimento, o qual é muitas vezes o reverso do crime. Para o autor, a síntese e o nó górdio da questão do mal está na infelicidade (malheurj no sentido que lhe dá Simone Weil (ódio, opróbrio e sofrimento indissoluvelmente ligados) e a figura do Servo Sofredor. O mal puro, o "mal radical", constitui um desafio à metafísica, desafio este que ela deve ter a coragem de aliviar, de questionar sem cessar, mesmo sabendo que não há solução para o problema do mal, pois que quanto mais lidamos com ele tanto mais se nos obscurece e transforma em mistério. /// The riddle of evil, the scandal of evil in all its forms, does not stop disturbing the human conscience, revealing itself today as the main obstacle to the belief in God and assuming such proportions that even the theodicies of the past, sometimes heroic, stopped being possible. This article does not wish to justify them nor even excuse God. Its starting point is rather in the conscience that evil and the evil ones, wickedness and suffering cannot be separated, which is many times the reverse of crime. According to the author, the synthesis and the Gordian knot concerning evil is in the unhappiness (malheur) according to Simone Weil's sense (hate, opprobrium and suffering indissolubly connected) and the Suffering Servant figure. Pure evil, or "radical evil", is a challenge to metaphysics, challenge that metaphysics should have the courage to mitigate, question unceasingly, even knowing that there is not a solution for the problem of evil as the more we deal with it, the more~<br>

Abstract: Arguing that the times of scientistic criticism of psychoanalysis are past and that psychoanalysis is now open to new intellectual and scientific horizons, the article aims at showing how the recent developments of neurobiology, cognitive psychology, as well as new theories of therapeutic change in psychoanalysis support a reformulation of the psychoanalytic unconscious. The author defends that the obvious terminological confusion between the neurobiological and cognitive non-conscious on the one hand and the dynamic unconscious, on the other, require clear definitions of differences and of commonalities. Furthermore, the author also develops the idea that the dimensions of awareness and of selfascription (avowal/disavowal) help to determine what is the core of the dynamic unconscious, even though the cognitive non-conscious and the psychoanalytic unconscious overlap to a great extent. The article shows, finally, how a new interdisciplinary consensus offers now a chance for us to recognize the shortcomings of a rationalistic philosophy of mind. /// Argumentando que os tempos de uma crítica da psicanálise a partir do cientismo já passaram e que a psicanálise está agora aberta a novos horizontes intelectuais e científicos, o artigo pretende mostrar até que ponto os desenvolvimentos mais recentes da neurobiologia, da psicologia cognitiva bem como das novas teorias da mudança terapêutica em psicanálise suportam uma reformulação do inconsciente psicanalítico. O autor defende que a óbvia confusão terminológica entre o não-consciente neurobiológico e cognitivo por um lado e o inconsciente dinâmico por outro requerem definições claras das diferenças e dos aspectos comuns. Além disso, o autor desenvolve também a ideia de que as dimensões de conhecimento e de auto-atribuição (reconhecimento/nãoreconhecimento) ajudam a determinar aquilo que constitui o cerne do inconsciente dinâmico, mesmo que o não-consciente cognitivo e o inconsciente psicanalítico se sobreponham em grande m~<br>

Abstract: O presente artigo procura apresentar algumas das principais características do diálogo de Paul Ricoeur com a psicanálise freudiana no contexto da sua hermenêutica filosófica. Num primeiro momento, o artigo começa por se referir ao contacto inicial de Ricoeur com a problemática da psicanálise na obra La symbolique du mal. Num segundo momento, considerando a obra Essai sur Freud, o artigo procura situar a psicanálise como uma arqueologia do sujeito a ser conjugada com as instâncias teleológica (Hegel) e escatológica (filosofia da religião). A cumplicidade das três instâncias representa o terceiro ponto do presente ensaio: o desejo transforma-se na instância comum entre elas. O quarto ponto explicita a articulação entre o arqueo-lógico/pulsional e o teleológico/espiritual no domínio da arte: o passado pulsional é subsumido nas dimensões teleológica e escatológica do sentido. O quinto ponto trata da figura do pai presente na imagem de Deus que se encontra na Bíblia: ele regressa de um modo que está para além do mero antropomorfismo, assinalado como está pela realização de promessas futuras. Uma tal figura provoca um repensar dos afectos arcaicos referentes ao medo da punição. Um sexto ponto oferece uma apreciação geral da hermenêutica filosófica de Ricoeur e da resistência que ela propõe a todas as formas de subjectivismo. Finalmente, o artigo refere-se ainda ao modo como fé e filosofia se encontram e se afectam mutuamente ao mesmo tempo que uma e outra mantêm as suas características distintas. /// The present article seeks to present some of the main features of Paul Ricoeur's dialogue with Freudian psychoanalysis in the context of his philosophical hermeneutics.

Abstract: For over twenty years, Richard Kearney has insisted that theology must not follow traditional metaphysical itineraries along paths that offer perspectives on God as Being Itself, or as Pure Act, or as causa sui. Instead, it should chart avenues that lead through the poetics of imagination, past the synthesizing dynamics of narrative, and toward the destination of God as a God that privileges potentiality over actuality. In constant dialogue with deconstructive and postmodern theories, Kearney has developed an "onto-eschatological hermeneutics" of the "God Who May Be" that presents a post--metaphysical, perhaps even more biblical, interpretation of God as divine possibility. This paper investigates Kearney's "onto-eschatological" poetics of God as it relates to his imaginative theological method and to the Pauline notion of kenosis as the risk of divine love. It concludes by associating Kearney's theopoetics with Kierkegaard's idea of repetition as a cipher for understanding the kinetics of the God Who May be as an alternative to the traditional metaphysical structures of God as a static "I Am Who I Am." /// Desde há mais de vinte anos que Richard Kearney vem insistindo em que a teologia deveria deixar de seguir os itinerdrios metafísicos tradicionais, ou seja, deveria deixar para trás os caminhos metafísicos que oferecem perspectivas sobre Deus enquanto Ser-mesmo, Acto Puro, ou causa sui. Em vez disso, a teologia deveria antes seguir caminhos orientados por uma poética da imaginação, para além da dinâmica sintetizadora da narrativa e em direcção a uma noção de Deus que privilegia a potencialidade sobre a actualidade. Num diálogo constante com as teorias desconstructoras e pós-modernas, Richard Kearney desenvolveu uma "hermenêutica ôntico-escatológica" do "Deus que pode ser", hermenêutica essa que nos oferece uma interpretação pós-metafísica, talvez mesmo mais bíblica, de Deus como divina possibilidade.

Abstract: Memory brings the past into the present. It is a feature of human temporality, contingency, and identity. Attention to memory's psychological and social importance suggests new vistas for work in religious ethics. This essay examines four recent works on memory's importance for self-interpretation, social criticism, and public justice. My focus will be on normative questions about memory. The works under review ask whether, and on what terms, we have an obligation to remember, whether memory is linked to neighbors near and distant, how memory is related to justice and forgiveness, and whether memory sits easily with the kind of relationships that allegedly characterize life in democratic public culture.<br>

Abstract: The role of narrative in explanation has received considerable attention in most of the disciplines concerned with questions of historical process, including history, geology, psychoanalysis and palaeo-anthropology. Archaeologists, however, have been curiously reluctant to consider the proposition that their reconstructions of the past are fundamentally narrative in character. An argument is put forward for the serious study of narrative in archaeology, and three case studies from the prehistory of the New Guinea Highlands are presented in support: a brief review of the debate over the impact of sweet potato on Highland society; an analysis of the changing interpretations of the Kuk Swamp agricultural site by Jack Golson; and a summary of the role of indigenous narratives in accounting for the history of wetland drainage amongst Huli speakers in the Southern Highlands of Papua New Guinea.<br>

Abstract: Depuis la seconde moitié du xxe siècle, il s'opère un jeu de va-et-vient incessant entre le passé et le présent, entre la transcendance de la tradition ou sa rupture, en même temps qu'il se produit un phénomène d'échanges et de communications de diverses musiques du monde. De ce phénomène résultent aussi bien des chocs de culture, de savoirs que de pensées et de leur ré-interprétation ou transformation, sans oublier leur ré-appropriation par les uns et par les autres. Les musiques des uns et des autres -cultures du monde -, devenant alors le patrimoine de tous, se prêtent aux fantasmes et aux interprétations de ceux qui les reçoivent ou les perçoivent selon leur sensibilité, selon leurs affinités. C'est dans ce cadre que la musique elitiste contemporaine couvre actuellement une hétérogénéité de procédés et de formes, en ce qu'elle associe divers facteurs : écriture-oralité, mémoire collective, acquis culturel, juxtaposition ou enchevêtrement d'expressions musicales d'origines diverses (populaires, variétés, traditionnelles, savantes). Ceci appelle sa relecture à différents niveaux, par conséquent sa ré-interprétation, ainsi que l'examen approfondi de ses conditions historiques et socioculturelles de production. Pour amorcer cette nouvelle réflexion sur l'art musical elitiste contemporain, devenue actuellement plus qu'une nécessité, je propose l'expression World Music savante pour servir ici de béquille à une tentative de questionnement sur l'émergence et la consolidation d'une nouvelle identité culturelle ou tradition musicale elitiste contemporaine, celle cristallisant une réalité multiple et hétérogène. C'est aussi, pour moi, une manière de m'interroger sur la contemporanéité de la musique savante actuelle. Since the second half of the 20th century, there has been a ceaseless interplay between past and present, between transcendence of and break with tradition, together with a phenomenon of exchange and communication with diverse musics of the world, resulting in ~<br>

Abstract: In honor of the 40 th volume of Curriculum Inquiry, I begin by claiming that pursuit of questions about what is worthwhile, why, and for whose benefit is a (perhaps the) central consideration of curriculum inquiry. Drawing autobiographically from my experience as an educator during the past 40 years, I sketch reflections on curriculum books published during that time span. I situate my comments within both the historical backdrop that preceded the beginning of Curriculum Inquiry and the emergence of new curricular languages or paradigms during the late 1960s and early 1970s. I suggest that two orientations of curriculum books have provided a lively tension in curriculum literature—one expansive and the other synoptic—while cautiously wondering if both may have evolved from different dimensions of John Dewey's work. I speculate about the place of expansion and synopsis in several categories of curriculum literature: historical and philosophical; policy, professional, and popular; aesthetic and artistic; practical and narrative; critical; inner and contextual; and indigenous and global. Finally, I reconsider expansive and synoptic tendencies in light of compendia, heuristics, and venues that portray evolving curriculum understandings without losing the purport of myriad expansions of the literature.<br>

Abstract: La investigación, interpretación y escritura de la historia de la guerra civil española ha experimentado notables cambios en los últimos veinte años. Algunos de esos cambios derivan del conflicto entre el trabajo de los historiadores y los recuerdos y memorias de los actores, de los que dicen que fueron actores y de sus herederos. Como consecuencia de ese dominio del recuerdo y de la opinión, ha decrecido el interés por la reflexión metodológica y teórica, que acompañó por mucho tiempo a los estudios sobre la guerra civil, y ha ganado terreno la importancia de la subjetividad en la escritura de la historia. De todo eso, del debate sobre el pasado, de la objetividad y de la subjetividad, y de los caminos que tomamos los historiadores para abordar esas cuestiones trata este artículo. The research, construal and writing of the history of the Spanish civil war has undergone considerable changes in the last twenty years. Some of these changes stem from the conflict between the work of historians and the memories and recollections of those involved, those who say they were involved and their heirs. As a result of this dominance of memory and opinion, the interest for methodological and theoretical reflection which for so long accompanied studies on the civil war has dropped, and subjectivity in the writing of history has gained in importance. The article looks at all of this, the debate on the past, objectivity and subjectivity and the approaches taken by historians to tackle these questions.<br>

Abstract: A partir de la conception de la biographie développée par A. L. Strauss et de la philosophie du temps de G. H. Mead, trois niveaux d'organisation du temps de l'expérience biographique sont mis au jour. D'abord en examinant comment s'articulent l'irréversibilité du temps et le caractère partiellement indéterminé du passé. Toute restitution rétrospective de l'expérience biographique s'inscrit dans ce cadre. Ensuite, ce temps biographique, constitué dans l'après-coup au sein d'interactions avec autrui, se structure principalement autour des événements marquants, lesquels forment le plus souvent un calendrier privé. Mais, avant cela, ces événements ont leur temporalité propre liée à leur parcours sémantique : la constitution du sens de l'événement est ellemême un processus temporel partiellement contingent - la réduction du tranchant de l'événement ne va pas de soi - et la stabilisation d'un sens appropriable par la personne est la condition pour que l'événement qui « a été » ne « soit plus », que Von puisse tourner la page. Out of the conception of biographical time as developed by A. L. Strauss and G. H. Mead's philosophy of time, three levels for organizing the time of biographical experiences come to light. First of all, any retrospective reconstruction of a biographical experience involves examining how time's irreversibility is linked to the partly indeterminate nature of the past. Next, this biographical time, reconstructed afterwards through interactions with others, mainly takes shape around significant events, which usually form a private calendar. Previously however, these events had their own temporality linked to their semantic itinerary : the construction of an event's meaning is itself a partly contingent temporal process — reducing the cutting edge of an event cannot be taken for granted — and the stabilization of a meaning that the person can appropriate is the condition for the event that « was » to be « no longer » , so that one can be able to make af~<br>

Issue: i40039577<br>

Abstract: It would seem to the purpose here to consider the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga in his relation to his fellow-historians, Robert Fruin and Jan Romein. For in this trio Huizinga contrasted with Fruin, and in his turn Romein contrasted with Huizinga, whereas, on the other hand, in spite of their different view-points, they are at the same time connected by the plainly unbroken line of liberal adogmatism. Fruin the father of Dutch historiography, was original in his liberal adogmatism. Not a single thesis, according to him, is to be carried into safety beforehand and exempted from investigation. Nothing is to be held up for acceptance without permission for examination. In demanding such blind acceptance one would be guilty of moral constraint and mental repression, a fault according to him especially committed by the Roman Catholic Church. In the long run this liberal and adogmatic inspiration of Fruin's came to run dry. With him the devices and the technique of research became ends in themselves. Fruin rationalized this development in the thesis that the disinterestedness with which we ought to strive after the truth would be tarnished if we were to expect from scholarly historical research any contribution whatsoever to the existential unfolding of the investigating subject. Huizinga's views on the theory of history constitute a violent reaction to this view. He argues that owing to the historian's selection of his material, as well as by the ideas through which the historian comprehends the historical process, subjectivity is unavoidable. Moreover, it is desirable. It is unscholariy, Huizinga says, to assume without evidence that the purification the subject desires to undergo by his adogmatic stand, should presuppose complete elimination—impossible in itself—of any subjective element whatsoever. The idea of objectivity, he says, should be broadened from a non-subjective objectivity, without evidence too narrowly conceived, per se unattainable, into an objectivity~<br>

Abstract: What do historians do when they interpretate the past ? Narrativists hold that they organize factual statements into a meaningful whole, the story, which itself has nothing to do with past reality. Others, like David Carr and Paul Ricoeur, defend a relation between the narrative whole and the experience of time. An altogether different approach to the question of the unity of history is that of Johan Huizinga. Huizinga does not place the meaningful unity of history in the text, but in the aesthetic conception of the past. The past is not like a reservoir of signs, which acquire meaning by being put in a self-invented order, nor is it a story-like structure which can be interpretated and translated like a text. History is a cultural reality which we experience as full of symbolic meaning. Interpretation is the search ofthat meaning. The centre of historical conciousness is not in the story, but in the mental imageswe create when we see historical objects, search through documents or read a historians interpretation. In this article I try to clarify Huizinga's concept of the „historische sensatie“ by relating Huizinga's ideas to those of the Dutch writer Lodewijk van Deyssel. Secondly I try to show how the imagination of the (past) world can be regarded as a fundamental form of truth by confronting Huizinga's ideas with those of the philosopher Martin Heidegger and artists such as Albrecht Dürer and Vincent van Gogh.<br>

Abstract: Cet article s'interroge sur le statut à la fois épistémologique et ontologique d'un passé qui « a été » et dont les individus comme les sociétés retiennent le souvenir, mais qui, comme le langage ordinaire l'exprime, « n'est plus » . Toute une tradition de réflexion sur la conservation du passé par la mémoire depuis Platon et Aristote a voulu ramener la mémoire à la métaphore de l'empreinte. En revanche, cet article tente de montrer que la mémoire à plusieurs dont dépend la connaissance historique n'est pas simplement assimilable à ce topos traditionnel. Ce qui caractérise la mémoire plurielle et publique qui alimente le travail de l'historien, c'est le statut privilégié du témoignage, la possibilité de confronter différents témoignages les uns aux autres, dont dépend la crédibilité du récit historique. C'est ainsi moins la problématique d'une ressemblance entre récit et événements racontés — problématique de la trace, héritée d'une tendance traditionnelle à identifier la mémoire avec l'empreinte — que la confrontation de témoignages dans leurs différents degrés de fiabilité qui nous fait assister à l'événement raconté. Cette réflexion sur le décalage entre mémoire et histoire ouvre, dans la deuxième partie de cet article, à une analyse approfondie de la temporalité propre au passé qui fait l'objet du souvenir et conduit à une confrontation avec privilège accordé, dans la synthèse des trois modes du temps, chez saint Augustin au présent et, chez Heidegger, au futur. De cette manière, l'article tente de rééquilibrer la synthèse des temps en lui restituant un autre rapport au passé, que l'on ne saurait atteindre à partir d'Augustin ou de Heidegger. Libérer l'histoire du paradigme de la trace, de la métaphore de la mémoire comme empreinte, revient précisément à la restitution de ce mode de temporalisation du passé jusqu'ici esquivé : cet autre rapport au passé vise, conjointement à la mise en évidence du témoignage propre au travail de l'historien, à souligner la dette~<br>

Abstract: Since its first publication, A Costa dos Murmúrios has attracted the critics' attention to the paradox of the explicit denial of its own authority over the historical facts that are part of the narration and its implicit, if qualified, affirmation of the same authority. This article also focuses on the sort of subliminal tension but from the angle of the literary construction of emotions, rather than examining either the poetics of historiographic metafiction or the role of memory in the narration of the past. Analyzing various aspects of A Costa dos Murmúrios (such as the predominant points of view, the structure of the narrative, the disintegration of the characters' identities, the emotional impact of a few vivid scences, the personalization of national events), a case is made for reading this novel as an intimate chronicle of historical facts.<br>

Abstract: En janvier 2003, le Musée national des Arts d'Afrique et d'Océanie ferme ses portes. Ses collections sont transférées au quai Branly, en vue de l'ouverture d'un musée des arts et civilisations d'Afrique, d'Asie, d'Océanie et des Amériques. Différentes campagnes d'enquêtes, réalisées depuis 2000, rendent intelligible ce nouvel épisode de l'histoire mouvementée du palais de la porte Dorée. A partir du triple point de vue de l'institution muséale, du personnel et du public, ces enquêtes éclairent le processus de la fermeture d'un musée « patrimoine national » et de son nouveau destin. La réflexion porte plus précisément sur les liens apparemment contradictoires entre rupture et continuité, clôture et pérennité, pesanteurs du passé et évolution du regard. La création prochaine d'une Cité nationale de l'histoire de l'immigration peut illustrer ces paradoxes. The National Museum of African and Oceanian Arts closed in January 2003. Its collections were transferred to the future Quai Branly Museum of Arts and civilizations from Africa, Asia, Oceania and the Americas. Various survey campaigns carried out since the year 2000 explain this new episode of the eventful history of the Palais at the Porte Dorée. From the threefold point of view of the museum institution, the personnel and the visitors these surveys throw some light on the closure process of a museum belonging to the national patrimony and on its new destiny. The study is focussed on the seemingly contradictory relations between rupture and continuity, closure and durability, heaviness of the past and new look at museums. The future creation of a national city of the history of immigration illustrates these paradoxes. Das nationale Museum der Afrikanischen und Ozeanischen Künste wurde im Januar 2003 geschlossen. Seine Sammlungen wurden in dem zukünftigen Museum der Künste und Zivilizationen aus Afrika, Asia, Okeania und die Amerikas am Quai Branly gebracht.Verschiedene Erhebungen, die seit 2000 durchgeführt wurden, ~<br>

Abstract: Le titre de « Juste parmi les Nations » est décerné depuis 1963 par l'État d'Israël afin d'honorer la mémoire des non-Juifs « qui ont risqué leur vie pour venir en aide à des Juifs » . Le « Juste » reçoit un diplôme et une médaille par un représentant de l'Etat hébreu lors d'une cérémonie publique où les individus « sauvés » et leurs « sauveteurs » , ou leurs descendants, sont réunis. Cet article étudie comment, à travers cette cérémonie, s'effectue un bricolage entre des « mémoires » véhiculées par des institutions et des individus, Juifs et non-Juifs, résidant en France et en Israël. Comment s'explique le recours à une seule et même pratique de rappel public du passé par des individus dont les récits des souvenirs peuvent diverger ? The title of « Righteous among the Nations » has been attributed since 1963 by the State of Israel to honor « the high-minded gentiles who risked their lives to save Jews » . Each nomination goes with the gift of a medal and a diploma to the nominee during an official ceremony. This public event gathers « rescued people » and « rescuers » and members of each family. In this article, the author studies how, through this ceremony, a « patchwork » between different and plural memories can take place. In a common place and time, the different actors crosses institutions, individuals, Jews and non-Jews, living in France or in Israël. How can we explain the use of a single common practice of remembrance by individuals whose social characteristics are different and whose narrations of the past diverge from each other ? Der Titel « Gerechte(r) unter den Nationen » wird seit 1963 vom Staat Israel verliehen, um an Nicht-Juden zu erinnern, « die ihr Leben riskiert haben um Juden zu helfen » . Der/die Gerecht(e) erhält von einem Vertreter des Staates Israel im Rahmen einer Zeremonie und im Beisein der « Geretteten » ein Diplom und eine Medaille verliehen.

Abstract: Traditional sources of sociohistorical data capture only a narrow sense of past lifeworlds. Ethnographic accounts often preserve greater details of social practice but have less clear guidelines for use as data. We evaluate the use of hermeneutical theory as providing guidelines for a method by which ethnographies may be used as sociohistorical data. Hermeneutical analysis of ethnographic "texts" is used to reconstruct patterns of daily life in early-twentieth-century rural Appalachia. This method involves: (1) concept-critique to separate observations from the theoretical framework of the ethnographic account, and (2) validation through a logic of internal consistency and comparison. Through hermeneutical analysis, ethnographics can be made to yield observations of social relations not otherwise available. Our analysis suggests benefits and drawbacks of hermeneutical analysis of ethnographic texts.<br>

Abstract: Europe is grounded, from all sides, in traces of old inter-state and ethnic conflicts. Experience has proved that they can still be re-activated in spite of various forms of resolution in the past. History is welcome in the present, and we can observe mobilisation among agents, populations of victims, or despoiled groups, which have been forgotten or forced into silence through post-conflictual issues. Various interest groups, political parties, or states, build up memorial resources that they incorporate in their actions list of historicist strategies, with the aim of 'recycling' the representations of the symbolic pasts into contemporary political games. These mobilisations meet the reconciliation trends coming from society (for example, informal groups, NGOs, and so on), or are taken in charge by national and international institutions – which are becoming more and more routine - especially under the influence of the circulation of 'good' models of the pacification of resentments, containing a highly normative tone. The question is to know whether, in spite of the apparent heterogeneity of this phenomenon, the historicist games do constitute a common indicator of the state of political regimes, especially democracies, and also of the strength of that supranational construction called the EU. This question necessitates the revisiting of the dominant concepts in the field of the political sociology of memory. The international circulation of reconciliation grammars, and the fact that memory issues are being torn out of their national frameworks and exploited in several arenas, both internal and external, in order to increase their yield of political resources, are further evidence that the paradigms heretofore dominant in the social sciences are now at an impasse.<br>

Abstract: Cette note de synthèse souligne la spécificité de la discipline enseignée. L'histoire scolaire occupe une position originale dans le champ des didactiques par la complexité de ses références (production savante, auto-référence scolaire et usages publics de l'histoire). Tendus entre une transmission de connaissances consensuelles et la recherche d'une posture critique, les objets d'histoire enseignés demeurent soumis à des questionnements renouvelés au gré de la demande sociale comme le montrent les récents débats autour des questions mémorielles vives et concurrentes. L'histoire enseignée apparaît ainsi comme un mixte articulant représentations sociales, savoirs privés et connaissances validées. Depuis une quinzaine d'années, des travaux ont permis de mieux cerner le « penser en histoire » et les processus cognitifs spécifiques en jeu dans la classe (temps historique, conceptualisation, problématisation, construction de schemes explicatifs). Des recherches contextualisées ont permis d'explorer les pratiques professionnelles effectives et d'en modéliser le fonctionnement « normal » : une discipline qui privilégie la transmission de savoirs disant la réalité du passé et attachée à la neutralité du texte enseigné ; une discipline qui peine à mettre en cohérence des finalités intellectuelles ambitieuses (outiller le citoyen actif dans la cité de demain) et des activités dans la classe souvent cantonnées à la mémorisation, au repérage et à la catégorisation. Aussi voit-on se dessiner dans les travaux actuels, une problématique centrée sur les écarts entre les intentions et les pratiques. En articulant la notion de soumission aux règles du « contrat didactique » avec les autres modèles théoriques des sciences humaines et sociales mobilisés au sein des équipes de recherche, les travaux menés de manière encore trop dispersée, laissent apparaître des acquis importants qui pourraient être pris en compte dans la formation des enseignants This paper underlines the specificity o~<br>

Author(s): MORAWSKI WITOLD<br>
Abstract: On the assumption that harmonization of the allocative efficiency of market, state redistributionism and the social values of solidarity and social justice is the key to successful systemic transformation, the author analyzes systemic change from the institutional perspective. Thus he is able to interpret the new systemic rules in their interaction with the environment and to interpret change in evolutionary terms. The analytic design has seven components: new rules, their intrinsic domestic sources, the need to adjust structurally to the West, environmental contingencies (values, actors and their methods of operation, public or private space, time and circumstances), the mechanisms of emergence of the new system (via establishment of new institutions, deinstitutionalization, reinstitutionalization etc.), impact of the heritage of the past, and, finally, the effectiveness of the new institutions (the state, the economy and civil society). Both in the analysis of universal challenges and the analysis of Polish problems, the author emphasizes the need to develop adaptive rationality, which he views as a superior, synthetic form of overcoming the dilemmas posed by the systemic transformation.<br>

Author(s): VarineAbstract: This ethnographic study of the creation of a museum in Le Creusot (France) provides an analysis of the heritage industry that emerged in the wake of the demise of a family company around which the town was built. This museum was a reaction to the passing of an age when industrial and urban environments were intrinsically linked. Through this description of how the past is collected and recollected in a museum, this article attempts to determine if this duty of remembrance is not, to a certain extent, a strategy of forgetfulness. Is cultural regeneration-the staging of history fading into oblivion-our society's sole response to industrial regeneration?<br>

Issue: i40059165<br>
Date: 11 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Larkin Craig<br>
Abstract: This article seeks to address how Lebanese youth are dealing with the legacy of civil war (1975-90), given the national backdrop of official silence, persisting injustice, and competing memory discourses. Drawing on Marianne Hirsch's concept of postmemory, it explores the memory of a generation of Lebanese who have grown up dominated not by traumatic events but by narrative accounts of events that preceded their birth. This residual form of memory carries and connects with the pain of others, suffusing temporal frames and liminal positions. The article examines how postmemory is mediated and transformed through the mnemonic lenses of visual landscapes and oral narratives. Consideration is given to the dynamic production of "memoryscapes"—memories of violence localized in particular sites—and to narrative constructions of the past implicated in the ongoing search for meaning, historical truth, and identity. This article seeks to challenge pervasive notions of Lebanese postwar amnesia and of a generational detachment from the residual effects and future implications of war recollections.<br>

Abstract: As most European societies have struggled to find a consensus for working up their World War Two past, former forced labourers often had to endure ensuing societal initiatives to suppress or instrumentalise their memories or to see them tied to overreaching political or ethical imperatives. This article tries to trace the whereabouts of these memories in societal and individual perspectives. First, forced labour in Nazi Germany can be seen as part of a forced migration experience. Second, the memories of Nazi forced labour have often been used to represent the experiences of collaboration and defeat in World War Two in the respective countries. Third, national political and moral economies have shaped the societal status of former forced labourers' memories. These memories have hardly found their proper place in most of the respective national pasts.<br>

Abstract: Attention to bodies has transformed the study of religion in the past thirty years, aiding the effort to overcome the discipline's Protestant biases by shifting interest from beliefs to practices. And yet much of this work has unwittingly perpetuated an individualist notion of the religious subject. Although religionists are now well aware that bodies cannot be studied apart from the social forces that shape them, all too often the religious subject stands alone in a crowd, participating in communal rituals, subject to religious authorities and disciplinary practices, but oddly detached from intimate relationships. In this article, I first argue that the turn to the body was motivated by what it appeared to reject: theoretical questions about subjectivity. I then seek to challenge prevailing trends by arguing that these same theoretical insights should now prod us to attend to the import of intimacy and personal relationships.<br>

Abstract: As oral historians, we devote a great deal of time to painstakingly designing our projects, cognizant of the fact that our research requires us to interact with human beings in often intimate ways. For this same reason, though, our careful methodology and meticulously designed projects are constantly being tested. This article is a reflection on some of the ethical and methodological challenges that the authors faced during their life story interviews with Holocaust survivors in Montreal, Canada. In particular, it explores three major themes: the elaborate process of learning to "share authority" and build trust with interviewees; the limitations of "deep listening" and their implications; and the struggle to deal with contentious politics, such as perceived racism, that emerged out of some interviews. Reflection on these methodological and ethical challenges not only opens up a wider and important discussion among researchers about how practice relates to theory but also teaches us about our interviewees. For example, what does an interviewee's refusal to engage deeply about his or her past tell us about how they formed their identity in the aftermath of mass violence? Challenges, such as this one, are part of the story. They shed light on questions of narrative formation, the identity politics that result from survival, and how individual memory interacts with dominant narratives about atrocity. They force us to recognize that both our interviewees—and ourselves—are human beings, and not just collections of stories.<br>

Abstract: Cet article propose une réflexion sur la place de la diachronie et de la synchronie dans la recherche sociale, en partant de l'une des contradictions indépassables pour toute appréhension du temps. Celui-ci peut être pensé sous l'angle de la concomitance (dont chacun a fait l'expérience et qui revient à penser le temps comme une «succession de présents différents») ou sous l'angle des processus (c'est-à-dire de la modification permanente des conditions de l'expérience en fonction d'une differentiation entre passé, présent et futur). Nous nous interrogerons sur ce que signifie travailler dans la diachronie ou dans la synchronie, en soulignant notamment la difficulté à distinguer clairement les deux approches: de nombreuses recherches habituellement pensées comme diachroniques ne le sont peut-être pas et, réciproquement, des approches pensées comme synchroniques s'articulent presque nécessairement avec une pensée des processus. This article proposes a reflection on the place of the synchrony-diachrony distinction in social research. The understanding of time is structured by a recurring contradiction: time can be thought of in terms of "concomitant experiences" (time appears in that perspective as a "succession of different presents") or in terms of "processes" (insisting on the permanent modifications of social life on the basis of a differentiation between past, present and future). I will try to present as clearly as possible diachronic and synchronie approaches, before stressing the difficulty to separate them: some researches usually thought of as diachronic might include other dimensions, while conversely, investigations presented as synchronie almost necessarily articulate processual perspectives.<br>

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i40072402<br>
Date: 8 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Ally Shireen<br>
Abstract: Despite its manifest, if largely undocumented, histories of menacing violence and perilous politics, the thrust of popular memory in the former apartheid bantustan of KaNgwane insists that it was a peaceful, even apolitical, place. In a contemporary South African memorial culture that idealizes memories of victimization by (and resistance to) apartheid and its political violence, why would some in KaNgwane persistently narrate the past through tropes of peaceful order and disavowals of the political? Are these mnemonic effacements in KaNgwane best conceived of as forms of forgetting? This article challenges such a proposition. First, it recovers the hitherto unrecognized politics and violence in KaNgwane, in part (and paradoxically) out of the very same narratives that deny such histories. Second, it explores the dialectical co-implication of remembering and forgetting, and of memory and history, in KaNgwane's supposed anamnesis. And third, it proposes that the occlusions and assurances of memory in KaNgwane are structured by a localized semiotics in which politics is retrospectively signified by order and restraint, and negated by disorder and revolt. In this ' memory work', KaNgwane's past is anaesthetized of violence, and heroism is recovered not from rehearsals of victimization and resistance, but from memories of pacified civility instead. Malgré son passé manifeste (bien que non documenté pour l'essentiel) de violence menaçante et de politique périlleuse, la mémoire populaire de l'ancien bantoustan de KaNgwane sous le régime de l'apartheid insiste, dans ses grandes lignes, sur le caractère paisible et apolitique du lieu. Dans une culture de mémoire sud-africaine contemporaine qui idéalise les mémoires de victimisation par (et de résistance à) l'apartheid et sa violence politique, pourquoi certains à KaNgwane persistent-ils à narrer le passé à travers des tropes d'ordre paisible et de désaveu du politique? Faut-il concevoir ces effacements mnémoniques au KaNgwa~<br>

Author(s): PURI MICHAEL J.<br>
Abstract: When conceived as the presence of the past, memory can be said to pervade the music of Maurice Ravel. The number and range of these acts of musical memory -including illeces modelled on the medieval ballade, the Renaissance chanson, the Baroque tombeau, the Classical sonatine and the Romantic poème, among others -seem at first glance to testify to a uncomplicated relation between past and present which, upon closer review, is revealed to be problematic. One of the most complex and captivating artistic testaments to what Andreas Huyssen has called 'twilight memory' -not only in Ravel's music, but in Western modernism as a whole - is the eighth and final waltz of his illano suite Valses nobles et sentimentales (1911). In this waltz, which Ravel entitled 'Éilllogue', the hope of making the past present is reborn with each of its numerous thematic recollections, only to be dashed repeatedly by the melancholy knowledge of its impossibility. In the present study, affinities between the Éilllogue's musical behaviours and philosophical accounts of memory by Bergson, Jankélévitch and Nora are explored, along with the compositional precedents established by Beethoven, Schumann, Debussy and others.<br>

Abstract: Focusing on the instrumental ensemble genre of nanguan, as played in contemporary Taiwan, I first discuss the experiences of ten musicians in entering this tradition to show changes in the learning environment over the past three generations. Second, I examine how beginners study singing prior to the acquisition of instrumental experience, looking also at the roles of memorization, enculturation and socialization. Meanwhile, in order to balance generalization and individuality, I use my personal experience as a case study to illustrate how learning processes develop from the day-to-day interactions of musicians.<br>

Abstract: This paper reviews a body of data that identifies underlying influences that have contributed to an evolving change in American Psychiatry toward a more positive and receptive stance toward religion and spirituality over the past three decades. This development, surprising in light of the remedicalization of psychiatry and its predominantly neuro-biological orientation, is attributed to five foundational ideas that have helped to leverage this change. These are significance of culture, creative power of ritual, psychic function of belief, neuro-biology of spirituality, and relevance of recovery narratives. The impact of these factors for psychiatric assessment and treatment is described, as well as the contribution of the Oskar Pfister legacy and award to the ongoing dialogue between religion and psychiatry. Adapted from the American Psychiatric Association's 2011 Oskar Pfister Lecture in Religion and Psychiatry.<br>

Abstract: Any praxis is inscribed in time. To what extent does man's perception of time leave an inprint on Saussurian 'langue' ? Revisiting a well-beaten track in linguistic studies, we propose to give this farreaching question a partial answer concerning the opposition between French imparfait and passé simple. We first capture the opposition between those two tenses in a passive way, in which man as a subject (subjected to...) bears witness to the flow of time from future to past; we then capture the opposition in an active way, in which man as a project bears witness to the flow of time from past to future. This two-fold representation bears on the opposition between imperfect and simple past. It is shown next that linguistic theories view tenses as markers of localisation in time whereas verb forms also help mark how the time implied by the process is viewed, what orientation is given to it. Our contention is that implied time is represented in a downward fashion (particularisation) with imperfect and in an upward fashion (generalisation) with simple past.<br>

Abstract: The word "end" was not written by Hugo at the end of Toilers of the Sea; this is because his ending, within the precise delimitations suggested here, does not need it, and might even be spoilt by the word. Indeed, it leads narrative desire and characters to an end which, as in music, resonates with the past reading — while at the same time it metaphorises both the act of writing and the act of reading as it comes to its last words.<br>

Abstract: The issue is the manner in which the reading of literature can constitute an everyday existential resource, without construing this use of reading in an excessively instrumental manner. The key resides in the formal characters rendering a literary element notable, memorable, and/or quotable, both privately and collectively, inasmuch as the orientation of these elements is the becoming of the reader(s), not their past. La question est celle de la façon dont la littérature peut représenter une ressource dans la vie quotidienne, sans concevoir un tel usage de la lecture littéraire comme purement instrumental. Un tel usage de la lecture se trouve lorsque les caractéristiques formelles qui rendent, individuellement ou collectivement, notable, mémorable ou citable tel ou tel passage littéraire s'accompagnent d'une orientation vers l'avenir du lecteur, et non vers la rétrospection.<br>

Abstract: Carlo Ginzburg, in 1988, considered present historiography as beholden to a regimen of truth by quotation that had distanced itself from the task of making the past present to make it believable, a position he was to nuance; but the distinction between the two modes is a valid one for analyzing the writing of history -if analysis reveals their intertwining in ways that ultimately open out onto the relationship between history and fiction, whose history is still not told. En 1988 Carlo Ginzburg considérait que l'historiographie moderne se soumettait à un régime de la preuve par la citation documentaire qui l'éloignait de la tâche de rendre l'histoire présente pour la rendre crédible ; s'il devait plus tard nuancer cela, la distinction constitue une entrée valide pour analyser l'écriture de l'histoire - si l'analyse révèle plutôt leur imbrication selon des modes qui ouvrent sur le rapport entre fiction et histoire, dont l'histoire reste à faire.<br>

Abstract: S'appuyant sur un corpus de textes adolescents adressés au site Internet www.filsantejeunes.com, notre analyse tente de cerner le problème de l'indicibilité du sensible, puisque la plupart de ces textes se limitent à élaborer un discours sur le corps, ses difficultés à être la source de bien-être, à se conformer aux normes de beauté, et n'abordent pas le phénomène, l'expérience de perception du monde. La théorie des instances proposée par Jean-Claude Coquet permet de rendre compte de cette impossibilité de dire le sensible, laquelle serait due à une mise en tension conflictuelle des deux instances du non-sujet et du sujet. Ce conflit sans issue peut aboutir à des comportements de boulimie et/ou d'anorexie, aux conséquences graves pour la santé, voire la vie du sujet. La psychothérapie, dans ces cas-là, devrait viser une réconciliation des instances. Ces textes adolescents constituant des exemples d'écriture autobiographique, genre discursif très prisé à l'adolescence, permettent aussi de contribuer à l'analyse de la genèse de ce genre littéraire, où s'impose la reprise différée, par le sujet adulte voire vieillissant, d'expériences anciennes de l'instance non-sujet, expériences corporelles de prise directe avec le monde. This analysis, based on a corpus of texts by teenagers posted on www.filsantejeunes. com, tries to take the measure of the issue of the impossibility of expressing in language the experience of sensing the world -since most of these texts are content to limit themselves to elaborating discourses about the body, its difficulties at being a source of happiness, at conforming to norms of beauty, and do not deal with the phenomenon, namely the experience of perceiving the world. The theory of instances, or of the grounding of utterance, elaborated by Jean-Claude Coquet, can explain this impossibility of expressing in language the experience of sensing the world: it is due to a conflict between the two instances, the grounding in the subject or in the no~<br>

Abstract: In the quest for a more sustainable environment, there appears to be a need to confront issues of tradition vs. modernity and culture vs. technology in a world where boundaries once dividing these issues are collapsing, and differences once separating them are disappearing. This study demonstrates, through examination of a series of built examples, the successful integration of tradition and modernity as they are reflected in Muslim cultures. In practice, the notion of culture and technology is addressed through the built context, ultimately establishing the identity of a society through its architecture. This paper argues for the preservation of a culture through understanding the level of symbolism established in its built environment: the higher the level of symbolism, the further detached an artifact becomes from its place of origin. This research focuses on possible scenarios involving the conscious application of past and present typologies of form and technology in search of a recognizable cultural identity.<br>

Abstract: This article challenges the assumption that "tradition" is a quality pertaining chiefly to objects, stylistic conventions, or the use of materials. Equally, it refutes the notion that tradition is merely the perpetuation of ritualized practices or skilled techniques. By considering the complex relation between vocational migration, heritage, and identity among contemporary fine woodworkers at London's Building Crafts College, it argues that tradition is a state of mind — a recurring nostalgia for an idealized past, or the desire for a Utopian future. More specifically, the article investigates a "tradition of longing" for engagement in nonalienating modes of production, aesthetic work, and an authentic way of living.<br>

Abstract: What I consider in this paper are various forms of government, various technologies and discursive regimes of government that are in common use today. What interests me are the categories and tools, practical dispositifs and languages that developed over the last decades 'to constitute, define, organize, and instrumentalize the strategies that individuals, acting freely, may use to deal with one another' (Foucault). The paper considers first the neo-liberal wish to reassert the individual as alone in responsibility for his/her own life after the unfortunate digression into Welfare Statism and Keynesian economics, source of all ills. It then focuses on some material and social technologies that encourage people to accept full and complete 'self-sovereignty'. This section leads to a discussion on the new demands (and resistance) society imposed on this liberal normative ideal. It notably considers the growing demands to 'participate' in decision processes and to be environmentally friendly. In section "Les Mots et Les Choses: A New Discursive Regime", it considers the discursive regime that progressively took shape and which currently permeates international governance bodies of all stripes—from the World Bank to the Conference of Parties for Climate Change. In the final section, it comes back to the initial question and considers what these changes actually mean for the democratic order as constituted over the past 250 years.<br>

Abstract: En su autobiografia, Rigoberta, la nieta de los mayas, Menchú recobra la dolorosa memoria de sus antepasados mayas y articula su trauma personal, que habiamos visto en su testimonio Me llamo Rigoberta Menchú y asi me nació la conciencia. A través de la postmemoria, la activista guatemalteca se conecta con la herencia transgeneracional de su comunidad, así como narra su propio pasado por la recuperación imaginativa de la memoria. Se confirma de esta manera que la memoria y la postmemoria como esfuerzo de creación son elementos vitales en la reconstrucción del pasado. In her autobiography, Crossing Borders, Rigoberta Menchu revisits the painful memory of her Mayan ancestors as well as articulates her own personal trauma as seen in her testimony I, Rigoberta Menchu: An Indian Woman in Guatemala. Through postmemory the Guatemalan activist is able to connect with the transgenerational legacy of her community as well as narrate her own past through the imaginative recovery of memory. In this way, she confirms that memory and postmemory as a creative endeavor are vital components of the reconstruction of the past.<br>

Abstract: El artículo propone una lectura de la novela de Antonio Gil, Cosa mentale (1994), como construcción artificiosa del pasado a través de la puesta en juego de los procedimientos pictóricos aplicados a la poesía. El dictum horaciano ut pictura poiesis será revisado a partir del registro delirante y experimental de una novela que indaga en las maneras de configurar el pasado histórico recurriendo a temporalidades alternativas al tiempo de la modernidad histórica. De esta manera, según un criterio analógico, es posible identificar retóricas de la imagen y de la representación a nivel narrativo, en correspondencia con la narratividad pictórica. Finalmente, se entrega una interpretación sobre la perspectiva transhistórica del narrador que permitiría entender las anacronías narrativas como rupturas entre tiempo de la modernidad y tiempo del mito. This article proposes a reading of the Antonio Gil's novel, Cosamentale (1994), as an artificial construction of the past through the pictorial procedures applied to poetry. Horatio's dictum ut pictura poiesis will be revised on the basis of this delirious and experimental novel that explores a ways to configure the historic past resorting to alternatives temporalities in respect of historical modernity time. In this way, according to an analogical criterion, we identified rhetorics of the image and the representation in the narrative level, in correspondence with the pictorial narrative. Finally, we give an interpretation about the transhistoric perspective of the narrator that explains narrative anachronisms between the time of modernity and the time of the myth.<br>

Abstract: The aim of the paper is to consider such ethnolinguistic categories as magic, connotation, cognitive blending as possible keys to the following questions: How is it possible that we can perfectly adopt different representations of the past and internalize them as our past? How can we reconcile different representations of the past and how is it possible that diverse representations of the past merge in one social memory? Such amalgamations of various forms of representations and diverse scales of objectification can be clarified by means of the theory of magic, by means of the law of resemblance, and the law of contiguity. Such considerations are supported here by empirical study of the construction of social memories in Teschen Silesia, which was divided between Poland and Czechoslovakia in 1920. On both sides of the new border different state institutions emerged and influenced local memories.<br>

Date: 1 1, 2013<br>
Author(s): KARKOWSKA MARTA<br>
Abstract: The goal of this article is to review the possibilities and limitations of applying Aleida and Jan Assmann's concept to the study of local memory, using as an example the memory of inhabitants of the Polish town of Olsztyn. The author first briefly presents selected key premises of Aleida and Jan Assmann's concept of cultural memory. She then addresses the question of how the Assmanns' concept is received and interpreted in Poland. Discussion of these issues leads to an analysis of the advantages and difficulties of applying the two German scholars' theoretical proposals to the study of memory in local communities. The author refers to the case of a moderately aggregated, urban society with a complicated multiethnic past. Her conclusions concern the challenges scholars face in adopting Aleida and Jan Assmann's theoretical perspective for studying memory and local communities in this part of Europe.<br>

Author(s): Clayton Cam<br>
Abstract: Sartre's theory of the imagination is important both as an alternative to the idea that the imagination consists of images contained somehow in the mind - the "illusion of immanence" — and as an early formulation of Sartre's conception of consciousness. In this paper I defend Sartre's theory of imaginative consciousness against some of its critics. I show how difficulties with his theory parallel a perennial problem in Sartre-interpretation, that of understanding how consciousness can negate its past and posit possibilities beyond the facticity of its situation. In this short essay I will not provide a detailed exposition of Sartre's theory of the imagination. Rather, I provide the basis of an interpretation of this theory that emphasizes the role that the past plays in imaginative consciousness.<br>

Abstract: The article advances an interpretation of the self as an imaginary object. Focusing on the relationship between selfhood and memory in Sartre's The Transcendence of the Ego, I argue that Sartre offers useful resources for thinking about the self in terms of narratives. Against interpretations that hold that the ego misrepresents consciousness or distorts it, I argue that the constitution of the ego marks a radical transformation of the conscious field. To prove this point, I turn to the role of reflection and memory in the creation of the self. Reflection and memory weave past, present and future into a consistent and meaningful life story. This story is no other than the self. I propose to understand the self as a fictional or imaginary entity, albeit one that has real presence in human life.<br>

Abstract: After a popular uprising which led to the toppling of the authoritarian regime of Ben Ali, Tunisia has entered a period of transition towards democracy. But this period proves to be thorny, difficult and not bereft of huge challenges. But this is almost common to all transitions. This paper seeks to analyze other historical experiences of transitions towards democracy (in Latin America, Southern European countries, Eastern and Central European countries). The purpose is not to look for models to be reproduced in Arab countries, but to draw lessons from past experiences in order to avoid unforeseen traps, to shorten the period of transition, and to lessen the social and economic cost of uncertainty. Après un soulèvement populaire qui a permis de mettre un terme au régime autoritaire de Ben Ali, la Tunisie est entrée dans une phase de transition vers la démocratie. Cette phase s'avère épineuse, difficile et pleine de défis. Mais c'est le propre de toutes les transitions. Ce texte essaye dès lors d'analyser d'autres expériences historiques (en Amérique Latine, Europe du Sud, Europe centrale et orientale) de transition vers la démocratie, non pas pour rechercher des modèles à copier mais pour y puiser des leçons utiles susceptibles de faire éviter aux pays du printemps arabe les pièges imprévus, raccourcir la période de transition et diminuer le coût social et économique de l'incertitude.<br>

Abstract: Dans l'article qu'on va lire, Ludivine Bantigny retrace la généalogie du concept d'historicité, ses différentes déclinaisons et ses enjeux pour les sciences sociales en général et l'histoire en particulier. Ce texte propose d'examiner les definitions de la notion d'«historicités», d'explorer les usages qui en sont faits ou pourraient en être faits par les sciences sociales en général et par l'histoire en particulier, et de réfléchir à ce qui a été nommé le «présentisme». Si la définition est loin d'être figée, on peut entendre par historicité la capacité qu'ont les acteurs d'une société ou d'une communauté donnée à inscrire leur présent dans une histoire, à le penser comme situé dans un temps non pas neutre mais signifiant, par la conception qu'ils s'en font, les interprétations qu'ils s'en donnent et les récits qu'ils en forgent. L'historicité suppose une conscience mouvante et changeante du passé et du futur, façonnée à l'aune du présent. Il est dès lors important d'insister sur la pluralité des modes d'historicités et done sur leur coexistence. Par là, il s'agit de considérer les formes d'historicités dominantes et les résistances qui peuvent aussi lui être opposées. This text analyzes the definitions of the notion "historicities", explores how the social sciences in general and history in particular uses or could use it and considers what has been called "presentism". While the definition is not at all fixed, historicity can be understood as how the players of a society or a community fit their present into a history, how they think it as situated in a time that is not neutral but signifying, by the conception they have of it, the interpretations they give and the accounts they make of it. Historicity implies a moving and changing consciousness of the past and the future, shaped by the present. It is thus important to emphasize the plurality of types of historicities and thus of their coexistence. The forms of dominant historicities and the resistance that can b~<br>

Author(s): Bantigny Ludivine<br>
Abstract: La coexistence de différentes manières de penser l'historicité - qu'elles soient, en particulier, cycliques ou linéaires - est évidente dans l'histoire longue de la Chine et, plus généralement, de l'Asie orientale. C'est ce que démontre l'article de Prasenjit Duara qui, après une réflexion sur les débats historiques et philosophiques portant sur le temps et l'histoire, insiste sur la manière dont les circulations transnationales affectent profondément les formes de l'historicité. Ici, c'est le rapport entre nation et conscience historique qui est examiné à nouveaux frais. Les récits du passé sont peut-être nécessaires à toutes les organisations sociales qui cherchent à se constituer comme telles. Cependant, avant l'apparition de l'Étatnation, ces récits non seulement englobaient des différences et des contestations, mais ils entretenaient aussi une relation à un temps et des idéaux universels ou cosmologiques. L'émergence de la modernité contribua au désenchantement du politique, parallèlement à l'avènement d'États capitalistes en concurrence, qui cherchèrent a mobiliser toutes les formes de ressources et de biopouvoir. Ces histoires de l'État et de la civilisation, linéaires et réifiées, furent essentielles dans cette mobilisation. Un bon exemple peut en être donné avec les récits historiques eurasiens et la manière dont ils circulèrent. Cet article les examine et s'intéresse notamment aux modalités de l'historicité en Asie orientale, en étant attentif à leurs circulations et en insistent sur les voies, à la fois globales et régionales, qu'elles empruntèrent. Leurs forces furent converties en récits historiques linéaires de nations souveraines engagées dans des interrelations de compétitions agressives. Narratives of the past are perhaps necessary in all collectivities that seek to constitute themselves as such. Before the modern nation-state, however, these narratives not only embedded differences and contestations, they also bore a relationship to universal or co~<br>

Abstract: Ludivine Bantigny revisite les événements de 1968 au prisme de l'historicité. Soulignant combien le temps fut alors objet de luttes et de concurrences politiques, elle nous fait revivre l'intensité du présent, ce sentiment d'accélération tant individuel que collectif qu'éprouverent les protagonistes, la présence du passé, celui des révolutions, de la Commune ou des gréves de 1936, et un horizon qui s'ouvrait sur maints possibles. Cet article entend revisiter l'événement Mai-Juin 68 à l'aune de la conscience historique qu'en ont ses différents acteurs et du rapport aux temporalités imbriquées qu'ils entretiennent alors. Il évoque l'attention particulière prêtée au temps vécu comme un «temps de qualité», entre sentiment de l'urgence et impression de vivre un moment suspendu. Pour autant, ces temporalités elles-mêmes sont replacées dans la conscience que l'histoire est en train de se faire et qu'elle nécessite de réfléchir à cette condition historique, où le passé est un héritage pour mieux penser l'avenir. De fait, les références historiques mobilisées ici n'ont rien de figé; elles signent bien plutôt un rendez-vous de l'histoire et de l'événement, ce qui en fait un passé vivant. This article revisits May-June 1968 in terms of the various players' historical consciousness of the event and their relationship to the interwoven temporalities they had. It deals with the particular attention given to lived time as "quality time", between a feeling of urgency and the impression of living a suspended moment. Nevertheless, these very temporalities are part of the consciousness that history is going through, and it is necessary to think about this historical condition in which the past is an inheritance that makes thinking the future better. Indeed, the historical references used here are not cut and dried: they mark an appointment with history and with the event, which makes it a living past.<br>

Issue: i40104982<br>
Date: 6 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Bohnekamp Dorothea<br>
Abstract: On sait combien l'Allemagne fédérale a construit sa légitimité démocratique sur le traitement de la mémoire de la Shoah. Mais comment la communauté juive présente dans le pays a-t-elle reçu cette mémoire ? Cet article tente de répondre a cette question en s'appuyant notamment sur la presse judéo-allemande et en dressant une chronologie depuis la guerre. Dorothea Bohnekamp montre comment, apres la désillusion des communautes juives apres 1945 face à l'absence d'intérêt manifeste par les autorités à leur endroit, 1952 représente un tournant, quand l'attention portee à la vie juive en Allemagne devient un critère d'évaluation de la democratisation de la RFA. L'après-1989 constitue une nouvelle étape, avec l'arrivée massive de Juifs russophones renouvelant la vie communautaire. Toutefois les debats passionnés sur le Musée juif de Berlin ou sur le Mémorial de l'Holocauste invitent à se demander dans quelle mesure les Juifs vivant en Allemagne ne sont pas en définitive dépossédés de la mémoire de la Shoah au profit des descendants des bourreaux. Centrale au sein de la culturelle mémorielle allemande, la mémoire de la Shoah reste un imperatif politique fort en République fédérale allemande, dont Pidentite democratique s'est construite en opposition absolue au nazisme. Après le déni des crimes nazis dans l'après-guerre, la réactivation du passé depuis les annees 1970 participe d'une représentation politique du judaïsme considérée comme symbole de la culture républicaine du pays. Or, les nombreuses expressions de la culture mémorielle en Allemagne (musées, mémoriaux, etc.) ont souvent été sujet à polémique, dans la mesure où leur utilisation publique reflète aussi la difficulté à imprimer une logique collective à des souvenirs traumatiques irréductiblement individuels. Si les communautés judéo-allemandes renaissent depuis la Réunification, elles ne se sentent pas toujours pleinement représentees par la culture memorielle officielle et restent réfractaires a toute instrumenta~<br>

Abstract: In societies coming to terms with historical injustices, public apology has recently emerged as a potent trend. This is particularly true of France, where the state served as a catalyst for a wave of public apologies for acts of intolerance committed during the Second World War. Following Jacques Chirac's 1995 official apology for Vichy's anti-Semitic policies, various groups in civil society publicly atoned for their particular Vichy roles in discrimination against Jews: the medical profession, the law bar, the Catholic Church, and the police. How does public apology, as distinct from court trials, historical commissions, and reparations, affect contemporary France's reconciliation with its past? This article also analyzes how apologizing for Vichy has created demand for an official French apology for the Algerian War. By 2006, the politics of memory in French society decidedly shifted attention from Vichy to post-colonialism: in both cases, the apology turn imposes new dynamics of remembering and forgetting.<br>

Abstract: Over the past few years there has been an increasing interest in the use of psychoanalytic ideas within a sociological framework These ideas have been largely developed within sociological theory rather than practice. There does, however, seem to be a new frame of thought and practice emerging which we could term psycho-social studies, perhaps even a new discipline in its own right In this article I will discuss the development of the use of psychoanalytic ideas around sociological issues, explore some of the tensions that have arisen and evaluate the implications for methodological practice.<br>

Author(s): Marx John<br>
Abstract: The seventeenth century was not finished in eighteenth-century England. The ghosts of the 'Great Rebellion' continued to haunt Hanoverian England as political groupings struggled for some kind of control of representations of the past. One of the explicit purposes of Hume's "History of England" (1752-64) was to exorcize these ghosts of the past and to delegitimize the political memories of Whigs, Tories and Jacobites, churchmen and dissenters. This article focuses on the account of the puritans in the "History of England." In significant ways this contravenes Hume's own agenda. Out of his anti-puritan history there emerges the negative figure of the radical political intellectual which was subsequently appropriated by Burke and by wider forces of political reaction in England in the 1790s. Far from escaping the obsolete antagonisms of the past which continued to shape Hanoverian political hostilities, Hume in his "History of England" contributed to their reproduction and even intensification from the 1770s.<br>

Author(s): van Alphen Ernst<br>
Abstract: The difference between literal and figurative language becomes evident by comparing the Dutch novel The Journey of the Customs Officer to Bentheim (1983) by Willem Brakman with Proust's Remembrance of Things Past. Certain passages in the Dutch novel can be read either as literal or as metaphorical descriptions. The reader having a reading attitude which activates that frame of "reality" which is strictly separated from the frame of reference called "fiction and representation" will read crucial passages in this novel figuratively. The reader for whom fiction and reality are inseparable and situated on the same ontological level will read them literally. Both reading attitudes, the modernist aqd postmodernist ones, are personified in the two main characters of the novel. This twofold reading implies a critique of Hrushovski's descriptive method for the analysis of metaphor which is used throughout this paper. If the position of frames of reference is undefined in his theory, in his interpretive practice it becomes clear that for him frames of reference are situated in the text. Yet The Journey's ambiguity as to whether one or two frames is applicable undermines this position. It is up to the reader to differentiate or not hierarchically between reality and fiction.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell-Wiley Publishing<br>
Issue: i40115211<br>

Author(s): Marcus Ruth Barcan<br>
Abstract: In this paper some claims of Professor Ricoeur are challenged. (1) It is pointed out on historical grounds that counter to Professor Ricoeur's claim, most past philosophies are displaced, or ignored. The surviving canon is small and very selective. There is, therefore, substantial agreement on the large corpus which is rejected. (2) It is also argued that Professor Ricoeur's contrast between philosophy and the sciences is too sharp since in the history of modern sciences there are always conflicting theories existing in parallel. However, it is the case that in philosophy standards of "acceptability" are looser and not the rigorous ones of science. A philosophical theory may be appreciated for the problems it discloses, the richness and subtlety of its arguments, its strategies and the like despite acknowledged failings. Appreciation of incompatible theories is not irrational. (3) The claim is rejected that the seeming irrationality is resolved by viewing each system as wholly autonomous. (4) The apparent restriction of philosophy by Professor Ricoeur to global systems is also questioned. L'auteur conteste quelques affirmations du prof. Ricoeur. (1) Elle montre, sur des bases historiques, que beaucoup de philosophies passées sont écartées ou ignorées. Le canon retenu est petit et très sélectif. Il y a donc un accord substantiel quant au vaste corpus qui est rejeté. (2) Elle montre aussi que le contraste que le professeur Ricoeur établit entre philosophie et sciences est trop abrupt, puisqu'il y a toujours eu, dans l'histoire de la science moderne, des théories opposées qui coexistaient. Toutefois, il est vrai qu'en philosophie, les standards d' «acceptabilité» sont plus lâches et diffèrent de ceux, plus rigoureux, de la science. Une philosophie peut être appréciée pour les problèmes qu'elle pose, pour la richesse et la subtilité de ses arguments, ses stratégies ou d'autres choses semblables et ceci en dépit de ses insuffisances notoires. Il n'est pas irrationnel d'a~<br>

Abstract: In a first section, the renewed interest in historical consciousness among social scientists and historians is discussed, which resulted in a clearer understanding of how historical memory functions and of the diverse ways in which historians use references to the past. Against this background, Paul's use of history in the letter to the Galatians is analysed in a second section. The apostle is not interested in recording the past, but develops, in the light of his own experiences in preaching the gospel among gentiles, an alternative perspective on Israel's past. By taking the figure of Abraham as his point of departure, he argues for a more inclusive understanding of Israel's history, which enables him to provide a theological justification for the equal status of gentile believers in the community of faith.<br>

Abstract: At Malmö School of Education a project team has tried to find out to what extent people are capable of constructing and presenting historical stories. The practical approach has dominated the project. Participants have been a lot of teacher students and a dozen experienced history teachers at schools in the south of Sweden. The main purpose has been to create teacher-stories for classroom use. To a minor extent we also have examined what narrative competence teenagers can develop. We tried to answer these questions: Is it easy or difficult to create and tell stories that are 1) chronological, 2) true, and 3) meaningful? Our results — more empirically than scientifically based — are: 1) Not only teachers but also pupils can create chronologic presentations. 2) We found some problems when we tried to follow the truth criterion. Story-tellers found it difficult to construct good stories if being limited to use only true elements of the past (found for example in historical dissertations). 3) The biggest problems we met were when we tried to make meaningful stories out of our true stories. Narrative history probably is worth a renaissance. However, much work remains before we know the best ways to develop narrative competence. An der „School of Education“ von Malmö hat ein Forscherteam den Versuch unternommen herauszufinden, bis zu welchem Grad Menschen fähig sind, historische Geschichten zu entwickeln und zu erzählen. Ein praktischer Zugang bestimmte das Projekt. Eine Anzahl Lehramtsstudenten und ein Dutzend erfahrener Geschichtslehrer an Schulen Südschwedens nahmen an diesem Projekt teil. Das Hauptziel war, Geschichten für Lehrer zur Verwendung im Geschichtsunterricht auszuarbeiten. In zweiter Linie ging es darum zu untersuchen, welche narrative Kompetenz Jugendliche entwickeln können. Wir haben versucht, folgende Fragen zu beantworten: Ist es leicht oder schwierig, Geschichten zu schaffen und zu erzählen, die 1. chronologisch, 2. wahr und 3. sinnvoll sind? Unsere Erg~<br>

Abstract: As a Catholic historian, this theme raises particular difficulties for me, since the notion of specific patterns of thought is one I would not use, and the term 'contemporary history' is much too vague. Of course, Catholic scholars, no less than their protestant counterparts, still recognize the need to raise questions about the nature of history and its analysis, despite the various unsuccessful attempts in the past when systematic theologians have failed to come to terms with the reality of historical events, as in the unhistorically conceived 'New Scholasticism'. The concept of 'freedom', for example, is one which requires new conceptualization in our present historical context. If we accept the current view that all rationalist theories of knowledge are in fact based on an act of 'faith', so we have to see that the belief in the primacy of 'Reason' cannot any longer be maintained. Which does not mean that we have to take flight into 'unreason', or abandon rational categories of thought. What we need to find is some manner by which 'faith' can be anchored as a final justification, over and above any transcendental basis. In our present pluralistic world this will have to be to presented in a variety of ways. But at least it calls for a new consideration of how to relate 'faith' and 'knowledge'.<br>

Abstract: This paper explores the complicated workings of Japan's mnemonic praxis in its establishment of moral authority. The atomic bombing of Hiroshima was a decisive moment inaugurating Japan as the torch-bearer of pacifism. Given Japan's ideational multiplicity as the victim and the victimizer, its pacifist ideology needs further examinations in conceptual and empirical manifestations. This research situates the ambivalent amnesia and political compromises demonstrated during the renovation project of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum from 1985 until 1994. As for a nation yet to achieve meaningful reconciliation over the past with Asian neighbors, the political divide opens room for utilitarian considerations in its pacifist discourse. The Hiroshima experience suggests that Japan's pacifism can be a problematic representation given its selective mnemonic praxis and situational ethics. This paper argues that Japanese pacifism should be redefined as 'pacifist movement.' Pacifism is foundational ethics, whereas pacifist movement accommodates political contextualization.<br>

Abstract: L'article propose de renouveler l'analyse de la mémoire historique française de l'Occupation. Il met en évidence un processus d'institutionnalisation d'une nouvelle figure, celle du Juste parmi les nations devenu progressivement Juste de France. Cette évolution repose notamment sur un rapport complexe entre ce nouveau personnage mémoriel et celui, plus ancien, du Résistant. D'une part, cette mise en place s'appuie sur des modalités symboliques proches de celles utilisées pour les résistants. D'autre part, la figure du Juste de France remplit un rôle fonctionnel autrefois exclusivement dévolu à ces derniers. À travers son incorporation s'opère la réécriture d'une rhétorique dichotomique au sein d'un régime mémoriel renouvelé où une France-patrie des droits de l'homme remplace une France-nation et territoire. Ce constat conduit à l'analyse de la portée réconciliatrice d'une telle mémoire historique et de ses modalités. Celle-ci repose notamment sur les imbrications entre individuel et collectif au cœur des représentations du passé. L'article incite enfin à un retour critique sur les travaux des tenants du « paradigme de la mémoire stratégique ». Ainsi, à travers un cas empirique concret, l'auteur se livre-t-il à une réflexion conceptuelle et méthodologique sur la notion de mémoire et ses implications. Apparaît avec force la nécessité de dépasser les approches courantes des phénomènes de mémoire, souvent trop linéaires et unidimensionnelles. The article aims to throw new light on the analysis of French historical memory of the occupation. There is the institutionalization of a new figure, that of the righteous among nations becoming progressively the righteous of France. This development is based on complex relations between this new memorial character and the older one of the Resistant. On the one hand, this character is built on symbolic processes similar to those used for the Résistants, and on the other hand, the figure of the righteous of France fulfills a functio~<br>

Abstract: Depuis une vingtaine d'années, la notion d'identité a été de plus en plus fréquemment utilisée dans des travaux portant sur la musique, sans que le sens qui lui est donné et les fonctions qui lui sont attribuées soient toujours précisément définis. Cet article voudrait contribuer à clarifier les rapports qu'entretiennent musique et configuration identitaire. Sur la base de travaux portant tant sur la théorie des identités que sur les identités en musique, il suggère que les significations sociales, donc identitaires, de la musique doivent être appréhendées dans les relations entre production, réception et matière musicale elle-même. La musique n'étant pas un langage mais un système symbolique aux interprétants infinis, elle est susceptible d'un grand nombre d'interprétations variables selon les situations et les enjeux; son utilisation en politique suppose par conséquent des opérations de façonnage spécifiques. For the past twenty years, studies of music have used more and more frequently the notion of identity. Yet the meanings given to "identity" in these studies, and the functions ascribed to it, have not always been precisely defined. This paper tries to clarify the relationship between music and identity configurations. Based on studies dealing with the theory of identity and with musical identities, it suggests that the social significations of music -identitarian significations included - must be understood as resulting from the intertwining of production, reception and the musical object itself. Music is not a language, but a symbolical system whose interprétants are infinite, it can consequently generate many diverse interpretations, which vary according to situations and stakes, and it needs to be specifically fashioned to be put to political uses.<br>

Abstract: Dans le contexte des relations communautaires en Belgique, l'évocation des causes du passé est un poncif de l'analyse des tensions et des conflits qui émaillent régulièrement ces relations. L'application d'un cadre d'analyse de path dependence forgé par des travaux en sociologie historique permet de tester et de préciser l'idée selon laquelle le passé belge influe le présent conflictuel. Le recours à cet apport théorique a pour objet d'expliquer, en partant d'un cheminement historique initié à la fin du 19e siècle, les conflits récurrents et le modèle d'autonomie croissante qui caractérisent la vie politique belge. In the context of the communal relationships in Belgium, the evocation of the causes of the past is a common place in the analysis of the tensions and conflicts that mark out these relations. The adoption of a framework of analysis of path dependence elaborated in the field of historical sociology allows to test and precise the affirmation that Belgian past shapes the conflictual present. The recourse to this theoretical and methodological scaffold is intended to explain, by following the evolution of a historical trajectory initiated at the end of the nineteenth century, the regular conflicts and the model of increasing autonomy that characterize Belgian political scene.In the context of the communal relationships in Belgium, the evocation of the causes of the past is a common place in the analysis of the tensions and conflicts that mark out these relations.

Abstract: O plural e conflituoso entendimento da legitimação da pena no Direito, tem origem nas diversas intencionalidades que lhe conferem sentido. Neste artigo são analisadas as intencionalidades mais relevantes, destacando os seus modelos justificativos: retribuição, reparação, prevenção, expiação, reabilitação e restauração (precedidas pela vingança, extrajudiríca). Para melhor análise destes são também consideradas a variável da temporalidade (passado, presente, futuro) e a variável dos sujeitos, que protagonizam a dinâmica do castigo (infractor, víctima, Estado, sociedade). Depois, num momento comparativo, destacam-se criticamente as confluencias e as oposições. Assim será possível concluir que a intencionalidade restauradora e a sua firme relativização do castigo é aquela que melhor consegue articular as variáveis de sentido-com os seus valores-, a temporalidade e os sujeitos, pelo que se mostra ser a referência mais positiva para a legitimização. Contudo, dada a sua precaridade, devido ao seu surgimento recente, impõe-se reforçá-la reflexivamente e prácticamente. The plural and conflictual understanding of the legitimacy of penalty in law stems from diverse intentionalities that constitute their respective meanings. This article analyzes the most relevant intentionalities. It seeks to highlight the models that justifies them: retribution, reparation, prevention, atonement, rehabilitation and restoration (preceded by vengeance, extrajudirical). To better analyze these models, the variable of temporality (past, present, future) and the variable of the subjects are also considered in view of the fact that they operate in the dynamics of punishment (offender, victim, State, society). Then, establishing comparisons, the confluences and oppositions are critically highlighted. In order to conclude that the restorative intentionality and its strong relativization of punishment is the one who can best articulate the variables of meaning -with their values, involving temporalit~<br>

Abstract: This article analyses the difficult relation between anthropology and history. The point, therefore, is to show how anthropology conceptualises the past differently from history as a discipline. Beginning with the differences between anthropology and history in terms of the concept of time, the article highlights that while for history time is concrete, objective and exogenous to human beings, for anthropology it is characterised by its being condensed, collectively subjective and endogenous. By analyzing actual examples, the article shows that the anthropologist is not interested in the past per se, but rather in the past as a dimension of the present. Accordingly, actualised, revised and manipulated history as well as the role of the past in the present need to be taken into account. Consequently, history and the past have their own specific efficiency because they are also a form of knowledge and social resource mobilised by single individuals or groups to find their bearings and act accordingly in the present and likewise to plan the future.<br>

Author(s): Bellagamba Alice<br>
Abstract: This article addresses two different experiences of historical recollection. The first is related to a research project on late colonial times, carried out in 2002 with a group of elderly Gambian friends. Their reminiscences allow the depiction of the conflicts and contradictions of this historical period, while showing the interplay between biography and national history, personal and collective memories. The second part of the article describes a more spontaneous activity of history-making, a monthly get-together of an opposition party organised during 2002 and 2003 by the same group of elderly men that joined my research efforts in 2002. The monthly get-together can be seen as a form of political activism played through historical discussions and communication of experiences between elders and youths participating in the meeting. Memory-work thus becomes a strong future-oriented activity aimed at promoting change by means of preserving traces of past experiences and events.<br>

Abstract: The article examines the phenomenon of communist/post-socialist nostalgia, with a focus on Slovenia and Poland, through the central issue of identity, memory and the concrete manifestations of nostalgia. The emergence of a somewhat distinct 'Eastern European' identity and the East--West divide in historical and cultural terms is explored throught several historical events of the European project between the World Wars. The revival of the communist brands, commercial products, symbols, music and film is the core of the communist 'renaissance', witnessing mainly the need for encountering the past, the selevtiveness of memory and the right and emotional need to value one's own personal history and past.<br>

Abstract: Laying down as a theorical narratologic principle that history has never taken the shape of an actual experience, but was untili today a mere narrative representation, the author aims at following the evolution of the relation between literary shapes and historical past in the Polish literature after the Second World War. From 1945 onwards history does not appear any more as a kind of strategical staging; instead it becomes an attempt to live an immediate experience regardless of any intellectual reconstruction. Otherwise, instrumentalisation and ideological recovery of the past lead the Polish writers to a real denial of history thanks to (self) parodical literary forms. Finally the multiplication of autobiographical works means a new attack against the traditional historical novel. Thus, thanks to this triple strategy which leads to a dismantling of history consistent with the now prevailing bursting of narrative forms, Polish literature brings its own answer to the history crisis which is to be seen nowadays in the western literature.<br>

Article Title: SOCIALIST REALISM AS A SURVIVAL STRATEGY : READERS' LETTERS ABOUT NIKOLAJ OSTROVSKIJ'S "HOW THE STEEL WAS TEMPERED"<br>

Author(s): LANDRY TRISTAN<br>
Abstract: From the very beginning of his career as a writer, Nikolay Ostrovsky (1904-36) received hostile criticisms of his style, which was described as 'coarse,' and which led some observers to conclude that his success was due more to his prowess as a soldier than to his talents as a writer. But his success was incontrovertible. Readers rushed to buy his book How the Steel Was Tempered, despite the absence of publicity when it appeared. What accounts for the extraordinary success? Readers' letters contained in the Russian State Archive of Literature and Art (RGALI) can help us answer this question. Over the past ten years there have been many studies in which scholars have sought the organizational basis of socialist realism as an esthetic, putting the literariness of the work before its political character. It certainly seems logical, since esthetics is not just a question of production but also of consumption (Jauss, Iser, Lotman), that this program of research should also include the acceptance of the texts, their reception by the readers. Сначала своей писательской карьеры, Николай Островский (1904-1936) получил строгие критики за свой стиль, который был описан как «груб» и некоторые наблюдатели считали, что успех его был обязан больше его подвигам в качестве солдата чем его талантам писателя. Но успех был бесспорен. Читатели устремлялись чтобы покупать книгу, Как закалялась сталь, несмотря на отсутствие рекламной шумихи во время ее публикации. Что может объяснить этот чрезвычайный успех? Письма читателей, содержавшиеся в Государственных архивах искусства и литературы Федерации России (RGALI) могут нам помочь отвечать на этот вопрос. В течение последних десяти лет, многочисленные публикации показали структуру социалистического реализма, как эстетика, помещающая литературность произведения перед его политическим характером. Потому что эстетика не только вопрос продукции а также потребления (Jauss, Iser, Lotman), кажется логическим, чтобы эта исследовательская программа ~<br>

Abstract: Until about 2005, it was hard to find any publication about literature during the communist era or any important work concerning this period. Since then, this astonishing silence has given way to the publication in Bulgaria of several novels and hybrid writings. In the meantime occured not only literary, but also political and social events which changed the issue: isn't the real problem in Bulgaria today no longer the institutional, generational, historiographical or literary silence, but the dilemna between the collective or individual responsability? To cope with these problems, the author takes into account both the works of Paul Ricoeur concerning the excess of memory and the excess of oblivion, the blocked memory, manipulated memory, abusively controlled or obligated memory, and two emblematic books concerning the communist past as seen in the State Security files: The Watched Man by Vesko Branev, and Surveillance and Conditioning: the literary prose of the State security by Žerminal Čivikov.

Author(s): WOLICKA ELŻBIETA<br>
Abstract: The article of Elzbieta Wolicka is consecrated to the consideration of the phenomenon of time taken in the contexts of individual human experience, contemporary cultural situation and Christian faith. The starting point of the 1st part of the article is the fragment of Confessiones (ch. XI) of St. Augustine and the short parable of Franz Kafka entitled HE. The author of the article brings to the light the dialogical basis of the human perception of time and raises up the quaestion of "a hidden sabotage of trust" which is characteristic to the social relations of our times. This is also the one among many other factors of the so called "crisis of culture" (mal du siècle). The crisis consists of a feeling of a threat, a burden of the past and a fear of the future. The 2nd part of the article is concerned with the analysis of the eschatological meaning of some words of Christ in the Gospel of St. John (4, 23; 5, 25-29; 12, 13; 12, 27, 31). They reveal the Christian sense of the human temporal condition in the light of "the economy of salvation" and the dialogue between a believer and God. A catastrophic thrill, a feeling of existential paradox, a blockage of communication - the symptoms of the crisis of cultural conscience - could be described as "the edipse of God" (M. Buber) or "the abandonment of God" (J. Ellul) in the contemporary world. The Gospel points out that in the heart of human temporal experience there is still existing conversatio sacra and the presence of God in our history is actual.<br>

Abstract: The term intellectuals(s) has been in use for scarcely more than one century. What is its definition? What conditions of possibility govern the emergence of the Modern intellectual? How many of these conditions can be traced to the past? The typological approach used here sets the origin of the intellectual's role and status in the new paradigm of power established in Carolingian times (781-804), which displayed a peculiar axiom: the idea that all Power is intrinsically divisible. This view was already five centuriesold when Petrarch claimed the autonomous position of cultural critic—not the Modern intellectual's status, but some of his authority, though on different grounds.<br>

Abstract: Archaeology assumes itself as a discipline through a practice of boundary-making that merges the past with the present. It is, in this practice, increasingly critiqued for being ethnocentric and separating power from the communities it claims to represent. In response, archaeology is experiencing a turn toward "community". Examining two community archaeology case studies, we assess whether archaeology can be transformed into a discipline that productively participates in the liveliness and messy connectedness of objects, peoples, histories and cultures— in contrast to a conventionally detached practice of objectifying other peoples' lifeways. In both cases, archaeological and descent communities play direct and central decision-making roles in this traditionally "distanced" discipline. They demonstrate means of re-figuring archaeology as a participatory practice. Community-founded archaeology is thus shown to transform methods commonly supporting institutional reproduction into a radically indigenous, emically structured, set of knowledge practices and outcomes. Archeologie suppose elle-même comme une discipline à travers une pratique de fabrication limite qui fusionne le passé au présent. Il est, dans cette pratique, plus en plus critiqué pour avoir été puissance ethnocentrique et séparation des communautés qu'elle prétend représenter. En réponse, archéologie connaît un tournant vers une « communauté ». Examen de deux études de cas communautaires archéologie, nous déterminer si archéologie peut se transformer en une discipline qui productivement participe à la vivacité et la connectivité désordre des objets, des peuples, des histoires et des cultures—contrairement à une pratique conventionnelle détachée d'objectiver les modes de vie des autres peuples. En cas, archéologiques et descente communautés jouent des rôles décisionnels directes et centrales dans ce traditionnellement « distanciés » discipline.

Abstract: The 1990s and 2000s saw a memory and remembrance boom at both the national and supra-/transnational level. Crucially, many of these emerging memory frames were not simply about a glorious and heroic past, as in, for example, traditional nationalist narratives. Rather, groups started to narrate their symbolic boundaries in a more inclusive way by admitting past wrongdoings. In this article, we look at a corpus of so-called 'speculative speeches' by leading politicians in the European Union and, against the aforementioned historical background, analyse their representations of Europe's past, present and future. By utilising the discourse-historical approach in critical discourse analysis, narrative theory and elements of Reinhart Koselleck's conceptual history (Begriffsgeschichte), we illustrate how, first, a 'new Europe', based on admitting failure, is narrated. However, second, we also show that such a self-critical narration of a 'bitter past' is, paradoxically, transformed into a self-righteous attitude towards Europe's 'others'.<br>

Abstract: Depuis les années 1980, l'exhumation dmédico-légale des fosses communes est une pratique courante dans les contextes d'après-violence. Menées dans le but de soulager le « traumatisme » des familles de victimes, adossées à une exigence de « vérité » sur les crimes perpétrés, les exhumations font office de « meilleures pratiques » standardisées favorisant une sortie de conflit. Cette thérapeutique politique peut-elle être mise au service de la lutte et détournée des objectifs réconciliateurs définis ? Cet article analyse le processus d'invention d'un nouveau mode d'action protestataire. Il se centrera sur le travail militant de la Federación Estatal de Foros por la Memoria, collectif espagnol qui interprète l'exhumation comme un outil de lutte permettant de sortir de la réconciliation et de réveiller volontairement les antagonismes. The forensic exhumation of the mass graves has become common practice in post-violent contexts since the 1980s. Being carried out to relieve the psychological "trauma" of the victims' families who demand the "truth" on the past wrongdoings, forensic exhumations are now considered as a standardized "best practice" in the field of conflict resolution. Can this political therapy be put at the service of political strife and diverted from its reconciliation objectives? This article aims at analysing the invention process of a new form of political protest. It will focus on the activities of the Federación Estatal de Foros por la Memoria. According to this Spanish association, mass grave exhumations are a way out of reconciliation and a deliberate revival of antagonisms.<br>

Abstract: C'est d'abord s'étonner de la place qu'occupe dans l'œuvre novatrice de Freud la culture antique. Retracer l'itinéraire de la rencontre avec Œdipe, c'est faire comme un état des lieux. L'Interprétation des Rêves, Totem et Tabou, L'Homme Moïse et la religion monothéiste, mais aussi des articles moins connus, des extraits de sa correspondance, contiennent des analyses inattendues, sur l'origine de la tragédie grecque, son évolution, sa fonction, sur la catharsis, le plaisir tragique, etc... Le but n'est pas d'apprécier la pertinence des réponses, mais de dégager l'originalité d'une démarche qui lie fiction et réalité, structure et histoire, passé et présent. And our first response will be to marvel at the importance of the culture of antiquity in Freud’s innovating work. Tracing up the stages of his encounter with Œdipus is tantamount to an inventory of fixtures. The Interpretation of Dreams, Totem and Taboo, The Man Moses and monotheistic religion, but also less known articles and extracts from his correspondence contain unexpected analyses on the origin of Greek tragedy, its evolution, its function, on catharsis, tragic pleasure, etc. Our aim is not to assess the relevance of the answers but to bring out the originality of a procedure that links up fiction and fact, structure and history, past and present<br>

Abstract: Dans la réflexion de Jean-Pierre Vernant et Pierre Vidal-Naquet, le rapprochement entre le passé et le présent est caractéristique d'une démarche qui, pour aborder les problèmes historiques les plus difficiles, et notamment les questions politiques, n'hésite pas à recourir à ce que Nicole Loraux a pu appeler «une pratique contrôlée de l'anachronisme». L'analyse porte dans cette étude sur un point omniprésent dans leurs œuvres : l'héritage politique des Grecs ? Comment ont-ils défini, par leurs travaux, un héritage politique qui ne reprend pas tout ce que les Anciens ont pensé et fait? Comment, dans leur démarche, chacun à leur manière, ont-ils tracé et franchi des frontières, entre le passé et le présent? Quelle pertinence accorder dans ce contexte à la notion de frontière? Quel sens donner aux trois termes autour desquels est centrée cette contribution: le politique, les frontières, l'historien? In Jean-Pierre Vernant's and Pierre Vidal-Naquet's thought, the rapprochement between past and present characterizes a procedure which in dealing with the most difficult historical issues and notably the political ones, does not hesitate to resort to what Nicole Loraux once called "a controlled practice of anachronism". In this study the analysis bears on a pervasive point throughout their works: the political heritage of the Greeks? How did they define in their works a political heritage of the Greeks which does not take up all that the Ancients thought and did? How in their thought processes each of them in his own way has traced up and trespassed borders between past and present? What relevance can be accorded in such context to the notion of border? What meaning to be given to the three terms around which this contribution is centered: politics, the borders, the historian?<br>

Abstract: Conspiracy accounting is often regarded as an atypical, pathological form of political reasoning, and little research has considered how ordinary social actors may refer to political conspiracies in the course of argument. In this article, we consider the spontaneous use of conspiracy narratives by politically engaged Greek citizens in interview discussions of the Macedonian crisis. Analysis revealed that conspiracy narratives were typically used to challenge dominant representations that attributed the Macedonian crisis to Greek xenophobic nationalism. Specifically, conspiracy accounts were used to dispute assumptions concerning Greece's majority status by representing the political opposition as a consortium rather than a single out-group, by recasting the threat posed to Greece as a matter of realistic rather than symbolic competition, and by extending the historical frame of reference to encompass past and prospective future threats to the Greek people and the Greek state. In conclusion, we note how the use of conspiratorial reasoning may be used to construct complex causal arguments concerning intergroup relations and to challenge dominant ideological assumptions about social hierarchy and political legitimacy. In this respect, conspiratorial reasoning might be regarded as a prototypical form of intergroup representation.<br>

Abstract: Using postwar El Salvador as a case study, I argue against the dominant paradigm that situates the repressive role of the state as both the central object of memorialization and the main subject of history. Instead, I focus on the ways in which the memory of insurgent collective action is constructed among young members of the popular classes in postwar El Salvador. Drawing on extensive ethnographic research in the communities of northern Morazán, I understand memory as the suspended time of praxis. Media—such as Internet, Facebook, and TV play a key role in this process, impinging on the ways youth relate with the revolutionary past of their relatives making sense of their present living conditions. I argue that memory must be understood as a particular form of praxis, one that is embedded in historic concrete forms of class constitution in which the role of media has become a constitutive element in the labors of memory, particularly among young people.<br>

Abstract: Neste ensaio, entrelaço fios de vidas das mulheres negras que estáo atadas óï fio da minha vida. Com os fios soltos das canções de Zezé Motta e dos escritos da filósofa Hannah Arendt, teço este texto-existência. Na leitura dos ensaios e poemas de Marlene Nourbese Philip, escritora afro-caribenha, me inspiro não só para resistir às amarras culturais hegemônicas, mas também para transcendê-las, criando possibilidades de escrita que vincule a dinâmica da fala com a dinámica da ocóo, compondo um texto que se movimenta ora como dança, através do espaço, ora como urna canção, ritmada pelo tempo, pois criar e dançar uma coreografia é uma forma de fazer historia. Como investiga Selma Treviños, trata-se de urna ferramenta para animar o passado ou uma "escrita" acerca de algo que já foi feito, se concordamos que cada corpo carrega sua pròpria história e individualidade, memòria, sentimentos e emoções. Na busca do entendimento desta minha breve existência, danço, escrevo, teço palavras com fios desfiados da flor do útero das minhas ancestrais. Vasculho minhas lembranças e, na memória corporal, decifro a dor, encontró a raiz da violência, observo o medo, destilo a alegría, enfeito a doçura, mergulho na paz e conheço a liberdade. In that essay I interweave threads of the black women's lives that are tied to the thread of my life. With the free threads of Zezé Motta's songs and of philosopher Hannah Arendfs writings, I weave this text-existence. In the reading of the essay and poems of Marlene NourbeSe Philip, writer Afro-Caribbean, I am inspired not only to resist the hegemonic cultural ties, but also transcend them, creating possibilities of writing that links the dynamics of the speech with the dynamics of the action, to compose a text that is moved some times as a dance through the space, other times as a song, with its rhythm determinedby time, because creating and dancing a choreography is a form of making history. As investigates Selma Treviños it is a tool to encourage th~<br>

Author(s): TodorovAbstract: Rapidement, derrière la réclamation de la réparation morale des crimes contre l'humanité que constituent la traite négrière et l'esclavage dans les colonies françaises durant deux siècles, pointent des revendications de réparations matérielles de ces crimes. À l'inverse de ladite réparation, ces revendications paraissent n'avoir que très peu de possibilité d'être effectivement satisfaites et ne présenter qu'une faible légitimité à l'être. Et ce, principalement, parmi d'autres facteurs, du fait de l'éloignement dans le temps des crimes en question. C'est que s'il est vrai que bien des inégalités que connaissent les peuples des départements français d'Outre-mer portent encore la marque de l'oppression esclavagiste passée, il n'est pas moins certain qu'elles ne sont pas à combattre en fonction du passé, mais relativement a des dominations présentes. /// Quite soon, following in the tracks of a demand for a moral reparation of two centuries of slavery and slave trade in France's colonies, claims have been made for material reparations of these crimes against humanity. Unlike the first demand, these claims have very few chances of actually being satisfied and are apparently lacking in justification, mainly because, among others factors, these crimes lie in a distant past. Although many of the inequalities experienced by the inhabitants of the French overseas departments still bear the marks of slavery, it is no less true that the struggle against inequality is not to be led as a function of the past but, instead, in relation to present-day domination.<br>

Abstract: While the Good Friday Agreement heralded a new beginning in Northern Ireland, its promotion of amnesty and amnesia, and its "rhetorical dismemberment of the past," effectively occluded the experiences of victims. Rather than engage in the seductive embrace of cultural amnesia, much Northern Irish art focuses upon the dangers of forgetting the past. For visual artists and writers alike, a wilful neglect of history may result in the return of the repressed and in psychic breakdown on both the communal and individual levels. Works by Jack Pakenham, Ciaran Carson, Colin Davidson, Frank McGuinness, and Willie Doherty use the trope of "haunting" to allow readers/viewers to bear witness to the plight of those left behind by the Agreement's rhetoric and to understand their post-conflict trauma. Bien que l'Accord du Vendredi saint annonçât un nouveau début pour l'Irlande du Nord, il eut comme résultat, de par sa promotion d'une amnistie combinée à une amnésie forcée, ainsi que son démembrement rhétorique du passé, de nier le vécu des victimes. Plutôt que de se laisser subjuguer par la séduction de l'amnésie culturelle, une grande partie de l'expression artistique de l'Irlande du Nord se concentre sur le danger d'oublier le passé. Pour les plasticiens aussi bien que les écrivains, une négligence délibérée de l'histoire pourrait ramener la répression et occasionner des blessures psychiques aussi bien au niveau communautaire que de l'individu. Les œuvres de Jack Pakenham, Ciaran Carson, Colin Davidson, Frank McGuinness, et Willie Doherty déploient le trope de la « hantise » pour permettre aux lecteurs et au public de témoigner de la souffrance de ceux qui ont été laissés pour compte par la rhétorique de l'Accord, et de mieux comprendre leur traumatisme post-conflit<br>

Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Johnson Nuala C<br>
Abstract: Drawing on the theoretical insights of Paul Ricoeur this paper investigates the geographies of public remembrance in a post-conflict society. In Northern Ireland, where political divisions have found expression through acts of extreme violence over the past 30 years, questions of memory and an amnesty for forgetting have particular resonance both at the individual and societal level, and render Ricoeur's framework particularly prescient. Since the signing of the Belfast Agreement in 1998, initiating the Peace Process through consociational structures, discovering a nomenclature and set of practices which would aid in the rapprochement of a deeply divided society has presented a complex array of issues. In this paper I examine the various practices of public remembrance of the 1998 bombing of Omagh as a means of understanding how memory-spaces evolve in a post-conflict context. In Omagh there were a variety of commemorative practices instituted and each, in turn, adopted a different contour towards achieving reconciliation with the violence and grief of the bombing. In particular the Garden of Light project is analysed as a collective monument which, with light as its metaphysical centre, invited the populace to reflect backward on the pain of the bombing while at the same time enabling the society to look forward toward a peaceful future where a politics of hope might eclipse a politics of despair.<br>

Abstract: D'un côté, l'Enquête d'Hérodote rapporte les projets de domination qui, de Crésus à Xerxès, constituent la trame des rapports entre Grecs et Barbares, de 561 à 479. Mais, de l'autre, le lecteur ne peut oublier que de larges sections décrivent les coutumes et l'espace de nombreux peuples dès que la conquête les menace. Cette dynamique s'enracine dans les conditions matérielles de création et de lecture au Ve siècle avant J.-C, et dans les héritages narratifs que transforme Hérodote (Vies, Catalogues ...). Or aucun conquérant n'est glorifié ni présenté comme un vainqueur, tandis que les peuples visés opposent la singularité de leur espace et l'étrangeté de leurs coutumes, soit un genre de vie devenu stratégie de résistance, en associant particularisme insulaire et fuite calculée sur le modèle nomade. Les Grecs, de même, tantôt conquérants insatiables mais défaits, tantôt résistants invaincus, contribuent à monter que, chez Hérodote, l'autre a le visage de celui qui résiste plutôt que du Barbare. Il s'agit donc bien d'une autre écriture du passé, qui sauve de l'oubli tous les peuples décrits, non les seuls hauts faits des Rois. Les mêmes images sont employées pour décrire la résistance insulaire des nomades, et pour dire le cheminement de l'écriture, ainsi en relation d'homologie avec son objet. On one hand, Herodotus' Inquiry reports the plan of domination which from Croesus to Xerxes composes the system of the relation between Greeks and Barbarians, from 561 to 479. But on the other hand, the reader cannot forget that large sections describe customs and many people's area when they are threatened by conquest. This discrepancy has its roots in the material conditions of creativity and reading in the fifth century B.C., and to the narrative forms available to Herodotus (Lives, Lists...). However, no conqueror was praised nor spoken of as a victor, while people shown opposed their individual space and their peculiar customs, that is to say a way of life set up as a stra~<br>

Abstract: If nations are "imagined communities" as many theorists like to define them, then they need an ideology to create a cohesive imagination. In modern times, the project of writing "history" has been an important instrument in the service of this ideological purpose of justifying and reproducing the modern nation-state as the predestined and legitimate container of collective consciousness. School textbooks, at least in South Asia, have long been among the most exploited media for the presentation of the history of the national collective. This essay is a study of school textbooks in Bangladesh. It looks at narrative representations of selected episodes from the past, both pre- and postindependence, in order to reflect on how they construct "history". Through this work I endeavor to relate textual images to issues of community relations and identity by identifying and sharing the ways in which the audience for nationalist discourse is created, nurtured, and secured through symbolic means.<br>

Abstract: Réponse à l'article publié par G. Lafont: La pertinence théologique de l'histoire, dans la Rev. Sc. ph. th. 63 (1979) 161-202. La discussion doit être épistémologique et théologique. Après avoir rappelé son projet central (penser le monde en faisant droit à la contingence), l'A. propose une réflexion sur le nom. Que le monde soit irrémédiablement pris dans l'historique ne condamne pas à la dissémination: en effet le monde apparaît toujours comme déjà nommé, et le nom est irréductible à l'acte de nomination qui sera toujours réponse (reconnaissance, en acte, d'un nom). Par là, l'A. tente de montrer que son pari théologique ne condamne pas à esquiver le moment nécessaire d'une référence, mais conduit certes à le repenser, à ouvrir une nouvelle ontologie. Pour ce faire, il met à profit certains enseignements de la tradition juive et de l'enseignement psychanalytique. Il signale enfin que loin de rompre avec le passé, son projet ambitionne de renouer en profondeur avec certaines des positions les plus originaires et traditionnelles du christianisme. A response to the article published by G. L. : La pertinence théologique de l'histoire, in Rev. Sc. ph. th. 63 (1979) 161-202. The discussion has to be epistemological and theological. Having recalled his main project (to think the world by giving its place to contingency), the writer is proposing a reflection on the name. That the world cannot but be historical does not condemn it to be disseminated: indeed the world always appears as already named, and the name is irreducible to the nominating act that will always be a response (acknowledgment, in act, of a name). Thus the author tries to demonstrate that his theological bet does not lead to evade the necessary moment of referring, but most certainly to think it over, to work out a new ontology. To bring it about, he makes use of teachings of the Jewish tradition and of the psycho-analytical teaching. Finally he points out that his project not only is far from being a brea~<br>

Article Title: Criticism, Literary History, and the Paradigm: The Education of Henry Adams<br>
Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219749<br>
Date: 5 1, 1973<br>
Author(s): White Wayne<br>
Abstract: Literary historians have persistently regarded The Education of Henry Adams as a "paradigmatic" text. While "historical explanations" stress the book's historical achievement, "critical explications" portray it as a failure of historical consciousness that achieves its success in the ahistorical arenas of aesthetic integration and imaginative projection. To relate the products of "explication" with the aims of "historical explanation," I regard the work's true "paradigm achievement" as an inquiry into "historical being." For Adams this achievement embodies disciplinary formulation and professional commitment and thus coordinates historical speculation and self-cultivation. One must assess the ethical density and cultural significance of the text before explaining its historical identity. The Education, despite its origin in epistemological chaos, makes the past eternally relevant to the present; for it is a personal and theoretical discovery of how the narrative structures of history and selfhood create the possibilities of individual and social life.<br>

Author(s): Wing Nicolae<br>
Abstract: The conflict between formalist thinking and theories that view texts in their historical contexts serves as a starting point for the introduction of a cognitive view of literature. From this perspective language has full referential powers. The "referent" splits into two entities, however: things-in-themselves (in their material identity), which we cannot know, and things in their coded form, which are perceptually accessible. Readers' mnemonic potentials, a consequence of the bonding of perception and language, are adduced to show that texts originate in past interpretations of other texts and in personal experience and that consequently social forces and historical events are subsumed in the individual memory. In the cognitive light, memory becomes the ultimate metaphor, and the epistemological claim of realism regains its compelling force.<br>

Article Title: Narrating the past: History and the Novel of Memory in Postwar Spain<br>
Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219800<br>
Date: 1 1, 1963<br>
Author(s): Williams David K.<br>
Abstract: Historiography in Francoist Spain (1939-75) sought to affirm the morally and historically correct role of the regime within the flow of Spanish history. As an important vehicle of dissidence, the novel of memory stands in sharp contrast to Francoist history: it explores the past largely eschewed or appropriated by the regime and contests the so-called truths that Franco shaped through the discourse of myth. This essay examines the role of subjective memory as a challenge to historiography and discloses the narrative strategies novelists used to counter the government's myths. Unlike Francoist historiography, the novel of memory lays out history as a series of disruptions and undermines the referential illusion of truth and wholeness in our understanding of the past.<br>

Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i220980<br>
Date: 7 1, 1968<br>
Author(s): Womack JoAnn<br>
Abstract: The Mexican state's use of revolutionary history to invoke nationalistic sentiments nurtures a lively tradition of storytelling. Ironically, Buena Vista's storytellers criticize the inauthenticity of official representations of the past even as they draw on the images and ideals of "official" history to weave their own tales. This article argues that discourses of authenticity reinscribe historic distinctions between the community and the state in a language which evokes modern notions of purity and truth. The article highlights the political role of discourses of authenticity within the hegemonic structures of modern state power in Mexico.<br>

Abstract: Although extensive research has been directed toward ethnic identity over the past 15 years, the issue of local identity has been relatively neglected. This article examines local foci of identity in rural Brittany. Studies of regional ethnic groups in Europe have frequently emphasized the external boundaries dividing such groups from dominant national cultures. In contrast, the present article suggests that internal, local boundaries are emically of greater significance in the construction of cultural identities.<br>

Abstract: Adopting a reflexive approach, this article interprets a recently created healing ritual in Brittany that integrates local 19th-century notions about the curative powers of prehistoric monuments with diverse elements from non-Breton sources. Parallels are noted between this New Age therapy and witchcraft, an older explanatory framework for illness and misfortune in Brittany. The therapeutic discourse associated with the ritual draws on the past and on exotic cultures to construct a meaningful cosmology. Therefore, this discourse--like the New Age movement as a whole--has much in common with anthropology, which, it is suggested, provides Western society with an ordered vision of the world. [Brittany, New Age healing, witchcraft, interpretation of the past, anthropology as cosmology]<br>

Author(s): Young Patricia A.<br>
Abstract: The field of bioethics has been dominated by the tenets and assumptions of Western philosophical rationalistic thought. A principles and rights-based approach to discussions of moral dilemmas has sustained and reinforced a pervasive reductionism, utilitarianism, and ethnocentrism in the field. Recent explorations of casuistry and hermeneutics suggest a movement toward an expanded theoretical and conceptual framing of medical ethical problems. Increased attention to moral phenomenology and a recognition of the importance of social, cultural, and historical determinants that shape moral questioning should facilitate collaborative work between anthropologists and ethicists. In this article, I examine the philosophical orientation of U.S. bioethics and the relationship of the social sciences to the field of medical ethics. Deterrents to collaboration between anthropologists and bioethicists are explored. Finally, I review past and possible future contributions of anthropology to the field of bioethics and, more generally, to medical ethics.<br>

Article Title: Introduction: From the "New Ecology" to the New Ecologies<br>
Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i227583<br>
Date: 3 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): Wolf Aletta<br>
Abstract: An earlier ecological anthropology defined its project within the compass of the idealism v. materialism debate. Culture was an adaptive tool, instrumental rather than formal; it was intelligible with respect to its material effects, not - as the idealists would maintain - in terms of itself, as an autonomous, self-determining order of reality. This argument was mounted with respect to bounded, stable, self-regulating, local, or at best regional entities and the environment they inhabited. All of the premises of the earlier ecology have since been challenged, and today's ecologies - symbolic, historical, and political - radically depart from the reductions and elisions of the ecological anthropology of the past. In particular, the new ecologies override the dichotomies that informed and enlivened the debates of the past - nature/culture, idealism/materialism - and they are informed by the literature on transnationalist flows and local-global articulations. This introduction positions Rappaport's work within this historical shift from a polarized field of mutually exclusive frameworks to today's synthetic new ecologies and their antireductive materialism. Rappaport's work, produced over three decades, serves, in and through its own transformations, as a bridge between the reductive materialism of the past and a new-materialist ecology.<br>

Author(s): Selzer Greg<br>
Abstract: The flight of Voyager 1 past Saturn in 1981 provides an occasion for a semiotic comparison of reports in French newspapers (Le Monde and Libération), a popular science article (in, La Recherche), and specialized scientific articles in Nature. The texts differ in the distance supposed between reader and writer, in the treatment of human and nonhuman actors, in characterization of the event and assumptions about readers' interest in it, and in their narrative structure. The analysis shows that popularizations and specialized scientific articles are not related in a simple dichotomy or scale and cannot be explained by a notion of the "general public"; rather, the various types of texts must be considered in terms of more complex relations between what are called in semiotic terms the enunciator and the enunciatee.<br>

Abstract: The essay deals the ways in which the «defeated» of the Social Republic have been told in the decades following their defeat. In particular, it analyzes the narrative strategies and the readings of the past through which the heirs of Republican fascism have tried to rebuild their historical legitimacy into a political system that had accepted their presence, but had assigned them – in the name of Anti-Fascism – a completely marginal place.<br>

Abstract: October 17th, 2011. In the Parisian region and the neighbouring suburbs of the Hauts-de-Seine, the 50th commemoration of the massacre of Algerians in Paris led to the institutionalization of the colonial memory. By virtue of their duration and their size, these commemorative ceremonies questioned the particular period during which the French colonial past appeared in former and present socialist and communist councils. In Nanterre – a commune situated in the North-western suburbs of Paris that has had a communist council since 1935 – this memory is exceptional due to its long colonial and postcolonial history. Although the largest Algerian slum in France was to be found in the Nanterre of the 1950s and 1960s, for many years, the council remained completely silent about the massacre of Algerian activists in 1961. It is only recently that the massacre has started to be commemorated in Nanterre. This can be explained by two significant and recent transformations of the city: firstly, its demographic and urban transformation; and secondly, the change of its political elite, following a boom in the number of local associations and activist networks working on the question of the local (and colonial) memory. The emergence of this memory in the micro-politics of Nanterre responds to the need for a common and unified identity of its residents, an identity that the working class and communist banners have failed to provide. The residents’ struggle to have a school named after the Algerian sociologist Abdelmalek Sayad – who wrote on Nanterre’s slums – and a street named after Abdennbi Guémiah – a teenager killed by a racist neighbour in the early 1980s – testify to the need for such a memory. The heritage and memory of immigration in the city has now become a core issue in Nanterre’s local politics. It helps political authorities build a brandnew image and overcome the mistakes of the past by recognizing its (post)colonial citizens. Beyond the dead and the words, the sudden e~<br>

Abstract: This paper emerges out of an ethnographic study conducted at the University of Cape Town that explored the dynamics of an intervention providing a ‘safe space’ for university staff to engage in alternative ways with South Africa's apartheid past, the university's institutional culture and with each other. This paper focuses on the social politics that arose between the intervention, its participants and imagined non-participants in relation to the university's ‘transformation’ vision. The interventionist intention was reworked by participants at a ground level into key symbols by which participants shaped the patterns of their behaviours and gave meaning to their experiences. Utilising Ortner's (1973) model for recognising and using key symbols, I argue that ‘transformation’ and ‘safe space’ are
         elaboratingsymbols in that they have conceptual and action elaborating power. These elaborating symbols operate in relay with a kind of logic that ‘crystallises commitment’ from participants to the intervention in an emotionally powerful and relatively undifferentiated manner. In so doing, they render the intervention a ‘summarising’ symbol capable of expressing what their experience means to them as an imagined community in relation to others.<br>

Abstract: Public history sites like the West Indian Museum of Panama and the Miraflores Visitors Center have different approaches to narrating the Panama Canal story, ranging from tales of man’s triumph over nature and celebratory discourses of nationalist victories, to testimonies of the racial histories silenced by official renderings of the past. Given the important role of museums as educational institutions, sites that inform public opinion, and representational platforms for national tourism, this article explores the relationship these institutions forge between visitors and canal history. Through a comparative analysis of the narratives and experiential strategies at each site, I evaluate the degree to which Panamanians are cast as spectators in grandiose histories of triumph, or as agents, responsible for shaping the past, present and future. In contrast to these physical sites, I consider how The Society of Friends of the West Indian Museum of Panama constructs a living past through memory practices that challenge the petrified histories traditionally found in museums.<br>

Abstract: Historians are dumb witnesses to a culture wrangling with itself about its criminal past if they only narrate the sequence of historical controversies such as those that have dotted the German public landscape since the Holocaust. They need to be alive to the subterranean biblical themes flowing beneath the surface froth of events, linking past and present through the continuity of German political emotions that are necessarily collective and therefore sensitive to anxieties about accusations of collective, inherited sin. This article argues that the guilt/shame couplet so common both in public German and academic discourses about postwar Germany cannot account for the intergenerational transmission of moral pollution signified by Holocaust memory. In order to understand the dynamics of German political emotions, it is more useful to employ an alternative couplet: stigma and sacrifice.<br>

Abstract: This article examines the formative role of the World War II experience in shaping politically relevant memories in postwar Italy. Rather than considering the past a legacy or a heritage—something abstract, malleable and susceptible to serving political interests—the focus here is on the meaning-giving power of memories and symbols in the historical evolution. The birth of Italian democracy after the war was preceded by disruptive events that could have divided the nation. This article illustrates how contested and fragmented interpretations of critical events were structured by and through the dimension of cultural memory, which sustained social and political imaginations, eventually shaping characters and outcomes of the Italian political transformation.<br>

Abstract: This article discusses the results of focus group interviews with members of three different Catholic communities in Poland: the Radio Maryja Family from Rzeszów, epitomizing the so-called “Closed Church,” the intellectuals from Lublin associated with the late Archbishop Życiński, who exemplify adherents to the “Open Church,” and the Club of Catholic Intelligentsia from Kraków, which adopts a middle position between these two groups. The analysis reveals that although the groups constitute varying “communities of memory” with different perceptions of the Polish national past and relations between Poles and Jews, there are no significant differences in their memory of Auschwitz. The qualitative study of these three Catholic communities confirms the results of surveys which show that over the past years in Poland the Jewish meaning of Auschwitz has gained precedence over the Polish and Catholic meanings.<br>

Abstract: This article analyzes the social construction of silence in early-nineteenth-century Europe, focusing on France and the Netherlands. In both countries, the newly installed Restoration monarchies propagated a “politics of forgetting” of the problematic recent past of the revolution and the Napoleonic era as an essential part of attempts to build a stable and legitimate political order. This official forgetting was contested in both countries. On the basis of the “letters of adhesion,” the article examines the close interaction between the individual reconstruction of the personal past and social forgetting. Finally, it relates the rise of a historicizing culture in the early nineteenth century to the culture of silence in Restoration Europe.<br>

Abstract: Tropes for poetic relationality proliferate and concatenate. And there is so much more to say. The topic of poetic copia is indeed so abundant as to suggest myriad forking paths of contemplation and investigation. Hidden within the present reflections are dozens of doors leading to other rooms of thought that this article unfortunately does not have the luxury to open. The poets of the Latin American neobaroque—including Argentines Néstor Perlongher, Osvaldo Lamborghini, and Arturo Carrera, Uruguyans Roberto Echavarren and Eduardo Milán, Cuban American José Kozer, and Peruvian Argentine Reynaldo Jimenez—are in deep dialogue with cannibalistic poetics, as De Campos argues in his analysis of “anthropophagous reason” (which he defines as a “ludic space of polyphony and of language in convulsion”).
         
               In the twentieth and twenty-first century there is also a suggestive plethora of poetic frauds, hoaxes, and impersonations—the Ern Malley hoax and Christopher Reid's143
            Katerina Brac, to name just two. Multilingual poetics, with its play on shifting linguistic identities, interlanguage, and polyphony, presents another avenue that would be fruitful for exploration; as does new media poetics that makes use of digital technology. As cultural processes that mingle past and present texts, such cannibalistic poetry participates in a form of cultural philosophy
               that unseats dualistic notions of genius and non-genius, source and derivative, and argues implicitly or explicitly against the metaphysics of origin.144<br>

Abstract: There is much to admire in
      Against World Literature, but I often found myself wishing that Apter had developed her arguments further by opening out more beyond her own cultural and theoretical comfort zone. Throughout her book, “World Literature” is taken to be a unified entity, practiced largely in translation by American academics; no mention is made of the ambitious publication projects undertaken in Japan over the course of the past century, in China since the end of the Cultural Revolution, or in countries as varied as Estonia, Poland, Portugal, and South Korea in more recent years. Within English-language scholarship, Apter rarely discusses work published in the past decade, even though scholars of world literature increasingly focus on complexities of translation and on the cultural politics of transmission and reception. No mention is made, for instance, of Mads Rosendahl Thomsen'sMapping World Literature(Bloomsbury, 2008), Ursula Heise'sSense of Place and Sense of Planet: The Environmental Imagination of the Global(Oxford, 2008), Djelal Kadir'sMemos from the Besieged City: Lifelines for Cultural Sustainability(Stanford, 2010), or Jacob Edmond'sA Common Strangeness: Contemporary Poetry, Cross-cultural Encounter, Comparative Literature(Fordham, 2012). A treatment of untranslatability from a broad temporal and cultural perspective can be found in Ronit Ricci's remarkable bookIslam Translated(Chicago, 2011), which opens with a chapter on “‘Translation’ and its Untranslatability,” exploring the implications of the fact that the very term “translation” has no direct translation in Arabic, Tamil, and Javanese, the languages at the heart of her study.<br>

Abstract: Fitzgerald's nostalgic style, though, set an example of how a nostalgic narrative could be structured, and in its aftermath it was used by such different authors as Evelyn Waugh in
      Brideshead Revisited(1945), Anthony Burgess inA Clockwork Orange(1962) and the works of Kazuo Ishiguro. The author's own later work employs it as well. The technique of using the reader's textual memory in order to evoke a phenomenological nostalgic experience is very evident in both versions ofTender Is the Night(the 1934 original, and Malcolm Cowley's 1951 restructuring). In the 1951 version, the structure of the narrative closely follows the pattern of happiness and reflection. An early description of a Swiss valley communicates an awe of life and nature: “The sun swam out into a blue sea of sky and suddenly it was a Swiss valley at its best—pleasant sounds and murmurs and a good fresh smell of health and cheer” (9). In the transitory third book, “Casualties: 1925,” the tone has changed from appreciative to melancholic, as in this description of the small town of Amiens: “In the day-time one is deflated by such towns, with their little trolley cars of twenty years ago crossing the great grey cobble-stoned squares in front of the cathedral, and the very weather seems to have a quality of the past, faded weather like that of old photographs” (138). At the end of the novel both Dick and Nicole Diver become obsessed with youth and the past as well as with time: “for Nicole the years slipped away by clock and calendar and birthday, with the added poignance of her perishable beauty” (228). Toward the end of the novel, Nicole's last sight of Dick—“her eyes followed his figure until it became a dot and mingled with the other dots in the summer crowd” (386)—forces the reader to reflect in a reversed movement. Instead of vanishing like Dick, this image suggests a backward recollection of what was a Swiss valley “at its best.”<br>

Abstract: Remembering is a function of the meaning-making process after the emptiness of loss. Spelder and Strickland suggest that “grief is the emotional response to bereavement, to the event of loss” (as qtd. in DuBose, 368). The theologian Todd J. DuBose explains that “grief gazes at an ever-receding present as it moves further and further into the past. The immediate reaction often involves bargaining for a reversal of the loss, denial, anger, shock, anguish, distress, sadness” (368). These reactions are the body's means of trying to make sense of the world in the wake of the emptiness created by bereavement. Interpreting Drew Leder and Maurice Merleau-Ponty's notion of chiasmic structure of the body, DuBose explains that the body realizes its existence only in relation to other bodies. It touches because it is being touched. Other bodies make ours perceptible. The disappearance of these other bodies in death is, in tune with the chiasmic structure of bodily existence, the disappearance of our own bodies. We experience that disappearance as pain, grief, sorrow. These manifestations of pain are, indeed, the ways our bodies adjust to vacuum and fill it with meaning. For DuBose, “meaning-making processes, which
         appearto be immaterial processes, are embodied phenomena. Reflection, perception, feeling, language, even logic make sense only through the influx of the body's ‘reading’ of space, time, action, and sensation” (370).<br>

Abstract: In their important volume on the history of the geography of continents cited above, Martin Lewis and Karen Wigen devote an entire chapter to the Eurocentric/Afrocentric controversy. Some new light is shed on this debate within this context. Europe, simply as a geographical designation, is already an ambiguous, if not spurious, notion. Its legitimacy is claimed through the invention of its past, and its projection of its meaning within the world is created by navigation of the Atlantic Ocean. The ideology of Europe is not put forward as a limited cultural meaning of thought, truth, or value. Rather, European cultural meanings are assumed to be the correlates of universal values and norms. It is precisely this view of Europe that is being rejected by the Afrocentric camp. In many respects, however, the Afrocentric proponents share many of the structural characteristics of their opponents in their desire to locate and specify the origin of normative human value. For the Afrocentric position, the locus of this value is the continent of Africa. As a matter of fact, the two camps often claim the same personages as members of their respective traditions.

Abstract: In this remembering, I suggest, SPEP might find a possibility for differing from its own past. My point is not that our canon should include, alongside Derrida and Deleuze, Casey, Lingis, Grosz, Scott, and so on but, rather, to urge transgression of the boundaries of the canonization—or the memorialization—that has enacted itself through the task of bringing twentieth-century European philosophy to this continent and continuation of what we begin here: celebrating, witnessing, interrogating, and furthering our own thinking through and beyond the texts we have discovered and cherished and those we have generated over the last fifty years. As important as twentieth-century European philosophers have been to us and despite the fact that there are superb European thinkers active today, the fact is that most of what we call Continental philosophy now happens here, among us in this organization. In the twenty-first century

Abstract: Second, how do we account for the fact that the processes of public memory are both created by individual choices and nurtured in collective contexts? Many scholars have productively addressed this question by unpacking specific examples in which individuals or groups vie to control public memories. The critical framework I recommend offers a more systematic approach to this issue. To view representations of the past through the nested lenses of rhetoric, public memory, and the agential spiral is to focus on how human beings—individually and in groups—forge connections with people of other times through the medium of public agency. The agential spiral, derived from my reading of Ricoeur's “threefold mimesis,” aims to pinpoint three moments in the construction of narratives in which human action is represented and reinterpreted within a temporal structure. As a critical framework, the agential spiral helps us to view the creation of public memories at three key moments and to see the process as a coiling whole. Using this tool, we can better understand why certain memories persist in certain societies and how those memories powerfully connect people across time as well as space.<br>

Abstract: Nonetheless, the cost of what increasingly felt like a quixotic struggle for a mere critic was high. In a November 1897 review titled “On Pleasure Bent,” Shaw views his job as corporeal trauma, concluding that “trials [as a theater critic] have injured my brain.”
      
            He relates that he has lately “suffered … from seeing Shakespeare butchered to make a cockney's holiday” and determined to have a “real experience of some kind, under conditions, especially as regards fresh air, as unlike those of the stalls as possible” (378, 372). To remedy the toxic, stuffy artificiality of the theater, he heads “into the country, [selects] a dangerous hill, and [rides] down it on a bicycle at full speed in the darkest part of the night” (373, 372–73). When the doctor apologizes for the pain attendant upon stitching up the resulting “excessive openness of [his] countenance,” Shaw proclaims that “to him who has endured points made by actors for nearly three years, the point of a surgeon's darning needle comes as delicious relief” (373). In his review, GBS is unable to resist an opportunity to contrast implicitly the modern urban doctor and health system predicated on the profit motive with the care delivered by an Irish rustic physician possessing an “unperverted consciousness of [a] benevolent and sensible life” (375). He also is concerned that his treatment will irrevocably alter his relationship to his job as a critic:13
         
            When the physician refuses to charge for the services rendered (allegedly when he detects the playwright's ethnicity through his accent), Shaw acknowledges that his seat in the theater is also providedI doubt if I shall ever see a play again without longing for the comparative luxury of that quiet country surgery, with the stillness without broken only by the distant song and throbbing drumbeat of some remote Salvation Army corps, and the needle, with its delicate realism, touching my sensibilities, stitch, stitch, stitch, with ~<br>

Author(s): Matz Jesse<br>
Abstract: Mauriceis a novel that waits for the future (for completion, publication, and audience) but also looks nostagically to the past. This strange temporal location reflects a temporality basic to Forster's narrative structures and sexual identity: like philosophers who presently ascribe to the “tenseless theory of time,” Forster dispels identity among a tenseless order of moments, in a narrative structure that seeks likewise to trade “becoming” for a better order. InMaurice, such tactics as iterative seriality, overdetermined prolepsis, nonephiphany, and other modes of “detensing” give form to a version of homosexuality that would escape “identity,” with unusual implications for moderist temporality and narratological criticism. Forster's modernist time is eccentric for its interest in logical order; and the narratological criticism which would attend to his “tenseless” homosexual form must remember that it is often the combination of subversion and order that encourages the best narratological advances.<br>

Abstract: Elizabeth Bowen subjects both her characters and her readers to the dynamics of nostalgia in two of her novels.
         The House in ParisandThe Little Girlsare unique in Bowen'soeuvrein their use of “structural nostalgia”—a tripartite structure containing a section that takes place in the past put between two sections that take place in the present. Though this structure suggests that readers may simply engage in a nostalgic return along with the characters, Bowen uses it instead to force both her characters and her readers into a conscious examination of both the pleasures and the problems created by nostalgia.<br>

Date: 3 1, 1965<br>
Author(s): Steen Gerard<br>
Abstract: To provide a context for the essays published here, this introduction to the special issue on metonymy highlights a number of aspects of the cognitive-linguistic discussion of metonymy of the past twenty-five years. It briefly sketches the development of metonymy studies in poetics, linguistics, and philosophy, emphasizing that the cognitive-linguistic approach to metonymy of the past decades represents a return to the semantic views of metonymy advocated in structuralist semantics. This development was triggered by the extensive study of metaphor, but metonymy has now emancipated itself as an autonomous field of study that displays complex and unresolved relations with metaphor. This introduction also attends to the new insights added by cognitive linguistics to such a semantic approach to metonymy, suggesting that metonymy has indeed gone cognitive linguistic.<br>

Issue: utopianstudies.23.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 10 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: In synthesizing and problematizing aspects of both Utopian and dystopian discourses contemporary and antecedent to his own writing, Joyce is able to move beyond—and indeed to deconstruct—the polarizations inherent in these discourses. Tobin Siebers has written that “if modernism expresses the desire to capture a sense of wholeness, of the end of destiny pictured in single objects, be they
      Finnegans Wakeor a Brancusi sculpture, then the very concept of world war is modernist. It is in response to this concept that postmodernism will define itself.”
               Yet Siebers seems to have missed how open-ended, heteroglossic, and polysemic52
            Finnegans Wakein fact is. In its plurality of voices and perspectives, Joyce's work ultimately comes to refute the totalizing structures and absolutist strategies of the modernist period and comes to synthesize, as is surely the essence of the Utopian project, from the present and the past the radical possibilities of futurity—in a text that progresses modernism into postmodernism, a book that according to Valentine Cunningham “would not exist were it not for the pre-existence of historical texts and historical phenomena antecedent to it” and which Cunningham has described as “the absolute text of (post)modernism”
               —a text that projects the history of cultural tradition through its contemporary modernity into a pluralistic future, yet which is absolute only in that it is absolutely transitional.53<br>

Article Title: The Problematic of Architecture and Utopia<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: It is in this sense that Utopia can be understood as
      lying before us—in both senses of this confounding double phrase. Utopia resides in the past (beforein this instance means “behind us”) inasmuch as any reconsideration of Utopia in the present must inevitably begin with the past. But if the sources of Utopia in the present reside in the past, realization is in the future (beforein this instance means “ahead of us”). It is this double valence that links the articles that make up this special issue. Some deal with historical figures, literature, or places, while others take up analogous considerations that are closer to us now. However, in each case, the future is what is at issue: What shape will it take? How might the circumstances of its emergence be as propitious as possible? These key questions suffuse all of the articles that follow and are of the greatest urgency to all disciplines but in particular for architecture and urbanism, which are burdened with providing the stage upon which we play out the drama of our lives, individually and collectively.<br>

These functions are undermined by theRepublicanfamily's fear of reprisals for articulating a counter-discourse in theFrancoist New State, and the personal history of Sunta, the narrator inAlfons Cervera's

Sunta resolves this situation through the medium of narrative memory, which effects a retrospective uncovering of memory traces through images of the past, allowing her to revisit an inadequately assimilated childhood from an empowered position.El color del crepúsculo<br>

Abstract: In a period of immanent crisis when comprehensive historical narratives are no longer possible—nor is utopia—dystopia, or rather uchronia tinged with dystopia, seems to be a rather effective means to construct a sweeping historical narration. Through the “timeless time” of uchronia in which—as Ricoeur explains in
         Time and Narrative(vol. III)—“we are torn between two fleeing horizons” so that “our present sees itself in crisis,” Roth looks back at a counterfactual past in order to better investigate historical causality and to embrace past and present into a postmodern problematic perspective on the temporal dimension.<br>

Abstract: This essay argues that some recent Holocaust films introduce a new attitude towards memory that moves beyond the notion of postmemory while remaining committed to the project of remembering the past and creating an ethical response. The films by Marceline Loridan-Ivens and Robert Thalheim focus on future generations and their ability to relate to the Holocaust in an ethical way that avoids the problems of traumatization and commodification that mark earlier Holocaust film and commercial cinema, respectively.<br>
