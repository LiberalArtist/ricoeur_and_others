  Abstract: In the second main section of
                  Permanence and Change, near the end of the chapter entitled “The Range of Piety,” Kenneth Burke presents us with an unlikely vision. Imagine, says Burke, a scene where Matthew Arnold is found “loafing on the corner with the gashouse gang.” Picture Arnold studiously trying to ape the style of his buddies—the casual lean on the lamppost, the cut of a cap across the eyes, the demeanor of calculated indifference. It is a wildly implausible scene, and Arnold emerges as a hapless figure. Witness, says Burke, “the crudeness of his perception as regards the<br>

  Book Title: Memory Work-Anne Truitt and Sculpture<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): de Baca Miguel<br>
  Abstract: Memory Workdemonstrates the evolution of the pioneering minimalist sculptor Anne Truitt. An artist determined to make her way through a new aesthetic in the 1960s, Truitt was tireless in her pursuit of a strong cultural voice. At the heart of her practice was the key theme of memory, which enabled her not only to express personal experience but also to address how perception was changing for a contemporary viewership. She gravitated toward the idea that an object in one's focus could unleash a powerful return to the past through memory, which in turn brings a fresh, even critical, attention to the present moment. In addition to the artist's own popular published writings, which detail the unique challenges facing female artists,Memory Workdraws on unpublished manuscripts, private recordings, and never-before-seen working drawings to validate Truitt's original ideas about the link between perception and mnemonic reference in contemporary art. De Baca offers an insider's view of the artist's unstinting efforts to realize her artistic vision, as well as the cultural, political, and historical resonances her oeuvre has for us today.<br>

  Author(s) FISCHER MICHAEL M. J.<br>
  Abstract: Subjectivity is a ″vanishing subject,″ writes Amélie Oksenberg Rorty in this book′s opening chapter. As she traces the history of some of the philosophical insights that have shaped current understandings of subjectivity and the subject, Rorty finds not a progression but various contested movements and fragmentary meanings. Self-awareness has a different philosophical trajectory than individuated perception does; scholars have emphasized a diachronically unified persona and, at times, posed it against a synchronically unified persona; the meanings of emotions, the body, social interactions, and suffering as subjectivity have all been areas of contestation. For example, according to Rorty, ″Where Aristotle finds<br>

  Abstract: Dead people, in popular Vietnamese culture, can be powerfully sentient and salient beings who entertain emotions, intentions, and historical awareness. The ethnological literature about their mortuary customs and religious imaginations confirms this. Remembering ancestors means, in Vietnam, according to Le Van Dinh, relating to them “as if they were alive.”¹ A French Jesuit missionary to Vietnam and author of classical studies on Vietnamese popular religions, Léopold Cadière, wrote that the Vietnamese perception of the world incorporates the awareness that the life of the dead is intertwined with that of the living, and that the Vietnamese idealize a harmonious relationship between<br>

  Abstract: Recent emphasis, stemming primarily from the work of P. O. Kristeller, on the central importance of rhetoric for Renaissance humanism, has enabled us to understand the underlying unity of a singularly complex movement; and it has proved singularly fruitful for Renaissance scholarship. At the same time, since this approach depends on the identification of a kind of lowest common denominator for humanism, it may also have the unintended effect of reducing our perception of its rich variety and thus of limiting our grasp of its historical significance. I should like, accordingly, to begin with Kristeller’s fundamental insight, but then to<br>

In studying Pentecostalism, essentialist and normative tendencies may also stem from the identity of Pentecostalism itself and from its perception by others. Any scholar studying this form of Christianity must therefore reflect on them, especially when interdisciplinary work is proposed. The overview given in this chapter serves to raise scholarly awareness of the pitfalls connected with essentialist and normative approaches.

  Abstract: Some of my previous remarks may suggest that our basic human impulse to metonymize or demetaphorize attained to its most triumphant moment in the Christian culture of the High Middle Ages. There if anywhere the unconscious and mechanical prejudices of language and perception were most fully reinforced by the flowering of a highly sophisticated and articulate cultural consciousness fashioned in the same mode and shaped by the same prejudices.

  Abstract: Many of the difficulties modern readers experience with

Consequently, to presume, as the narrator frequently does, that he manifests supreme goodness seems a mockery of truth. Offended, moderns may retort that, far from being supremely good and deserving worship, the Father deserves to be repudiated as evil. Jung's analytical psychology, however, offers a more refined perception, which promotes a more balanced response.<br>

  Abstract: Every community that wants to last beyond a single generation must concern itself with education. Education has to do with the maintenance of a community through the generations. This maintenance must assure enough continuity of vision, value, and perception so that the community sustains its self-identity. At the same time, such maintenance must assure enough freedom and novelty so that the community can survive in and be pertinent to new circumstances.¹ Thus, education must attend to processes of both continuity and discontinuity in order to avoid fossilizing into irrelevance on the one hand, and relativizing into disappearance on the other<br>

  Abstract: “Just as we reject the principle of divorcing faith and works, so we reject the principle and the practice of divorcing the life of faith and the life of study,” wrote Father Leo Ward of the University of Notre Dame in 1961.¹ Describing the ideal for the Catholic school, Ward’s rejection invites reflection on Catholic intellectual life. However, this comment, which might galvanize Catholic professors who perceive themselves as exemplars of the ideal, might also solicit quite a different reaction from those outside the professionally academic arena. The public perception of Catholicism does not always incline toward a scholastic tradition.<br>

Whereas religion was previously dismissed as irrelevant and kept apart from more respectable objects of intellectual discussions, it has emerged as the focus of numerous, though not always well-informed, discussions. This surge in interest follows a worldwide resurgence of religion in the modern world that even the most hardened secularists find hard to deny.

  Abstract: Friedrich Nietzsche famously stated: “There are no facts, only interpretations.”¹ Perhaps this could be slightly rephrased: no facts go uninterpreted. There are simply no bare facts, at least if a fact is to be meaningful. Every fact has meaning only in relation to other facts, to context, and to the human understanding itself. In other words, at the heart of every confrontation of concept and perception is the issue of

  Book Title: Phenomenologies of the Stranger: Between Hostility and Hospitality-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: What is strange? Or better, who is strange? When do we encounter the strange? We encounter strangers when we are not at home: when we are in a foreign land or a foreign part of our own land. From Freud to Lacan to Kristeva to Heidegger, the feeling of strangeness-das Unheimlichkeit-has marked our encounter with the other, even the other within our self. Most philosophical attempts to understand the role of the Stranger, human or transcendent, have been limited to standard epistemological problems of other minds, metaphysical substances, body/soul dualism and related issues of consciousness and cognition. This volume endeavors to take the question of hosting the stranger to the deeper level of embodied imagination and the senses (in the Greek sense of aisthesis). This volume plays host to a number of encounters with the strange. It asks such questions as: How does the embodied imagination relate to the Stranger in terms of hospitality or hostility (given the common root of hostis as both host and enemy)? How do we distinguish between projections of fear or fascination, leading to either violence or welcome? How do humans sensethe dimension of the strange and alien in different religions, arts, and cultures? How do the five physical senses relate to the spiritual senses, especially the famous sixthsense, as portals to an encounter with the Other? Is there a carnal perception of alterity, which would operate at an affective, prereflective, preconscious level? What exactly do embodied imaginariesof hospitality and hostility entail, and how do they operate in language, psychology, and social interrelations (including racism, xenophobia, and scapegoating)? And what, finally, are the topical implications of these questions for an ethics and practice of tolerance and peace?<br>

The philosopher saw the painter as a paradigm example of the essence of perception.¹ As he writes, “Cézanne did not think he had to choose between feeling and thought, between order and chaos. He did not want to separate the stable things which we see and the shifting way in which they appear; he wanted to depict matter as it takes on form, the birth of order through spontaneous organization” (Merleau-Ponty 1964 [1945]: 13).<br>

  Author(s) Franck Didier<br>
  Abstract: One of the most prominent connections between Nietzsche’s thought and the entire phenomenological enterprise lies in Husserl’s founding postulate that the thing-in-itself is an invalid concept. Although Husserl never formulates it explicitly, the development of phenomenology demonstrates the root of this invalidity: the thing-in-itself is a contradiction insofar as a thing is, by definition and by essence, always an object of perception. This is also, of course, one of Nietzsche’s most explicit, best established, and most consistently repeated claims, and perhaps one that has the greater consequence within the overall economy of his thought. Indeed this connection suggests a kinship<br>

In her perception, the mix of womanhood, philosophy, and religion seemed incongruous, not to mention the even stranger notion of a woman claiming to teach Christian philosophy at a Christian university in a country with a political reputation which at the time certainly raised questions about the authenticity of Christianity.

  Abstract: In a recent exchange in the journal

Focused on their conflicting interpretations of Abram’s popular bookThe Spell of the Sensuous(1996), and eventually resting on their divergent readings of Merleau-Ponty’sPhenomenology of Perception(1962),¹ Toadvine and Abram each attempt to address a set of ontological questions that are, I think, foundational for environmental philosophy: How can we understand the human body as a particular site of perceptions of, and interactions with, the more-than-human world?

  Abstract: Finland, a sparsely populated Nordic country with 5.4 million inhabitants, has a fast-growing and disproportionately large video game culture and industry. Combining high technology with the spirit of experimentation, Finnish game design has managed to join other Finnish success stories in high technology, such as the Linux operating system and Nokia mobile phones. On the other hand, the public perception of gaming in Finland has often been conflicted. The studies conducted have nevertheless revealed Finns of all ages to be rather active game players.<br>

  Abstract: In my book

This assumption had far-reaching consequences, opening the door for a subsequent understanding of architecture as a “sign,” whose meaning was articulated as the<br>

  Abstract: As this volume makes abundantly clear, Bonhoeffer’s influence has travelled far and wide. However, it perhaps finds its most concentrated and controversial manifestation in the 1960s with the rise of liberation and radical theology.¹ Both perspectives used Bonhoeffer to revolutionize doctrinal hermeneutics, stripping away the suffocating layers that a powerful, privileged, Western interpretation had laid over our perception of God. However, it was not just in the realm of doctrine, but also ethics, that such a revolutionary archaeology came to light. In 1966 Joseph Fletcher published his immensely popular

Eliot accused Matthew Arnold of distinguishing too bluntly between critical and creative. “He overlooks the capital importance of criticism in the work of creation itself.” Eliot’s perception was, of course, partially based on the literary work of French writers since Flaubert and Baudelaire, including Mallarmé, Laforgue, and Valéry.

  Author(s) WABEL THOMAS<br>
  Abstract: In his categorial semiotics and phenomenology, Charles Sanders Peirce arrives at a fundamental triadic structure that, he claims, shapes all possible experience and reality alike. The subject—seen as the “interpretant” in a triadic semiotic process—becomes an instance in the self-interpretation of the universe of signs. Thus, perception of reality and reality itself coincide. This can be experienced in what Peirce calls the category of “Firstness.” Following Peirce, the contemplation of reality in the immediate experience of its quality (Firstness) is a phenomenological task. In Peirce’s “humble argument” for the reality of God, the experience of Firstness can account<br>

  Book Title: Reading Daniel as a Text in Theological Hermeneutics-  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Hebbard Aaron B.<br>
  Abstract: Reading Daniel as a Text in Theological Hermeneutics sets out to read the book of Daniel as a narrative textbook in the field of theological hermeneutics. Employing such disciplines as historical criticism, literary criticism, narrative theology, and hermeneutics, this work seeks to maintain an interdisciplinary outlook on the book of Daniel. Two inherently linked perspectives are utilized in this reading of Daniel. First is the perception that the character of Daniel is the paradigm of the good theological hermeneut; theology and hermeneutics are inseparable and converge in the character of Daniel. Readers must recognize in Daniel certain qualities, attitudes, abilities, and convictions well worth emulating. Essentially, readers must aspire to become a Daniel. Second is the standpoint that the book of Daniel on the whole should be read as a hermeneutics textbook. Readers are led through a series of theories and exercises meant to be instilled into their theological, intellectual, and practical lives. Attention to readers is a constant endeavor throughout this thesis. The concern is fundamentally upon contemporary readers and their communities, yet with sensible consideration given to the historical readerly community with which contemporary readers find continuity. Greater concentration is placed on what the book of Daniel means for contemporary readers than on what the book of Daniel meant in its historical setting. In the end, readers are left with difficult challenges, a sobering awareness of the volatility of the business of hermeneutics, and serious implications for readers to implement both theologically and hermeneutically.<br>

Classical sociological theory reflected the modern appreciation of the independence of ‘the social’ relative to ‘the political’ and the need to understand the internal dynamics of ‘the social’ in their own terms. In a stronger sense, sociological theory suggested that<br>

  Abstract: Indisputably, gender has been a fundamental organizing principle in Western societies.¹ Intrinsic to the conceptualization of gender is a dichotomy in which male and female, man and woman, are constantly and binarily ranked, both in relationship to and against each other. It has been well documented that the categories of male and female in Western social practice are not free of hierarchical associations and binary oppositions in which the male implies privilege and the female subordination. It is a duality based on a perception of human sexual dimorphism inherent in the definition of gender. Yorùbá society, like many other societies<br>

  Book Title: Precarious Visualities-New Perspectives on Identification in Contemporary Art and Visual Culture<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Ross Christine<br>
  Abstract: Through the study of exemplary media works and practices - photography, film, video, performance, installations, web cams - scholars from various disciplines call attention to the unsettling of identification and the disablement of vision in contemporary aesthetics. To look at an image that prevents the stabilization of identification, identity and place; to perceive a representation that oscillates between visibility and invisibility; to relate to an image which entails a rebalancing of sight through the valorization of other senses; to be exposed, through surveillance devices, to the gaze of new figures of authority - the aesthetic experiences examined here concern a spectator whose perception lacks in certainty, identification, and opticality what it gains in fallibility, complexity, and interrelatedness. Precarious Visualities provides a new understanding of spectatorship as a relation that is at once corporeal and imaginary, and persistently prolific in its cultural, social, and political effects.

Perception in real time is an indispensable prerogative of any ar design – and I adopt here Ronald Azuma et al.’s definition of AR as a system that “supplements the realworld with virtual (computer-generated) objects that appear to coexist in the same space as the realworld”¹ – if it is to adequately do<br>

  Author(s): Wilson James Matthew<br>
  Abstract: Ours is an age full of desires but impoverished in its understanding of where those desires lead-an age that claims mastery over the world but also claims to find the world as a whole absurd or unintelligible. In
      The Vision of the Soul, James Matthew Wilson seeks to conserve the great insights of the western tradition by giving us a new account of them responsive to modern discontents. The western- or Christian Platonist-tradition, he argues, tells us that man is an intellectual animal, born to pursue the good, to know the true, and to contemplate all things in beauty. Wilson begins by reconceiving the intellectual conservatism born of Edmund Burke's jeremiad against the French Revolution as an eff­ort to preserve the West's vision of man and the cosmos as ordered by and to beauty. After defining the achievement of that vision and its tradition, Wilson off­ers an extended study of the nature of beauty and the role of the fine arts in shaping a culture but above all in opening the human intellect to the perception of the form of reality. Through close studies of Theodor W. Adorno and Jacques Maritain, he recovers the classical vision of beauty as a revelation of truth and being. Finally, he revisits the ancient distinction between reason and story-telling, between mythos and logos, in order to rejoin the two.Story-telling is foundational to the forms of the fine arts, but it is no less foundational to human reason. Human life in turn constitutes a specific kind of form-a story form. The ancient conception of human life as a pilgrimage to beauty itself is one that we can fully embrace only if we see the essential correlation between reason and story and the essential convertibility of truth, goodness and beauty in beauty. By turns a study in fundamental ontology, aesthetics, and political philosophy, Wilson's book invites its readers to a renewal of the West's intellectual tradition.<br>

  Abstract: La presente Tesis estudia las relaciones entre la ciencia y la poesía. Nuestro trabajo aborda el modo en que el conocimiento científico modula la creación literaria, así como algunos de los procedimientos del pensamiento literario. Las hipótesis de investigación reposan sobre dos niveles de la escritura de Lorand Gaspar: la dimensión epistemológica del discurso poético y su valor cognitivo. A partir del análisis de un corpus literario se propone una metodología de estudio que atiende a la complejidad epistemológica y cognitiva de la enunciación poética. Tres apartados teóricos organizan la investigación de algunos de los procesos del pensamiento poético: percepción, emoción y metáfora. Lo anterior se enmarca en una argumentación que favorece la transdisciplinariedad mediante estrategias de análisis literario que integran consideraciones de carácter interdisciplinar.This thesis studies the relations between Science and Poetry. The research approaches the way in which the scientific knowledge modulates the literary creation, as well as some of the procedures of the literary thought. The hypotheses of investigation rest on two levels of Lorand Gaspar’s writing: the epistemological dimension and the cognitive value of the poetic discourse. Based on the analysis of a literary corpus this research proposes a methodology of study that attends to the epistemological and cognitive complexity of the lyrical enunciation. Three theoretical chapters organize the investigation of some of the processes of the poetical thought: Perception, Emotion and Metaphor.

  Abstract: Any cognitive psychology of dreaming must encounter and reconcile two statements: “the dream is a story” and “the dream is imagery.” Neither statement is as obvious as it initially appears, I I because there is no agreement in contemporary cognitive psychology on the ultimate relation between visual-spatial imagery and language. Much evidence and theory supports both the view that a visual-spatial imagistic intelligence rests directly on and creatively reorganizes the processes of perception and the view that mental imagery is a surface paraphrase of abstract propositional knowledge, whose deep structure is accordingly far closer to verbal syntax than visual imagery.<br>

  Book Title: The Music of Béla Bartók-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): WILSON PAUL<br>
  Abstract: According to Wilson, earlier critics of Bartók's music have often sought to discover an unvarying precompositional system that accounted for individual musical events. Wilson's approach is different in that he develops a way to explore each work within the musical contexts that the work itself creates and sustains. Wilson begins by discussing a number of fundamental musical materials that Bartók employed throughout his oeuvre. Using these materials as foundations, he then describes a series of flexible, behaviorally defined harmonic functions and a model of pitch hierarchy based on the functions and on several connective designs. Wilson shows how these hierarchical structures provide meaningful forces for coherence and for dynamism and progressional drive in the music. After analyzing the five works from Bartók's oeuvre, he concludes by explaining the philosophical similarities between his theory and the work of David Lewin and Charles Taylor in the related fields of perception and hermeneutics.<br>

  Book Title: Metaphysics in Ordinary Language-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Rosen Stanley<br>
  Abstract: In this rich collection of philosophical writings, Stanley Rosen addresses a wide range of topics-from eros, poetry, and freedom to problems like negation and the epistemological status of sense perception. Though diverse in subject, Rosen's essays share two unifying principles: there can be no legitimate separation of textual hermeneutics from philosophical analysis, and philosophical investigation must be oriented in terms of everyday language and experience, although it cannot simply remain within these confines. Ordinary experience provides a minimal criterion for the assessment of extraordinary discourses, Rosen argues, and without such a criterion we would have no basis for evaluating conflicting discourses: philosophy would give way to poetry.Philosophical problems are not so deeply embedded in a specific historical context that they cannot be restated in terms as valid for us today as they were for those who formulated them, the author maintains. Rosen shows that the history of philosophy-a story of conflicting interpretations of human life and the structure of intelligibility-is a story that comes to life only when it is rethought in terms of the philosophical problems of our own personal and historical situation.<br>

  Abstract: What is the relation between mystical experience and ordinary consciousness, between the principles of modern physics and the patterns of perception in all moving creatures, between our human self-consciousness and the more primary sentience of protozoa? This book pursues an inquiry into consciousness that ranges from ancient Greece to empirical neuro-psychology to the experiential traditions of introspection and meditation. Harry Hunt begins by reviewing the renewed interest in ordinary consciousness and in altered and transpersonal states of consciousness. He then presents competing views of consciousness in cognition, neurophysiology, and animal psychology, developing a view of perceptual awareness as the core of consciousness potentially shared across species. Hunt next brings together the separate strands of neo-realist approaches to perception and thought, the phenomenology of imagery and synesthesia, and cognitive theories of metaphor. He develops an original cognitive theory of mystical experience that combines Buddhist meditative descriptions of consciousness and Heidegger's sense of Being. In relating both of these to James J. Gibson's views on perception, he avoids the various "new age" supernaturalisms that so often blight the transpersonal literature. Other themes include the relation between consciousness and time; the common perceptual-metaphoric rooting of parallels between consciousness and modern physics; and the communal basis of transpersonal states as reflected in a sociology of mysticism and a reinterpretation of parapsychological research.<br>

  Abstract: We have been dealing with the cognitive processes that underlie experiences which we have variously termed higher states of consciousness, transpersonal experience, or presentational states. These have been understood as a reconstitution on the level of symbolic cognition of presence-openness as the basic structure of perception in motile sentient creatures. Horizonal openness and the flow gradients of the ambient array are “real,” “existent,” and inherent to the structure of sentience, but would only be realized as such, as felt meaning for its own sake, on the human level. Presence-openness emerges into presentational symbolic cognition through the synesthetic translation of the<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bzfp">Paul and Scripture</a><br>
  Author(s) Stanley Christopher D.<br>
  Abstract: The vocabulary and cadences of Scripture—particularly of the LXX—are imprinted deeply on Paul’s mind, and the great stories of Israel continue to serve for him as a fund of symbols and metaphors that condition his perception of the world, of God’s promised deliverance of his people, and of his own identity and calling. His faith, in short, is one whose articulation is inevitably intertextual in character, and Israel’s Scripture is the “determinate subtext that plays a constitutive role” in shaping his literary production.¹<br>

  Abstract: In Canada, it appears that biblical scholars do not often avail themselves of the opportunity to reflect on how their political, historical, and social contexts impact their work on the Bible.¹ This does not mean that Canadian biblical scholarship is not “engaged”; rather, I suspect that it has more to do with a perception that there is not much about biblical studies in this country that marks it as distinct—as any different, say, from American biblical studies in general.² In fact, the reluctance to think about what makes biblical studies in this country

  Abstract: “I think fiction rescues history from its confusions.” This tentative assertion in one of the rare interviews with Don DeLillo could draw a hail of objections from historians, as it insinuates, with confident and serious nonchalance (DeLillo’s characteristic style), that history is confused.

  Abstract: It was Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten’s
                  Aesthetica(1750), which gave the new discipline of aesthetics its name. Aesthetics was concerned with a special faculty of perception that Baumgarten titled “sensuous knowledge” (cognitio sensitiva). In contrast to clear and distinct conceptual knowledge, sensuous knowledge is acognitio confusa, a confused knowledge form. “It is not aimed at distinctions; it pursues an animated intertwinement of aspects even when it is a matter of a stationary object. It lingers at a process of appearing,” Martin Seel remarks.¹ These processes of aesthetic appearing involve compounds of sensation or what I will call figures of sensation.<br>

  Book Title: The Reparative in Narratives-Works of Mourning in Progress<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROSELLO MIREILLE<br>
  Abstract: The authors studied in this book can be visualized as the islands that constitute an unknown, fragile and trembling literary and cultural Francophone archipelago. The archipelago does not appear on any map, in the middle of an ocean whose name we already know. No Francophone anthology would put these authors together as a matter of course because what connects them is a narrative grammar rather than a national origin or even a language. Yet, their writing techniques and their apprehension of the real (the ways in which they know and name the world) both reflect and actively participate in our evolving perception of what Gayatri Spivak calls the “planet”. The Reparative in Narratives argues that argue that they repair trauma through writing. One description of these awe-inspiring, tender and sometimes horrifying tales is that their narrators are survivors who have experienced and sometimes inflicted unspeakable acts of violence. And yet, ultimately, despair, nihilism, cynicism or silence are never the consequences of their encounter with what some quickly call evil. The traumatic event has not killed them and has not killed their desire to write or perform, although the decidedly altered life that they live in the aftermath of the disaster forces them to become different types of storytellers. They are the first-person narrators of their story, and their narration reinvents them as speaking subjects. In turn, this requires that we accept new reading pacts. That pact is a temporal and geographical signature: the reparative narrative needs readers prepared to accept that healing belongs to the realm of possibilities and that exposure and denunciation do not exhaust the victim’s range of possibilities. Rosello contends that this context-specific yet repeating pattern constitutes a response to the contemporary figuration of both globalized and extremely localized types of traumatic memories.<br>

  Abstract: Over the past two decades, postcolonial studies – or postcolonial theory – has firmly established itself within the Anglophone academy. In France, however, the perception of this critical body of thought labours under a certain number of misconceptions that have rendered the development of an equivalent ‘hexagonal’ movement deeply problematic, and have given rise instead to a determined opposition in the general ‘intellectual field’. By ‘intellectual field’ we mean the broad domain constituted by publications and debates in the social sciences, particularly sociology, history, political sciences and, more marginally, anthropology.

  Abstract: Aesthetics as a philosophical discipline arose in the middle of the 18th century, when art came to be defined as an autonomous field of rules, social practices, and institutions (like museums). For that historical reason, aesthetics is not just “art theory,” as it articulates both more general and more particular issues, for instance: perception through the senses, the definition of beauty, judgment of taste, the truth content of an artwork and its relationship to (physical, psychological, economic etc.) reality, the questions of originality and newness; eventually, the definition and the very possibility of “art” itself, which becomes a serious matter<br>

  Abstract: The act of interpretation occurs in nearly every area of the arts and sciences.

Individual topics include: the general nature of interpretation and its forms; comparing and contrasting interpretation and hermeneutics; culture as interpretation seen through Hegel's aesthetics; interpreting philosophical texts; methodologies for interpreting human action; interpretation in medical practice focusing on manifestations as indicators of disease; the brain and its interpretative, structured, learning and storage processes; interpreting hybrid wines and cognitive preconceptions of novel objects; and the importance of sensory perception as means of interpreting in the case of dry German Rieslings.In an interesting turn, Nicholas Rescher writes on the interpretation of philosophical texts. Then Catherine Wilson and Andreas Blank explicate and critique Rescher's theories through analysis of the mill passage from Leibniz's

  Abstract: What does it mean to live during wartime away from the battle zone? What is it like for citizens to go about daily routines while their country sends soldiers to kill and be killed across the globe? Timely and thought-provoking,
         War at a Distanceconsiders how those left on the home front register wars and wartime in their everyday lives, particularly when military conflict remains removed from immediate perception, available only through media forms. Looking back over two centuries, Mary Favret locates the origins of modern wartime in the Napoleonic era and describes how global military operations affected the British populace, as the nation's army and navy waged battles far from home for decades. She reveals that the literature and art produced in Britain during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries obsessively cultivated means for feeling as much as understanding such wars, and established forms still relevant today.<br>

As a form of relational spatialization, however, it incorporates the opposing dimensions of the homonym routes/roots. Traveling is a concept that depends upon the notion of stasis to be comprehensible. Routes are pathways between here and there, two points of rootedness.

  Abstract: The modern Western tradition of utopian writing, rooted in More’s

Although this mentality has been variously characterized, one of its firm bases is the epistemological concern for verifiable ways of knowing and measuring reality. Tracing the beginnings of this way of thinking in the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance, the comparatist Timothy J.

  Abstract: Twelfth-century writers assimilated and transformed a tradition of the conceptual unity of all the arts and attributed that unity to the fact that art both conceals and discloses. Recovering that tradition, especially the methods and motives of concealment, provides extraordinary insights into twelfth-century ideas about the kingdom of God, the status of women, and the nature of time itself. It also identifies a strain in European thought that had striking affinities to methods of perception familiar in Oriental religions and that proved to be antithetic to later humanist traditions in the West.<br>

  Abstract: Until postmodern revisionism altered our perception of modernist poetry, the consensus was that modernism represented an essentially stylistic revolution: an abandonment of the vague, suggestive, and mellifluous verse of the Aesthetes for a direct, ironic, and spare verse style. Eliot, of course, was seen to be the principal architect of this change, with some assistance from Pound and his Imagist movement. Stevens’ marginalization was in considerable part a consequence of his failure to participate in this stylistic shift, because of his persistence in a mode more compatible with the Aesthetes or the Symbolists, who preceded them.

  Abstract: Towards the end of the second millennium, the issue of whether fragmentation is part of modernity is no longer in dispute. In many spheres of human endeavour and perception, phenomena linked with fragmentation express a general diversification in social and cultural life. One only has to think of the social division of labour which has distanced architecture from engineering, and both of these professions from urban studies in the social sciences as well as in the humanities. Furthermore, fragmentation has had profound spatial consequences, since privately owned parcels of space are used for construction rather independently of one another. In<br>

  The Latin American Experience from:

  Abstract: The different opinions expressed during the French Revolution crystallize conceptions of the individual and society that the
                     philosopheshad entertained but never completely developed. On the whole, the revolutionary ideologies expressed values that were far from liberal; thus they provided fertile ground for the emergence of the intellectuals. TheDéclaration des droits de I’homme et du citoyen(1789) together with the writings of Sieyès, who is quite representative of his time, and the discourse of the Jacobins, show a convergence of ideas that share a perception of reason and its function in the workings of society.<br>

  Book Title: Philosophy of Merleau-Ponty-  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Matthews Eric<br>
  Abstract: In this clear and comprehensive account of Merleau-Ponty's thought Eric Matthews shows how Merleau-Ponty has contributed to current debates in philosophy, such as the nature of consciousness, the relation between biology and personality, the historical understanding of human thought and society, and many others. Surveying the whole range of Merleau-Ponty's thinking, Matthews examines his views about the nature of phenomenology and the primacy of perception; his account of human embodiment, being-in-the-world, and the understanding of human behaviour; his conception of the self and its relation to other selves; and his views on society, politics, and the arts. A final chapter considers his later thought, published posthumously. The ideas of Merleau-Ponty are of immensely important to the development of modern French philosophy. Matthews evaluates his distinctive contributions and relates his thought to that of his predecessors, contemporaries, and successors, both in France and elsewhere. This unrivalled introduction will be welcomed by analytic philosophers and cognitive scientists as well as all students taking courses in contemporary continental philosophy.<br>

  Book Title: The Rhetorical Emergence of Culture-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Girke Felix<br>
  Abstract: "Just as rhetoric is founded in culture, culture is founded in rhetoric" - the first half of this central statement from the International Rhetoric Culture Project is abundantly evidenced. It is the latter half that this volume explores: how does culture emerge out of rhetorical action, out of seemingly dispersed individual actions and interactions? The contributors do not rely on rhetorical "text" alone but engage the situational, bodily, and often antagonistic character of cultural and communicative practices. The social situation itself is argued to be the fundamental site of cultural creation, as will-driven social processes are shaped by cognitive dispositions and shape them in turn. Drawing on expertise in a variety of disciplines and regions, the contributors critically engage dialogical approaches in their emphasis on how a view from rhetoric changes our perception of people's intersubjective and conjoint creation of culture.<br>

  Abstract: I believe there is an anti-Muslim wind blowing across the European continent. One factor is the perception that Muslims are making politically exceptional, culturally unreasonable or theologically alien demands upon European states. Against that, I wish to say, that the claims Muslims are making, in fact, parallel comparable arguments about gender or ethnic equality. Seeing the issue in that context shows how European and contemporary is the logic of mainstream Muslim identity politics. Additionally I shall argue that multicultural politics must embrace what I call a moderate secularism, and resist a radical secularism.<br>

Seeing is therefore a form of knowledge. Travel (whether actual or virtual) and acquisition of knowledge about the world are indelibly linked.

  Abstract: The argument about the relationship between time and narrative is now coming into focus. It begins in the Kantian notion that we have no access to things in themselves, but only, as phenomenology holds, to things as they are experienced, apprehended in consciousness, thought about, or understood. But the concept of consciousness cannot be taken for granted. Philosophy in general, both in the phenomenological and in the Anglo-American analytical traditions, has turned to language in order to investigate the realms of experience, perception, thought and understanding.

Color morphs and moves. Insector angel-like, it “flits from one form to the next,” rendering each lively if not alive. This undifferentiated relation to color as substance radicalizes perception. It ties color to the objects that play host to it such that the visual becomes tactile. Color becomes transitive or transactional. Color happens. It happens to you, through you.<br>

In earlier times, of course, intellectuals questioned the strictures of religious and political tradition. Some of them even served as the conscience of their epochs. But the self-perception of the intellectual as both the critic and the reformer of society, as committed to a communal project of social change, is the legacy of what the philosophe Pierre Bayle first called the “republic of letters.” Its citizens would endeavor to address popular audiences in addition to academic ones. They fervently believed that “the most fundamental ideas<br>

  Abstract: In the introductory remarks to his early study
                  Grundrechte als Institution(Basic rights as an institution), Niklas Luhmann (1965) observed that the task at hand was to replace the old-European “reason of perception”(Vernehmen)with the “reason of comparison”(Vergleich)(8). In so doing, he quoted the title of a book by Ernst Cassirer (to which he has referred on many other occasions, as well). The latter’sSubstance and Function(2003 [1910]) addresses precisely this transition from substance, which may be “heard” or “seen”(vernehmbare Substanz), to function, which admits comparison (or, alternatively, represents functional equivalence).

  Abstract: It is a defining feature of war stories that issues of memory and history strangely intersect. War stories are often the stories of individual soldiers. However, due to the peculiar nature of their content relating to major collective endeavours, suffering and sacrifice, these stories quickly adopt major significance for the self-perception and self-legitimisation of collectives. Initially published as memoires, or historical novels written by men directly involved in the events under consideration, many of the tales are subsequently adapted to screen. As movies ‘based on true stories’, they reach far greater audiences and become important instruments for the social construction<br>

  Book Title: Ecosickness in Contemporary U.S. Fiction-Environment and Affect<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): HOUSER HEATHER<br>
  Abstract: Tracing the development of ecosickness through a compelling archive of modern U.S. novels and memoirs, this study demonstrates the mode's crucial role in shaping thematic content and formal and affective literary strategies. Examining works by David Foster Wallace, Richard Powers, Leslie Marmon Silko, Marge Piercy, Jan Zita Grover, and David Wojnarowicz, Heather Houser shows how these authors unite experiences of environmental and somatic damage through narrative affects that draw attention to ecological phenomena, organize perception, and convert knowledge into ethics. Traversing contemporary cultural studies, ecocriticism, affect studies, and literature and medicine, Houser juxtaposes ecosickness fiction against new forms of environmentalism and technoscientific innovations such as regenerative medicine and alternative ecosystems.
      Ecosickness in Contemporary U.S. Fictionrecasts recent narrative as a laboratory in which affective and perceptual changes both support and challenge political projects.<br>

  Abstract: The Italian philosopher and politician Gianni Vattimo is best known for his concept of “weak thought” (

In his most recent work, Vattimo has argued for a “hermeneutic communism,” a communism stripped of grand metaphysical assumptions that seeks to stem the tide of capitalism by working on concrete issues—in particular, historical communities. While Vattimo derives his thinking from Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Gadamer, in the worksBelief(1999) andAfter Christianity(2002) he has also articulated weak thought in terms<br>

The influence of Bourdieu’s sociology, albeit updated and adapted, is traceable in the various approaches many museums adopt to overcome cultural barriers in their public perception and community engagement (Merriman 1991; Fyfe 2006; Prior 2005; Barrett 2011).

  Abstract: When we look back in history, our perception of differences is foreshortened in time the way our perception of the horizon reduces distinctions in space. A millennium of the ancient world boils down to antiquity. The centuries from 800 to 1500 can be amalgamated into medievalism. Early modern periods are spoken of as homogeneous ages. Not only are ages and centuries homogenized, movements such as the Reformation or the Renaissance acquire a monolithic aspect. The equalizing resolution of phenomena distances them from one another by eliminating nuances and ambiguities. An example of such leveling is our perception of the 1587<br>

  Book Title: Christians and Jews in Angevin England-The York Massacre of 1190, Narratives and Contexts<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Watson Sethina<br>
  Abstract: The mass suicide and murder of the men, women and children of the Jewish community in York on 16 March 1190 is one of the most scarring events in the history of Anglo-Judaism, and an aspect of England's medieval past which is widely remembered around the world. However, the York massacre was in fact only one of a series of attacks on communities of Jews across England in 1189-90; they were violent expressions of wider new constructs of the nature of Christian and Jewish communities, and the targeted outcries of local townspeople, whose emerging urban politics were enmeshed within the swiftly developing structures of royal government. This new collection considers the massacre as central to the narrative of English and Jewish history around 1200. Its chapters broaden the contexts within which the narrative is usually considered and explore how a narrative of events in 1190 was built up, both at the time and in following years. They also focus on two main strands: the role of narrative in shaping events and their subsequent perception; and the degree of 'convivencia' between Jews and Christians and consideration of the circumstances and processes through which neighbours became enemies and victims.

  Abstract: Hanslick’s 1854 treatise 
                  Vom Musikalisch-Schönen entered the canon of musical aesthetics as an essentially negative formulation of musical beauty, claiming more what beautiful music is not than what it is. Thus, in order to demonstrate what he could not clearly posit in terms of pure sound, Hanslick employed a theory of musical perception as a more substantive criterion of judgment, drawing on various manifestations of listening to describe the effects of musical beauty. This approach led Hanslick to examine the incompetent musical listener as thoroughly as he did the competent listener, the true disciple of the beautiful. As Nicholas Cook<br>

Abstract: Soteriology,from the Greeksoterion,“salvation,” is the branch of theology that deals with salvation (especially through Christ). The soteriological dimension of alchemy is not directly aimed at a physico‐theology of resurrection. In the thirteenth century, the Oxford Franciscan Roger Bacon looked for ways to give the body incorruptibility and prolonged youth through alchemy, not for youth’s sake, but to prepare it for resurrection and eternal life. The chief means was the consumption of drinkable gold, the incorruptible matter par excellence and a symbol of the equilibrium of the microcosm; see Agostino Paravicini Bagliani, “Storia della scienza e storia della mentalità: Ruggero Bacone, Bonifacio VIII e la teoria della ‘prolongatio vitae,’” inAspetti della letteratura latina nel secolo XIII,ed. Claudio Leonardi and Giovanni Orlandi (Spoleto, 1992), pp. 243–80. After the Reformation, alchemy became entangled with apocalyptic expectations. Its success during the seventeenth century is linked to the perception that it carried “the secret of life itself, and with it the secrets of resurrection, of immortality, of perfection, of final salvation and Beatitude” (Betty Jo Teeter Dobbs, “Alchemical Death and Resurrection: The Significance of Alchemy in the Age of Newton,” inScience, Pseudo‐science, and Utopianism in Early Modern Thought,ed.

Abstract: Looking at the books and articles that established the second paradigm, one cannot but be struck by the absence of linguistic relativity as a topic or issue. More generally, between the early 1960s and the late 1970s the issue of the relationship between language and mind dropped out of the research agenda of adherents of the second paradigm. The few who continued to be preoccupied with linguistic relativity were Whorfs critics, for example, Berlin and Kay, who were operating with theoretical presuppositions (innatism, universality) and a methodology (elicitation with no recording of spontaneous speech) alien to adherents of the second paradigm. As Kay became more interested in syntax and prototype semanticsand moved out of the anthropology department at the University of California at Berkeley to join the department of linguistics on the same campusand Berlin continued his own work on ethnobotanical classifications and sound symbolism (e.g., Berlin
         1992), interest in relativity continued to decline in the 1970s and 1980s (to resurface in the 1990s: e.g., Gumperz and Levinson1996, Lucy1992). This decline was linked to another important change: language was no longer a window on the human mind as it had been for Boas and his students. Rather, it was primarily asocialphenomenon, to be studied not in the isolation of oneonone informant sessions but in the midst of speech events or speech activities (see, e.g., Basso1979, Bauman and Sherzer1974, Gumperz1982, Sherzer1983). Even when semiexperimental techniques (e.g. interviews, questionnaires), were used, the goal was to document and make sense of linguistic variation across speakers and events (e.g., Gal1979) rather than of worldview or perception of reality.<br>

Author(s): Luhmann Niklas <br>
Abstract: “What interests us here … is how art functions as communication,” Luhmann says (p. 39), and that is the crux of his conception of art: it is the medium and not the message that is important. The work of art is produced
      exclusivelyfor the purpose of communication and that it accomplishes this goal or fails to do so by facing the usual, and perhaps increased, risks involved in all communication. Art communicatesby using perceptions contrary to their primary purpose. … Art seeks a different kind of relationship between perception and communication—one that is irritating and defies normality—and just this is communicated” (pp. 22–23; author’s emphasis). Thus, what is most interesting about Luhmann’s view of art is also what is most interesting about his general theory: its sophisticated and elaborate explorations in the evolutionary development of the media of communication, which are perhaps unparalleled in contemporary theory. But due to his bracketing of the cultural dimension of art, he views the message or meaning that the artwork itself claims to convey as wholly residual. And what is art without meaning? Not only is this a problem for art, it is a problem for Luhmann’s theory; he cannot clearly define the source of art’s “irritating” character nor the “normality” it seeks to defy because he brackets the ideas and ideals that constitute the meaning (read: message) of any conceivable artwork. This gives the 300‐plus pages of Luhmann’s book a rather repetitive and tiring quality; it constantly seems as if he is writingaroundart rather thanaboutit. This is the price he pays for a theory in which the criterion is systems complexity rather than cultural meaning.<br>

Abstract: As surprising as it may seem, this hypothesis may allow us to reach the sense of a paradox rehearsed by Saint Augustine: “Factus eram ipse mihi magna quaestio” (“I had become to myself a huge question”).
         6We are not dealing here with a mere throwaway line, for the context, on the contrary, gives it a precise meaning. Augustine states that the disappearance of a very dear friend makes him hate what he loved before (his town and paternal home) and leads him to see nothing around him but death (“quidquid aspiciebam mors erat” [“everything on which I set my gaze was death”]); this loss of another thus provokes nothing less and nothing other than the loss of self, of my knowledge of myself, which it replaces with my putting myself into question. I experience myself insofar as I discover myself to be unintelligible to myself. Another formulation confirms this occurrence: even after his conversion (“in primordiis recuperatae fidei meae”), while listening to the chants resonating in the church (perhaps the hymns of Ambrose of Milan?), Augustine notes that he allows himself to be attracted and touched more by the singing itself than by what is being sung, the Psalms (“me amplius cantus, quam res, quae canitur, moveat”), thereby sinning within the very heart of prayer. Thus, he says, “In your [God's] eyes, I have become a question to myself” [“mihi quaestio factus sum”].7I become a question for myself, indeed an aporia for myself, because I discover that I cannot order my own prayer and thus my own perception correctly, which is to say, voluntarily; if my own prayer and perception, which define my innermost depths, escape my control, then they make me become a question to myself.<br>

The 1976Il formaggio e i vermi(The Cheese and the Worms) by Carlo Ginzburg and the 1979 launching ofmicrostoriaby Ginzburg, Carlo Poni, and Edoardo Grendi—practiced in France by Le Roy Ladurie in his 1975Montaillouand 1979Carnival in Romans—fostered a new kind of ethnographic history of everyday life that focused on the individual.92“The revival of narrative,” whether from Lawrence Stone’s famous 1979Past and Presentarticle or Paul Ricoeur’s 1983–85Time and Narrative,was to restore the story to history and to return to the event, as Pierre Nora had called for in his 1974 essay inFaire de l’histoire.
            93Pierre Bourdieu’s 1979La distinctionpushed for a reconciliation between events and structure.94By emphasizing that systems of oppositions are not stable structures but are constantly in the process of becoming, being made and remade, Bourdieu’s project to understand how social reality is constructed gets us closer to incorporating practice and perception with objective categories and suggests a way of bridging the gap between the endless details of one thing after another and causal explanation. This list of keyAnnalisteideas and methods derived from theMéditerranée’s problematic could include sharp criticism like that of François Dosse; the constructive response of Jacques Revel on theAnnalesparadigms, the social sciences, and the construction of the social; Pierre N~<br>

Abstract: Comparison functions as a means of defamiliarization by having the strangeness of the religious other reflect back upon the home tradition. In forcing us to construe the familiar in terms of the unfamiliar, comparison, to quote Jonathan Z. Smith’s paraphrase of Shklovsky’s defamiliarization concept, “makes the familiar seem strange in order to enhance our perception of the familiar.”

Abstract: Through his emphasis on essence, being, interpretation, perception, self and other, and intentionality, Budd [
         3] seems to situate his work within the tradition that takes consciousness as the primary reality. We see, for example, that he offers the following: “The framework that will be articulated … is admittedly somewhat eliminativist; it does, through evaluation, turn us from paths (such as deterministic scientism) that lead nowhere. That said, the framework not only allows, but necessitates, examination of the essential elements of our work” [3, p. 247]. Assuming my interpretation is correct and remembering that the clarity of his ideas may very well be compromised given that the tradition he espouses is a less coherent one than the “deterministic scientism” he rejects, we could nevertheless conclude that he gives prominence to “elements” and not to process. In other words, there is little emphasis on the interpretive process whereby new meaning is created; the dynamics are neglected despite his contention that part of the goal for librarianship is “the organization of information to enhance meaning” [3, p. 1].<br>

Abstract: Paul had become a perfect mirror of the crucified Christ. For Tesauro, the Word was a sun enlightening the martyr apostle and reflected himself through him. The shroud, Tesauro adds, is the visible echo of Paul’s inner stigmata. But, unlike Paul, we are unable to become pure reflections of this luminous sun. Our contemplation of the sacred cloth in fact beclouds its luminosity. Our intellect is a smudged mirror.
      114In similar terms, writing on 2 Cor. 3:18, in his epistle 147 (De videndo Deo) Augustine holds that, after Christ’s resurrection, our faces are mirrors reflecting God’s glory, but those who reject Christ have placed a veil over their faces.115We have seen that, in Tesauro’s Catholic view, we still retain a perception of the Word as the Father’s “metaphor.” For Augustine, the Bible as well is a mirror (speculum) reflecting our truthful image.116InAnatomia sacra(Sacred anatomy, 1685), a powerful manual of meditation on the shroud, the Theatine Vittorio Amedeo Barralis dedicates an entire chapter on the image of Christ’s “blindfolded eyes,” in which he opposes Christ’s physical blindness to the sinners’ inner inability to see themselves reflected in the Word’s image.117InSympathy, Tesauro contends that the Word has placed the relics of Maurice next to the shroud, because the relics work as “a third and firm mirror that excites that beneficial power of this sun.”118<br>

Abstract: Memory has been defined in philosophical terms as “our capacity to retain what we sense, enjoy, and suffer, and thus to become knowing in our perception and other activities.” But retention is only one part of the memory process: its other aspect is recall, the capacity to recollect past events and to recognize people, places, and facts. Psychologists refer to these two aspects as semantic memory, the basis for procedural knowledge (i.e., knowledge of how to do something, which may be retained even in amnesiacs), and episodic memory, the basis for declarative knowledge (i.e., knowledge of specific facts). It is the attempt to characterize the connection between experience and episodic memory, or recall, that has attracted most of the current research on memory.

Abstract: These poetic hermeneutical perspectives from Ricoeur, Kearney, and McFague help us reimagine the relation of ethics to poetics in a different way than in the powerful and continuing legacy of Platonism. Poetics is more here than either the Greek and premodern imitation of visible actions or the modern (aesthetic) perception of worldly appearances. It instead includes a fundamental, original, and necessarily invisible human moral capability to create social relations that are new and hitherto unimagined. This new poetic hermeneutics in effect recasts the old tradition of the
         imitatio Dei. It suggests—or rather affirms—that creating new moral worlds expresses a human capability that, however lost and corrupt, remains also primordially human. In mythical terms, poetics remains as humankind’s potential for the finite imitation of the world’s original Creator.<br>

Abstract: In many ways Koselleck’s conception of historical practice as the distinct marker of “new time”—modernity—was produced by an intense philosophic discussion throughout the first half of the twentieth century. Much of this discussion was driven by new scientific discoveries, theorizations of time, and the perception that modern society, constituted by a combination of capitalism and technology, was increasingly being directed by quantitative and objective forms of measurement and the regime of calendar and clock time. The major participants in this discussion, which Heidegger described as a “reckoning with time,” were Bergson, who probably inaugurated it by internalizing the flux of time and envisaging the possibility of coexisting mixed temporalities; Husserl, who explored further the internal recesses of psychological time and provided a dematerialized version of the lived everyday in an abstracted lifeworld; Simmel, who explicitly linked the new urban metropolis to the psychological interiorization of the state of time; Lukács, whose critique politicized a philosophy devoted to the exemplar of science and objective and quantitative measurement; and others who would not have always wanted to be classified with each other even though they shared an interest in addressing some common themes. But what seemed to hold this discussion together was the effort to rescue qualitative time and to evaluate the status of immediate experience. In many cases, this move led to an internalization, a dematerialization and dehistoricization of time, as well as, on the one hand, a distancing from the external world of clock and calendar and on the other hand important attempts to reconfigure the relationship between quantitative and qualitative time. It meant also upholding the proposition that things occur not simply in time, as such, but
         throughit, thereby opening up the possibility of shifting from measurement and perspectivalism to agency, actualization, and aspectivism.15~<br>

In hisBrahmasiddhi(37, lines 21–22; seeBrahmasiddhi by Ācārya Maṇḍanamiśra, ed. S.

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Abstract: In
         Fictional Truth, Michael Riffaterre sees the subtextual energy of fiction standing in the same relation to plot as does the unconscious in Freud to the system of conscious perception.29Like the unconscious, and revealed only in signs or symptoms of the otherwise functionally repressed, subtexts are therefore timeless, reversible, and cumulative. If denied maternity (its removal by death or its falsification) locates one such subtext inLittle Dorrit—strung along in counterpoint to the failed father motif, for instance—that matrilineal subtext has its perverse and unexpected returns across the marital trajectory of the son himself, as he is sped along the monorail of its domesticating engine toward the anticipated point of rest and its gender assimilation. Any such subtext, according to Riffaterre, is a phenomenon transcendent to change or if you will subtendent to it. It thereby lies, in the last sentence of his study, “outside the realm of time and … impervious to its ravages.”30Plot is the map of those ravages. Narratology understands this. Narratography would, as I say, reexperience it—and do so in a transferential exchange, against the medial flow, between a nervously cued attention and the insinuated unconscious of the text itself.<br>

Abstract: Bergson,

Although Bergson does not provide a scientific explication of this motion of reciprocal “harmonization” between past memory and present situation, his description suggests the phenomenon analogous to what contemporary immunology and neuroscience call “binding”: the “harmonization” of past and present is permitted, that is, by a matching or recognition whereby a preexistent memory turns out to fit a present sense perception better than all other competing memories. For a definition of “binding,” see Massimo Piattelli‐Palmarini, “Evolution, Selection, and Cognition: From ‘Learning’ to Parameter Setting in Biology and in the Study of Language,”Cognition31 (1989): 1–44, esp. 15–17.<br>

Abstract: First, consider the theme of knowledge. Humanists, like Said, link knowledge to the domain of human making and so the realm of history, language, and culture. Human action forms the “center” around which the rest of reality is observed, known, and valued. The religions, conversely, are taken to present a different observation of the world. What is real, ultimately, are sacred, holy, or divine powers that interact with and on human beings, and what is ultimately important is the right relation between human beings and these powers. Apparently humanism and religion encode different structures of perception through which knowable reality is organized, and those encodings are diverse responses to the tenacious ambiguity of mortal being. Part of the global conflict between humanism and religion is about which encoding of perception ought to orient social life.<br>

Author(s): Andrew Dudley<br>
Abstract: It is explicitly cinema's contribution of new concepts that prompts Rodowick, in another state‐of‐the‐field article, to hitch both Deleuze and Stanley Cavell to an enterprise within “philosophy” rather than within “theory,” whose energy he declares to be drained.
         47For theory seems too programmatic and imperious, whether driven by science in Althusser's sense (Grand Theory) or by models taken from natural and cognitive science (posttheory). Defending the latter, in a rebuke to Rodowick, Malcolm Turvey proudly reminds us that once continental film studies had been deracinated from the anglophone field, thanks largely to the relentless analyses of Noël Carroll, room was cleared for specific, targeted, and useful work. Turvey runs through a litany of recent and distinct gains in theories of emotion, editing, perception, imagination, pleasure, music, comprehension, interpretation, character identification, narrative, and suspense.48While those who write books and articles in these areas invariably do so by turning to well‐developed notions in the social sciences or philosophy, they do so, Turvey believes, from the strength of their own discipline. Here he connects to something I have been advocating all along; “most of us are not philosophers, sociologists, or economists butfilmscholars. What this means is that, at the end of the day, we have to use our expertise—gained from watching large numbers of films, observing them and the response of viewers to them carefully, and learning about the contexts in which they were made and exhibited—to evaluate the theories we take from other disciplines in terms of whether they successfully explain (or not) film.”49<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>

Date: 10 2009<br>
Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: First, from the perspective of Coleridge studies, prayer—as noted above—is an important yet overlooked topic that is treated, if at all, from an overwhelmingly synchronic perspective, alongside other aspects of Coleridge’s thought rather than within a tradition of thinking on prayer specifically. This is despite prayer playing critical roles in some of his most famous poetry and acting as the focus for much of his intellectual energy in his late career. Emphasizing the diachronic leads to our second reason, which is that Coleridge was placed pivotally across a romantic watershed in theology: after Kant, the higher criticism, and the collapse of the religion of natural reason, and at a moment when religious subjectivity was being reconceptualized by contemporaries like Friedrich Schleiermacher. Coleridge’s reflections can be analyzed within this context as marking a new way in which prayer was to be understood in relation to faith, knowledge, and rationality. As such, an important part of my argument below shall be to compare Coleridge with Kant, Kierkegaard, and others, proving that he stands at an important crux in the historical perception of prayer and faith itself. Finally, an investigation of Coleridge’s philosophy of prayer is all the more pertinent given renewed interest in the phenomenology and language of prayer within recent Continental philosophy and literary theory, accounts to which I shall return at the end of this article. The possibility of prayer—as a performative directed to an absolute Other—continues to engage a contemporary philosophical fascination with the limits of both language and subjectivity, limits that are in no small part related to the philosophical legacies of Kantianism, romanticism, and early nineteenth‐century theology.<br>

Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: The studies under review are indicative of the shifts that have occurred in historical scholarship on the secularization process. A common theme emerges in this literature, one that emphasizes the various ways in which the perception of divine absence gave rise to new ideals and institutions, from nationalism to modern conceptions of the self. After surveying a cross-section of recent work in the field, this essay will go on to identify an opposing trajectory by which persons and things in the eighteenth century became
         resacralized, immanent to each other in new ways that turned the disenchanting powers of the human subject upon and against itself. It is my contention that the current scholarly emphasis on the hidden God's transcendence (meant here in the usual sense, as the property of rising above worldly subjects, objects, and values) has obscured the role of immanence (the property of dwelling in worldly subjects, objects, and values) in Enlightenment-era efforts to imagine the autonomy of the terrestrial sphere. It will be necessary, therefore, to sketch the contours of this path not taken and the directions in which it might lead future work on the problem of secularization.<br>

Author(s): Kitts Margo<br>
Abstract: The recitation might be compared to the musical performances that commonly launch battle rituals. Von Rad cites musical performance as a first step in mustering troops for biblical holy war, a step that sanctioned the battle as God’s.
            26Consider Joshua and companions sounding trumpets as they circled Jericho for days before the attack (Joshua 6) or Gideon’s blasting of the trumpet before battle with the Midianites (Judg. 7:16).27Christian crusaders on the way to the holy lands ostensibly were roused by battle hymns,28contemporary equivalents of which (e.g., “Onward, Christian Soldiers,” “Joshua Fought the Battle”) are familiar. We know that jihad songs were popular entertainment at the al Quds mosque of Hamburg, where three of the four 9/11 pilots congregated.29Three battle songs performed at a wedding of one of its members are caught on tape.30In fact, the second stage of the last instructions includes an apparent poetic refrain, conceivably from such a song:
                  Against all this, it is not difficult to imagine the rousing effects generated when the 9/11 ritual actors recited in a stressed register verses understood to be transmitted from the Prophet and companions since ancient times. Whether those verses were sung, chanted in rhythm, or simply recited in prayer, their perception must have been enhanced also by ongoing traditions of Quranic recitation in the Islamic world, wherein the aural beauty of scripture is a common delight.Smiling towards the face of the perished one (dead): O youthYou are coming to the Gardens of Eternity.<br>

Date: 8 2010<br>
Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: Just as literature effaces the proper meaning of words, imposing a slippage that leaves the reader with no firm ground to stand on, so this essay effaces the proper meaning of Lévinas's text. To return to Blanchot's letter to Malka, it reveals to us finally what Blanchot meant when he said that in a
         certainway Judaism was so close to him that he could not speak of it. In what way is Judaism close to Blanchot? This proximity is one that must be announced as a distance. In maintaining that distance is not Blanchot declaring himself more loyal than Lévinas to the teaching of deracination, of which Blanchot considers Lévinas to be the teacher? In his letter to Malka and in his rewriting of Lévinas's essay “Heidegger, Gagarin, and Us,” Blanchot is answering Lévinas's call for Judaism to announce a new teaching to the postwar world. Undoubtedly Lévinas intended this call to strengthen both the Jewish community and the broader perception of Judaism's message. Blanchot's interpretation could be interpreted as doing the opposite. At the very least, it ignores the pragmatics of Lévinas's concerns. Yet, for Blanchot, Judaism's political power is only realized in renunciation. Its highest teaching, he suggests, is that there must be a gap between the call and the one in whose name the call is made. This is a space that literature discloses, offering us a mode of political speech that does not operate on the principle of mythical identification but rather ceaselessly interrupts itself, reminding us that fulfillment is not yet.<br>

Abstract: If we wish to express the principle of temporality in
         Ulyssesin terms of a formal concept, we could say with Augustine: within the continuous flux of unarticulated consciousness, everything is only to the extent that it is present; the past aspraesens de praeteritis[the present of the past], the present aspraesens de praesentibus[the present of the present], the future aspraesens de futuris[the present of the future]. All [manifestations of] time [alle Zeiten] are subjected to the movement, never to come to rest, of the actual flux of consciousness and are to flow into each other uninterruptedly: the past without any distance, modified and often also deformed, as a mere mirror; the present in a state of absolute contingency, a-causal and without any specificity (without any reference to a hierarchy of meanings), as mere perception; the future entirely as empty projection, in the mode of expectation, of mere intention or of passive desire, but never in the guise of a causal act of the will that would create a future for itself.

Abstract: My approach has something in common with that of Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht's
            Production of Presence: What Meaning Cannot Convey(Stanford, Calif., 2004). I differ, however, in viewing the crucial contemporary barrier to contemplation as that of an obsession with narrative rather than an obsession with meaning. (The last thing I would accuse contemporary culture of is a surfeit of intellectualism!) To be reengaged with nonnarrative phenomena does not require us to surrender all interest in meanings; perceiving the beauty of a gesture, for example, requires understanding what it signifies. Nor does it require us to surrender all interest in depth, another of Gumbrecht's targets; on the contrary, the beauty of other human beingsistheir depth, the depth of that invisible perspective which emerges in their aesthetic and everyday style. Even scientific knowledge—such as the delightful fact, inAdaptation, about Darwin's moth—can be truly enchanting, an enrichment rather than a desiccation of experience. We may well wish to save all these charming babies from going out with the “meaning” bathwater. What is more, the contemplation of orchids need, on my account, have nothing mystical about it (it would certainly not need to involve a perception of “Being”) and need not be transitory in the manner of epiphanies (orchid-lovers can happily stare at bromeliads all day). Finally, I hope to have given a substantive account of the role that the non-“presence” elements play in the fictional work; as I see it, these elements are absolutely necessary for making the flowers available in the first place.<br>

Author(s): Regan Ethna<br>
Abstract: Regan’s chief impetus for writing the book is the assumption that rights talk is anathema to theology. She addresses this assumption from several distinct perspectives: via definition, description, theological construction, and critical analysis. As a matter of defining human rights, Regan aims to show that one of the bases for the perceived opposition between theology and human rights lies in an overly narrow conception of the nature and scope of human rights discourse. Given her experiences working with street children in Trinidad, Regan rejects the view that human rights discourse merely defines human beings as atomistic, autonomous rights-bearers with few ethical imperatives. To correct the perception that human rights and theology are mutual antagonists, she articulates a definition of human rights as a “dialectical boundary discourse,” by which she means that human rights ought to be understood as a rich discourse that operates within a specified sphere. As a discourse, human rights consist in more than the lowest limits of ethical conduct. They express an intrinsic conviction that humans ought to flourish and that certain conditions can destroy, distort, or thwart the potential for human flourishing. Human rights discourse does not itself define human flourishing or delineate the conditions of human flourishing, but rather adopts a
      via negativa, drawing on examples from human experience to articulate conditions that prevent, disrupt, or damage capacities to flourish. In this way, human rights discourse adopts a role that Regan describes as “protective marginality,” not serving as ends in themselves but located at the margins of ethics, carving out a space within which ethical life may be possible, leaving the task of fuller development of ethics within this sphere to other discourses. By defining human rights as a dialectical boundary discourse of protective marginality, Regan shows that there is no necessary conflict between theological ethics and theo~<br>

Author(s): Fisher Cass<br>
Abstract: Cass Fisher has set for himself a noble goal: “to reframe the debate about the role of theology in Judaism and Jewish studies by proposing a new model for understanding Jewish theological language” (2). The impetus for this project is the awareness that although the discipline of Jewish studies has thrived in the past half century, theology is still marginal because of the mistaken perception that “there is no Jewish theology” (3) or that “Judaism has produced the wrong kind of theology” (4). Fisher correctly and persuasively argues that such perception not only is historically incorrect but also ignores a thriving “post-Holocaust theology, feminist theology, exegetical theology, and covenantal theology” (3), a list that could have included environmental theology. To appreciate the degree to which theological thinking is central to Judaism, a new and more appropriate understanding of theology is in order. Theology is not to be reduced to propositional speculations about God but should rather be understood as belief-forming activities that are an integral part of Jewish religious practice, including exegesis, hermeneutics, rational discourse on divine perfection, and religious experience.<br>

Author(s): Lehnhof Kent R.<br>
Abstract: In the instant before his heart breaks, Lear gives us reason to believe he is sincerely answering his ordination, and our hope that this is so attests to the play’s success in impressing upon us its exacting ethical vision. The king’s attentiveness to Cordelia’s inert form, as Michael Holahan has shown, is an exquisite example of ethical perception and responsiveness.
      
            And it is true, as Maynard Mack affirms, that Lear dies with no regard for himself. He draws his last breath “with his whole being launched toward another.”45
         
            Yet this altruistic posture is undermined by several of Lear’s last lines, some of which signal delusion (“This feather stirs. She lives” [5.3.239]), others indifference (“Prithee, away” [5.3.242]), and others wrath (“A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all” [5.3.243]). The play drives toward an ideal of ethical interrelation and absolute responsibility, but how close does the king come? After all is said and done, what we have witnessed remains enigmatic. Like the irreducible other, the tragedy resists our efforts to thematize its content or comprehend its meaning.46

Article Title: Historicizing Religion: Varro’s<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 674410<br>
Date: 02 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Rüpke Jörg<br>
Abstract: So far, two motifs for Varro’s historicizing seem to lurk between his compositional decisions and wordings. On the one hand, historicizing religion allows Varro to reconcile postulated rather than known origins, which are thought to be in accordance with philosophical reasoning, with the brute facts of contemporary religion. On the other hand, Varro is accounting for actual and observable change.
         
               The first motif points to the overall philosophical character of the work and it points to Varro’s striving at coherence in these sixteen books. The other motif fits very well into the context, which has been reconstructed for antiquarian writings in the century before the50
            Antiquitates, that is, the perception of accelerated change leading to attempts to document and systematize (and thereby frequently modify or even invent) tradition.

Abstract: Closely related to the philosophical problem of consciousness of time was the question of the meaning of time and duration in psychology and in literature. Although Mooij mentions William James's notion of “specious present” in passing, he fails to explicate James's perception of time, which attempted to provide an empiricist account of our temporal concepts through the influence of John Locke (p. 197). Apart from this caveat, the book's strength lies in its perceptiveness and breadth of interpretation of the history of the concept of time. Mooij's accuracy in comprehending and in transmitting the essence of such difficult and complicated philosophies is remarkable.<br>

Abstract: In his 1986 essay on the intersections between music theory, phenomenology, and perception, David Lewin develops a heuristic model through which to come to terms with the constitution of multiple and heterogeneous perceptions of musical events. One of his principal vehicles for demonstrating this phenomenological turn is the well-known analysis of Schubert's “Morgengruß.” The present article considers the ramifications of Lewin's methodology, particularly with respect to the experience of time that emerges from Lewin's mobilization of the heuristic perception model, by approaching it from the perspective of Husserl's
         Phenomenology of Internal Time Consciousness. This perspective reveals a superposition of temporalities as well as a superposition of languages as the underlying factors through which Lewin's analysis is produced.<br>

Issue: jsah.2011.70.issue-1<br>
Date: 03 2011<br>
Author(s): Ortenberg Alexander<br>
Abstract: A number of Maybeck scholars emphasize his dedication to the truthful representation of construction materials, often in the context of their discussion of his debt to Viollet-le-Duc's theory. See Cardwell,
               Bernard Maybeck, 58, 73. Woodbridge quotes Charles Keeler, who embraced young architect's design philosophy because "Maybeck detested 'sham, veneers, and things done for sheer effect. If the material used was wood, it should look like wood, not stone'" (Woodbridge,Bernard Maybeck, 24). In fact, the relatively cool reception of the palace was partially due to perception that in this project—a pastiche over light wood and metal frame—Maybeck moved away from the ideal of structural honesty. In this respect, an interesting insight could be found in McCoy's analysis. She also admired Maybeck's honest treatment of wood (McCoy,Five California Architects, 11, 15). However, she also noticed that Maybeck developed a similar approach to plaster. She mentioned Maybeck's experimentations with this material as an attempt to use it in an innovative and honest way, not merely as a cheap substitute for stone (ibid., 13, 18).<br>

Article Title: The Apparatus of the Dark: Emily Dickinson and the Epistemology of Metaphor<br>
Publisher: The University of California Press<br>
Issue: ncl.2012.67.issue-1<br>
Date: 6 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: This essay argues that Emily Dickinson’s poetry intervenes in the broad cultural assessment of epistemology provoked by the evolutionary debates of the 1860s. While scholars have begun to explore the thematic correspondences between Dickinson’s poetry and some aspects of this cultural conversation, this essay examines the ways in which her intervention occurs at the level of poetic form and is in fact profoundly dependent upon form. Specifically, it analyzes a set of her poems from the early 1860s through the early 1870s in which she uses the dual structure of metaphor to elicit a way of thinking about truth that is aligned with the empirical methods of research that were widely embraced in the mid nineteenth century; however, in the face of an increasingly contingent notion of truth, Dickinson’s way of thinking significantly revises cultural assumptions about what those methods might yield. The metaphors examined here amplify the distinctions between two material entities—lightning and fork, or sunset and lilac, for example—rather than merging them or leaping beyond them to stable, transcendent meaning. What Dickinson plays with is the possibility of a revised version of revelation or truth, one that is not only derived from the observation of material difference through the two parts of a metaphor, but that is more radically contingent on the perpetuity of such dual perception. Altogether, Dickinson’s metaphors are both critical and recuperative, as they contribute to the dismantling of fixed truth while embracing the limited revelations made possible by—
         onlymade possible by—sustained process.<br>

Abstract: In the winter of 1905, leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (L.D.S or the "Mormons") departed Utah on two seemingly disparate missions to the east coast. One contingent went to defend their church at Senate hearings in Washington, D.C.; the other, to Vermont to dedicate a monument to church founder Joseph Smith. These forays into national politics and religious memory refashioned Latter-day Saint identity, as well as public perception of Mormonism for the remainder of the twentieth century. They also illuminate one of the quotidian mysteries of religion: how it adapts to the demands of time, yet maintains its sense of mediating the eternal.<br>

Author(s): Newman Sara<br>
Abstract: In the
         Rhetoric, Aristotle identifies "bringing-before-the-eyes" as a capacity that is crucial to metaphors because it allows rhetors to actualize actions immediately before audiences, leading those audiences to insight. Because this description suggests that metaphors activate cognitive mechanisms on the part of their listeners, "bringing-before-the-eyes" has been considered a key element within Aristotle's theory and the nexus of that approach to metaphor and contemporary conceptual ones. Yet, no study has probed these claims to any degree. Accordingly, this paper examines Aristotle's references to "bringing-before-the-eyes" as well as to two associated concerns,energeia/actualization and sense perception. This examination demonstrates that "bringing-before-the-eyes" is not explicitly cognitive but instead a perceptive capacity. In this, Aristotle's theory anticipates recent approaches to language because it allows the audience to participate in the persuasive process at a level that extends its role beyond the traditional Aristotelian understanding that it is the target of emotional appeals.<br>

Article Title: Inhabiting the Chasm: The Dialogue of Lovers<br>
Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
Issue: i262176<br>
Date: 9 1, 1971<br>
Author(s): Bachelard Clive R.<br>
Abstract: In a practice environment that unswervingly promotes the systematic tendencies of efficient architectural productivity, to the detriment of architectural creativity, it becomes increasingly important for studio pedagogy to recover and sustain an imaginative engagement with the richness and ambiguity of lived reality. Inhabiting the Chasm is a studio project that attempts to deny the urge to rationalize program and structure and any unchallenged participation in the prevailing apparatus of conventionalized graphic depiction. The project focuses on the simultaneously unfathomable yet familiar reality of two individuals in love. It encourages a perception of the architect as place maker, as interpreter of dynamic human events, and as creator of the settings for the unraveling of dramatic human action.<br>

Abstract: This article investigates the perception of space through both visual and haptic systems of perception and examines the resultant impact on the process of spatial visualization. The development of technology from science as magic to science as information is used as a framework to (re)discover relationships between (1) the perception of space and the tools of visualization and (2) their effects on architectural education.<br>

Publisher: Carfax Publishing Company<br>
Issue: i266408<br>

Author(s): Woods Pat<br>
Abstract: Anecdotal evidence suggests that many qualitative researchers have had the experience of discovering that their informants had told them lies. This is quite different to those instances where faulty memory, subjective perception, partial or erroneous knowledge, a desire to give the researcher what they think they want, or even where a 'personal myth' comes in to play, because a lie is a conscious and deliberate intention to deceive. What should researchers do when they discover that they have been misled? What are the implications for qualitative methodology and its practitioners in the light of the criteria for good practice outlined in the Tooley Report? This article draws on two examples of informants who lied, in order to explore some of the questions and issues that can arise. It suggests, tentatively, that generic criteria may not always be sufficiently sensitive to cope with complexities of social life.<br>

Article Title: Natural Science as a Hermeneutic of Instrumentation<br>
Publisher: Philosophy of Science Association<br>
Issue: i302046<br>
Date: 6 1, 1979<br>
Author(s): Wartofsky Patrick<br>
Abstract: The author proposes the thesis that all perception, including observation in natural science, is hermeneutical as well as causal; that is, the perceiver (or observer) learns to 'read' instrumental or other perceptual stimuli as one learns to read a text. This hermeneutical aspect at the heart of natural science is located where it might be least expected, within acts of scientific observation. In relation to the history of science, the question is addressed to what extent the hermeneutical component within scientific observation opens natural science to the charge of reflecting merely cultural values, and of providing merely a culturally acceptable reading of the "Book of Nature", rather than, as the author states, one stating universal antecedent conditions of possibility of cultural activity itself.<br>

Publisher: Philosophy of Science Association<br>
Issue: i209984<br>

Author(s): van Fraassen Patrick A.<br>
Abstract: Using the methods of hermeneutic phenomenology, and against the background of the principle that the real is what is or can be given in a public way in perception as a state of the World, and of the thesis established elsewhere that acts of perception are always epistemic, contextual, and hermeneutical, the writer proposes that objects of scientific observation are perceptual objects, states of the World described by theoretical scientific terms and, therefore, real. This thesis of Hermeneutical Realism is proved by showing how the response of a standard instrument is 'read' as if it were a 'text'. Conclusions are then drawn about a number of topics, including Scientific Realism, Conventionalism, and Cultural Relativism.<br>

Author(s): Wait Eldon C.<br>
Abstract: Perhaps the greatest challenge to an existential phenomenological account of perception is that posed by the argument from illusions. Recent developments in research on the behaviour of subjects suffering from illusions together with some seminal ideas found in Merleau-Ponty's writings enable us to develop and corroborate an account of the phenomenon of illusions, one, which unlike the empiricist account, does not undermine our conviction that in perception we "reach the things themselves". The traditional argument from illusions derives its force from an uncritical assumption that the process of experience takes place in time conceived as an infinite series of distinct moments. Once this assumption has been bracketed we are able to recognise the paradoxical truth that in the disillusion something can become that which it has always been and can cease to be that which it has never been. Furthermore, through a reflection on our experience of others overcoming their illusions, and on psychological evidence, we are able to show that there is nothing to suggest that this description of the disillusion is a description of a private or subjective event.<br>

Abstract: By studying Durkheim through a Schopenhauerian lens, the one-sidedly cognitivist and functionalist reception of his social theory can be balanced. Durkheim explicitly rejected such monistic interpretations. His dialectical approach was always aimed at an essentially dualistic perception of man and society, wherein the lower pole, the individual, is central. In Durkheim's symbol theory, this position leads to two kinds of symbols: those that are bound to the human body, here called "this and that" symbols, and those people can choose freely, here called "this for that" symbols. This twofold symbol theory can already be found in medieval philosophy (e.g. Dante Alighieri) as well as in the work of Paul Ricoeur. For Durkheim the human person is the symbol par excellence. By implication the rituals in which the person is (re)constructed, that is the rites of passage, should be central. The interpretation here opens up new perspectives for a more psychological interpretation of Durkheim's sociology.<br>

Abstract: Building on 25 months of fieldwork in eastern Germany from 1991 to 2003, this article explores the interpenetration of aesthetics and politics, and questions them as theoretical categories. A multilayered description depicts aesthetic perception and action, guided by an imagery of façade, as constituted and reproduced by state policies, positioned experiences, and subversive responses. Moving beyond the Cold War legacy, aesthetics' potency and politicization is dated back to early nation building and Protestant and Romantic influences. Being essential to and controlled by shifting, largely authoritarian regimes, aesthetics simultaneously provided a 'shadow life' and a 'lingua franca', cross-cutting verbal and non-verbal mediums and everyday and high culture, as people juggled with, distrusted, and decoded surfaces, expressing and in search of deeper, hidden truths. I argue that historically generated aesthetic perceptions and praxis not only mark east German political culture but also emerge in Habermas's public sphere theory and, moreover, offer arguments to revise it.<br>

Abstract: The present paper is an analysis of the functioning of memory, selective memory and oblivion (or to put it differently—the game of remembering, partial remembering and forgetting) in Poland during the period of democratic transformation which, after long years of dictatorship and the hibernation of public discourse, ensures freedom of speech and encourages expression of different beliefs as well as articulation of divergent interests. It defines two distinct layers of memory and oblivion and, consequently, two main types of hidden or repressed elements which may be dubbed "skeletons in the nation's history closet." One is linked with the pre-communist past (before 1945), while the other is connected with the communist past (1945-1989). The latter is linked to political differences—within the same ethnic group—which presently constitute a very hot issue but are less likely to be inherited over more than two generations. The former comprises mostly nationwide skeletons, related mainly to contacts between the Polish and other ethnic groups and involving the sense of collective identity, collective pride, collective guilt, and collectively suffered injustice. On the one hand, these skeletons are currently still more willingly kept in the closet because they can be detrimental to the perception and self-perception of the national group as a whole, but on the other hand the memory of these ethnic and religious conflicts is more likely to be inherited and internalized by future generations for much longer. The question of how to facilitate the process of removing the nationwide skeletons from the national memory closet seems, therefore, all the more important.<br>

Abstract: Par exemple, Rudolf Bernet, qui se sert des développements finkéens de
la Sixième méditation cartésienne pour éclairer la position de Husserl (La Vie du
sujet, Paris, Puf, coll. « Épiméthée », 1994, pp. 9-10) et arrive ainsi, au moment de
déterminer « l'être de la conscience intentionnelle », à parler d'une « détermina-
tion réflexive de la conscience » et à insister sur l'« intentionnalité privilégiée de la
réflexion » (id., p. 54). Son interprétation du Supplément IX des Leçons de 1905 est
également marquée par cette lecture flnkéenne : « L'autoapparition rétentionnelle
du flux de la conscience serait donc une simple anticipation d'une conscience de
soi qui ne se réaliserait pleinement que sous la forme d'une perception réflexive. »
(Id., p. 289.) La relation de fondation que Husserl établit dans les Leçons entre
rétention et réflexion est ainsi invertie en une téléologie de la réflexion.<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in con~<br>

Publisher: Berghahn Journals<br>
Issue: i23508848<br>
Date: 1 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Stawarska Beata<br>
Abstract: The major thesis developed in Sartre's L'imaginaire is that all imaginary acts can be subsumed under the heading of one "image family" and, therefore, that imagination as a whole can be theorized in terms of pictorial representation. Yet this theory fails to meet the objective of Sartre's study, to demonstrate that imaginary activity is not a derivative of perception but an attitude with a character and dignity of its own. The subsidiary account of imagination in terms of neutralization of belief has the advantage of not being constrained by the requirement that imaginary activity serve a purely reproductive function of bringing an absent "original" into a quasi presence and, thus, leaves room for free creativity and fiction. It also points to a concrete lived experience of alterity at the heart of subjective life where the subject stages its life as if it were the life of an other, putting pressure onto Sartre's contention that the cogito defines subjectivity.<br>

Abstract: Dans les sociétés occidentales, la temporalité religieuse a imposé au temps social un modèle linéaire, largement tributaire des traditions eschatologiques judéo-chrétiennes, produit d'une lente élaboration forgée à partir d'influences diverses, dont celle du zoroastrisme. Cette perception d'un temps univoque est construite sur un paradoxe en liant cette progression continue à une mise en acte du processus eschatologique au moyen de rites inscrits dans la périodisation cyclique du calendrier. Cette actualisation par le rite des mythes qui le sous-tendent impose ainsi au présent, au passé et au futur de se rejoindre périodiquement au gré de la célébration de fêtes calendaires. In western societies, Judeo-Christianity imposed on time a linear model, born from eschatological traditions formed through diverse influences, including zoroastrianism. This perception of time as univocal is built upon a paradoxical view binding this continual progress to an enactment of the eschatological process through rituals inscribed in the cyclical periodization of the calendar. This actualization through rites of myths subtending them impose to the present, past and future to join periodically according to calendar celebrations. La temporalidad religiosa ha impuesto al tiempo de las sociedades occidentales un modelo lineal, ampliamente tributario de las tradiciones escatológicas judeo-cristianas, producto de una lenta elaboración forjada a partir de influencias diversas, entre ellas la del zoroastrismo. Esta percepción de un tiempo unívoco se construye sobre una paradoja que liga esta progresión continua a una puesta en acto del proceso escatológico por medio de ritos inscriptos en la periodización cíclica del calendario. Esta actualización por el rito de los mitos que subyacen a él impone así al presente, al pasado y al futuro una reunión periódica al ritmo de la celebración de las fiestas del calendario.<br>

Author(s): PATRICK MORAG<br>
Abstract: Many contemporary liberals increasingly accept that plural societies must aspire to far more expansive and inclusive ideals of justice and citizenship than liberal doctrine would suggest. The dominant perception is that extending the set of rights is the most effective way to implement a just and stable multicultural society. In fact, this is not a very plausible description of what people seek in demanding greater respect for diversity. Nor does it offer a compelling vision of how things ought to be. First, social expectations regarding recognition are not uniquely linked to rights; they encompass intractable struggles over values, as well as ways of living and evaluating. For example, a central feature of feminist, black and multicultural politics is the attempt to change social culture into a medium through which personal integrity and self-esteem may be acquired. Second, liberalism cannot easily accommodate this type of struggle, since it takes for granted a narrowly constricted conception of politics that is based on instituting public laws that harmonize the freedom of everyone. Anyone who takes seriously the idea that recognition surpasses legal relations of respect will then surely wish to consider whether liberalism must not be corrected and extended to reveal the political significance of the social conditions that enable individuals to experience themselves as both autonomous and individuated.<br>

Abstract: Ulanov, p. 46: "'Archetype' is a symbolic concept. It conceptualizes our experience, but it is
not a mere nominalistic designation. It has the symbolic function to mediate to consciousness the
objective reality of the psyche that is not directly accessible to our sensory perception or to our
logical reason. Archetypes symbolize the life of the nonindividual psyche that we all experience
but which is not our personal possession. We feel the drive effect of the archetype, its emotional
patterns and images, but we do not experience the archetype per se because 'an archetypal
content expresses itself, first and foremost, in metaphors'".<br>

Journal Title: Discourse Studies<br>
Article Title: Text as action, action as text? Ricoeur, λογοσ and the affirmative search for meaning in the 'universe of discourse'<br>
Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24049943<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur placed a great deal of importance upon text and the interpretation of text. Bell accepts this by virtue of his extended analysis of the story of Babel, and I hope to offer ways of extending and developing Bell's arguments to incorporate the ethical demands that Ricoeur placed upon text, upon our interpretation of text and upon action as a form of readable text. This will not include a commentary on discourse analysis, which I am not qualified to give. Ricoeur differed from the structuralist tradition in that he saw the relationship between language and life as taking a dialectical form: debate that presumes the possibility of altering one's position by grappling with different views, and often taking inspiration from Hegelian dialectics, with their contrasting polarized views and the eventual attempt at affirmative common ground. The term λογοσ (logos) was first used in a philosophical way by Heraclitus to give us the principle of order and knowledge, and yet for Heraclitus the world was dominated by conflict and change. Ricoeur studied this tension within logos between order and disorder, partly by his writing about language and his work on signs and symbols, partly through metaphor and narrative and also through his insights on translation. For him, all these are facets of the need for both Explaining and Understanding as forms of interpretation of language, ethics and action. Ricoeur's work on logos provides us with an approach that asks whether ethics controls language or vice versa or both and how this fits in with structuralism and later movements. For Ricoeur, signs (words, texts) are not the centres of our perceptual experience. At the heart of our perception are our motivations and our actions, for which we must take responsibility in a sort of provisional affirmation that we will keep trying. In so doing we must doubt (be suspicious of) our own motives just as much as those of others, and see action as a form of readable text.<br>

Abstract: This article concerns itself with the question of what constitutes a hymn, within the framework of the existing state church. This framework is defined as "religious pluralization", characterized by an individualized understanding of Christ, and the parallel development of a new interdenominational religious awareness, two trends which have been increasingly prominent since the days of post-Reformation Orthodoxy and the Enlightenment. "Pluralization" is intimately associated with a fundamental movement away from traditional forms of religious piety. The article attempts to describe the hymn as a figure of "tentative continuity"; that ist, the hymn is the means by which human beings symbolically express their religious perception of their own finiteness in history. The hymn can therefore claim a more universal validity than if it merely pinpoints a specific moment of human religious history. At this point, the article carefully examines several examples of older as well as of more modern hymnody.<br>

Abstract: On part ici de l'hypothèse que Mémoires d'aveugle. L'autoportrait et autres ruines de Jacques Derrida est en quelque sorte l'illustration de La Voix et le phénomène et donc la critique, par Derrida, de la phénoménologie de l'intuition, de la perception et de la vue. On relève toutefois aussi des rencontres avec Husserl et Kant. On n'oublie pas non plus qu'il y va de l'art, des arts visuels et, dans la grande richesse thématique de cet ouvrage, on relève des moments forts, aussi bien que des moments faibles, au sujet des arts du « visible ». La question demeurant : Derrida « voit »-il le dessin, la peinture et, même, entend-il la musique? The starting point of this paper is the hypothesis that Mémoires d'aveugle. L'autoportrait et autres ruines is somehow the illustration of Speech and Phenomenon, and constitutes consequently Derrida's critique of the phenomenology of intuition, perception and vision. It is however also possible to put the emphasis on some crossingpoints with Husserl and Kant. What should not be forgotten is the fact that what is at stake here is art, i.e. visual arts, and that in the great thematic richness of this work, it is possible to bring to light strong and weak points concerning the arts of the « visible ». But the question remains : can Derrida « see » the design, the painting, and even can he hear the music?<br>

Publisher: University of Tulsa<br>
Issue: i24598607<br>
Date: 7 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Bruns Gerald L.<br>
Abstract: The basic unit of Joyce's fiction is, arguably, the encounter, a reminder of the Dubliners story of that name. This essay explores the many occasions of self-encounter, as when Joyce's characters see themselves in mirrors, in the eyes of others, or in the guise of someone other than they are or appear to be: when Gerty MacDowell projects her "Lady Bountiful" self onto Bloom's erotic gaze, for instance. The regulating idea here (as in Maurice Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of perception) is that we perceive ourselves through our bodies, but this perception is not an empirical mirror-image; it is an image mediated (and thus transformed) by an array of intentions, memories, desires, and ongoing experiences of ourselves and others, including our experiences of how others see us (something to which Stephen is particularly subject). Joyce's mirror-experiences range from ironic unmasking—"The Dead"—to phantasmagorias—the "Circe" episode of Ulysses, where no image is unreal, and every misnomer (like "Henry Flower") has its moment of truth.<br>

Abstract: I begin with the hypothesis that Jacques Derrida's Memoirs of the Blind: The Self-Portrait and Other Ruins is in a way the illustration of Speech and Phenomena and therefore Derrida's critique of phenomenology, intuition, perception, and seeing. I also want to show in this regard parallels with both Husserl and Kant. I emphasize that what is at issue in Memoirs of the Blind is art, visual arts; and in the great thematic richness of this text, I note the high points as well as the low points concerning the arts of the "visible." The fundamental question is: Does Derrida "see" the drawing, the painting, and indeed listen to the music?<br>

Abstract: Karl Popper's well-known notion that the perception of the empirical facts is already
theory-laden must mean, as I would re-formulate it, that the perception of the empirical
facts - even apart from science - is in any case worldview-laden. At the same time, I assume
that an element of theory has been integrated into practically every modern worldview -
think of evolutionism or of historical materialism. In Popper too as it turns out the 'theory'
that is said to be presupposed in observation amounts more generally to a 'point of view'. It
can, so he holds, be a theory but also a general expectation or a myth. See Popper, Conjectures
and Refutations, p. 47.<br>

Author(s): Vassilicos Basil<br>
Abstract: In Matter and Memory, Bergson examines the relationship between perception and memory, the status of consciousness in its relation to the brain, and more generally, a possible conjunction of matter and mind. Our reading focuses in particular on his understanding of the evanescent presence of the present and of its debt vis-à-vis the "unconscious" consciousness of a "virtual" past. We wish to show that the Bergsonian version of a critique of "the metaphysics of presence" is, for all that, an offshoot of a Platonic type of metaphysics. It is true that Bergson departs from traditional stand-points on the side of a self-sufficient and original present and a form of presence to which the transparency of consciousness would confer the character of immediate evidence. All the same, it can hardly be claimed that his rehabilitation of the past and the unconscious opens up new perspectives on how forgetting and death are bound up with the work of memory.<br>

Author(s): Howes David<br>
Abstract: This essay traces the involution of anthropological understanding from the 1950s to the present. It is shown that as the conception of "doing ethnography" changed from sensing patterns to reading texts, and from reading texts to writing culture, so too did the content of anthropological knowledge change from being multi-sensory to being self-centred. The essay also proposes a way of escaping the tunnel-vision of contemporary (post-modern) ethnography — namely, by treating cultures as constituted by a particular interplay of the senses which the ethnographer must simulate before making any attempt to describe or evoke the culture under study. /// Cet article trace l'enchevêtrement qu'a subi l'étude de l'anthropologie depuis les années cinquante à nos jours. L'auteur démontre que le concept de "faire de l'ethnographie" a changé radicalement — de la perception sensorielle à la lecture des textes et de cette lecture à l'acte d'écrire une culture. Également, le contenu des connaissances anthropologiques a subi un changement du multi-sensoriel à l'égocentrique. L'article propose comment s'éloigner du champ de vue plutôt étroit de l'ethnographie contemporaine (dite post-moderne) en suggérant que les ethnographes traitent les cultures telles que constituées par l'action réciproque particulière des sens qui doivent être simulés avant que les ethnographes puissent essayer de décrire ou d'évoquer la culture en question.<br>

Article Title: Grasping the Dynamism of Lifeworld<br>
Publisher: Association of American Geographers<br>
Issue: i323894<br>
Date: 6 1, 1976<br>
Author(s): Buttimer Anne<br>
Abstract: Recent attempts by geographers to explore the human experience of space have focused on overt behavior and its cognitive foundations. The language and style of our descriptions, however, often fail to speak in categories appropriate for the elucidation of lived experience, and we need to evaluate our modes of knowing in the light of modes of being in the everyday world. Phenomenologists provide some guidelines for this task. They point to the preconsciously given aspects of behavior and perception residing in the "lifeworld"-the culturally defined spatiotemporal setting or horizon of everyday life. Scientific procedures which separate "subjects" and "objects," thought and action, people and environments are inadequate to investigate this lifeworld. The phenomenological approach ideally should allow lifeworld to reveal itself in its own terms. In practice, however, phenomenological descriptions remain opaque to the functional dynamism of spatial systems, just as geographical descriptions of space have neglected many facets of human experience. There are certain avenues for dialogue between these two disciplines in three major research areas: the sense of place, social space, and time-space rhythms. Such a dialogue could contribute to a more humanistic foundation for human geography.<br>

de un Montoro poeta culto y elocuente tal y como viene atestiguada, junto con las alabanzas
implicitas o explicitas por parte de personajes como Juan de Mena o los Aguilar, mas tarde por
autores como Francisco Delicado, quien transmite en su Lozana una perception del Ropero a la
altura de otros cordobeses ilustres de la epoca clasica. Asi, de la elocuente Lozana dice que "[e]s
parienta del Ropero, conterranea de Seneca, Lucano, Marcial y Avicena. La tierra lo lleva, esta in
agibilibus, no hay su par" (348).<br>

avec le Bild, la Phantasie, et la Vorstellung, ces variétés de re-présentation, distinctes par
principe des présentations simples dont la perception est le modèle. La phénoménologie en
ce sens, ne reste pas démunie, face à la revendication d'autonomie venue du camp sociologique

Issue: i275054<br>

Author(s): Veyne Nathalie<br>
Abstract: Le seul fait de déclarer son activité peut faire problème lorsque celle-ci s'inscrit non dans le régime occupationnel de l'emploi, du métier ou de la profession, mais dans celui de la vocation, comme c'est le cas pour les écrivains. Cet article cherche à expliciter les raisons pour lesquelles l'auto-déclaration de profession peut être aussi problématique pour les écrivains. A cette fin sont mis en évidence les paramètres organisant de façon générale l'identité professionnelle telle qu'elle est vécue et construite par les sujets: non seulement la représentation de soi telle que la réalise la déclaration de profession, mais aussi la désignation par autrui et l'auto-perception du sujet. Cette recherche s'inscrit ainsi à la fois dans une sociologie des professions artistiques et dans une sociologie de l'identité, ce qui permet de conférer à cette dernière notion une acception rigoureuse et donc utilisable par les sciences sociales. /// Declaring an activity can in itself be a problem if that activity does not belong to the occupational regime of employment, career or profession, but to that of a vocation, as is the case for writers. This article is an attempt to explain the reasons why self declaration of a profession can cause so many problems for a writer. The article deals with the parameters which go to form a professional identity as it is seen and developed by the subjects: a personal representation formed by the professional declaration as well as the designation made by other people and how it is perceived by the subject. This research is both part of a sociology on the artistic profession and of a sociology on identity which means that this notion can be given firm signification and may thus be used by social sciences. /// Allein die Tatsache seine Beschäftigung anzugeben kann ein Problem darstellen, wenn diese Beschäftigung nicht in den Arbeitsrahmen des Angestellten, des Gewerbs- oder Berufstätigen fällt, sondern in die Berufung wie es bei den Schriftstellern~<br>

Author(s): Perec H. Porter<br>
Abstract: Assessing the limits of evolutionary and cognitive approaches to the study of culture goes to the heart of an issue that tends to divide humanists and scientists. The issue is how far, in dealing with complex cultural texts and the complex transactions we perform as readers, can we advance by scientific reduction? The issue is vexed by the fact that at times the complexity and novelty of humanistic discourse is little more than obfuscation and strained ingenuity. But such failings discredit neither the search for novelty, nor the earned perception of irreducible complexity, nor the immense importance of work that is necessarily, and terminally, speculative.<br>

Abstract: The concept of memory had great impact on cultural history during the last two decades. However, due to the influence of theorists such as Maurice Halbwachs and Pierre Nora, it is often used in a very limited way only: either as a denomination for collective interpretations of the past or as a synonym for historical myths. Individual memory is often construed as a mere function of such collective patterns of historical perception. Several studies using the method of oral history, though, have demonstrated the tensions and the discrepancies that can exist between individual memory and hegemonic discourses of remembrance. In this paper, I will argue that the use of the oral history methodology bears a considerable social historical potential for the history of recollection and)<br>

Abstract: La ciudad habla a sus habitantes. En este artículo se presenta a la ciudad como texto, susceptible de distintas lecturas. Este nivel significativo orienta los comportamientos urbanos, da cuenta de su trama social y contiene las huellas de las decisiones históricas que incidieron en su construcción. En tanto expresión de la cultura, resultado histórico de la vida social, la ciudad es comparada con la lengua, planteándose en ambos casos el peso relativo del poder político en su constitución y en las hablas o prácticas que propician. La competencia ciudadana indica la capacidad de actuar con eficacia, abrirse camino en el laberinto de signos que la ciudad emite. La ciudad es múltiple y diversa, y propone distintos modos de percepción y apreciación. Da cuenta de la desigualdad social y, en algunos casos, es más explícita que el lenguaje, que a veces carece de palabras para designar aspectos de la vida social. El artículo está referido, sobre todo, a la ciudad de Buenos Aires. Se examinan también aspectos vinculados con la vida urbana en el plano de los espacios de interacción. Se señala que la ciudad ha ido perdiendo condiciones que la tornaban humana y habitable. Fue evolucionando hacia una mayor inseguridad y ello, junto con el desarrollo massmediático y la reducción de espacios públicos propicios, ha contribuido al aislamiento de sus habitantes y la disminución progresiva de la interacción y la participación. Estos aspectos tienen relación con las formas de representación política y la erosión de la condición de ciudadanía. En la última parte (poscriptum) se da cuenta de aspectos de la actual crisis política y económica que, sobre todo a partir de finales del año 2001, han producido una transformación en muchos aspectos de la vida urbana. En especial se observa un cambio notable en las formas de interrelación y uso de los espacios públicos junto con una intensificación de las formas de interpelación, de participación en la vida política y del protagonismo de los habi~<br>

Abstract: Le concept d' « œuvre ouverte » , tel qu'Umberto Eco décrit, doit son existence aux collaborations avec Luciano Berio, notamment dans le cadre de la gestation d'Opera à partir de 1956. L'ouverture, dans Opera, tient notamment à la multiplicité de signification et à la complexité des références internes et externes, à « l'intégration de différents niveaux de perception » . Passaggio, créé en 1963, réalise le principe brechtien de l'abolition de la limite entre scène et public ; c'est une « action musicale », où le spectateur est pris à partie. Mais parce qu'il se libère de toute cohérence narrative, l'espace musical et dramaturgique élaboré par Berio semble ne dévoiler qu'une ouverture introspective, comme pour mieux rendre à l'écoute sa fonction primordiale. The concept of "open work", as described by Umberto Eco, owes its existence to collaborations with Luciano Berio, among others during the conception of Opera, from 1956. The openness, in Opera, consists among others in the multiplicity of meanings and in the complexity of internal and external references, in the "integration of numerous levels of perception". Passaggio, premiered in 1963, realises the Brechtian principle of the abolition of the border between scene and audience. It is a "musical action" in which the auditor has a share. However, freeing itself from any narrative coherence, the musical and dramatic space elaborated by Berio appears to unveil but an introspective openness, as if to restore hearing's primordial function.<br>

Abstract: In this paper a distinction is made between two conceptions of the ego in freudian metapsychology. According to the first conception, a conception which Freud never gave up, the ego is conceived as a specific function on the surface of the living organism ; it is the result of a progressive differentiation of the Id ('Es') under the driving power of internal stimuli and external reality. Fitted with specific neutral, i.e. non-conflictual functions as perception, memory, control of the bodily motions and consciousness, the ego has to defend the individual as a biological living organism against the threats from without and within. In this conception the ego is treated as an instance that doesn't take part in the different psychic conflicts. We analyse the philosophical presuppositions and show the metapsychological disadvantages of this hypothesis that has been worked out especially in the American ego-psychology. According to the second conception, that takes into account important clinical pheno mena as identification, idealisation, narcissism, ideal of the ego, the ego is conceived as a metaphorical effect of a specific psychic act. With Lacan, we try to analyse and to interpret this specific act as an act that causes an infinite splitting in the ego : the ego is constituted as a subject that from its origin is separated from itself. Instead of being a biological function that lives in the immediate metonymical prolongiation of the living organism, it rather has to defend a certain representation of himself. This point of view doesn't exclude a purely functional description of the ego ; but the different functions have now to be interpreted differently because the ego is the effect of conflicts in which it takes part (consciousness is interlaced with unconsciousness, perception with denying...). In the last part of our study we show how Freud makes the philosophically important distinction between the ego as an object of the Id and the ego as a subject that has to~<br>

Abstract: Le rapport entre « conscience » et « identité » forme l'un des deux versants de la conception lockienne du sujet (l'autre étant constitué par la « propriété de soi-même »). La théorie lockienne repose sur la distinction du « mental » et du « verbal », et l'isolement du premier comme élément de la vérité. Elle suppose une reformulation du principe d'identité sous la forme d'une double négation inhérente à l'esprit (Mind) : il est impossible que l'homme ne sache pas qu'il pense, ou pense sans penser. Enfin elle caractérise comme « intériorité » la différentielle de perception et de réflexion qui opère tout au long de l'expérience. Dès lors le temps intérieur peut être intellectuellement et moralement ressaisi dans l'unité de la « conscience de soi ». Consciousness and Personal Identity form together one half of Locke's theory of the Subject (the other half being « self-ownership »). First of all, « mental » and « verbal » propositions (viz. truths) must be clearly distinguished. The principle of identity has to be reformulated in logico-psychological terms, as a double negation: it is impossible for the Mind to think, without knowing that it thinks. Finally the difference of perception and reflexion, which operates throughout « experience », is called an « internal sense » or interiority. As a consequence, Locke was able to call « self-consciousness » the typical unity of morality and understanding which forms the internal « duration » of the Mind.<br>

Author(s): Benoist Jocelyn<br>
Abstract: L'auteur met en évidence l'ambiguïté de la théorie phénoménologique de la négation telle qu'elle est soutenue par Husserl. Husserl hésite entre une conception de la négation comme acte et l'incorporation de la négation au sens lui-même : entre une conception illocutionnaire et une conception propositionnelle de la négation. En définitive, il choisit la seconde conception, mais en l'étendant au niveau infrapropositionnel (à la perception). L'auteur traite ce problème comme révélateur de l'ambiguïté de la philosophie phénoménologique, suspendue entre acte et sens, langage et perception. The author shows the ambiguity of the phenomenological theory of negation, such as it is held by Husserl. Husserl hesitates between a conception of negation as an act and of negation belonging to the meaning itself : that is, between an illocutionary and a propositional view of negation. Eventually, he chooses the later, but by extending it to the subpropositional level (i.e. to perception). The author takes this problem to be revealing of the ambiguity of phenomenological philosophy, standing between act and meaning, and between language and perception.<br>

Abstract: En confrontant ses romans et ses livres ultérieurs, souvent constitués de recueils de notes, l'auteur montre que s'élabore chez Julien Gracq une véritable pensée de l'histoire. Il examine tout d'abord le goût de Gracq pour l'histoire et la place de son expérience historique dans son écriture, avant de constater, à la manière de Vincent Descombes avec Marcel Proust, que c'est peut-être dans son écriture romanesque plutôt que dans ses réflexions que se révèle la profondeur d'une réflexion sur l'histoire. À travers l'examen des figures de la temporalité et de son écriture du changement, il tente de mettre en évidence la manière dont les fictions de Gracq mettent en scène l'attente et l'événement, sur le mode paradoxal de la remémoration. Ce qui va arriver est toujours déjà connu: l'écriture est réflexion a posteriori, faisant de l'œuvre le laboratoire dans lequel l'auteur essaie de retrouver l'effet produit par la détermination de l'histoire sur les individus et les sociétés. En mettant en perspective les romans de Gracq par les débats des historiens de son époque sur l'événement, ainsi que par les réflexions sociologiques ou philosophiques sur le temps et sa perception, l'auteur essaie enfin de comprendre comment ses livres peuvent être considérés comme une contribution à la conception de l'histoire et de l'historicité. Novelist Julien Gracq constructed throughout his work an elaborate reflection on History, as confronting his fiction with his later writing shows. This article first examines Gracq's taste for History, and the place of historical experience in his writing. As Vincent Descombes suggested for Proust, it is in his novels, more than his theoretical musings, that Gracq exhibited the depth of his thinking: his use of figures of temporality and his writing of change underpinned, in his fiction, his staging of wait/expectancy, and events, paradoxically presented through recollection. What will happen is always already known: through writing, Gracq attempted to~<br>

Author(s): Raveneau Gilles<br>
Abstract: La plongée sous-marine en milieu naturel est une activité qui modifie l'équilibre et la perception du corps. Les plongeurs – souvent convaincus de pratiquer une activité sans danger – s'exposent pourtant à des risques potentiellement mortels. À partir d'une enquête ethnographique, l'auteur montre qu'en définitive ce sport laisse une place aux transgressions des normes où le risque est progressivement converti en sécurité. Cet arrangement implique d'acquérir la maîtrise des « techniques de neutralisation ­­» du risque, permettant aux plongeurs d'entretenir paradoxalement un système normatif, tout en le « violant ». Il apparaît ainsi que la transgression des normes de sécurité est moins un acte individuel qu'une conduite déterminée par l'organisation sociale de la plongée. Diving in a natural medium modifies the equilibrium and perception of the body. Divers — often convinced to practice a safe activity — expose themselves to potentially mortal risks. On the basis of an ethnographic survey the author shows that this sport leaves room for an infringement of norms where risk is progressively neutralized. This implies that divers master the neutralization techniques that enable them paradoxically to maintain a normative system and to violate it at the same time. Infringement of safety norms thus appears to be an individual act rather than a behaviour determined by the divers' social organization. Der Tauchsport in einem natürlichen Medium verändert das Equilibrium und die Wahrnehmung des Körpers. Die Taucher — die oft davon überzeugt sind, dass sie einen risikolosen Sport treiben — setzen sich potentiell tödlichen Risiken aus. Auf der Basis eiener ethnographischen Studie zeigt der Autor, dass dieser Sport Platz für eine Übertretung der Normen lässt, wo das Risiko allmählich neutralisiert wird. Dies setzt voraus, dass die Taucher die Neutralisationstechniken beherrschen, die sie paradoxerweise ermöglichen, ein normatives System zu erhalten und zur gleicher Zeit zu verletz~<br>

Abstract: À partir d'une enquête effectuée auprès d'élèves de Quatrième, Troisième, Seconde et Première, on propose un modèle intermédiaire d'appropriation de l'histoire. En utilisant les classificateurs expérimentés en sémantique cognitive, on peut ramener à deux grandes catégories cognitives, l'identification du texte de l'histoire : l'une de type événement-changement s'inscrit dans un schéma narratif, l'autre de type entité stable dans un intervalle temporel met en œuvre des processus de catégorisation. Les événements, concepts et entités de l'historien ne correspondent pas toujours aux modes de perception des élèves. Ces derniers procèdent par catégorisation naturelle en multipliant les analogies entre des périodes historiques différentes, en ancrant les informations nouvelles dans une pensée sociale. How do secondary school students get in contact with historical texts ? Examples drawn from an investigation are used to present identification processes as a change-event or as lasting entities in a time interval, analogical categorization processes and social thinking rooting.<br>

Abstract: This article analyzes the strategies by which the narrator of Caesar's Bellum Civile constructs his authority and promotes his version of the civil war. Despite being generally omnipresent, omniscient and un-intrusive, the narrator can abandon his covert position and all-encompassing knowledge and use multiple devices to guide the readers' perception of salient events. Switches of focalization, inferred motivation, presentation through negation and intratextual echoes color the narrative of key episodes, such as the negotiations of peace with Pompey in Book 1 and the descriptions of the battles at Dyrrachium and Pharsalus.<br>

Abstract: This review explores the most significant dimensions and findings of phenomenological approaches in anthropology. We spell out the motives and implications inherent in such approaches, chronicle their historical dimensions and precursors, and address the ways in which they have contributed to analytic perspectives employed in anthropology. This article canvasses phenomenologically oriented research in anthropology on a number of topics, including political relations and violence; language and discourse; neurophenomenology; emotion; embodiment and bodiliness; illness and healing; pain and suffering; aging, dying, and death; sensory perception and experience; subjectivity; intersubjectivity and sociality; empathy; morality; religious experience; art, aesthetics, and creativity; narrative and storytelling; time and temporality; and senses of place. We examine, and propose salient responses to, the main critiques of phenomenological approaches in anthropology, and we also take note of some of the most pressing and generative avenues of research and thought in phenomenologically oriented anthropology.<br>

Abstract: Diversos trabajos han señalado còmo en contextos altamente represivos el surgimiento y la continuidad del activismo no se entienden sin la intervención de fuertes elementos subjetivos, afectivos y emocionales.Este artículo participa de este enfoque con un análisis longitudinal del activismo de la primera generación de anarquistas clandestinos bajo la dictadura franquista (1939-1975). Los resultados destacan la combinación de tres factores que ayudan a explicar el sostenimiento del activismo anarquista: i) la mediación de la esperanza en la percepción de oportunidades para la movilización; ii) la movilización estratégica de la indignación en el discurso dirigido a los potenciales apoyos y participantes; y iii) el fortalecimiento de la identificación ideológica con el movimiento gracias, paradójicamente, a la represión. Las fuentes incluyen diversos materiales de archivo y testimonios de activistas. Previous research has shown that in highly repressive contexts, the emergence and continuity of activism cannot be understood without considering the role of strong subjective, affective and emotional elements.Building on this approach, this article offers a longitudinal analysis of the activism of the first generation of clandestine anarchists under Franco's dictatorship (1939-1975). The results point towards a combination of three factors that help explain the maintenance of anarchist activism. These are: i) the role of hope in the perception of opportunities for mobilization; ii) the strategic mobilization of indignation in the discourse directed at potential supporters and participants; and iii) the strengthening of the ideological identification with the movement due, paradoxically, to the effects of repression. The sources used include a range of archival material as well as activists' memoirs.<br>

Publisher: Presses Universitaires de France<br>
Issue: i40069058<br>
Date: 1 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Serban Claudia<br>
Abstract: Notre étude examine la manière dont les principales injonctions de la méthode phénoménologique, telle qu'elle a été mise en place par Husserl et remaniée par Heidegger, sont reprises ou critiquées par la phénoménologie française contemporaine au tournant du xxi e siècle. En un premier temps, c'est le rôle qu'assume la réduction au sein de la phénoménologie de la donation élaborée par Jean-Luc Marion qui est analysé, ainsi que les conséquences méthodologiques de sa compréhension du phénomène et, tout particulièrement, la neutralisation du recours à l'herméneutique qui en découle. Nous faisons voir l'importance de la réfutation de l'hypothèse d'une non-donation par la phénoménologie de la saturation et le poids croissant qu'y gagne le concept d'événement. Cette dernière considération nous conduit à une confrontation avec l'herméneutique événementiale proposée par Claude Romano qui, tout en avançant une des plus radicales critiques de la réduction phénoménologique, plaide pour une phénoménologie herméneutique d'un type nouveau, attentive à l'autonomie et à la spécificité de la perception. The study shows how the main prescriptions of the phenomenological method, established by Husserl and redefined by Heidegger, are prolonged or criticized in French contemporary phenomenology at the turn of the 21st century. Firstly, the role played by reduction within Jean-Luc Marion's phenomenology of givenness is analyzed, together with the methodological consequences of its phenomenon concept, such as the caution towards hermeneutics. The importance of the refutation of a hypothetical non-givenness and the considerable weight gained by the notion of event are also stressed. From this point of view, a confrontation with Claude Romanos hermeneutics of the event appears as highly relevant, allowing to present one of the most radical critics of phenomenological reduction and to discover a new kind of hermeneutical phenomenology, open to the autonomy of perception.<br>

Abstract: Any praxis is inscribed in time. To what extent does man's perception of time leave an inprint on Saussurian 'langue' ? Revisiting a well-beaten track in linguistic studies, we propose to give this farreaching question a partial answer concerning the opposition between French imparfait and passé simple. We first capture the opposition between those two tenses in a passive way, in which man as a subject (subjected to...) bears witness to the flow of time from future to past; we then capture the opposition in an active way, in which man as a project bears witness to the flow of time from past to future. This two-fold representation bears on the opposition between imperfect and simple past. It is shown next that linguistic theories view tenses as markers of localisation in time whereas verb forms also help mark how the time implied by the process is viewed, what orientation is given to it. Our contention is that implied time is represented in a downward fashion (particularisation) with imperfect and in an upward fashion (generalisation) with simple past.<br>

Abstract: Contemporary poetry, since Rimbaud and Mallarmé, invests issues which used to be the preserve of rational philosophy, while philosophy since Nietzsche makes greater use of poetic expressivity. The convergence is towards the sensory focus of perception, rational thought, and expression, the body; but, except at the limits, philosophy establishes concepts, poetry speaks from within.<br>

Abstract: S'appuyant sur un corpus de textes adolescents adressés au site Internet www.filsantejeunes.com, notre analyse tente de cerner le problème de l'indicibilité du sensible, puisque la plupart de ces textes se limitent à élaborer un discours sur le corps, ses difficultés à être la source de bien-être, à se conformer aux normes de beauté, et n'abordent pas le phénomène, l'expérience de perception du monde. La théorie des instances proposée par Jean-Claude Coquet permet de rendre compte de cette impossibilité de dire le sensible, laquelle serait due à une mise en tension conflictuelle des deux instances du non-sujet et du sujet. Ce conflit sans issue peut aboutir à des comportements de boulimie et/ou d'anorexie, aux conséquences graves pour la santé, voire la vie du sujet. La psychothérapie, dans ces cas-là, devrait viser une réconciliation des instances. Ces textes adolescents constituant des exemples d'écriture autobiographique, genre discursif très prisé à l'adolescence, permettent aussi de contribuer à l'analyse de la genèse de ce genre littéraire, où s'impose la reprise différée, par le sujet adulte voire vieillissant, d'expériences anciennes de l'instance non-sujet, expériences corporelles de prise directe avec le monde. This analysis, based on a corpus of texts by teenagers posted on www.filsantejeunes. com, tries to take the measure of the issue of the impossibility of expressing in language the experience of sensing the world -since most of these texts are content to limit themselves to elaborating discourses about the body, its difficulties at being a source of happiness, at conforming to norms of beauty, and do not deal with the phenomenon, namely the experience of perceiving the world. The theory of instances, or of the grounding of utterance, elaborated by Jean-Claude Coquet, can explain this impossibility of expressing in language the experience of sensing the world: it is due to a conflict between the two instances, the grounding in the subject or in the no~<br>

Abstract: What distinguishes Woolf's prose is not her famous penchant for simile, but her constant use of the less ostentatious, though more radical, verb metaphor. Combining these figures in strings, in which the verbs are consistent but the implied nouns contradictory, Woolf deliberately unsettles the reader, forcing him or her to consider not only the tenuous relations between the word and the world, but the contingent nature of phenomenal reality itself. Thus the view of life as something at once "very shifting" and "very solid" (expressed in the diaries and dramatized in the novels), pervades the essays, captured in the paradoxical relation "it is and is not" that Paul Ricoeur claims lies at the heart of metaphor. A close study of a paradigmatic essay, "On Not Knowing Greek," and of manuscript drafts in New York and Sussex reveals that this tension between shifting and solid extends to the syntax, which manages to be both extravagant and firmly anchored, and to the developing structure of the essay as a whole, which traces a movement of mind (a strategy James Farrell defines as specifically "feminine"), remaining defiantly heuristic and resisting the inherent closure of the formal essay. Thus, like her novels, Woolf s reviews and essays engage us in the process of perception even while inviting us to explore critically the operations of language in that perception.<br>

Abstract: Metaphors cannot be studied in abstracto. The use of metaphors is part of the communication process of John's Gospel. Therefore this study starts with a consideration of the Gospel as a communicative act. This means that the author(s) employ(s) various means to alter the listeners'/readers' world view. Perhaps the most important way of achieving this is through the use of metaphors. Metaphors are created by way of unexpected predication through a deliberate category mistake. In this way the possibility is opened to innovative perception (seeing what was not there to see before) as well as to a redescription of reality. By relating the metaphors used in John's Gospel (e g true light, good shepherd, true vine, etc) to their possible communication situation, one can gain insight into the role metaphors play in identifying the Jesus of John.<br>

Abstract: This study, based largely on unpublished material, is an attempt to describe and evaluate how French Protestantism dealt with the German question in the postwar period. A short description of the perception of Germany by French Protestants towards the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century underlines the new approach which characterized the relations between French and German Protestants after the Second World War. In spite of the shattering defeat of the Third Reich, Germany remained in the eyes of many French Protestants a dreadful danger. However, already shortly after the war, some clergymen and laymen, many of whom had been involved in the resistance against the nazi regime, believed that their mission was to act as mediators and peacemakers despite the official hard-line diplomacy of their country. This article provides a selection of quotations of French Protestants' intentions and conceptions regarding the German question, as well as examining the ways and means they thought best to prevent Germany from becoming a new danger to France and Europe. It shows how seriously they debated all aspects of a common future with yesterday's enemy in a Europe of tomorrow, and affords an insight into how some Protestant personalities on both sides of the Rhine played an important role in the process of Franco-German reconciliation during the postwar period.<br>

Abstract: In Britain, as in France, 'mainstream' anthropologists were hesitant to acknowledge studies within their own country as proper subjects for anthropological enquiry. British social anthropology defined itself as the study of 'other cultures' and became entrenched in a tradition in which Otherness was confused with manifest difference. This naivete, elevated into a scientific principle, precluded the recognition of 'self as anything other than a scientific instrument; but also led to the invention of a generalisable Other, and thereby ignored the complexity of variation within the cultures it studied. By the same token, it blinded anthropologists to heterogeneity within their 'own' local cultures as well, and was finally changed only by a series of related paradigm leaps. Our understanding of culture changed from a set of prescriptive influences which integrated society, to a ragged and non-systemic array of interpretive tools which aggregated society. Consequent upon this change, symbols were acknowledged as vehicles of expression and of negotiable meaning rather than as having stipulated and invariant referents. The demise of modernist theories liberated anthropology from its scientific illusions and positivistic pretensions, enabling it to acknowledge the personal and speculative nature of the enterprise. This admission of the subjective, of the anthropologist's self, was necessary in order to see Otherness as inhering in 'person' rather than in an abstraction such as 'culture' and, therefore, to be enabled to recognise diversity within cultures rather than merely between them. This enhanced perception of internal heterogeneity clearly places the Self of the anthropologist at the centre of the stage and has led to the contemporary debates about the nature of ethnographic writing and the status of ethnographic 'authority'. It has also had obvious consequences for anthropological research, including the raising anew of the relationship of individual to society; and t~<br>

Author(s): WOLICKA ELŻBIETA<br>
Abstract: The article of Elzbieta Wolicka is consecrated to the consideration of the phenomenon of time taken in the contexts of individual human experience, contemporary cultural situation and Christian faith. The starting point of the 1st part of the article is the fragment of Confessiones (ch. XI) of St. Augustine and the short parable of Franz Kafka entitled HE. The author of the article brings to the light the dialogical basis of the human perception of time and raises up the quaestion of "a hidden sabotage of trust" which is characteristic to the social relations of our times. This is also the one among many other factors of the so called "crisis of culture" (mal du siècle). The crisis consists of a feeling of a threat, a burden of the past and a fear of the future. The 2nd part of the article is concerned with the analysis of the eschatological meaning of some words of Christ in the Gospel of St. John (4, 23; 5, 25-29; 12, 13; 12, 27, 31). They reveal the Christian sense of the human temporal condition in the light of "the economy of salvation" and the dialogue between a believer and God. A catastrophic thrill, a feeling of existential paradox, a blockage of communication - the symptoms of the crisis of cultural conscience - could be described as "the edipse of God" (M. Buber) or "the abandonment of God" (J. Ellul) in the contemporary world. The Gospel points out that in the heart of human temporal experience there is still existing conversatio sacra and the presence of God in our history is actual.<br>

Abstract: The text aims at considering from various points of view the presence of the value of truth in the work of art. The first step is a phenomenological analysis of epistemológical, ontological and aesthetic phenomena connected with perception of the work of art. Its conclusion is the statement that truth belongs to the characteristics of both creation (contents, structure) and reception (cognition of various aspects) of the work. The very fact that the aesthetic value of the object claiming to be beautiful can be discussed proves the presence of the object on the rational-veritable plane. The next aspect undertaken in the article is concerned with the epistemological and methodological criticism of the view (represented here by R. Ingarden) that there is a radical difference between the objective domains of science and art. An attempt is made to show that the view is rooted rather in ideologically understood scientism and neo-positivism than in a realistic conception of cognition through art. In a completely realistic attitude the borderline between 'what is rationally cognised' and 'what is beautiful' (the sphere of quasi in Ingarden's meaning) is not an absolute borderline. The domain of the work of art also contains cognitive elements, often existentially and morally essential for man's life. As it appears, a similar position can be found in G. B. Vico's texts that proclaim the unity of poetic and metaphysical perspective in ancient beginnings of anthropological thought about the human world. Nowadays a methodological tendency is observed on the philosophical plane that allows joining the veritable and aesthetic aspects, and hence exploring the objective domain of art in the cognitive aspect. This is expressed today, among others, in the increase of the significance of art in social, cultural and scientific life.<br>

Article Title: FREUND UND FEIND — SCHWIERIGKEITEN MIT EINER "BANALITÉ SUPÉRIEURE": Zur neueren Carl Schmitt-Literatur<br>
Publisher: Duncker & Humblot<br>
Issue: i40145734<br>
Date: 1 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): Maschke Günter<br>
Abstract: The author uses the term "banalité supérieure" to describe Schmitt's somewhat shocking thesis that the true political distinction is the one between "friend" (Freund) and "enemy" (Feind). To be sure, this perception does not free one from the necessity of continually determining a new the concrete friend-enemy relationship. Using the more recent literature from Italy, France, Spain and Germany, the discussion centers around the question whether Schmitt had several political terms which he himself often used and combined in different ways. The author demonstrates the fruitfulness of the etymological and philosophical study of the words "friend" and "enemy". At the same time, he presents the thesis that "friend" is also a political term and, as such, remains connected to "enemy". Hence, it is not important whether a political theory accentuates the "friend" or the "enemy". The criticism that Schmitt's anthropology is incomplete is rejected. As the classic authors have shown, it is sufficient that a political theory appreciates the value of experience. Experience confirms, however, the existence of danger and evil in human nature. Nevertheless, danger and evil may not be regarded as identical; political theory and' theology must remain separate. In conclusion, the author rebuffs the allegation that Schmitt was interested in the destruction of the Weimar Republic.<br>

Author(s): Glicksohn Joseph<br>
Abstract: In attempting to achieve some form of mapping between consciousness (specifically, consciousness₆) and cognition, I distinguish between a weak and a strong version of the hypothesis, indicating a change in mode of thinking of a metaphoric-symbolic nature (Glicksohn, 1993). The weak version would claim that metaphors, symbols, analogies and images are used in an attempt to depict the experience, which is not easily translatable into words. The strong version would claim that metaphoric thinking is one of the hallmarks of the experience, and is used both in an attempt to depict the experience and also to convey to the reader, and possibly to induce in the reader, some of the qualities of that experience. My discussion of these two options is preceded by some comments on problems inherent in studying altered or alternate states of consciousness. I also discuss the relationships among physiognomic perception, cognitive dedifferentiation, and symbolic cognition.<br>

Abstract: Cet article trouve son point de départ dans l'analyse du caractère sévère de Jésus dans l'évangile. Des synoptiques, c'est Matthieu qui met le plus l'accent sur la tension entre les pharisiens et Jésus. Le point culminant est le discours dans le temple dont le noyau est constitué des sept « Ouai » (Mt 23,13-36). Pour expliquer cette sévérité, nous utilisons comme approche méthodique la « pragmatique » de la science de la communication et de la linguistique. L'objectif de la recherche est d'offrir une nouvelle perception de la réalité et d'interpeller sur l'agir moral. This article begins from the analysis of the harsh nature of Jesus in the Gospel. Among the Synoptics, it is Matthew who insists the most on the strain between the Pharisees and Jesus. Its culmination is Jesus' speech in the Temple, at whose centre are the seven "Woes" (Matt. 23 :13-36). To explain this harshness, we will make use of the methodical approach called "pragmatic", in communication science and linguistics. Our aim is to offer a new perception of reality and to challenge to moral action.<br>

Abstract: La notion de tolérance est problématique: je m'efforce de le montrer en considérant tout d'abord les critiques dont elle est ou a été la cible. Puis, en partant de la conception de Locke, je relève les dilemmes qui peuvent surgir de la mise en pratique de la tolérance et la nécessité, mais aussi la difficulté, de fixer les limites de son application. Corollaire de la liberté de pensée et de l'acceptation du pluralisme, la tolérance est décrite, en dernier lieu, comme mise à l'épreuve purificatrice de nos convictions et comme instauratrice d'une véritable relation de réciprocité dans la mesure où elle parvient à dépasser le simple acquiescement à la diversité. The concept of tolerance is problematic : this I try to show first by considering the criticisms made of it. Then, starting with the perception of Locke, I point out the potential dilemmas of practising tolerance and the need, as well as the difficulty, of fixing limits to tolerance. A corollary to the freedom of thought and the approbation of pluralism, tolerance is finally described as the refining proof of conviction and the instigator of true reciprocity to the degree that it goes beyond the simple acquiescence of diversity.<br>

Abstract: The conflict between formalist thinking and theories that view texts in their historical contexts serves as a starting point for the introduction of a cognitive view of literature. From this perspective language has full referential powers. The "referent" splits into two entities, however: things-in-themselves (in their material identity), which we cannot know, and things in their coded form, which are perceptually accessible. Readers' mnemonic potentials, a consequence of the bonding of perception and language, are adduced to show that texts originate in past interpretations of other texts and in personal experience and that consequently social forces and historical events are subsumed in the individual memory. In the cognitive light, memory becomes the ultimate metaphor, and the epistemological claim of realism regains its compelling force.<br>

Abstract: The indigenous peoples of South America culturally code sensory perceptions in varied and complex ways. This article outlines and compares the sensory models of indigenous cultures from two contrasting South American regions: the central Andean highlands and the Amazonian lowlands. While the various peoples of the Andes appear to share the same basic sensory model, those of the Amazon manifest significant differences in the symbolic values they accord the different senses. One common factor among the Amazonians, which also distinguishes them from the Andeans, is the importance given to the senses dependent on proximity, particularly smell. Such differences can be attributed to a variety of causes and are seen to have a variety of cultural effects. In conclusion, the anthropological implications of examining indigenous theories and modes of perception are explored. [South America, Andes, Amazon, anthropology of the senses]<br>

Issue: i227566<br>
Date: 12 1, 1983<br>
Author(s): Williams Robert<br>
Abstract: An ethnographic study of a shelter in downtown Boston for people considered homeless and mentally ill documents the way in which the category of "experience," which many have taken to be universal and natural, is culturally and historically constituted. The residents of the shelter tend not to experience - defined here as an inwardly reflexive process that proceeds, coheres, and transforms through temporally integrative forms - but rather "struggle along" by way of an acutely tactile mode of perception that attends to episodic, temporally finite encounters. The fact that experience in the shelter is only a possibility, not a given, points to the need for a critical phenomenology that would help us to consider how this and other ways of being come about through specific social, cultural, political, and material forces.<br>

Abstract: This is partly an allusion to Wittgenstein on language games but I am emphasising the sense of play to add to what he says of games, life and travel. On language games, see more in
         Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-religion/ (accessed 18 February 2010): Some properties of language-games can be noticed in Wittgenstein’s several examples and comments. They are, first, a part of a broader context termed by Wittgenstein a form of life (see below). Secondly, the concept of language-games points at the rule-governed character of language. This does not entail strict and definite systems of rules for each and every language-game, but points to the conventional nature of this sort of human activity. Finally, Wittgenstein’s choice of ‘game’ is based on the over-all analogy between language and game, assuming that we have a clearer perception of what games are. Still, just as we cannot give a final, essential definition of ‘game’, so we cannot find ‘what is common to all these activities and what makes them into language or parts of language.’<br>

Abstract: The longstanding critical refrain that Virginia Woolf's fiction represents a turn ““inward”” to the vagaries of the inner life has more recently been countered with an ““outward”” approach emphasizing Woolf's interest in the material world, its everyday objects and their social and political significance. Yet one of the most curious and pervasive features of Woolf's oeuvre is that characters are so frequently wrong in their perceptions. This essay consolidates the inward and outward approaches by tracing the trope of misperception in Woolf's fiction as well as in her conceptions of the work of author and reader. For Woolf, the modern literary experience derives from the nature of the faculties of perception, the tenuous points of connection —— and disjunction —— between the inner and the outer worlds.<br>

Abstract: This essay uses Paul Ricoeur's concept of the “(as yet) untold story” to consider the relationship between James Joyce's 1904 short story “Eveline” (in
         Dubliners) and Colm Tóibín's award-winning 2009 novel,Brooklyn. Although Tóibín has denied the influence of Joyce in general, there are many similarities in the storyworlds of the two protagonists, Eveline Hill and Eilis Lacey: Eveline wishes to leave her father's home in Dublin but stays, whilst Eilis would prefer to remain at home but is forced to emigrate. Both act according to their perception of their mother's wishes and the rightness of their decisions has preoccupied readers. Through close analysis of thought and speech presentation, this essay shows that interpretive responses to the actions of Eveline and Eilis are inextricably linked to the formal qualities of each text.<br>

Abstract: Since the push for “authentic” literary culture and autonomous literary production must above all be read in national terms, it is useful to recall Rama's assertion that from the 1700s to the present, the slogan of Latin American writers has been “Be independent!” Calls have been made for ethnic, geographic, cultural, and local literary forms free of European elements. Rama identifies three main impulses that have driven literary innovation—independence, originality, and representation—and traces these aesthetic values to the romantic perception of America as “glaringly different from its mother societies, given its distinctive physical environment, its diverse ethnic makeup, and its difference in terms of development when compared to the only model of progress—Europe.”
         
               For the poetry of the Americas to be original, it simply must be true to its own particularity—or so it would seem.62<br>

Abstract: Remembering is a function of the meaning-making process after the emptiness of loss. Spelder and Strickland suggest that “grief is the emotional response to bereavement, to the event of loss” (as qtd. in DuBose, 368). The theologian Todd J. DuBose explains that “grief gazes at an ever-receding present as it moves further and further into the past. The immediate reaction often involves bargaining for a reversal of the loss, denial, anger, shock, anguish, distress, sadness” (368). These reactions are the body's means of trying to make sense of the world in the wake of the emptiness created by bereavement. Interpreting Drew Leder and Maurice Merleau-Ponty's notion of chiasmic structure of the body, DuBose explains that the body realizes its existence only in relation to other bodies. It touches because it is being touched. Other bodies make ours perceptible. The disappearance of these other bodies in death is, in tune with the chiasmic structure of bodily existence, the disappearance of our own bodies. We experience that disappearance as pain, grief, sorrow. These manifestations of pain are, indeed, the ways our bodies adjust to vacuum and fill it with meaning. For DuBose, “meaning-making processes, which
         appearto be immaterial processes, are embodied phenomena. Reflection, perception, feeling, language, even logic make sense only through the influx of the body's ‘reading’ of space, time, action, and sensation” (370).<br>

Abstract: Questions like this have shaped much of my own work. Being surrounded by so many enthusiastic but incompatibly articulate spokespersons for neglected lifeworld concerns, I concluded that criticism of tradition is most powerful when offered by those who are already in the midst of trying to be better phenomenologists—not, of course, in the sense that they are trying to be better members of a philosophical school but in the sense that they are motivated by the urge to find better ways to articulate something that tradition distorts or neglects. Why
      shouldaccounts of what matters most in life first be measured against the standards of “clear and distinct” propositional speech? Does anyone reallylive though life, thinking of it as a process going on inside our bodies? Do we reallyexperiencefreedom as an unconceptualizable combination of limitlessness and limit? And why throw the metaphorical wet blanket of a rigorously trained consciousness and its “correlates” over thepretheoretical practices of everyday life? Negative genuflections to philosophy's traditional priorities, privileging the subjective instead of the objective, inner instead of outer, lived body instead of house-for-the-mind—all of these inversions ultimately foster the continuing and undeserved hegemony of a traditionally objectivist understanding of what is Really Real. Kockelmans once told me that Merleau-Ponty eventually decidedPhenomenology of Perception“was not yet a philosophical book.” To be sure, its content and much of its treatment of that content is phenomenological, but its structure is still Cartesian. To start with specificallybodilyperception, however generously reconceived, still implies that other dimensions of presence to the world—linguistic, social, cultural, political, historical—can be added on at a later time, perhaps along with discussions of abstractly identified and timeless “topics” like freedom, the self, and so on.<br>

Abstract: Brentano himself perhaps takes a tiny step in this direction when he says of the I-substance (as the individuating independent part of consciousness) that it does not have length, breadth, or depth; nor is it round or square, nor does it have color and other sensory qualities.
         
                  And further, given that it is without any such bodily differentiation, he says that there is a consideration that serves as a positive substitute: in inner perception the I-substance appears to us “not merely as substance but also in contrast to that which is corporeal, as a spiritual [24
               geistige] substance.” In other words it is presented “as a zero-dimensional substance which, although it is unextended, is a thing for itself without any connectedness to its surroundings. It thus does not appear as a mere boundary like a point in a continuum of points.”

Abstract: There are perceptible changes in the orientation of SPEP papers in the 1960s. The eleven papers from the first two programs that James Edie edited and published in 1965 range within the phenomenological/existential area from issues of perception, lifeworld, and Husserlian horizons to authentic existence, solitude, and avoidance of the void.
         
               The next three meetings broadened the range of topics considerably by featuring papers that connected phenomenology to artificial intelligence, natural science, linguistics, schizophrenia, body image, social roles, tragedy, the experience of the holy, Hume, Kant, and Wittgenstein. A new person in the European scene, Jacques Derrida, was invited to the fifth conference, but he was unable to attend (he sent a mimeographed copy of his paper that was available in French for those at the conference who might wish to read it).1<br>

Abstract: The account of the aspect in Husserlian phenomenology is well known. With his theory of adumbrations, Husserl described how the perceived object is given in a one-sided, partial manner. The perception of its actual profile or aspect is given against the horizon of a set of potential perceptions of its other sides. Together these actual and potential perceptions are unified to form the sense of the thing that is perceived. For Deleuze, though, Husserl's account operates on the level of aftereffects because it does not ever consider the genesis or coming into being of the aspect itself. It is this event—the genesis of the aspect as such—that Deleuze's work brings to the fore. The Deleuzian aspect is separated from every figure and context. Think of it as being like the smile of the Cheshire Cat, which wanders away from the cat's body. This is not simply an imaginary or hallucinatory appearance; instead it indicates the genesis of a sensation prior to the work of figuration or its placement within a context. Every figure or form is a secondary coagulation or solidification of this primary sensation. To the extent that the aspect disarticulates itself from every position or background field, it can rightly be called an in-visible. This is how a minimal phenomenology approaches the invisible. That is, it approaches this minimal threshold of sense—the threshold that gives rise to sensation and conscious experience.<br>

Abstract: Hyperbole can offer one alternative perceptions of meaning and being, both psychologically and phenomenologically (Johnson
         2010), through the way of excess and exaggeration, and this is its global purpose—it reorients by disorienting. Once a perplexing and sometimes disturbing disorienting perception occurs, thisvertige de l'hyperboleas Baudelaire refers to it, one is ready for a perspectival reorientation—a paradoxical movement leading toward insight and partial apprehension. By generating confusion through excess, hyperbole alters and creates meaning.<br>
