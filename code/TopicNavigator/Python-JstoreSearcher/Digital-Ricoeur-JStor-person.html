For example, animals could be buried after a sacrifice (the animal was killed but was left whole); the animal could have died of natural causes (it may have<br>

  Abstract: Sketching the evolution of Israeli and Palestinian symbol use over most of a century raises a significant problem. Many useful critical analyses focus in depth on a particular persuasive message or a specific person’s use of persuasion.¹ In such analytical “snapshots,” the critic has the luxury of being able to carefully describe in detail a given speech, essay, or book. Our project requires a broader approach.<br>

  Abstract: The device presented here—of a projective first person narration on a possibly shamanistic base—points to a linkage of the male and female singers with other ʺnon-human entitiesʺ in what Philippi calls ʺa form of inter-species communication in which gods or humans speak of experiences to members of their own or other species.ʺ In saying this, he reveals a traditional way not only of knowing but of experiencing and projecting a total natural environment—as Gary Snyder describes it in his ʺforewordʺ to these songs: ʺThe life of mountains and rivers flowed from their group experience, through speech and<br>

  Abstract: The

First we are given the graceful but exultant image, dear to the mannerist tradition, of the “waters” and the “little vessel” that will “course” even as it “lifts her sail.” Next, the first-person narrator dramatically (“and what I sing”) offers the firm, clear definition of the theme. Finally, there is an invocation to the Muses recalling, like some mysterious legend, a famous episode in Ovid’sMetamorphoses.<br>

  Abstract: If I have recourse to metaphors of water and darkness to describe myself at twenty-one, it is partly because I spent that turbulent year in a harbor city buffeted by high winds and ransacked by winter storms. In this emotional maelstrom, I knew only one person who seemed to have the knack of staying afloat. And so I clung to him as to a life raft, buoyed by his concern for my welfare, guided by his advice, secure in his example. In retrospect, I am amazed that Brijen Gupta was only ten years older than I was.¹ Yet the difference<br>

  Abstract: When blues legend Howlin’ Wolf sings, “Nature cause me to mess up my life,” we know how he feels.¹ Caught by the inevitable, yet never entirely blameless, a person trapped by “nature”—“bad-ass nature” in this case—will surely sing the blues. And yet, despite our instinctive respect for nature’s power, we rarely define what we mean by the term. Nature may mean a person’s individual nature, as it seems to for Howlin’ Wolf, or human nature in general. Alternatively, it may mean physical nature, the concrete world external to ourselves, or it may mean the nature of circumstances, the<br>

  Abstract: Politics is an always uncertain and often dangerous enterprise, but wielding power as a big person in a patron-client setting is especially precarious. Every step in the career of such an individual is marked with peril. Seeking, gaining, exercising, maintaining, and even relinquishing power are all fraught with risk. As noted in the previous two chapters, the use of force and the distribution of spoils are common strategies leaders turn to as they seek to enforce compliance or purchase loyalty. Not as well recognized are the less violent, less hazardous, and less costly approaches used by leaders. The present chapter<br>

  Abstract: The spiritually healthy soul is a strong soul, a robust soul. Its strength comes from God, from the presence of God within. The emptiness in the self’s vortex becomes filled with the person of Jesus Christ, who is placed there by the Holy Spirit. Christ in both natures—the suffering humanity and the resurrected divinity—are present. Like a dynamo spreading power to light a city, this presence provides power that emanates from eternal life.<br>

  Abstract: One cannot pledge allegiance to a person, a position, or even a nation. One can declare allegiance only to a force or a movement. And it is lyric that allows one to locate and praise this present force, instead of reducing it to a wishful future or an inert past narrative. That, at least, is the lesson of Marvell’s Cromwell poems, as well as of his early royalist elegies. This chapter argues that “An Horatian Ode,” as well as his other political encomia, uses the apocalypse to reconsider the

  Abstract: The excerpt from Bialik’s poem as the first epigraph begins with a contact between scroll and person far more intimate than any proscribed by the Talmud. It terminates, at least as I have reproduced it here, with the poem’s title—transliterated as “
                  Lifneiaron ha-sefarim”—rendered in Hebrew characters. Part of what Levinas calls the Gemara’s “secret scent” lies in its orthography and graphemes, the characters that make up the Hebrew-Aramaic alphabet. So, indeed, does the secret scent of Bialik’s poetry. If the classic books of Jewish religious instruction no longer exert their pull on the poem’s speaker, if their columns<br>

  Abstract: Jaime Gil de Biedma’s poems come across on first reading as clear and “realistic.” Many of them comprise detailed evocations of specific episodes, narrated by a first-person speaker who gives commentaries and conclusions. Quite often these commentaries offer philosophic insights; at times, especially in the later books, they contain social or political ideas. All of this has led some critics to characterize Gil de Biedma as a realistic poet proccupied with ethical and social issues.¹ The very clarity of his work has caused readers to miss its depth and originality.<br>

  Abstract: In the five previous chapters, I have explored the range and complexity of the desires that nuns unveil on-screen and shown how these subvert one view of religious life voiced by Sister Luke, that “a nun is not a person who wishes or desires.” While traditional nuns regard the selfless surrender to God in agape as their supreme purpose, they paradoxically allude to the desires associated with eros when they acknowledge that “this letting go” of the self can awaken “the deepest yearnings of the human heart” (Donovan and Wusinich 2009: 28).

  Book Title: Questioning the Human: Toward a Theological Anthropology for the Twenty-First Century-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Van Stichel Ellen<br>
  Abstract: Theological anthropology is being put to the test: in the face of contemporary developments in the spheres of culture, politics, and science, traditional perspectives on the human person are no longer adequate. Yet can theological anthropology move beyond its previously established categories and renew itself in relation to contemporary insights? The present collection of essays sets out to answer this question. Uniting Roman Catholic theologians from across the globe, it tackles from a theological perspective challenges related to the classical natural law tradition (part 1), to the modern conception of the subject (part 2), and to the postmodern awareness of diversity in a globalizing context (part 3). Its contributors share a fundamental methodological choice of a critical-constructive dialogue with contemporary culture, science, and philosophy. This collection integrates a wider range of approaches than one usually finds in theological volumes, bringing together experts in systematic theology and in theological ethics. Authors come from different American contexts, including Black and Latino, and from a European context that include both French and German. Moreover, the interdisciplinary insights upon which the different contributions draw stem from both the natural sciences (such as neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and ethology) and the humanities (such as cultural studies, philosophy, and hermeneutics). This volume will be essential reading for anyone seeking a state-of-the-art account of theological anthropology, of the uncertainties it is facing, and of the responses it is in the process of formulating. The shared Roman Catholic background of the authors of this collection makes this volume a helpful complement to recent publications that predominantly represent views from other theological traditions.<br>

  Abstract: In this book various scholars explore the new challenges for theological anthropology. They make clear that the developments of the past fifty years in various fields of endeavor should be seen as an invitation, if not indeed as an urgent injunction, “to open our eyes to new ways of being human” (Julie Clague).¹ At the same time, we need to heed the postmodern warning regarding the dangers of engaging in what Henri-Jérôme Gagey called a “giant discourse,” whereby, in our attempt to unite languages into a single coherent understanding of the human person, we end up building a tower of<br>

  Abstract: Thomas Hobbes’s political philosophy is based on a paradox: Hobbes, one could say, gives too much and too little to the state at the same time. He can thus be seen in the tradition of Leo Strauss, as the father of liberalism, but also, from a liberal perspective, he is dismissed as the guardian of state absolutism. Hobbes stresses the absoluteness of state power, being the sovereign, that is highest, not surmountable power, so strong that he denies to the subjects aligned with each other in the person of the Leviathan every right to defy a sovereign decision or to<br>

  Abstract: A gift is any object given by one person to another, gratuitously (in the

This gratuitousness is emphasized as an essential part of the gift: a gift has to be given in a certain spirit if it is to be a gift at all, and that spirit is sheer generosity. The purest of gifts is the one that is given without motive, without reason, without any foundation other than the desire to give. A gift is, in the<br>

  Book Title: Crossover Queries: Dwelling with Negatives, Embodying Philosophy's Others-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): WYSCHOGROD EDITH<br>
  Abstract: Exploring the risks, ambiguities, and unstable conceptual worlds of contemporary thought, Crossover Queries brings together the wide-ranging writings, across twenty years, of one of our most important philosophers.Ranging from twentieth-century European philosophy-the thought of Heidegger, Foucault, Derrida, Levinas, Janicaud, and others-to novels and artworks, music and dance, from traditional Jewish thought to Jain andBuddhist metaphysics, Wyschogrod's work opens radically new vistas while remaining mindful that the philosopher stands within and is responsible to a philosophical legacy conditioned by the negative.Rather than point to a Hegelian dialectic of overcoming negation or to a postmetaphysical exhaustion, Wyschogrod treats negative moments as opening novel spaces for thought. She probes both the desire for God and an ethics grounded in the interests of the other person, seeing these as moments both of crossing over and of negation. Alert to the catastrophes that have marked our times, she exposes the underlying logical structures of nihilatory forces that have been exerted to exterminate whole peoples. Analyzing the negationsof biological research and cultural images of mechanized and robotic bodies, she shows how they contest the body as lived in ordinary experience.Crossover Queries brings together important essays on a remarkable range of topics by one of our most insightful cultural critics. Commenting on philosophical and theological issues that have shaped the recent past as well as scientific and technological questions that will preoccupy us in the near future, Wyschogrod consistently alerts us to the urgency of problems whose importance few recognize. To avoid the challenge these essays pose is to avoid responsibility for a future that appears to be increasingly fragile.-Mark C. Taylor, Columbia University<br>

  Author(s) RASCHKE CARL<br>
  Abstract: The work of Levinas attempts to give an account of the uniqueness of the human person, starting from what he believes to be peculiar to persons, the recognition of others as the source of moral obligation. This criterion had already been proposed in the literature of neo-Kantianism, but the formulation it received there had been found wanting. According to Heidegger, the neo-Kantian sees in the ethical a means for transcending human finitude: “There is something in the categorical imperative which exceeds the finite being.”¹ But for Heidegger the concept of the ethical can display itself only in relation to a<br>

  Author(s) Snellen Paulien<br>
  Abstract: Among the most challenging issues facing environmental hermeneutics is how to think about person-world relationships in an integrated manner—not by way of conceptually separated natural environments and social spheres—as if there were either some “pure nature” untouched by our interpretations and actions or any human life apart from environmental dynamics. Rather, the interactions of the physiochemical and biological, the individuating and communal dimensions—at all scales—provide our subject matter. For instance, it makes little sense to carry on studying “sense of place” and “identity” as we have been, assuming that these phenomena are stable and that the<br>

  Abstract: Catholics have often struggled to achieve recognition in France as legitimate intellectuals with a distinctive voice and valuable ideas to contribute. To a large extent, this is a result of the difficult interface between religion and politics. However, key Catholic figures in the interwar period worked with great tenacity to address the problems and dilemmas that rendered the interface difficult, especially the tensions between the spiritual and temporal realms and between a long-term conception of civilization and short-term political objectives. In the process they developed a complex but workable concept of engagement, based on a notion of the human person,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt14bsxmk">Hegemony</a><br>
  Abstract: In mainstream theories of world politics, the workings of political power are usually seen as a historical constant. They share the view expressed so clearly by Paul Ricoeur that “power does not have much of a history.”¹ At the same time, political power is overwhelmingly associated with “the modern state,” to which all states are supposed to correspond, but which is usually a version of France, England, or the United States regarded as a unitary actor equivalent to an individual person. Political power is envisioned in terms of units of territorial sovereignty (at least for the so-called Great Powers) that<br>

  Author(s) Lipman Matthew<br>
  Abstract: The first chapter in this part is Ann Margaret Sharp’s “Discovering Yourself a Person.” Here she examines Chapter One of Harry Stottlemeier’s Discovery. In it, Sharp finds that because the first chapter relies heavily on the analysis of concepts like reasoning, reflecting, falsifying, inquiring, and so on, it is an appropriate place for the discovery (or invention, it might be added) of who and what we are. As one watches the characters in Harry begin the process of inquiry and as one watches them stumble toward the formation ofa community, one finds them formulating individual ways or styles of thinking.<br>

  Abstract: The article focuses on the understanding of vulnerability that is found in the thought of Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Emmanuel Levinas. For Bonhoeffer, vulnerability is best understood as a form of ‘vulnerable discipleship’, that is, a choosing to be vulnerable for the other which aligns with his understanding of costly grace. For Levinas, vulnerability is primarily concerned with the vulnerability of the other person and, later in his thought, the vulnerability of the subject who is responsible for the other person. In exploring the grounds for possible conversation between these two thinkers, we argue that Levinas has potential to offer a<br>

How does religious commitment affect philosophy or feminism? How does feminism play out in religious or philosophical commitment? Wrestling with answers to these questions, women who balance philosophy, feminism, and faith write about their lives. The voices gathered here from several different traditions-Catholic, Protestant, Quaker, Jewish, and Muslim-represent diverse ethnicities, races, and ages. The challenging and poignant reflections in Philosophy, Feminism, and Faith show how critical thought can successfully mesh with religious faith and social responsibility.<br>

  Book Title: Critical Trauma Studies-Understanding Violence, Conflict and Memory in Everyday Life<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Wertheimer Eric<br>
  Abstract: Trauma is a universal human experience. While each person responds differently to trauma, its presence in our lives nonetheless marks a continual thread through human history and prehistory. In
      Critical Trauma Studies, a diverse group of writers, activists, and scholars of sociology, anthropology, literature, and cultural studies reflects on the study of trauma and how multidisciplinary approaches lend richness and a sense of deeper understanding to this burgeoning field of inquiry. The original essays within this collection cover topics such as female suicide bombers from the Chechen Republic, singing prisoners in Iranian prison camps, sexual assault and survivor advocacy, and families facing the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. As it proceeds,Critical Trauma Studiesnever loses sight of the way those who study trauma as an academic field, and those who experience, narrate, and remediate trauma as a personal and embodied event, inform one another. Theoretically adventurous and deeply particular, this book aims to advance trauma studies as a discipline that transcends intellectual boundaries, to be mapped but also to be unmoored from conceptual and practical imperatives. Remaining embedded in lived experiences and material realities,Critical Trauma Studiesframes the field as both richly unbounded and yet clearly defined, historical, and evidence-based.<br>

Among the many examples of this trend we can include the antagonism toward “grand narratives,” the postcolonial emphasis on hybridity, the resistance to Marxist models of totality (synonymous, briefly, with totalization) or to masculine models of desire seen in French feminism and queer theory<br>

  Abstract: Christian theology has recourse to a classically constructed kenotic God, of which the second person becomes incarnate: “who, though he was in the form of God, did not regard equality with God as something to be exploited, but emptied himself, taking the form of a slave, being born in human likeness. And being found in human form, he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death—even death on a cross.”¹ This radically personal God, who willingly accepts radical kenotic constraints in order to dwell among humankind, shares fully in human vulnerability—including death—in order to make<br>

  Book Title: Into the Far Country-Karl Barth and the Modern Subject<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Long D. Stephen<br>
  Abstract: Into the Far Country is an investigation of Karl Barth’s response to modernity as seen through the prism of the subject under judgment. By suggesting that Barth offers a form of theological resistance to the Enlightenment’s construal of human subjectivity as “absolute," this piece offers a way of talking about the formation of human persons as the process of being kenotically laid bare before the cross and resurrection of Christ. It does so by reevaluating the relationship between Barth and modernity, making the case that Barth understands Protestantism to have become the agent of its own demise by capitulating to modernity’s insistence on the axiomatic priority of the isolated Cartesian ego. Conversations are hosted with figures including Fyodor Dostoevsky, Rowan Williams, Gillian Rose and Donald MacKinnon in the service of elucidating an account of the human person liberated from captivity to what Barth names “self-judgment," and freed for creative participation in the super-abundant source of life that is the prayerful movement from the Son to the Father in the Spirit. Therefore, an account of Barth’s theology is offered that is deeply concerned with the triune God’s revelatory presence as that which drives the community into the crucible of difficulty that is the life of kenotic dispossession.<br>

The argument for the white person’s innocence in matters of race connects with the cultural ideas of innocence and defilement. The very contrast between the colors, white and black, is often a symbol for the contrast between innocence and defilement. Thus, the theme of white innocence in the legal rhetoric of race draws its power from more than the obvious advantage of pushing away responsibility. It takes power from the cultural, religious,<br>

Following his death this revelation was repressed in turn, only to reemerge from its state of unconscious latency in the teachings of the prophets, which would become the common patrimony of the entire Jewish people.<br>

  Book Title: Facing the Other-John Paul II, Levinas, and the Body<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): de Malherbe Brice<br>
  Abstract: What is the significance of the body? What might phenomenology contribute to a theological account of the body? And what is gained by prolonging the overlooked dialogue between St. John Paul II and Emmanuel Levinas? Nigel Zimmermann answers these questions through the agreements and the tensions between two of the most important thinkers of the twentieth century. John Paul II, the Polish pope, philosopher, and theologian, and Emmanuel Levinas, the French-Jewish philosopher of Lithuanian heritage, were provocative thinkers who courageously faced and challenged the assumptions of their age. Both held the human person in high regard and did their thinking with constant reference to God and to theological language. Zimmermann does not shirk from the challenges of each thinker and does not hide their differences. However, he shows how they bequeath a legacy regarding the body that we would overlook at significant ethical peril. We are called, Zimmermann argues, to face the other. In this moment God refuses a banal marginalisation and our call to responsibility for the other person is issued in their disarming vulnerability. In the body, philosophy, theology, and ethics converge to call us to glory, even in the paradox of lowly suffering.<br>

  Book Title: Gift and the Unity of Being-  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Milbank John<br>
  Abstract: Starting from both our originary experience of being given to ourselves and Jesus Christ’s archetypal self-donation, 'Gift and the Unity of Being' elucidates the sense in which gift is the form of being’s unity, while unity itself constitutes the permanence of the gift of being. In dialogue with ancient and modern philosophers and theologians, López offers a synthetic, rather than systematic, account of the unity proper to being, the human person, God, and the relations among them. The book shows how contemplation of the triune God of love through Jesus Christ in the Holy Spirit allows us to discover the eternal communion that being is and to which finite being is called. It also illustrates the sense in which God’s gratuitousness unexpectedly offers the human person the possibility to recognize and embrace his origin and destiny, and thus he is given to see and taste in God’s light the ever-fruitful, dramatic, and mysterious positivity of being.<br>

  Abstract: A primary developmental task for a child is to become emotionally bonded with a significant caregiver (e.g., mother) and then, in due course, to separate from her and to individuate and become his or her own person (Mahler, Pine, & Bergman, 1975). A failure to achieve this developmental task may mark the person’s relational pattern in that he or she may develop a fear of getting close to people or of feeling abandoned when pushed to pursue independence. A person with this pattern can also alternate between getting close to and taking distance from a significant person. This relational pattern—referred<br>

Several central themes of his theology are based on his use of the category of relation, such as his theology of the Trinity (the divine person as subsistent relation), creation (the relation of God to the world), and the Incarnation (the relation of the divine and the human natures in Christ). Relation receives attention of a philosophical and a theological order.¹ The philosophical approach is well attested in Aquinas’s commentaries on the

  Book Title: Analogies of Transcendence-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): FIELDS STEPHEN M.<br>
  Abstract: The problem of nature and grace lies at the heart of Christian theology. No dimension of divine revelation can be addressed without implicitly drawing reference to this issue.Analogies of Transcendence focuses on the central role that the analogies of being and faith play in developing a solution to the problem. These link God, as self-manifesting transcendence, to the human person as both fallen and justified, and to the material cosmos. Although the proposed solution draws on the work of Maréchal, de Lubac, Balthasar, and Rahner, it criticizes their approach for its underdeveloped analogies that diminish nature in grace's engagement with it. In redressing this weakness, Fr. Fields adapts its solution to the intellectual struggle of our time. This volume examines the origins and structure of modernity, which, it asserts, has not been superseded and is therefore critical of'‘postmodernism,' as well as of some ambiguous legacies of Thomism.<br>

We have also argued that the sacramental model constituted by these analogies can address modernity.

  Book Title: Writing and Materiality in China-Essays in Honor of Patrick Hanan<br>
  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Widmer Ellen<br>
  Abstract: Speaking about Chinese writing entails thinking about how writing speaks through various media. In the guises of the written character and its imprints, traces, or ruins, writing is more than textuality. The goal of this volume is to consider the relationship of writing to materiality in China’s literary history and to ponder the physical aspects of the production and circulation of writing. To speak of the thing-ness of writing is to understand it as a thing in constant motion, transported from one place or time to another, one genre or medium to another, one person or public to another. Thinking about writing as the material product of a culture shifts the emphasis from the author as the creator and ultimate arbiter of a text’s meaning to the editors, publishers, collectors, and readers through whose hands a text is reshaped, disseminated, and given new meanings. By yoking writing and materiality, the contributors to this volume aim to bypass the tendency to oppose form and content, words and things, documents and artifacts, to rethink key issues in the interpretation of Chinese literary and visual culture.<br>

  Book Title: Public Memory in Early China-  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Brashier K. E.<br>
  Abstract: In early imperial China, the dead were remembered by stereotyping them, by relating them to the existing public memory and not by vaunting what made each person individually distinct and extraordinary in his or her lifetime. Their posthumous names were chosen from a limited predetermined pool; their descriptors were derived from set phrases in the classical tradition; and their identities were explicitly categorized as being like this cultural hero or that sage official in antiquity. In other words, postmortem remembrance was a process of pouring new ancestors into prefabricated molds or stamping them with rigid cookie cutters. Public Memory in Early China is an examination of this pouring and stamping process. After surveying ways in which learning in the early imperial period relied upon memorization and recitation, K. E. Brashier treats three definitive parameters of identity—name, age, and kinship—as ways of negotiating a person’s relative position within the collective consciousness. He then examines both the tangible and intangible media responsible for keeping that defined identity welded into the infrastructure of Han public memory.<br>

  Book Title: Strange Narrators in Contemporary Fiction-Explorations in Readers' Engagement with Characters<br>
  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): CARACCIOLO MARCO<br>
  Abstract: A storyteller's craft can often be judged by how convincingly the narrative captures the identity and personality of its characters. In this book, the characters who take center stage are "strange" first-person narrators: they are fascinating because of how they are at odds with what the reader would wish or expect to hear-while remaining reassuringly familiar in voice, interactions, and conversations. Combining literary analysis with research in cognitive and social psychology, Marco Caracciolo focuses on readers' encounters with the "strange" narrators of ten contemporary novels, including Bret Easton Ellis's
      American Psycho, Haruki Murakami'sHard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, and Mark Haddon'sThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time. Caracciolo explores readers' responses to narrators who suffer from neurocognitive or developmental disorders, who are mentally disturbed due to multiple personality disorder or psychopathy, whose consciousness is split between two parallel dimensions or is disembodied, who are animals, or who lose their sanity.A foray into current work on reception, reader-response, cognitive literary study, and narratology,Strange Narrators in Contemporary Fictionillustrates why any encounter with a fictional text is a complex negotiation of interlaced feelings, thoughts, experiences, and interpretations.<br>

  Book Title: Children of God in the World-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): O’Callaghan Paul<br>
  Abstract: Children of God in the World is a textbook of theological anthropology structured in four parts. The first attempts to clarify the relationship between theology, philosophy and science in their respective approaches to anthropology, and establishes the fundamental principle of the text, stated in Vatican II's Gaudium et spes, n. 22, "Christ manifests man to man." The second part provides a historical overview of the doctrine of grace: in Scripture (especially the teaching of the book of Genesis on humans 'made in the image of God', as well as Paul and John), among the Fathers (in particular the oriental doctrine of 'divinization' and Augustine), during the Middle Ages (especially Thomas Aquinas) and the Reformation period (centered particularly on Luther and the Council of Trent), right up to modern times. The third part of the text, the central one, provides a systematic understanding of Christian grace in terms of the God's life present in human believers by which they become children of God, disciples, friends and brothers of Christ, temples of the Holy Spirit. This section also provides a reflection on the theological virtues (faith, hope and charity), on the relationship between grace and human freedom, on the role of the Church and Christian apostolate in the communication of grace, and on the need humans have for divine grace. After considering the relationship between the natural and the supernatural order, the fourth and last part deals with different philosophical aspects of the human condition, in the light of Christian faith: the union between body and soul, humans as free, historical, social, sexual and working beings. The last chapter concludes with a consideration of the human person, Christianity's greatest and most enduring contribution to human thought.<br>

  Abstract: Emmanuel Levinas is typically thought of as an ethical thinker, with his thought involving a tension between “ethics” and “politics.”¹ Certainly Levinas’s formulations seem to lend themselves to be thought in this way, as he speaks of an infinite responsibility for the other person that goes beyond all politics and all power systems, the latter arising only with the interruption of this face-to-face relationship by the “third,” which would delimit this responsibility and even betray it.² I have been arguing that Levinas has never been an ethicist in the traditional sense.

  Author(s) NIELSEN HENRIK SKOV<br>
  Abstract: My purpose in this essay is to critique the concept of narrative voice from the vantage point of a rhetorical model of fictive representation. In its core sense, narrative voice is concerned with the narrating instance, the various manifestations of which are usually categorized in terms of person and level. These distinctions provide for a typology of narrating instances which is conventionally understood within a communicative model of narration—a model in which the narrating instance is situated within the structure of narrative representation, as a literal communicative act (that is, as a discursive event that forms part of a<br>

  Abstract: People’s relations with signs in Java, the degree to which they are master of or subject to them, at once indicate and determine their potency. This assumption about the relationship between self and Signs has important consequences for Javanese epistemology. Exegesis of wayang exemplifies these consequences, and I will take it as a starting point for a more general discussion of Javanese interpretation. My point is that, like speech, the signs that are an art form, a tract of ngèlmu, or a dream, all pose a challenge to a person’s autonomy, a challenge to which modes of interpretation are the<br>

  Abstract: Henri Peyre (1901-1988), a giant figure in French studies, did more to introduce Americans to the modern literature and culture of French than any other person. Sterling Professor and chair of the French Department of Yale University for more than four decades, Peyre was also the author of forty-four books, a brilliant speaker, and a mentor to two generations of students. He left enormous legacies as both teacher and scholar.Peyre also left a large and fascinating body of correspondence. This collection of his letters documents the era in which he lived. His lively letters also bear witness to the vast network of his friends and colleagues, including such major post-war literary figures as Robert Penn Warren, Andre Gide, and Andre Malraux.<br>

  Abstract: Socialization processes normally imply that we stimulate and praise—or discourage and scorn—some of our desires. And something comparable happens to our beliefs, emotions, interests, and, of course, to our actions. A tradition or cultural heritage is not just something out there; it entails a complex, and usually implicit, social normativity. However, communities also make explicit, in a fragmentary way, that normativity by means of codes, regulations, exhortations, suggestions, prohibitions, historical narratives, monuments, songs—all in a more or less vague and inconsistent manner.

  Abstract: “All men are intellectuals,” Gramsci famously declared, “but not all men have in society the function of intellectuals.”¹ For scholars writing in the wake of Edward Said’s influential
                  Representations of the Intellectual, that function has mainly been to serve as a “critical commentator addressing a nonspecialist audience on matters of broad public concern.”² While writers on public intellectualism acknowledge that university credentials are not a prerequisite for this kind of enterprise, for the most part their discussions describe a “person trained in a particular discipline . . . who is on the faculty of a college or university.”³ While such<br>

  Abstract: I have delayed treating explicitly the theological aspect of fortitude until now in order to allow clear terrain for dialogue between resilience research and Aquinas’ virtue anthropology. The previous chapters serve as a foundation concerning his vision of human agency in adversity and the way in which resilience research offer psychosocial insights on human development and resilience in difficulty. By treating the theological aspects of virtue and resilience apart from the philosophical and psychosocial aspects, I do not mean to imply that the subject (person or community) examined philosophically and scientifically differs from the subject examined spiritually and theologically.

  Abstract: One of Kenneth Schmitz’s major and undoubtedly lasting accomplishments is his demonstration of the distinctive contribution made by Karol Wojtyla to philosophy. In Schmitz’s masterful expositions, Wojtyla’s philosophical project comes alive as an effort to understand action phenomenologically and realistically, as something that proceeds from and reveals, not consciousness, but the whole person “as a being among other beings.”¹ In this connection, among other things, Schmitz corrects a common misunderstanding of the extent of Wojtyla’s philosophical debt to Scheler’s thought. To be sure, Wojtyla plainly acknowledges the importance to him of both Scheler’s critique of Kant’s ethics and its basis<br>

  Abstract: The German philosopher Josef pieper (1904–1997) continues to provoke among his contemporaries constructive, critical, and especially fruitful discussion on anthropological and ethical questions. He does this by formulating a defense of culture, which he contrasts with a pragmatic way of thinking that reduces the person to a specific role and function, to proletarian status.

  Abstract: The subject of this book, the human person as the efficient cause of his own action, locates the very center of Wojtyła’s philosophy. One reason for this is the intrinsic unity and constant interrelation of anthropology and ethics in the thought of Wojtyła. In his anthropological publications, he always analyzes the ethical implications of the anthropological theses. Correspondingly, when he writes about ethics, he is always interested in the question: “What concept of man underlies a particular ethical theory?” I have been able, therefore, to explore the fundamental themes of Wojtyła’s anthropology and ethics while at the same time safeguarding<br>

  Abstract: The contributors to this inspiring anthology meet the challenge that everyone faces: that of becoming a whole person in both their personal and professional lives. John C. Haughey, SJ, has gathered twelve professionals in higher education from a variety of disciplines-philosophy, theology, health care, business, and administration. What they have in common reflects the creative understanding of the meaning of "catholic" as Haughey has found it to operate in Catholic higher education. Each essay in the first six chapters describes how its author has assembled a unique whole from within his or her particular area of academic competence. The last six chapters are more autobiographical, with each author describing what has become central to his or her identity. All twelve are "anticipating an entirety" with each contributing a coherence that is as surprising as it is delightful.<br>

A reasonable question immediately arises: What does it mean to consider the human sexual person adequately in order to respond to complex moral issues surrounding human sexuality? In response to this question we first formulate a foundational principle of human sexuality; we then expand on the morally significant dimensions of that principle; and finally we draw insight from these dimensions in our reconstructed definition of complementarity, a<br>

  Abstract: As mentioned in chapter 4 within the section, “The Human Good,” Lonergan defines conversion in terms of horizontal and vertical liberty. Horizontal liberty allows a person to make relatively minor choices from a range of options within a fixed boundary or “horizon.” Vertical liberty is the product of a much more radical choice, a leap of self-transcendence that expands or otherwise transforms one’s horizon itself. Sometimes the new horizon, “though notably deeper and broader and richer” than the previous horizon, may still be “consonant with the old and a development out of its potentialities.” However, sometimes a new horizon is<br>

As Plato recognizes, philosopher-rulers need not only “the ability to grasp eternal and immutable truth” but also certain “qualities of character”; in describing these, he begins with “love of the knowledge that reveals eternal reality” and follows immediately with “truthfulness” – for how could “a love of wisdom and a love of falsehood” possibly coexist in one person?¹ Character thus connotes integrity, because virtuous traits are complementary and coherent.<br>

  Book Title: Passage to Modernity-An Essay on the Hermeneutics of Nature and Culture<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Dupré Louis<br>
  Abstract: Did modernity begin with the Renaissance and end with post-modernity? In this book a distinguished scholar challenges both these assumptions. Louis Dupré discusses the roots, development, and impact of modern thought, tracing the fundamental principles of modernity to the late fourteenth century and affirming that modernity is still an influential force in contemporary culture.The combination of late medieval theology and early Italian humanism shattered the traditional synthesis that had united cosmic, human, and transcendent components in a comprehensive idea of nature. Early Italian humanism transformed the traditional worldview by its unprecedented emphasis on human creativity. The person emerged as the sole source of meaning while nature was reduced to an object and transcendence withdrew into a "supernatural" realm. Dupré analyzes this fragmentation as well as the writings of those who reacted against it-philosophers like Cusanus and Bruno, humanists like Ficino and Erasmus, theologians like Baius and Jansenius, mystics like Ignatius Loyola and Francis de Sales, and theosophists like Weigel and Boehme.Baroque culture briefly reunited the human, cosmic, and transcendent components, but since that time the disintegrating forces have increased in strength. Despite post-modern criticism, the principles of early modernity continue to dominate the climate of our time.
      Passage to Modernityis not so much a critique as a search for the philosophical meaning of the epochal change achieved by those principles.<br>

  Abstract: Childhood studies, a field designed to dismantle inaccurate and often destructive definitions of childhood, has yet to come up with a consensus on what we mean when we say “child” in the first place. If the child is socially constructed, as Philippe Ariès has argued, and as many of our contributors take as a given, how can we possibly hope to work through those constructions to extract an authentic person? As the conversation moves between the humanities and the social sciences, between archivists and activists, childhood studies struggles with the question of how to bridge the relationship between the rhetorical<br>

  Abstract: Born in 1795, Keats was among the younger generation of Romantic poets who grew up when Wordsworth’s influence was dominant. He came from a lower-middle-class family (his father ran a livery stable), and he had no prospects of higher education. At the age of sixteen, he was apprenticed to an apothecary-surgeon and later studied medicine at Guy’s and St. Thomas’s hospitals in London. Our contemporary notion of a surgeon as a highly trained specialist is not appropriate to Keats’s prospect. In his time, a surgeon was a medically trained person whose skills seldom went beyond setting broken bones and lancing<br>

  Book Title: The Sacredness of the Person-A New Genealogy of Human Rights<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Skinner Alex<br>
  Abstract: According to Joas, every single human being has increasingly been viewed as sacred. He discusses the abolition of torture and slavery, once common practice in the pre-18th century west, as two milestones in modern human history. The author concludes by portraying the emergence of the UN Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 as a successful process of value generalization. Joas demonstrates that the history of human rights cannot adequately be described as a history of ideas or as legal history, but as a complex transformation in which diverse cultural traditions had to be articulated, legally codified, and assimilated into practices of everyday life. The sacralization of the person and universal human rights will only be secure in the future, warns Joas, through continued support by institutions and society, vigorous discourse in their defense, and their incarnation in everyday life and practice.<br>

  Abstract: The key thesis underlying the three historical-sociological discussions presented in this book is that we should understand the rise of human rights and the idea of universal human dignity as a process of the sacralization of the person. Inherent in this thesis is a rejection of all notions that this rise can be regarded as the product of a particular tradition, such as the Christian—a product that was more or less bound to emerge from the seed of tradition at some point in history. Traditions as such, I suggest, generate nothing. What matters is how they are appropriated by<br>

  Book Title: Hysteria Complicated by Ecstasy-The Case of Nanette Leroux<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): GOLDSTEIN JAN<br>
  Abstract: Hysteria Complicated by Ecstasyoffers a rare window into the inner life of a person ordinarily inaccessible to historians: a semiliterate peasant girl who lived almost two centuries ago, in the aftermath of the French Revolution. Eighteen-year-old Nanette Leroux fell ill in 1822 with a variety of incapacitating nervous symptoms. Living near the spa at Aix-les-Bains, she became the charity patient of its medical director, Antoine Despine, who treated her with hydrotherapy and animal magnetism, as hypnosis was then called. Jan Goldstein translates, and provides a substantial introduction to, the previously unpublished manuscript recounting Nanette's strange illness--a manuscript coauthored by Despine and Alexandre Bertrand, the Paris physician who memorably diagnosed Nanette as suffering from "hysteria complicated by ecstasy." While hysteria would become a fashionable disease among urban women by the end of the nineteenth century, the case of Nanette Leroux differs sharply from this pattern in its early date and rural setting.<br>

  Book Title: Seasons of Misery-Catastrophe and Colonial Settlement in Early America<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): DONEGAN KATHLEEN<br>
  Abstract: The stories we tell of American beginnings typically emphasize colonial triumph in the face of adversity. But the early years of English settlement in America were characterized by catastrophe: starvation, disease, extreme violence, ruinous ignorance, and serial abandonment.
      Seasons of Miseryoffers a provocative reexamination of the British colonies' chaotic and profoundly unstable early days, placing crisis-both experiential and existential-at the center of the story. At the outposts of a fledgling empire and disconnected from the social order of their home society, English settlers were both physically and psychologically estranged from their European identities. They could not control, or often even survive, the world they had intended to possess. According to Kathleen Donegan, it was in this cauldron of uncertainty that colonial identity was formed. Studying the English settlements at Roanoke, Jamestown, Plymouth, and Barbados, Donegan argues that catastrophe marked the threshold between an old European identity and a new colonial identity, a state of instability in which only fragments of Englishness could survive amid the upheavals of the New World. This constant state of crisis also produced the first distinctively colonial literature as settlers attempted to process events that they could neither fully absorb nor understand. Bringing a critical eye to settlers' first-person accounts, Donegan applies a unique combination of narrative history and literary analysis to trace how settlers used a language of catastrophe to describe unprecedented circumstances, witness unrecognizable selves, and report unaccountable events.Seasons of Miseryaddresses both the stories that colonists told about themselves and the stories that we have constructed in hindsight about them. In doing so, it offers a new account of the meaning of settlement history and the creation of colonial identity.<br>

  Book Title: The Reparative in Narratives-Works of Mourning in Progress<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROSELLO MIREILLE<br>
  Abstract: The authors studied in this book can be visualized as the islands that constitute an unknown, fragile and trembling literary and cultural Francophone archipelago. The archipelago does not appear on any map, in the middle of an ocean whose name we already know. No Francophone anthology would put these authors together as a matter of course because what connects them is a narrative grammar rather than a national origin or even a language. Yet, their writing techniques and their apprehension of the real (the ways in which they know and name the world) both reflect and actively participate in our evolving perception of what Gayatri Spivak calls the “planet”. The Reparative in Narratives argues that argue that they repair trauma through writing. One description of these awe-inspiring, tender and sometimes horrifying tales is that their narrators are survivors who have experienced and sometimes inflicted unspeakable acts of violence. And yet, ultimately, despair, nihilism, cynicism or silence are never the consequences of their encounter with what some quickly call evil. The traumatic event has not killed them and has not killed their desire to write or perform, although the decidedly altered life that they live in the aftermath of the disaster forces them to become different types of storytellers. They are the first-person narrators of their story, and their narration reinvents them as speaking subjects. In turn, this requires that we accept new reading pacts. That pact is a temporal and geographical signature: the reparative narrative needs readers prepared to accept that healing belongs to the realm of possibilities and that exposure and denunciation do not exhaust the victim’s range of possibilities. Rosello contends that this context-specific yet repeating pattern constitutes a response to the contemporary figuration of both globalized and extremely localized types of traumatic memories.<br>

This leads us to a question of classification. Modiano’s novels are not what they seem, so we know what they are not: but what exactly are they? To what subgenre<br>

As an emotional reaction to the denial of the loss of a loved object, be it a person, a place, or an ideal, melancholia gives shape to a “constellation of affect” or a “structure of feeling” encompassing the individual and the collective, the psychic and the social (Eng and Kazanjian, 2003: 3).

Starting in the 1930s, Shpet became largely invisible in official Soviet scholarly discourse, a tendency that was only exacerbated during the decades after his execution in 1937.

  Book Title: Textual Intimacy-Autobiography and Religious Identities<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): KORT WESLEY A.<br>
  Abstract: Given its affinity with questions of identity, autobiography offers a way into the interior space between author and reader, especially when writers define themselves in terms of religion. In his exploration of this "textual intimacy," Wesley Kort begins with a theorization of what it means to say who one is and how one's self-account as a religious person stands in relation to other forms of self-identification. He then provides a critical analysis of autobiographical texts by nine contemporary American writers-including Maya Angelou, Philip Roth, and Anne Lamott-who give religion a positive place in their accounts of who they are. Finally, in disclosing his own religious identity, Kort concludes with a meditation on several meanings of the word

  Abstract: The moral relationship between justice and mercy is analogous to the relationship between a morally good state and a morally good person. That is to say, justice is prior to mercy in the realm of practice. A morally good state is determined by morally good laws, which in turn provide the necessary conditions for the moral development of its citizens and, most important, the practice of justice by both individual citizens and the state. Of course, morally good laws are determined in large part by the moral quality of those who make the laws. In brief, justice pertains to objective<br>

  Abstract: Conceptions of the person are often central to the ways people reason about ethics, rights, and justice. These conceptions are not the same everywhere. In various cultures individuals are de-fined as people mainly by their status or social role, by their age or gender, or by the particular relationships into which they enter. This relativist image of the person has been opposed, most strongly in cultures that have been heir to the Western classical and Judeo-Christian cultural tradition, by a view of the individual as a particular incarnation of a generalized category of personhood—the notion of “man” as both<br>

  Book Title: Circles Disturbed-The Interplay of Mathematics and Narrative<br>

  Author(s): MAZUR BARRY<br>
  Abstract: Circles Disturbedbrings together important thinkers in mathematics, history, and philosophy to explore the relationship between mathematics and narrative. The book's title recalls the last words of the great Greek mathematician Archimedes before he was slain by a Roman soldier--"Don't disturb my circles"--words that seem to refer to two radically different concerns: that of the practical person living in the concrete world of reality, and that of the theoretician lost in a world of abstraction. Stories and theorems are, in a sense, the natural languages of these two worlds--stories representing the way we act and interact, and theorems giving us pure thought, distilled from the hustle and bustle of reality. Yet, though the voices of stories and theorems seem totally different, they share profound connections and similarities.<br>

  Abstract: A consideration of consciousness provides an appropriate end point for understanding the interaction between aesthetic experiment and ideological critique in meta-utopian fiction. In its challenge to exclusivist modes of social imagination and practice there emerges in this art a different mentality characterized by an insistence on balancing public and private modes of discourse, a love of ideological play, and an acknowledgment of the thinking, discerning person. The meta-utopian consciousness is built on a distinction between apparent ideological differences (for example, the looking-glass war between modes of realism) and significant valuative oppositions and choices (for example, between didactic and ludic art,<br>

While the dynamics of abstraction and experience will continue to guide the investigation, the turn from paradigm to person will bring to light distinctive features of the works of Pound and Eliot. The present chapter, devoted to Ezra Pound, begins with the poet’s tendency to think in terms of certain oppositions—form/flux, abstraction/experience, identity/difference, unity/multiplicity—and then to find constructs that hold together the antithetical terms. This attempt to integrate form and flux is typical of Pound’s approach<br>

Its power to convince derived, in part, from its comprehensiveness—that is, from its ability to encompass, digest and absorb the most disparate elements. All agreed that the cycle of understanding consisted of a vicious circle when understanding did not go beyond rhetorical demonstration. For then it became little more than a ventriloquist’s trick, the same person interrogating the text and responding for it. But, when the cycle produced authentic understanding, it was never self-reflective, because it depended on powers, insights, or visions that did not originate in the interrogator,<br>

  Book Title: Neverending Stories-Toward a Critical Narratology<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Tatar Maria<br>
  Abstract: In these compelling new essays, leading critics sharpen our understanding of the narrative structures that convey meaning in fiction, taking as their point of departure the narratological positions of Dorrit Cohn, Grard Genette, and Franz Stanzel. This collection demonstrates how narratology, with its attention to the modalities of presenting consciousness, offers a point of entry for scholars investigating the socio-cultural dimensions of literary representations. Drawing from a wide range of literary texts, the essays explore the borderline between fiction and history; explain how characters are constructed by both author and reader through the narration of consciousness; show how gender shapes narrative strategies ranging from the depiction of consciousness through intertextuality to the representation of the body; address issues of contingency in narrative; and present a debate on the crucial function of person in the literary text. The contributors are Stanley Corngold, Gail Finney, Kte Hamburger, Paul Michael Ltzeler, David Mickelsen, John Neubauer, Thomas Pavel, Jens Rieckmann, Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan, Judith Ryan, Franz Stanzel, Susan Suleiman, Maria Tatar, David Wellbery, and Larry Wolff.<br>

  Book Title: Liturgy as Revelation-Re-Sourcing a Theme in Twentieth-Century Catholic Theology<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Caldwell Philip<br>
  Abstract: A critical issue in modern Catholic theology has been the relationship between the doctrine of revelation and the church’s liturgical and sacramental practice. This volume argues that although in the twentieth century Catholic theology increasingly recognized the centrality of Christology—particularly the person of Christ—as the locus of revelation and drew out the crucial implications of Christ as the revelation of God, it was slow to connect this revelatory dynamic with the encounter that occurs within the sacramental space of the liturgy, most notably the Eucharist. Taking the decline of the neoscholastic enterprise in Catholic theology and the challenges posed by modernism as his point of departure, Philip Caldwell traces the evolution of the Catholic theology of revelation in the twentieth century and the vital role played by the liturgical and sacramental renewal movements in reimagining this pivotal theological category. Examining the specific contributions of René Latourelle, Avery Dulles, Salvatore Marsilli, and Gustave Martelet against a background of pre-conciliar ressourcement theology, this volume provides a comprehensive account of why a Trinitarian and Christological construal of liturgy and sacraments as revelation is key to the vision that informed Vatican II and offers constructive theological and ecclesial possibilities for the future.<br>

  Abstract: The authenticity of psychoanalytic knowledge can be measured by the change in awareness of the person being analysed,¹ just as the verifiability of group analytical findings is measured by the changes in the group with whom the group analyst works. That is why psychoanalytic or group analytic theory formation has to be related to case studies in order not to be speculative. Due to the brevity of this chapter I cannot undertake any full, systematic ethnohermeneutic reconstruction in the way I would prefer; therefore, I will have to confine myself to proposals, to some case studies published,² and to my<br>

  Author(s) Margry Peter Jan<br>
  Abstract: If memory is to be collective and useful, “an altar cannot be in honor of, but is to the memory of a person” (Camon 1978: 84). The memory of major events tends to crystallize, to acquire a fixed frame of interpretations and analysis, suggested by personal feelings and political beliefs. Tragedies, especially when highly shocking, tend to turn into “legendary” narratives, and the more important they are, the harder it becomes to examine them critically. The events of July 2001 in Genoa are already part of a militant legend. The death of Carlo Giuliani during the G8 riots was instantly<br>

  Abstract: To what extent do extreme experiences call for an extreme historiography? What discourse or critical response can do justice to the corporeal and psychological effects, among many others, of immobility in trains? The telling of such effects is as burdensome for the victim as it is for the person reading, listening to, or watching a testimony. Anthropologist Michael Jackson argues that the ethnographic impulse of “co-existence” with suffering is perhaps the most that can be achieved through an ethical engagement with the other.¹ Still, the quest for explanation remains paramount: “But can the intellectual succeed in accomplishing what the sufferer<br>

  Abstract: Elizabeth Cady Stanton’s apparently absolute defense of individual rights in her talk from 1892, “Solitude of Self,” rests on a sober confrontation with mortality. She was seventy-six years old, still vibrant intellectually but facing the increasing physical limitations of old age. The feminist movement she had piloted since the 1840s was shifting away from a broad natural rights defense of women’s equality in all areas of life into a narrower, more respectable campaign for the vote. Without question, she understood the importance of suffrage, for without the vote no person could participate in the great decisions of the day, in<br>

  Abstract: Critical life events such as the loss of a job, the end of a relationship or a divorce or, as discussed in this chapter, the passing of a parent, are often accompanied by depression, melancholy, disorientation and loss of perspective on life. It is the concept of critical life events in particular that is a predictor of psychological anomalies. As a general rule, a critical life event condenses the experience and takes the affected person into a stadium of ‘relative imbalance’ (Filipp, 1981, p 24; Inglehart, 1991), therefore requiring the person to reorganise his or her behaviour and experience making<br>

  Abstract: The ‘signature narrative thesis’ serves particularly well in explaining how personal identity gets constituted through one’s reflective consciousness or understanding, although it leaves open the question of how reflective consciousness itself is constituted (cf. Davenport 2012: 2–3). Is the ‘self’ identical to the narrative form of a person’s understanding, or is there a deeper self than that which emerges on the reflective level? In contrast to this narrative view, according to recent scholarship the phenomenological tradition unanimously affirms that the core self is to be found in pre-reflective consciousness.

  Book Title: The Real and the Sacred-Picturing Jesus in Nineteenth-Century Fiction<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): GATRALL JEFFERSON J. A.<br>
  Abstract: The figure of Jesus appears as a character in dozens of nineteenth-century novels, including works by Balzac, Flaubert, Dickens, Dostoevsky, and others.
         The Real and the Sacredfocuses in particular on two fiction genres: the Jesus redivivus tale and the Jesus novel. In the former, Christ makes surprise visits to earth, from rural Flanders (Balzac) and Muscovy (Turgenev) to the bustling streets of Paris (Flaubert), Seville (Dostoevsky), Berlin, and Boston. In the latter, the historical Jesus wanders through the picturesque towns and plains of first-century Galilee and Judea, attracting followers and enemies. In short, authors subjected Christ, the second person of the Christian trinity, to the realist norms of secular fiction. Thus the Jesus of nineteenth-century fiction was both situated within a specific time and place, whether ancient or modern, and positioned before the gaze of increasingly daring literary portraitists. The highest artistic challenge for authors was to paint, using mere words, a faithful picture of Jesus in all his humanity. The incongruity of a sacred figure inhabiting secular literary forms nevertheless tested the limits of modern realist style no less than the doctrine of Christ's divinity.<br>

  Abstract: Ibn ʿArabī’s sophisticated cosmology, his profound understandings of human nature and the processes of spiritual transformation for men and women alike, and his sometimes radical gendered legal positions were birthed from within the complexities of his experience, both mystical and mundane.

  Abstract: Conceptions of risk raise issues of profound moral significance. Since the notion of risk always involves concern with possible harm (of whatever variety—not all harms are physical) or compromise of a person’s or group’s good, bioethicists tend to think about questions of risk as matters of beneficence. However, we will argue that beneficence does not exhaust the moral significance of risk—that conceptions of risk also raise issues of social justice. In itself, this is a noteworthy deviation from typical understandings of the application of the canonical principles of bioethics. Our analysis thus dovetails with that provided by Eva<br>

  Abstract: Communication media inevitably raise questions about emotion. In Plato’s

Talking with Phaedrus, a young man who brings a written speech to him, Socrates expresses concern for the “frenzied enthusiasm” he believes it is likely to produce in those who read it. Among the faults that Socrates finds with writing is that it “doesn’t know how to address the right people, and not to address the wrong.”¹ Because a written script, unlike a live speech, does not require a person to deliver it, it cannot make<br>

  Book Title: Eating Beauty-The Eucharist and the Spiritual Arts of the Middle Ages<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): ASTELL ANN W.<br>
  Abstract: In a remarkable book that is at once learned, startlingly original, and highly personal, Ann W. Astell explores the ambiguity of the phrase "eating beauty." The phrase evokes the destruction of beauty, the devouring mouth of the grave, the mouth of hell. To eat beauty is to destroy it. Yet in the case of the Eucharist the person of faith who eats the Host is transformed into beauty itself, literally incorporated into Christ. In this sense, Astell explains, the Eucharist was "productive of an entire 'way' of life, a virtuous life-form, an artwork, with Christ himself as the principal artist." The Eucharist established for the people of the Middle Ages distinctive schools of sanctity-Cistercian, Franciscan, Dominican, and Ignatian-whose members were united by the eucharistic sacrament that they received.<br>

It recalls the vicious abuse of food and drink and the concomitant destruction of health and humanity, emblematically represented in the gaping glutton and the drunkard sprawled on the sidewalk. Finally it evokes the devouring mouth of the grave, the sepulcher that swallows every beautiful person and thing (in Latin,

  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): MINOW MARTHA<br>
  Abstract: Minow firmly rejects the prevailing conception of the self that she believes underlies legal doctrine-a self seen as either separate and autonomous, or else disabled and incompetent in some way. In contrast, she regards the self as being realized through connection, capable of shaping an identity only in relationship to other people. She shifts the focus for problem solving from the "different" person to the relationships that construct that difference, and she proposes an analysis that can turn "difference" from a basis of stigma and a rationale for unequal treatment into a point of human connection. "The meanings of many differences can change when people locate and revise their relationships to difference," she asserts. "The student in a wheelchair becomes less different when the building designed without him in mind is altered to permit his access." Her book evaluates contemporary legal theories and reformulates legal rights for women, children, persons with disabilities, and others historically identified as different.<br>

  Abstract: The limitations of rights analysis were not unknown to the reformers who challenged the institutional treatment of mentally retarded people. They worked within a rights framework but also looked to other disciplines to reimagine the legal entitlements of marginalized people. Litigators developed an argument that the label of mental retardation is a stigma that deprives individuals of their liberty; therefore, the right to due process applies before the label can be assigned.¹ To build this argument, the critics of labeling drew on a theory developed by sociologists and shifted the focus from the deviant person to the process by which<br>

  Abstract: When you talk about the media today, one question constantly recurs: Do the new media wipe out the old? Or, more particularly, has television wiped out books? Since no moderately alert person who notices bookstalls or the habits of persons around him could possibly believe that books have disappeared, the asking of the question becomes itself interesting. Something besides the facts is disturbing him. Television and the whole of electronics must be doing something, he feels. What is it that they are doing?<br>

While these notes and reports resemble particular snapshots of a person’s life, often taken from different angles and through various lenses, confirmed and reconfirmed by numerous Securitate sources, they typically resist attempts to assemble them into a coherent plot.

Kafka’s intent, it has been said, is “to make strange the familiar.”² Like his much admired model, Gustave Flaubert, he radically changed the fictional worlds that European realism had mapped out.³ The transformative power of his writing, however, unlike Flaubert’s, arises from the stark, suggestive force of his images: the resulting dynamics of puzzlement and shock reveal<br>

To single out one element as

  Abstract: Symbolic interactionism (e.g., McCall & Simmons 1978; Stryker 1980) provides insights into how humans understand social events. Definitions of situations categorize settings and the people in them, narrowing a person’s attention to a constrained range of phenomena, a restricted set of identities and objects that guide understanding and anticipation of social events. Events are created and interpreted to confirm the situational meanings provided by the definition of the situation. People create events to establish identities, to maintain identities, and to restore damaged identities.

Such a definition of the system and the cosmos to which it is related is a conception of identity.

Abstract: Although his arguments could be tighter, Steffen makes some novel points. He suggests that crime, as an abuse of freedom, is appropriately punished by limitations on freedom—the greater the crime the greater (longer) the appropriate limitation. He also argues that implementation of the death penalty results in a focus on the criminal’s body, rather than on the person. This objectification, he argues, is inconsistent with the sort of respect for the criminal which is necessary for holding him responsible for his crime.<br>

Abstract: These topics may have been secondary in importance to Durantis goal of producing an intellectual history (which he does with great elegance and depth), but their exclusion leaves me wonderingto adapt a phrase from Hymeswhen we are going to break through into dialogue. Hymes (1975) speaks of a breakthrough into performance with regard to the way a speaker switches from talking about a tale to the authentic performance of a tale. For the question at hand, the concern is breaking through into authentic dialogue not so much about the place of linguistic anthropology as about the place of theoretically informed and methodologically rigorous approaches to communicative practice in contemporary anthropology. This means a breakthrough into a different kind of relationship analogous to that achieved by the pronominal breakthroughs in the Russian novels analyzed by Friedrich (
         1966), from whom Hymes draws his inspiration. Like the pronominal shift from second person plural (vous) to second person singular (tu), it means a shift from the formal and distant to the more familiar and engaged.1<br>

Abstract: We have thus followed a strange movement, a sort of coming and going between perceiving subjects and perceived objects, a zoom effect like that of a camera trying to set the right distance with its object in order to achieve a maximum degree of clarity—total transparency. On the one hand, we have seen how the tricky adjustment between the multiplicity of stabilized representations of Hawking and my face‐to‐face interaction with him has fragmented his identity. Like an impressionist painting, distance allows us to see what proximity causes us to lose. The layering of the multiplicity of narratives about Hawking reveals the stable identity of an individual that face‐to‐face contact does not allow. The closer we get to the object‐subject, the further we move from it. We no longer know who or where he is. All the categories we normally use in thinking about a person, a body, a machine, a mind, an interaction, a conversation, a text, and speech are blurred. In his presence, Hawking seems even more difficult to seize than we had imagined. The reason is, first, because, as we have shown, the depth of the social body (the one that talks of the other as much as of itself and allows the accumulation of self‐definitions), normally visible but unnoticed in any interaction, is absent in his case. Second, the internal functioning of the flesh‐and‐blood body, normally invisible, becomes visible and distributed here (the
      Iandlegsare mixed in the same discourse and are detached from the body; they are before him while his voice is next to him, and the flesh‐and‐blood body is collectively taken care of) and omnipresent (it appears at different moments during the interaction). Third, the machine, by the coordination of the actions it allows, disturbs the interaction as much as it creates it. This is where the confusion and fragmentation of identity is pursued by recomposition. Here we follow, step by step, how the machine to which this silent body is attached makes the component~<br>

Abstract: Creating a historical identity for a new generation of Dissenters in eighteenth‐century England had certain limits. Calamy’s
      Continuationof 1727 had been alert to the problems of bridging generational differences within Dissent and rebuilding links between the very different worlds of Restoration and Hanoverian Dissent. Neal’sHistory of the Puritansis alert to a different set of problems having to do with with inclusions and exclusions.The History of the Puritansacknowledges the diversity of Hanoverian Dissent. Nevertheless, Neal also draws some lines demarcating legitimate from illegitimate forms of Dissent. The “we” of legitimate Dissent has theological, political, and social boundaries. Thus some refugees from Germany during the 1540s are described as anabaptists “who, besides the principle of adult baptism, held several wild opinions about the Trinity, the Virgin Mary, and the person of Christ.”50Neal is generally more conciliatory in commenting on the Baptists. Nevertheless, his anxieties about radical sectaries disturbing social order and challenging the intellectual authority of their superiors run through his account of the seventeenth century, with its clear implications for artisan Baptists in Hanoverian England. One of them, the Baptist’s own historian Thomas Crosby, grouched about Neal’s misrepresentations: “many, even of the learned, and so late an author as Mr Neal, from whom we might have looked for more Christian treatment, have made it their business to represent the Anabaptists, as they are pleased in contempt to stile them, in odious colours, and to write many bitter things, even notorious falsehoods concerning them, nay, to fasten doctrines upon them which they never approved.”51<br>

Abstract: Not only does man know that he does not know himself, even if this were only because within his most intimate depths he discovers an unfathomable memory: “Magna vis est memoriae, nescio quid horrendum, Deus meus, profunda et infinita multiplicitas. Et hoc animus est et hoc ego ipse sum. Quid ego sum Deus? Quae natura sum?” (“Great is the power of memory, an awe‐inspiring mystery, my God, a power of profound and infinite multiplicity. And this is mind, this is I myself. What then am I, my God? What is my nature?”).
         31But above all, man understands, within this impasse, that the one who is alone in knowing him remains for him another, namely, God: “Utrum ita sim, nescio. Minus mihi in hac re notus sum ipse quam tu. Obsecro te, Deus meus, et me ipsum mihi indica” (“Whether I am one or the other I do not know. In this matter I know myself less well than I know you. I beseech you, my God, show me myself”).32Under Augustine’s analysis, man’s incomprehensibility to himself thus takes on yet wider and vaster dimensions. To begin with, as in the Greek fathers, the analysis points out not only the image and likeness of God within man’s incomprehensibility but also a unique privilege held by the human being with regard to all other creatures (which only resemble theirgenus, which is to say, themselves). Next, this incomprehensibility tells man that he goes beyond and exceeds himself, in short that “l’homme passe infiniment l’homme” (“man transcends man”), following the formulation of an exemplary Augustinian: in a word, man passes beyond his own means, man lives above his means.33Finally and above all, according to a strict consequence, only the infinite and incomprehensible can comprehend man, and thus tell him of and show him to himself; only God can reveal man to man, because man only reveals himself by revealing, without knowing it, the one whose image he bears. Not only is it true that “Je est un autre” (I is another), but this other calls himself God within man,~<br>

Abstract: Second, readers of Braudel’s
         Mediterranean,no matter how much of the book they actually have read, continue to be struck by the energy, engagement, and dedication of a fervent lover and committed convert. “I have passionately loved the Mediterranean, no doubt because I am a northerner like so many others in whose footsteps I have followed.”74This famous opening sentence in the preface to the first edition, dated May 1946, one year after VE Day and Braudel’s release from a German prisoner‐of‐war camp, resonates in Braudel’s remarks during a 1981 interview thirty‐five years later on his initial excitement at seeing the Mediterranean for the first time in October 1923 at the age of twenty‐one:
               North Africa freed Braudel, like so many earlier enchanted and enthralled romantic travelers, from his provincial complaisance. One can almost hear him chanting Goethe’s 1787 credo on finding one’s true self in the liberating southern sun: “I hardly recognize myself. I feel like a completely different person. Yesterday I thought: ‘Either you used to be mad, or you are now.’”It was for me such a surprise! I did not know the sea, I saw the Mediterranean, avowing that it is a present of the gods! Imagine someone like me who went down the Rhone Valley for the first time, who stopped at Marseille, who embarked on a boat and learned with pleasure that he had sea legs—it was just like that—and abruptly saw the arrival of Algiers on the horizon.… Algiers was the most beautiful city in France, after Paris, and a city itself very different, with, I would say, the beauty of its streets, the extraordinary beauty of its women.… It was hot, there was wine, fish, everything that one wants. For me, I began to live.

Abstract: By extending these ideas on reading to a hermeneutics of self‐understanding, Ricoeur is able to argue that identity is a temporal structure that rests on narrative, as well as a project that is ongoing for individuals during their lifetime. Reading is central to this project because it is only in reading that the dynamism of configuration completes its course; in other words, the passage from prefiguration via configuration to refiguration results in transfiguration of worlds. In this relationship of worlds, it is the person as reader who takes this journey [
         21]. His thesis is that “the process of composition, of configuration, does not realize itself in the text but in the reader, and under this condition configuration makes possible refiguration of a life by way of the narrative” [44, p. 430]. As part of this, a person can be called upon to make an account of herself, and such an account, Ricoeur argues, involves a positing of a beginning, a middle with its highs and lows, and an ending [14]. Through composition, or configuration, this account is dynamic; we can weave different plots about our lives. Ricoeur reminds us that “just as it is possible to compose several plots on the subject of the same incidents … so it is always possible to weave different, even opposed, plots about our lives” [30, p. 248]. But, simultaneously, a life can have the quality of being singular and complete. In terms of a hermeneutics of self‐understanding, Ricoeur best captures this when he argues that “to understand oneself is to understand oneself as one confronts the text and to receive from it the conditions for a self other than that which first undertakes the reading. Neither of the two subjectivities, neither that of the author nor that of the reader, is thus primary in the sense of an originary presence of the self to itself” [44, p. 17].

Abstract: After this initial citing of the relationship between race and sexuality, race does not disappear from Rubin’s essay but rather appears through a proliferation of analogies. It is this nature of racial incorporation that needs close scrutiny because it demonstrates not simply an omission but a problematic technique of appropriation via inclusion. Here are a few instances of Rubin’s incorporation of race:
         
               
            It is impossible to think with any clarity about the politics of race or gender as long as these are thought of as biological entities rather than as social constructs. … One may then think of sexual politics in terms of such phenomena as populations, neighborhoods, settlement patterns, migration, urban conflict, epidemiology, and police technology. (Rubin
            1984, 277)
               
            This kind of sexual morality [revulsion at homosexuality] has more in common with ideologies of racism than with true ethics. It grants virtue to the dominant groups, and relegates vice to the underprivileged. (
            1984, 283)
               
            This system of sex law [criminalization of sodomy] is similar to legalized racism. (
            1984, 291)
               
            The use of S/M [sadomasochistic] images in the movie
            Not a Love Storywas on a moral par with the use of depictions of black men raping white women, or of drooling old Jews pawing young Aryan girls, to incite racist or anti‐Semitic frenzy. (1984, 298)
               As the above examples make amply clear, although the vector of racial difference is clearly present in the essay, racial analogies help mainly to clarify the nature of sexual oppression and sexual intolerance. Let us focus for a moment on the particular manner in which race and sex/gender are linked: “race or gender,” “in common with,” “similar to,” “on a moral par with,” and “similar miracles.” First, in each case there is an assumption of a problematic similari~<br>

Abstract: In his first panegyric on the shroud, Tesauro stresses that only a “sublime person” is able to write a “sublime commentary” of his own biography, as Julius Caesar did in
      The Gallic War. Tesauro contends that the body inscribed on the shroud is foreshadowed in a passage from the book of Ezekiel, when God sends six men to slaughter the idolaters living in Jerusalem. Among these six mysterious executioners was a man “dressed in linen, with a scribe’s ink‐horn in his belt” (Ezek. 9:2).36God orders this man clothed in linen to place the mark “Tau” on the foreheads of those who mourn over the abominations committed in Jerusalem (Ezek. 9:4).37Later, after the killing, the same man dressed in linen scattered burning coals over the city (Ezek. 10:2).<br>

Abstract: By contrast with both Ricoeur and Kermode, Frei emphasizes narrative in order to foreground a way of reading that centers on the person of Jesus as the one who unifies the disparate genres and texts of scripture. This involves shifting the focus from the
         whatof Jesus’s life to thewho—or better, only understanding what Jesus does in light of who he is. As is clear in many of Frei’s writings, but particularly inThe Identity of Jesus Christ, the danger in focusing on the “what”—the meaning of the text, or the quality that we attribute to Jesus’s presence—is that our appropriation of this quality (e.g., the wandering stranger, or the human being fully open to God‐consciousness) effaces the textual ascription of this quality to Jesus himself. It is by ascribing the qualities to Jesus, in the act of figural reading, that one turns away from the interpreting subject. As the qualities become markers of Christ’s identity, they no longer serve as general concepts representative of human nature. It is less, I think, that the subject is dispossessed (though this may happen), than that the subject becomes possessed by Jesus.<br>

Abstract: Meanwhile, as one of us listened to these assaults on Conrad and Cather, the other chose to visit the session on “Feminist Perspectives on the Frankfurt School,” which drew a standing‐room‐only crowd and turned out to offer a little of everything—except, of course, literature. No sooner had we seated ourselves and unpacked the trusty tape recorder than we heard the familiar whine of the dentist’s drill—no, sorry, our mistake: it was only the sound of the first speaker, who had come to “clarify the function of femininity in Frankfurt School thought, with an emphasis on re‐reading the work of Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer in the context of gender.” Ah, yes, we knew it well: the “critique of patriarchy and logocentricsm,” old friends such as the feminist icons Luce Irigaray and Julia Kristeva, not to mention Judith Butler, the young philosopher of queer theory who our rough tabulation identified as the second most frequently referred to person at the convention. The most frequently cited figure was undoubtedly Walter Benjamin, the hapless Marxist critic and protege of Adorno who committed suicide while fleeing from the Nazis in 1940.<br>

Abstract: Stanley Fish (
            1996) has written about the philosophical dimensions of this conflict, implying that there is no common ground that could form the basis for either agreement or even shared discussion about that disagreement. “To put the matter baldly,” he writes, “a person of religious conviction should not want to enter the marketplace of ideas but to shut it down, at least insofar as it presumes to determine matters that he believes have been determined by God and faith. The religious person should not seek an accommodation with liberalism,” he continues, “he should seek to rout it from the field, to extirpate it, root and branch” (21).<br>

Abstract: The second reason why the concept of perspective exchange occurs so infrequently in the jargon of theology of interreligious dialogue is this: cognitive scientific research has indicated that dispositions, like the disposition for perspective exchange, which is a natural function of the brain, can be blocked out by the influence of the person’s culture.
            46This is more likely if that culture is characterized by a constant marking of boundaries between “us” and “them,” when it focuses on exclusion rather than inclusion and exhibits hegemonic tendencies, as pointed out by the cognitive scholar J.‐P. Changeux.47In my opinion it is important to inquire frankly and critically to what extent Christianity manifests these characteristics, not only in terms of what is currently regarded as exclusivism and inclusivism but since its early beginnings. At all events, this question has opened my eyes to both the religious and moral particularism in biblical books such as the law codes in the Pentateuch, Isaiah, and Psalms and revealed to what extent there is some kind of breakthrough in Paul’s letter to the Romans and the earliest texts in the synoptic Gospels on the acts of Jesus.48Meanwhile, Sunday after Sunday, all these books are read and contemplated, and for centuries they have directed religious socialization and profoundly influenced the experience, thoughts, and actions of innumerable Christian groups.49In other words, Christianity, or rather Christians, like all people, are naturally capable of perspective exchange but may be hindered from doing so by unconscious and conscious forms of religious and moral ethnocentrism that have crept into the origins, history, and culture of their tradition—at least, that is my hypothesis in this article.<br>

Abstract: This human experience [embalming] has been passed on from remote antiquity. The unique Egyptian art erected the famous Egyptian pyramids. … These monuments were erected in order to aggrandize the pharaoh and his relatives, to emphasize his divine nature, and to perpetuate his power. … This amazing cult existed more than 5,000 years ago. In an unprecedented way, it was revived in the new twentieth century. The idea is not so much the significance or genius of a given person but the revival of a monument dedicated to a cult, which is supposed to impart immortality. In such a way, the pharaohs' ghosts emerge through the millennial dusk and enter the mausoleums of Lenin, Ho Chi Minh, Augustino Neto, and Mao. … Today we don't know who begot the idea to embalm Lenin's body, to erect a mausoleum, to make a sarcophagus for the tiny body, so that millions of people would believe in his immortality. Whoever these initiators, it is an indubitable fact that they were atheists, partaking in the construction of a symbol that would remind one of immortality, greatness, everlasting power.

Abstract: The Ricoeurian hermeneutical circle requires further modification, however, if it is to answer to the full challenge of childism. This modification reflects my own and others’ sympathetic revisions of Ricoeurian hermeneutics in a more postmodern direction. Childhood raises to an especially sharp degree the problem of what Emmanuel Levinas, Jacques Derrida, John Caputo, Sallie McFague, and Richard Kearney have called the interpretation of “otherness” or “difference.” In my view it is possible, indeed necessary, to recognize otherness without (as some have claimed) abandoning the notion of a hermeneutical circle. “Otherness” does not mean “othering”: the marginalization of those who are different. Rather, it refers to the sense in which each singular human being is ultimately irreducible to any understanding, narration, or construction of them whatsoever. Levinas claims that no other is fully reducible to anything “said” about them but is always also its own transcending or infinite “saying” beyond language and meaning (indeed, as a “face” of the Wholly Other).
         34Or as others have argued, a little differently, each “other” person continually escapes interpretation as a linguistic object by virtue of their utter and mysteriousdifférance(their difference as endlessly deferred).<br>

Abstract: We can find some initial resources from phenomenological hermeneutics in the work of Paul Ricoeur, one of the leading hermeneutical ethicists of the twentieth century, and in particular in his “poetics of the will.” Adapting the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl, Ricoeur argues that ethical willing and action rest ultimately upon a human capability for “ethical intentionality.” Moral practice first springs from neither subjective feelings nor objective laws or values but from humanity’s dynamic and innovative “desire to be” as an active participant in and shaper of its world. This ethical intentionality or being‐in‐the‐world has religious dimensions in that it may be affirmed, more primordially than historical corruption, as humanity’s “absolutely primitive … joyous affirmation of being‐able‐to‐be [
         pouvoir‐être].”25Ethical intentionality is a human capability that is never completed in this world itself. It consists, rather, in each person’s inborn ability to create or interpret received historical environments into his or her own ever more coherent and profound meaning.<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur nonetheless sets out an original critique of philosophical writings, one that is restless and that prospers in many unexpected fields. If successful, this critique promises fresh insights on the ordinary uses of the word. On its first definition, “recognition” as “identifying an object or a person” would be understood to also carry a tension with the way “things themselves” appear. In its second sense, appearing in chapter 2, the “recognition of one’s own identity” would include the individual and collective capabilities that precondition the understanding of one’s self‐identity. And, finally, the third meaning of “recognition as mutual recognition,” treated in chapter 3, would include an understanding of the particular subtleties of asymmetry.<br>

Author(s): Budd John M.<br>
Abstract: The foregoing is certainly not an exhaustive list of the elements of a practical and normative ethics for librarianship. No one person can pretend to suggest an all‐inclusive set of elements. The question to be faced is, How do we, as public professionals, address the need for a more comprehensive consideration of ethics? The answer to this question grows out of the rights‐based premises upon which this article is based. As a public profession, librarianship is committed to a democratic form of public polity. An essential part of the democratic way of being is deliberation, especially public deliberation. Among the many ways we can define democracy is by aggregative or deliberative means. An aggregative position assumes that collective preferences are given; that is, the preferences are taken to be legitimated so that no further justification is required. Invocation of the LBR or ALA’s Code of Ethics as immutable dogmas of the profession may be indicative of an aggregative definition of democracy. The principal shortcoming of this stance is that challenge of taken‐for‐granted preferences is very difficult and meets with tenacious resistance. An alternative—deliberative democracy—admits to pluralism of preferences and of participants. Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson maintain that “deliberation is generally the best way to arrive at just decision, or, more accurately, the least unsatisfactory” way [

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 509555<br>

Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: Both literally and figuratively speaking, Smith’s narrative presents a dramatic departure from the traditional Adamic myth whose “intention is to set up a
         radicalorigin of evil distinct from the moreprimordialorigin of goodness of things.”72Mormonism’s evil is as uncreated and preexistent as is good. Both are always potential to the act, as choice, of the uncreated person. As the attendees to the counsel and, later, earth’s inhabitants, humans must choose between the two plans and their personal fate is decided by their choice. Implicit in this personal struggle is the notion that the power is in these persons not only to discern but also to vanquish evil. This, too, is a central dynamic in Smith’s challenge to traditional Christianity’s theological anthropology. In Smith’s completely original Genesis 1, Moses's experience of the divine at the burning bush is followed by an assertion of his newly realized identity against Satan, who comes demanding to be worshipped: “Who art thou? For behold, I am a son of God, in the similitude of his Only Begotten; and where is thy glory, that I should worship thee?” Moses then summarily dismisses him with the command “Get thee hence, Satan; deceive me not.” Subject to Moses's superior power, Satan must comply.73Thus, the agency and power of persons to effect their will, first manifested in the narrative of a heavenly council, characterizes earthly life as well.<br>

Abstract: Shastri,
            BSūBh, 360, lines 6–8 (II.1.6): “yat tu uktaṃ pariniṣpannatvād brahmaṇi pramāṇāntarāṇi saṃbhaveyur iti tadapi manorathamātram. rūpādyabhāvāddhi nāyamarthaḥ pratyakṣasya gocaraḥ. liṅgādyabhāvācca nānumānādīnām” (The above‐mentioned claim—namely, that brahman must be accessible to thepramāṇassince it is an actually existing reality—is nothing more than an illusion. For this object does not lie within the range of perception since it does not have form. Nor does it lie in the range of the various forms of inference since it is devoid of distinguishing marks). See also ibid., 63, line 4 (I.1.4): “na ca pariniṣṭhitavastusvarūpatve ʿpi pratyakṣādiviṣayatvaṃ brahmaṇaḥ” (Though it is brahman’s nature to be a thoroughly known reality, still, brahman is not an object of the worldlypramāṇas). More ambiguous, perhaps, is the question of theātman’s accessibility to the worldlypramāṇas. Tilmann Vetter’s suggestion, inStudien zur Lehre und Entwicklung Śaṅkaras([Vienna, 1979], 118), of a division of labor between “reason” and revelation corresponding toātmanand brahman, respectively, “Śāstra (Schriftzitate und das mit ihnen begründete theologische System) macht das Absolute zugänglich, Yukti (rationale Überlegung) den Kern der Person” (Śāstra [scriptural citations and the theological system based on them] makes the Absolute accessible; Yukti [rational reflection] makes the core of the person accessible), suggests a greater willingness on Śaṅkara’s part to concede the empirical knowability of theātman. Yet Śaṅkara does not seem to have much confidence in (independent) reason’s ability to know the self, either. This is suggested, above all, by his criticism of the Mīmāṃsā tenet regarding the accessibility of the self to perception and inference (Halbfass,Tradition and Reflection, 148); for a discussion and critique of Vetter’s view, see 142, 177–80.<br>

Abstract: Drawing in particular on the analogy between the demigod carrying the world on his shoulders and the storyteller holding up her fictional world, Winterson’s self‐mythologizing as Atlas—her retelling of the mythical adventures of the Titan in the first person—extends the relevance of
         Weightbeyond authorial metafiction. The storyteller, indeed, is not just the writer of fictions; she is also the teller of the story of her own life, and in this sense, rewriting retains its existential drive to project human existence narratively. Winterson’s narrative rests upon the simile of the book of nature. “The strata of sedimentary rock are like the pages of a book, each with a record of contemporary life written on it,” she writes, using black and red lettering and varying letter size to highlight the materiality and mediality of writing (Winterson2005, ix; cf. Hayles2002). Proceeding to retell the beginning of the world—“In the beginning there was nothing” (Winterson2005, 3), we read in a reformulation of Genesis 1:1–2, which might be Winterson’s or Atlas’s—the narrator, rejecting the notion that all “the rest is history” (5), explains: “All the stories are here, silt‐packed and fossil‐stored. The book of the world opens anywhere, chronology is one method only and not the best” (6).<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession.

Abstract: This is to be the last chance, then, for her stolen and now resold life, its last chance for release from all this manacled, mangling silence. Time is a sickly blur until the novel numbers begin appearing. Even Ephraim is interested after his sluggish fashion and brings the first installment up to her after showing it round the pub in one of his stupid boasts. But wait. Little who? What did any of this have to do with her? Marseilles? That prison isn't
         herprison. Not that next one, either. As the numbers drag on, it comes to her ever so slowly. Comes to her that there, burning through all these aliases and inventions and irrelevant digressions, there is her own story blazing out at her after all as if through a chipped prism, facet by facet, time and again. Never by name, or even in person, nonetheless she sees her own poor self everywhere. From early on, she is the secret fact behind every deprivation of the hero's life, every jaded feeling with which he turns from the world.She is what is missing in him.Surely, then, she is what the novel will have to make up for, bring forward in the end. She hears echoes of her story in the words themselves, the sly chime of letters, the names for feelings that were hers to begin with. She hears echoes of her fear in Jeremiah's wife, that servant woman Affery, afraid of everything. She should be. She hears echoes of her nemesis in ClenNAM, MRS. And of the wordson,her son, buried there in everyprison.It makes her dizzy, this spin of letters, just like when she writes, the words thickening as she sounds them out.<br>

Author(s): Balsamo Gian<br>
Abstract: In both Augustine’s and Marcel’s experience, it turns out that the loss of a dear person may entail a loss of self, a sense of personal diminution—the subtraction of a crucial element in one’s purposeful self‐instantiation in the world. In the context of a different discussion, Ricoeur remarks aptly that the death of a loved one “constitutes a genuine amputation of oneself to the extent that the relation with the one who has disappeared forms an integral part of one’s identity.” We saw that Augustine copes with such a loss of identity by way of a detour into the desire of divine love and seeks his own better self through a self‐abnegating identification with this divine love. Marcel reacts instead to such a loss of identity by way of a detour into the materiality of his own mortality and seeks his own better self through a self‐denying identification with the love that the dear one’s death has left imprinted in his organism. In both cases, death’s “radical heterogeneity in relation to … desire” is exorcised by desire itself. The relevant difference between Augustine’s and Marcel’s respective forms of mourning is that the former reflects the metaphysical transcendence intrinsic to a more ancient notion of soul, while the latter’s reflects the soft transcendence of an embodied notion of soul that, however organismic in nature, bridges the gap separating merely genetic and epigenetic responses to mourning from the autonomy of one’s self‐instantiation.

Article Title: Just War, Civic Virtue, and Democratic Social Criticism: Augustinian Reflections<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 592372<br>

Author(s): Miller Richard B.<br>
Abstract: Augustine’s apology for Christianity and the idea of just war suggests a point that he and his interlocutors presumed as obvious, namely, that there is an ethics of memory—a duty to remember justly for the sake of history, self‐understanding, and narrative recollection. He thus invites us to consider the obligations and virtues of what Ricoeur calls a “just memory.”
         82Augustine’s ethics is, as I noted above, “agent‐referring”: it attends to the moral effects of an action on the character of the person carrying out that action. He developed his agent‐referring concerns, moreover, not by looking at the morality of individuals as isolated monads but as situated and affected by cultural forces that help shape character over time. The temporal quality of character and culture led him naturally to consider the virtues that surround memory, both individual and collective.83Given the intimate connection between memory and identity, there is an obvious obligation to remember for Augustine, a responsibility to remember truthfully. He thus worried about whether what people remember about themselves is prone to self‐aggrandizement and, with that, self‐deception. For these reasons, we can say that an Augustinian ethics of war is, among other things, an ethics of memory. That Rome’s morality “proceeded to bloody strife of all parties and then to the social and civil wars” is not his own personal judgment; it is, in his words, “the witness of history.”84<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 603531<br>
Date: 10 2009<br>
Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: Indeed, the Dane’s reflections on prayer are not dissimilar to Coleridge’s. In Kierkegaard’s
         Upbuilding Discourses(1843–44), he describes an aporia: “If a person yields completely in prayer, he does not struggle, but if he does not yield himself at all, then he is not praying.”44This knot of activity and yielding echoes Coleridge’s comments in N5554, as well as what the English writer called, in 1826, the “twofold Ground of Prayer”: “Perfect resignation to the Divine Will” set against “impassioned obstinacy and petitionary vehemence” (N5411, fol. 44v). As in Coleridge’s account, Kierkegaard’s theory cuts this aporia by making the self against itself the very core of prayer. In the analysis made inUpbuilding Discourses, one’s struggles and petitions reach a concentrated point, which leads to renunciation. In the moment that one abandons the petitionary desire that had impelled the praying “I,” one suddenly realizes one’s prayers have been answered: “Only when he himself becomes nothing, only then can God illuminate him so that he resembles God.”45<br>

Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: This brief glimpse into Enlightenment-era controversies over mysticism and materialism both corroborates and problematizes the revised narratives of secularization found in the studies reviewed in this essay. For defenders of self-ownership, the human person—like the nation or society—was thought to derive its autonomy from a remote and transcendent God demanding that created beings exercise their faculties on their own, for their own purposes. However, historians have often neglected the violent reactions to this development. Radical spiritualists and radical philosophers railed against what they regarded as illegitimate claims for self-ownership by calling for a revival of immanent dispossession. This challenge implied a dramatic reversal of transcendence in a resacralized world: the self must evacuate its position in favor of a totalizing force, thereby neutralizing its personal autonomy and allowing the divine (or what remained of it in nature) to inhabit the place that the individual human person claimed to occupy.<br>

Abstract: Attributed to the earliest days of Islam, the apparent tradition here is to recite verses of the Quran, and then to spit or blow onto whatever is to be blessed by those verses.12. The expectoration (from the soul, into a siphon; and the clothes, the knife, your personal belongings, your ID, your passport and all of your papers).
               74The practice of blowing inspiration from the Quranic verses into clothing, knife, passport, and papers would seem to saturate the possessions of the ritual actor with sanctity, as if to shower the actor himself with a sacred vapor and drive divine grace into his person. In old school anthropology, this might have been called “contagious magic,”75but within the schemes of Tambiah, Fernandez, and Ricoeur, it is probably better understood as a thickening of the metaphorical domain the ritual actor enters by contact with the verses. The thickening of the metaphorical domain helps to transform him into a pious persona on a holy mission. Spitting Quranic verses onto tokens might also be seen as another form of supplicating/praying.<br>

Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: The truth can be recovered through rubbing and digging, Lévinas suggests, in images that recall Heidegger's own metaphors of destruction. The consequence of this mode of reading is that it reduces polyvalence to a vehicle, making of the text's opacity a nut to be cracked, an occasion for clarification. In “Judaism and Revolution” for example, a Mishnaic passage discussing whether fair practices of payment should be derived from a general principle or from the custom of the land “reveals that the other man's right is practically an infinite right.”
         20In another reading, Tractate Shabbat 88, a midrash on Exodus 19:17, appears to be a commendation of the Israelites for their absolute obedience to God's commandments. Lévinas rereads it to reveal a Lévinasean lesson: “The Torah,” he writes, “is given in the Light of a face. The epiphany of an other person is ipso facto my responsibility toward him: seeing the other is already an obligation toward him.”21<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 659348<br>
Date: 4 2011<br>
Author(s): Landy Joshua<br>
Abstract: Neither—to return to the earlier objection—has Kaufman quite yielded to the narrativity brigades by agreeing to tell that time-honored story, “Charlie becomes a writer.”
         36To be sure, the fictional character Charlie “grows” and “adapts” and “learns” and “overcomes obstacles to succeed in the end.” But above and behind Charlie, we sense the existence of an entity who doesnotgrow and adapt and learn, an entity who may well feel, with Susan, that “for a person, adapting is almost shameful; it's like running away,” an entity who has been more or less the same since the days ofBeing John Malkovitch. Here is where the distinction between Charlie and Kaufman, which might seem like a technical issue, actually becomes of prime importance (figs. 5–6). In the movie, one might say, Charlie becomes Donald. But, in real life, there is no Donald; in real life, there is only Kaufman, someone who is, we assume, an amalgam of Charlie and Donald, at once, enduringly, with an inexorable combat being unchangingly waged in his head, that marvellous, mysterious head into which Valerie Thomas, in the opening scene, expresses a desire to climb. From this point of view, the film is a spurious diachrony concealing a genuine synchrony; only superficially the story of how Charlie became Donald,Adaptationis, at a deeper level, the entirely nonnarrative portrait of a never-changing Kaufman.37<br>

Abstract: Whereas someone like Tamburlaine, for example, almost exclusively uses the third person in the self-aggrandizing style of Julius Caesar, Faustus, although he shares some of Tamburlaine's mighty bombast, uses the third person even, or even especially, in his most wretched moments: “Ah Christ my savior, seek to save / Distressed Faustus' soul” (2.3.82–83).<br>

Author(s): Bowman Sharon<br>
Abstract: However, Larmore usually uses “commitment” in a much broader sense that allegedly applies to all mental states. Beliefs are not images or ideas felt with a certain vivacity, or acts of accepting propositions, but are instead dispositions with practical implications: behavior that expresses the belief “has to be such that the belief would have provided the individual
      a reasonto act this way” (77–78). Similarly, following Scanlon, Larmore holds that “every desire represents its object as something there is a reason to pursue” (78), even if it is easily outweighed. This claim is more troublesome because we experience some appetites without thinking that there is anything that would count in favor of the desire’s object before our attraction toward it. Their psychologicaldynamiscan also persist even when we believe that the apparent reason to which such desires respond is illusory, as the case of Swann’s love shows (182). These brute preferences or inclinations give us at best disjunctive reasons to satisfy them or to eliminate them (Mark Murphy,Natural Law and Practical Rationality[Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001], 75)—and this weak reason to satisfy them can thus be rejected outright rather than merely outweighed. That is exactly what distinguishes desires and emotions that involve strong evaluations: these motives respond to reasons that appear normative independently of being desired. Even if desires are bound up with beliefs given the wholism of the mental (92, 102), it does not follow that in every desire the “person obligates himself to behave, all else being equal,” in ways that accord with “the value accorded to the object of desire” (80)—as if a person who had no other desires but this one would rationallyhaveto act according to it.<br>

Abstract: With this understanding of human rights, Regan shows how secular human rights and Christian theology engage in common themes, interests, and areas of concern, arguing that both have in the recent past and could continue in the future to benefit from a reciprocity of critique. In this descriptive mode, Regan discusses the emergence and development of liberation theology but also highlights intellectual engagement with human rights discourse of the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church from the end of WWII to the post–Second Vatican Council era. While reverent toward the deepening and thickening of the church’s vision of the human person, Regan also challenges the institutional church to reflect on apparent moments of dissonance between its theory of human personalism and praxis.<br>

Author(s): Csordas Thomas<br>
Abstract: My point here is that one needs to connect political economy and moral economy. The idea (ascribed to Fassin) that one can distinguish a separate domain of culture that is called “morality” is unhelpful. The notion of moral conflict (ascribed to Robbins and Zigon), which contrasts moral stability with moral change and upheaval, seems to me equally unhelpful. In the societies that I know, moral ambivalence and ambiguity, as well as the constant appraisal of new situations, is always present. It is hard to discern a situation of moral stability that is suddenly disrupted. In fact, it seems to be in the nature of morality that it is unstable and constantly invites questioning and debate. In China (and even in the anthropology of China) there is some debate of the decline of morality with the rise of capitalism today. This is a moral discourse that should not be taken for granted but understood in relation to conflicting arguments about what it means to be a good person in China today. It should definitely not be understood as a sudden moral change in relation to a period of moral stability in Maoist China. It would probably be fruitful to analyze such discourses of moral panic to shifting relations in the family and to Chinese understandings of power and money. This, obviously, requires ethnography of social inequality and of relative access to what is locally understood as “the good life.” No doubt, suffering is part of life, but, again, it cannot be understood in generalized, universal terms (as in Weber and Geertz). It has to be understood through the analysis of cultural debate in situated social life.<br>

Abstract: Even the king is too constrained by the monarchial model, inasmuch as his royal office subsumes his self in such a way as to inure him to the “elevation” of
      autruiand impedes him from responding as a flesh-and-blood individual to the other before him. The king is not an “I” but a “we,” and the metaphysical plurality of his person inhibits him from assuming the ethical stance of the one-for-the-other. This difficulty is evident in the very first scene, as Lear slips in and out of the third person, recurrently using the royal “we” to make personal demands.
            His erratic usage is indicative of his inability to separate his self from his scepter, an inability that confuses his conversation and complicates his approach to the other. To truly address himself to the other, a king would have to extract himself from his office: he would have to speak in the first person. Henry V attempts something of the sort on the eve of the battle at Agincourt, but he butts up against political impossibility. To enter into relation, a king must do more than borrow a cloak. He must truly depose himself before the other, which would seem to leave us—at least in the case of53
         Lear—without a prince and without a polity.<br>

Author(s): Hequembourg Stephen<br>
Abstract: But whether he is right or wrong, Adam with these words frames the debate for both parties and for nearly all of the critical literature on Eve’s dream. At the center of that debate is this question of what exactly happened, the night before, in Eve’s mind. But in searching for the key to her spiritual condition in the dream space, we miss the profound importance of the fact that Eve does not and perhaps cannot yet articulate sin in her own person. It may be that her yet sinless vocal chords simply cannot form the words: “And I did eat.” As William Riggs writes, “Evil thoughts, in Adam’s famous assessment, ‘into the mind of God or Man / May come and go, so unapprov’d, and leave / No spot or blame behind’ (V 117–19), but thoughts articulated—so Eve’s experience of her own words argues—constitute a significant gesture toward choice.”
      
               If Riggs is right then Eve’s famous ellipsis, far from inviting speculation, should end it altogether. What is often read as a clever evasion of guilt or at least a questionable coyness may in fact be the surest sign of abiding innocence. We need not speculate on what did or did not happen in Eve’s dreaming mind. The fact that she refuses to pronounce the incriminating words may be—to borrow another famous verse that may or may not belong in quotation marks—all we know and all we need to know.29<br>

Article Title: From Religionless Christianity to Immanent Grace: Bonhoeffer’s Legacy in Badiou<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 677726<br>
Date: 10 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Urbaniak Jakub<br>
Abstract: What follows is his dismissal of the significance for Paul of the historical life and death of Jesus. According to Badiou, Paul is “indifferent to the particularities of the living person,” he betrays no interest in the details of Jesus’s life and ministry, and ultimately “
            dissolves incarnation in resurrection.”
                  If this is the case, then Jesus, who is neither a master nor an example, matters only to the extent to which he is the name for what happens to us universally.146
               
                  Badiou also argues for a dedialecticized Christ event, which separates out the cross and death as merely the “site” for the event, and resurrection as the event itself.147
               
                  This causes his reading of the Pauline letters to be resolutely criticized by several authors.148
               
                  For instance, Chester points out that seeing in the cross merely the “site of the event” remains inconsistent with regard to Badiou’s own conviction that the truth-event always arises from what is excluded, since Paul’s logic of exclusion is inextricably tied to God’s actions, most fundamentally the self-giving of Jesus in the crucifixion.149
               
                  It also seems that Badiou fails to appreciate Paul’s emphasis on true solidarity with the outcasts as the prime mode of messianic existence; for any embrace of the cross as a model of Christian presence in the world in Badiou’s mind is collapsed into a masochistic embrace of suffering in the sense given to it by Nietzsche.150
               
                  Besides, as Welborn argues, “Badiou’s attempt to disjoin death from resurrection leads him to place the Pauline concept of the Christ in dangerous proximity to the Nietzschean idea of the Overman as a figure of pure self-affirmation.”151

Abstract: Peperzak is concerned with the relation between philosophy and faith, more than any other topic, however. Following his phenomenology of philosophical conversation, he claims, “The encounter with God is somewhat comparable to a face-to-face relationship that stretches me when I look up to a human person who loves me. Since God is infinite, however, faith and love toward God encompass the universe of all that exists. … Faith thus mobilizes and orients the entirety of one’s existence from top to bottom” (120–21). Peperzak regards faith as a fundamental Desire that orients us in an encounter with the absolute. As such, there is no clean separation of faith and philosophy. All thinking emerges from some sort of faith, and while philosophy has a universality that can engender conversation across differences of faith orientation, its autonomy is a relative and limited one. Moreover, Peperzak associates the infinity of God encountered as Other with the Platonic Good that illuminates all thinking and being, while itself escaping thematization: “the
      phila(love) ofphilosophiareaches out toward a wisdom (sophia) that implies … a sense of the difference between this cosmos and the ultimately desired but ungiven Good. … By longing, Eros reaches further than any theory” (159).<br>

Author(s): Popkin Jeremy D.<br>
Abstract: The value of Popkin's approach becomes clear in his chapter on two historians whose autobiographies have been included in the literary canon for many years: Edward Gibbon and Henry Adams. By reading them as historians, Popkin offers new insights to an already great body of literature on these authors, for instance by showing that both Gibbon and Adams believed that their personal experiences helped them in understanding the past. Not all 327 autobiographers listed in the bibliography are discussed in depth, and in chapters on vocation and career their works serve to sketch an impression of the historical profession in the twentieth century. Bookish children from middle‐class backgrounds, as most historians have been, often picked up their vocation from parents or teachers. They were also often inspired by children's books like those by Jules Verne and Karl May, which is interesting, because despite these literary models they chose to write nonfiction. For Popkin this is a telling detail, as he concludes that historians are obviously motivated by a wish to tell stories. With few exceptions historians are reluctant to write about their careers. Most are silent about their academic successes, failures, and frustrations, and few pages are spent on the daily life of teaching courses and doing administrative work. On the contrary, most authors want to show that they had another life besides their profession. Therefore they often describe their own lives against the background of great events. Since Jean‐Jacques Rousseau's
      Confessions, autobiography has been seen as a genre that should focus on the innermost experience and not world events, but many historians simply could not cast off their professional background. Often only those historians who were involved in politics became aware of how little an individual could accomplish, or lost faith in the ideas they once had believed. Holocaust memoirs are discussed in a separate chapter, in which Popkin concludes that t~<br>

Abstract: Conventional views of text/music relationships in early Italian opera focus on the imitation of affections. But by dealing exclusively with the referential meanings of texts (e.g., emotions, images, and concepts) these views overlook an important aspect of music's interaction with language. In opera, music also imitates language's contextual and communicative functions—i.e., discourse, as studied today by the subfield of linguistics called pragmatics. In his operas Monteverdi fully realized Peri's ideal of “imitating in song a person speaking” (“imitar col canto chi parla”) by musically emphasizing those context-dependent meanings that emerge especially in ordinary language and that are prominent in dramatic texts, as opposed to poetry and prose. Such meanings are manifest whenever words such as “I,” “here,” and “now” appear— words called “deictics”—with the function of situating the speaker/singer's utterances in a specific time and place. Monteverdi highlights deictics through melodic and rhythmic emphases, repetition, shifts of meter, style, and harmony, as part of a strategy to create a musical language suited to opera as a genre and to singers as actors. In
         Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patriaandL'incoronazione di Poppea, this strategy serves large-scale dramaturgical aims with respect to the relationships among space, time, and character identity, highlighting issues also discussed within the contemporary intellectual context.<br>

Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: si.1999.22.issue-2<br>
Date: August 1999<br>
Author(s): TenHouten Warren D.<br>
Abstract: It is argued that autobiographical texts, such as life-historical interviews, provide the richest possible source of information about a person's temporality and a culture's historical past. It is proposed that time-consciousness can be inferred from such texts. To this end, ethnographic and other studies of Australian Aboriginal time-consciousness were used to construct a seven-part model of patterned-cyclical time-consciousness. Turning these seven attributes of patterned-cyclical time-consciousness into their opposites yields seven features of one-dimensional, ordinary-linear time-consciousness, thereby establishing a structured temporal polarity. A lexical-level, content-analytic methodology, Neurocognitive Hierarchical Categorization Analysis (NHCA), is introduced, in which folk-concepts of time from
         Roget's International Thesauruswere used to construct wordlist indicators for 9 of the 14 definitional components. Then, using NHCA for a comparative analysis of texts consisting of life-historical interviews, earlier results of an empirical study were brieflv re-presented. Australian Aborigines, compared to Euro-Australian controls, used a significantly smaller proportion of words for an index of ordinary-linear time but a higher proportion of words for an index of patterned-cyclical time, indicating a time-consciousness that is primarily patterned-cyclical rather than linear. Females were less linear and more patterned-cyclical than males in both cultures. These cross-cultural results contribute predictive validity to the proposed polarity of time-consciousness. Implications for the culture-and-cognition paradox and its resolution in dual-brain theory are addressed.<br>

Author(s): Thompson Jim<br>
Abstract: In the formation and composition of what might be termed personal identity a key but often neglected aspect is ideal identity. While comprising aspirations rather than realities, it makes a major contribution to the definition of self-identity. It does this as a result of: (a) clarifying what kind of person the individual wishes to be; and (b) an interrogation of how she sets about achieving her ideal identity, intimating what kind of person she is at a particular moment by virtue of the way in which she strives to achieve her ideal. The article argues for a re-appraisal of the notion of ideals in education and for its reinstatement as a significant feature of education. Indeed, we argue, children cannot avoid ideals--they are presented to them everyday from a wide variety of sources. But these sources or the ideals that they promote are not necessarily good for the child's well-being or for her fellow citizens. Consequently, teachers as moral agents have an important role in assisting children to acquire ideals that do meet such a criterion of goodness in addition to helping them reflect critically on the range of ideals they may encounter in their communities and society.<br>

Abstract: Recent study of the nature of textuality as such opens new insights for the study of the Bible. Although individual parts of the Bible have oral antecedents, the Bible as a whole has existed only as a text, and a unique kind of text, folded back on itself out of communal memory as no other book has been. A text is a monument. Textuality establishes a special relationship between discourse and death. Spoken words are exchanges between living persons. The text presents its message as well if its author is dead as it does if he or she is alive. Print is even more bound to death than writing is. In comparison with oral performance-delivery of an oration, song-a text physically has certain special alliances with past time. All texts come out of the past. Literature as text is psychologically retrospective: its effects typically include an element of nostalgia. Because of its future orientation, culminating in the closing words of Revelation, "Come, Lord Jesus" (as against typical narrative closes such as "They lived happily ever after"), the Bible has an unusual relationship to textuality: it is not literature in the way other texts are. Typical narrative plot structures existence retrospectively: the story is organized back from the conclusion. This retrospective organization is maximized by writing, which tightens plot and makes more of re-cognition, a kind of return to the beginning (the past) and hence a cyclic pattern. In addition to being related intimately to death, writing and print are also limitlessly fecund, the central forces in the evolution of consciousness, once they appear. The fecundity of writing and print, like other fecundity in human existence, is achieved by passage through death. "Unless the grain of wheat dies." The Word of God in the Person of Jesus Christ is conceived of by analogy with the spoken word. The Father speaks the Word, the Son (eo verbum quo filius); he does not write the Word, who would then by biblical attestation be not life but d~<br>

Abstract: This paper provides a phenomenological account of the writing of a young woman diagnosed with schizophrenia. The method of interpretation is to put ourselves in the place of the author drawing upon a combination of sympathy, reason, common-sense, experience, and "an intersubjective world, common to us all" (Schutz, 1945: 536). The result is the recognition of the person as also capable of putting herself in the place of others so as to understand their behavior. This "role-taking success" identifies the limits of the current sociological understanding of insanity's significance in social interaction as an instance of "role-taking failure" (Rosenberg, 1992).<br>

Abstract: Working-class people perform class identities. These performances are marked with ironies in which working class symbolizes power and powerlessness. Such performances elide linear meaning-making in favor of poetic paradox and help us understand the contradictions of working-class life. "The New Deal," a chapbook by my great-grandfather, represents an occasion for understanding how one working-class person used language to consider his life's contradictions. The chapbook articulates a unique "working-class poetics" and suggests why rhetoricians ought to locate representations of the paradoxes of working-class life.<br>

Author(s): Wurm Richard<br>
Abstract: The logic of Indonesian subjectless and tenseless expressions appears to have cultural implications, just as the use of tenses in English scientific writing entails much more than grammatical minutiae. A. L. Becker has pointed out that tense in English functions in a "coherence system" that pervades and transcends grammar. A parallel coherence system is suggested for Indonesian, based not on tense but on topic. Paul Ricoeur's distinction between LANGUAGE and DISCOURSE is the basis of the claim that Indonesian sentences cohere on the bond between grammatical subject and discourse topic. Examples are drawn from a number of contexts that call forth passive sentences in Indonesian. The article concludes on another suggestion by Becker. The Indonesian topic may be part of a larger deictic category of person, which may be related in discourse to orientation in space--both physical and social--of participants in the speech event. If this suggestion is correct, then the contrast between English and Indonesian coherence systems may be found in the opposition tense/time vs. person/space.<br>

Author(s): Cormier Philippe<br>
Abstract: Le dépassement phénoménologique du substantialisme métaphysique devrait permettre aujourd'hui d'envisager une refondation de la notion de personne, laquelle s'était quelque peu immobilisée depuis Boèce. Sur ce nouvel horizon, le retour à la fondation première, celle d'Augustin, s'impose. Celui-ci est le premier en effet, pour l'essentiel dans son traité de la Trinité, à avoir clairement pensé la personne (divine) comme relation et non comme substance. La réduction augustinienne de la personne (humaine) à l'ego ou à « l'homme intérieur » ouvre la possibilité d' « analogies subjectives » avec la Trinité: pensée, amour, connaissance; mémoire, intelligence, volonté. Cependant, la spéculation augustinienne trouve sa limite en échouant à penser une personne de chair — et, qui plus est, une telle personne comme « en relation ». Ce qui était relation en Dieu reste, en l'homme, substance pensante, seule face à son Dieu. Phenomenology has overcome the old substance of metaphysics and then should permit us today to refound the idea of the person which was in a way, since Boethius, brought to a standstill. Therefore we must to go back to St. Augustine who was actually the first, in his De Trinitate, to conceive, the (divine) person as a relation and not as a substance. The (human) person so confined to the ego or to the « inner man » allows some possible « subjective analogies » with the Trinity: thought, love, knowledge, memory, intelligence and will. However the Augustinian theory fails to conceive first the person in her own flesh and blood — a bodily person — and secondly such a person as being « in relation »: man is a thinking substance, alone facing her God.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i211059<br>
Date: 11 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Verheggen Theo<br>
Abstract: By studying Durkheim through a Schopenhauerian lens, the one-sidedly cognitivist and functionalist reception of his social theory can be balanced. Durkheim explicitly rejected such monistic interpretations. His dialectical approach was always aimed at an essentially dualistic perception of man and society, wherein the lower pole, the individual, is central. In Durkheim's symbol theory, this position leads to two kinds of symbols: those that are bound to the human body, here called "this and that" symbols, and those people can choose freely, here called "this for that" symbols. This twofold symbol theory can already be found in medieval philosophy (e.g. Dante Alighieri) as well as in the work of Paul Ricoeur. For Durkheim the human person is the symbol par excellence. By implication the rituals in which the person is (re)constructed, that is the rites of passage, should be central. The interpretation here opens up new perspectives for a more psychological interpretation of Durkheim's sociology.<br>

Abstract: The Subject of this essay, as well as the intention behind it, is to examine the problems connected with the relationship between sociology and the theme of the person. The paper's position is that this theme has a substantial (and not only formal) centrality within a sociological analysis, which is intended to be critical, in the sense used by Theodor Adorno of this term, and is, therefore, naturally, problematic. This discourse implies that the analysis cannot be limited only to codes and factual dynamics (numbering, classify, aggregating-disaggregating) which reduce the sociological discourse to mere sociography.<br>

Abstract: The article identifies a paradox in the concept of person and in its use. Modernity, and the liberation from the logic of status, should have brought about the ultimate consolidation of the idea of personal value. On the contrary it caused such a drastic functional differentiation within society that the individual has come to be defined by his/her function (citizen, economic actor, etc.) rather than as the single bearer of different roles. The concept of person has thus become an expression to identify only the communicative aspect of social life. That is the reason why in our complex society the concept of person cannot find a proper location and comes to the fore only when the other codes fail.<br>

Abstract: When analysing the concept of social relationship, the link between a person and an individual, who from a sociological perspective do not have the same semantic value, needs to be reconsidered as whole. As an individual is typically enclosed in a social dimension, it cannot have a self-referential character. Instead, it tends to half-reveal the authentic foundation of the civil society on the basis of a range of values which, after leading to the recognition of the self, activate relationships with the social other and the rest of the world including the transcendental one. In fact, within the opening relationship it's possible to find the conscience of own existence, to purchase the awareness of own identities and to become responsible of own world of life. Considering the aspects of sociological compromise and moral quality of the afore-going, it is clear that socio-cultural exchanges — where relationship skills come clearly into play — are the heuristic foundation of the complex relationship between individuals and society. Consequently, such exchanges become social dynamics through which affective similarities and legitimate differences interact to build an ethical balance for society as well as support a differentiated development of social bonds.<br>

Abstract: Research on information sharing has viewed this activity as essential for informing groups on content relevant to a decision. We propose and examine an alternate function of information sharing, i.e., the social construction of meaning. To accomplish this goal, we turn to social construction, social presence, and task closure theories. Drawing from these theories, we hypothesize relationships among the meeting environment, breadth and depth of information shared during a meeting, and decision quality. We explore these relationships in terms of the effects of both the media environment in which the group is situated and the medium that group members choose to utilize for their communication. Our study of 32, 5- and 6-person groups supports our belief that interpretation underlies information sharing and is necessary for favorable decision outcomes. It also supports the proposed negative effect of low social presence media on interpretation in terms of depth of information sharing; a low social presence medium, however, promotes information sharing breadth. Finally, the findings indicate that when in multimedia environments and faced with a relatively complex task, choosing to utilize an electronic medium facilitates closure and, therefore, favorable outcomes.<br>

Abstract: This essay focuses on a strange medieval phenomenon, the so-called gift of tears—religious weeping that brings beatitude. This internal purifying process, which was embedded in the specific conditions of historical Christianity, was described and understood as a procedure in which God himself acts and, therefore, as a process that humankind cannot learn, formalize, or ritualize. However, the author analyzes religious weeping as a peculiar, 'intimate ritual' in which the formalized process took place in the soul or spirituality of the weeping person. This essay aims to describe and analyze this practice while examining the historical conditions that enabled such a cultural elaboration to develop.<br>

Publisher: Wiley Subscription Services<br>
Issue: i23254812<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): SLATMAN JENNY<br>
Abstract: In this paper, I explore the meaning of bodily integrity in disfiguring breast cancer. Bodily integrity is a normative principle precisely because it does not simply refer to actual physical or functional intactness. It rather indicates what should be regarded and respected as inviolable in vulnerable and damageable bodies. I will argue that this normative inviolability or wholeness can be based upon a person's embodied experience of wholeness. This phenomenological stance differs from the liberal view that identifies respect for integrity with respect for autonomy (resulting in an invalidation of bodily integrity's proper normative meaning), as well as from the view that bodily integrity is based upon ideologies of wholeness (which runs the risk of being disadvantageous to women). I propose that bodily integrity involves a process of identification between the experience of one's body as "Leib" and the experience of one's body as "Körper." If identification fails or is not possible, one's integrity is threatened. This idea of bodily integrity can support breast cancer patients and survivors in making decisions about possible corrective interventions. To implement this idea in oncology care, empirical-phenomenological research needs to establish how breast cancer patients express their embodied self-experiences.<br>

Abstract: Jaspers' thesis (while rejecting the claim of philosophers of the Western tradition to universal validity and Truth, yet conceding that their metaphysical systems express an awareness of Being) is as follows: "Reality is neither the object nor the subject, but that which encompasses both, the Encompassing which is illuminated in the division between subject and object"; He — the One God — is Encompassing and the greatest closeness which has its place within the inwardness of man". The whole inquiry leads Jaspers to claim that the existential self is rooted in Transcendence and the ground of all things lies in the real ization of the existential self in freedom in which eternity and time coalesce. In this freedom time — far from being the "moving image of eternity" — becomes the actual scene of the existential self's moral striving with the forces of this world, and by seizing the cipher (= the language of Transcendence) as the symbol of Transcendence, the existential self achieves authentic existence, thus endowing the historical process of time with unique and ultimate meaning. 1) Reason: It is because of reason with which God has endowed man that any content of a pretended revelation possesses any self-evidencing power: "In diesem Menschwerden durch Vernunft wird das Eine der Transzendenz fühlbar dem Einen der jeweils geschichtlichen Existenz". Yet by abandoning belief in universal Truth we become open for Truth, realised and determined in its concrete historic form for each individual by means of communication. Communication therefore becomes "the universal condition of man's being". It follows that Truth cannot be separated from communicability. It only appears in time as a realitythrough-communication so much so "that I can not even become myself alone without emerging out of my being with others". Now the element in which existential communication lives and moves and has its spiritual being is — reason ("reason is what penetrates everything"). 2) Unity of Mank~<br>

Abstract: Remonstrances (jian ﻿諫) reveal a great deal about the writing of history in China during the Eastern Zhou. As represented in the Zuozhuan and Guoyu, remonstrances, like other speeches, are normally delivered in court and address questions of official policy. They tend to test contemporary phenomena against the lessons of the past, especially as those lessons have been formulated in the Shijing, the Shangshu, aphorisms, and other forms of what I term "inherited speech." Remonstrances also have the support of the third-person historical narrative which surrounds them; the ruler who ignores a remonstrance always suffers for his obstinacy. After briefly discussing the importance of speeches in the Zuozhuan and Guoyu, I outline the structure of a remonstrance and examine four passages in which critical speech, including remonstrance, is said to have circulated freely in the courts of an idealized early period. Next I show how remonstrances match observed historical particulars with fragments of inherited speech. The famous remonstrance of Gong zhi Qi, an exemplary episode, shows how this application of inherited speech guides rhetorical choices and establishes Traditionalist or Confucian terms as the keys to historical intelligibility. Finally, I examine a set of remonstrances which are exceptional in that they do not include overt citations of inherited speech. Among these, military remonstrances can genuinely eschew explicit citation of lessons of the past, while others borrow the authority of inherited speech without seeming to do so. In one case, a brief remonstrance has apparently acquired the status of an aphorism, so that already when it is first uttered it qualifies as a sort of inherited speech. In another case, a precursor of the indirect remonstrances (fengjian ﻿諷諫) of later periods, remonstrators use a theatrical combination of actions and speech to criticize their superior's departure from correct ways.

Abstract: How do children conceptualise their own development? From their point of view, what serve as constraints for their movements in time and space? The theoretical framework of the experiment described here was a cultural historical first person developmental perspective. The concept of transition is here put in use to capture the children's experience of their movements with or against a dynamic, inviting and demanding socio-cultural landscape over time. An interpretation of children's experience of their developmental timing with temporalities of the childhood landscape is presented. Comment les enfants conceptualisent-ils leur propre développement? De leur point de vue, qu'est-ce qui contraint leurs mouvements dans l'espace et dans le temps? Le cadre théorique de la recherche décrite ici est une perspective historico-culturelle, développementale et à la première personne. Le concept de transition est utilisé pour mettre en évidence l'expérience que les enfants ont de leurs mouvements, allant avec, ou à l'encontre de leur environnement socioculturel et temporel, lequel est à la fois dynamique, invitant et exigeant. Une interprétation de l'expérience que les enfants ont de la temporalité de leur propre développement est présentée en rapport avec les temporalités caractérisant l'environnement de l'enfance.<br>

Abstract: Freud's metapsychology, although it is not identical with the whole field of psychoanalytic psychology, originated under the controlling influence of a questionable positivistic model of science. The analysis begun in a previous study (Gregorianum, 61 [1980] 97-136) continues in this study of the relationship in Freud's thought between theory and empirical observation. We also treat the attempts by Freud and by the later neopositivist schools of classical ego-theory to articulate psychoanalytic insights about the person in terms taken from neurophysiology, biology, and classical mechanics. Such terms pervade the terminology used to express the metapsychological viewpoints, albeit in disharmonious juxtaposition with more specifically psychological terms. Freud's whole work was affected by his desire to propose psychoanalysis as a natural science on the model of the positivistic outlook of late nineteenth century Viennese physicalism. Opposition arose in the 1950s and 1960s to understanding psychoanalysis as a natural science, especially because of problems of conceptual definition, language, and verification or validation. Orthodox Freudians themselves were troubled by the problem of psychic energy and the discussion finally led to critical doubts about Freud's whole metapsychology. One reason was the dependence on a physical and mechanical model of science and on a neurophysiology no longer tenable. Other frames of reference in the exact sciences were sought, such as cybernetics and information theory, in an attempt to remain to some extent in harmony with the original epistemological ideology. There are those today who remain convinced that psychoanalysis is an exact science, and who in turn reject the different psychologies of understanding and the hermeneutical sciences. In the context of a basic-level discussion, this contribution explores, in their context, the principles of the worldview found at the most theoretical level of metapsychology. Among these, the p~<br>

Abstract: Today, bioethical themes are no longer the exclusive patrimony of university classrooms. Everyone is talking about them; "secular" and "catholics" alike. Catholics are often accused of imposing a "confessional" point of view. This article wishes to clarify this point given its importance in themes regarding the life and death of man, such as: artificial fecundation, abortion, cloning, brain death, organ transplants, and euthanasia. The article is based on a philosophical reflection starting with anthropological considerations. The extensive number of themes does not allow taking all of them into consideration. Thus the article adheres to the following outline: 1. Establish the epistemological bases for a rational discourse based on universal premises, with particular reference to artificial fecundation and the nature of human sexuality. 2. Analize the "human nature" condition of the embryo, of the physically and mentally disabled, of the terminally ill, and their status as "human persons"; this discourse is founded on the ontological status of the human body. 3. Present the value of the human body as a psycho-biological unity, which constitutes man's substantial unity. 4. We call this psycho-biological unity "person": "corpore et anima unus"; an individual subject with a rational nature, with its own singularity and oneness. The person has an absolute value, therefore cloning, even for "therapeutic reasons", is contrary to its ontological status. 5. From the consideration that a "person is", while a "personality becomes", we can explain how the person develops and matures his biological and spiritual capacities, without incurring changes in his ontological status. 6. The psycho-biological unity of the human person (corpore et anima unus) is at the basis of death in man, a unique reality. In analysing "human death" we should avoid two reductions: a biological reduction which curtails death to physical-biological processes and events (medical diagnosis of brain death)~<br>

Abstract: L'approche par les capabilités proposée par A. Sen a été considérée comme une révolution dans l'analyse du développement et, en particulier, de la pauvreté. Si elle a exercé une influence sur les indicateurs du développement, elle pose néanmoins la question de la conception sous-jacente du sujet. Cet article montre que la conception de la personne utilisée par Sen est insuffisante et qu'il pratique un individualisme très standard. Cette approche est d'autant plus problématique qu'elle n'est pas simplement compréhensive, mais aussi normative. En ne tenant pas compte de la fragilité de la personne, son analyse aboutit finalement à une faiblesse morale. The capability approach proposed by A. Sen constitutes a real change in the poverty analysis. It influenced considerably development indicators. However, the question who really is the subject behind this approach is at stake. In this paper we defend the idea that the conception of the person used by Sen is relatively standard. It is then problematic because his approach is not only comprehensive but also normative. His analyse finally conducts to a moral weakness. El enfoque de las capabilidades propuesto por A. Sen fue considerado como una revolución en el análisis del desarrollo y, en particular, en el de la pobreza. Si bien ejerció una influencia sobre los indicadores de desarrollo, plantea la cuestión de la concepción subyacente del sujeto. Este artículo muestra que la concepción de la persona utilizada por Sen es insuficiente y que practica un individualismo muy estándar. Este enfoque es aún más problemático dado que no es simplemente comprensivo sino también normativo. Al no considerar la fragilidad de la persona, su análisis desemboca finalmente en una debilidad moral.<br>

Abstract: Vgl. Johann Gottlieb Fichte: Die Thatsachen des Bewußtseins, 12. Vortrag (1813). Nach-
gelassene Werke, hg. von Immanuel Hermann Fichte. Bd. 1 (Berlin 1834-35) 518: »(Wir denken
nicht, bilden nicht die Welt, sondern sie ist, eben schlechthin, wie der gebundenste Dogmatis-
mus es nur irgend sich denken mag: nur ist die Empirie nicht an sich, sondern sie ist an der
Erscheinung, und ist nicht Sein, sondern ist Bild, durch und durch Bild). Dieses Bild ist auch in
der Erscheinung nicht isoliert, sondern synthetisch vereint mit einem anderen Bilde, dem des
Ich, und zwar als die Accidenz des Ich, als Bestimmung des Ich, die da schlechthin ist; nicht
etwa gegeben durch irgend eine Freiheit des Ich, und als sein Principiat, sondern gegeben durch
das Sein des Ich. Das Ich ist und hat die Welt, dieses Weltbild. Was ist das aber für ein Ich? Das
individuelle, irgend eine Person, oder das Eine? Offenbar das Eine Ich; denn es ist ja nur eine
Welt, und das Ich ist ja an dieser Stelle bloß der Insichhalter und Träger der Welt. Also es ist nur
ein Ich, wie eine Erscheinung. In Beziehung auf die gegebene Welt ist die Erscheinung gar nicht
gespalten, sondern schlechthin Eine, und stellt sich dar als Eine in Einem und demselben Ich.
(Ich hoffe: es ist klar, und es wird gut sein, diese Formel zu verstehen, und das Verhältnis aus
ihr zu begreifen. In der objektiven Weltanschauung ist keine Person, kein Individuum schaut
die Welt an, sondern Alle sind in der Weltanschauung allzumal Eins. Die Dogmatiker, indem sie
auf dem Ansichsein der Welt, und so auf ihrer objektiven Einheit bestehen, zerreißen dennoch
ihre Anschauung der Welt in Iche: und Ich heißt ihnen allemal das Individuum: einen anderen
Begriff vom Ich haben sie gar nicht.« Vgl. ebenfalls den ersten Lehrsatz Fichtes (Ein endliches

Issue: i24395981<br>

Abstract: In this essay, I argue that Penelope Fitzgerald's The Gate of Angels attempts to work out the difficulties that any intelligent, religiously inclined person must come to terms with in the twentieth, now twentieth-first, century. Fitzgerald sought not to shelter her religious belief behind a cloister wall, thinking like her uncle the Reverend Wilfred Knox, "that no cloister walls can be high enough to exclude the cares of the world." Among these cares is the desire to give a faithful report of the world to each other, to know this world as it exists in truth, and not to misrepresent it. Early twentieth-century investigations into the makeup of the physical world as well as the theoretical and intellectual advances possible with quantum physics were very much part of this desire; and in The Gate of Angels, set in and around Cambridge University's pre-war physics laboratories, Fitzgerald offers a beautiful rendering of the excitement engendered by these investigations. At the same time, Fitzgerald offers a picture, true to her own experience, wherein things that in the popular mind are often conceived of as opposite and irreconcilable—for instance, chance and necessity—are found to stand in a relation of sympathy, casting over The Gate of Angels "that sympathetic glow which," Henry James wrote, "forms half the substance of our genial impressions."<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd<br>
Issue: i24439507<br>
Date: 10 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): CHRISTMAN JOHN<br>
Abstract: In this article I critically discuss a claim made by several writers in philosophy and the social sciences that for an individual to count as a person, a single personality, or the subject of a life, the experiences of the subject in question must take a narrative form. I argue that narrativity is a misleading and, in some ways of understanding it, implausible condition of what it is that adds unity to personhood and personality. I pursue this critique by considering canonical accounts of narrativity in philosophy and literary studies. I consider those connections between events that must hold for the sequence to be considered a narrative: causal, teleological, and thematic connections. I argue that for each of these, the condition that experiential sequences (for a given subject) must have this structure is empty: any life sequence that is reflected upon in an interpretive spirit can meet it. What the condition of narrativity amounts to, then, is the more basic requirement that the person must be able to look upon the factors and events of her life with a certain interpretive reflection, whether or not those factors and events have any particular narrative unity in a traditional sense.<br>

Author(s): da Silva António Barbosa<br>
Abstract: The purpose of this theoretical article is to discuss the existential and universal feature of suffering—as illustrated by Job's suffering in the Book of Job in the Bible and by the survivors of the 2004 Asian tsunami catastrophe—and to highlight its significance for health care. Further, the study is aiming at contributing to health professionals' understanding of patients' suffering. The sources are narratives, comprising Job's book, TV interviews 1 year after the tsunami catastrophe and the survivors' autobiographies. The methodological approach is a philosophical analysis. The existential, universal, ontological and epistemological aspects of suffering are carefully scrutinized to unveil the universal and existential versus culture-specific features of suffering. Based on the results, the authors' recommendations are (1) a holistic concept of the patient and health care has to seriously consider suffering in all its complexity because when a person is in pain, it is not his/her body but the whole person as a unity of body, psyche and spirit that suffers and (2) suffering should be seen as the most central concept of health care, which should provide treatment for physical pain and all dimensions of suffering: physical, social, mental and spiritual aspects.<br>

Abstract: Il semble cependant qu'il présuppose la possibilité principale pour une loi
juridique de n'être pas seulement un facteur extérieur qui nous force à agir de
manière légale. Au bout du compte, tout droit provient de la liberté, car une
personne ne peut être subordonnée qu'aux lois qu'elle s'est elle-même
données. « Die moralische Persönlichkeit ist also nichts anderes als die
Freiheit eines vernünftigen Wesens unter moralischen Gesetzen [...], woraus
dann folgt, daß eine Person keinen anderen Gesetzen, als denen, die sie
(entweder allein, oder wenigstens zugleich mit anderen) sich selbst gibt,
unterworfen ist », Rechtslehre, pp. 25 sq. Voir aussi p. 38 : La source des
jugements sur ce qui est juste et ce qui est injuste n'est pas à chercher du côté
des lois empiriques, positives, mais dans la raison elle-même qui est la
« Grundlage » d'une « législation positive possible » (einer « möglichen
positiven Gesetzgebung »).<br>

Abstract: Le 21 août 2004, dans la Békaa (Liban), un jeune touriste musulman sunnite est le témoin d'un miracle : une statue de la Vierge s'anime devant lui et lui adresse un message. L'événement transforme en quelques jours Béchouate, un village isolé, en vaste centre de pèlerinage interreligieux réunissant des dévots de différentes confessions, chrétiens et musulmans. Cet article portera sur le basculement qui voit une statue, « Notre-Dame de Béchouate », brusquement passer du régime de l'objet à celui d'une personne qui s'anime, sourit, bouge et parle. Elle sera donc l'héroïne de l'ethnographie ici proposée, une héroïne au centre de pressantes attentions humaines. Partant de l'observation des liens complexes qui se créent et se recréent entre cet « objet-personne » et des dévots de différentes religions, il s'agira de s'interroger sur les économies locatives du divin et de faire « heuristiquement crédit » aux acteurs rencontrés sur le terrain lorsque pour de « bonnes raisons », ils affirment être en présence d'êtres divins et/ou surnaturels. On 21 August 2004, in the Bekaa Valley (Lebanon), a young Sunni Muslim tourist witnessed a miracle : a statue of the Virgin Mary came to life and gave him a message. Within a few days, Beshuat, once a quiet and remote village, became a major interdenominational pilgrimage center drawing thousands of Christian and Muslim worshippers. The statue of Our Lady of Beshuat is the main « actor » of the following ethnographic essay that details its/her sudden transformation from « object » into « persona » capable of moving, smiling and speaking. Based on observation of the complex ties between this object-person and worshippers of different religions, the aim of this essay is to highlight how the divine is made present and, by so doing, to give « heuristic credit » to the people encountered in the field who declare, for « good reasons », that they are in the presence of divine or supernatural beings.<br>

Abstract: I am open to David Carroll's considération that American 'deconstructionists' (and
those in art historical circles?) may have oversimplified Derrida's thought into a 'newer
form of new criticism' (in Paraesthetics, Foucault/Lyotard/Derrida ILondon:Methuen,
1987) pp.81-89). Yet even Carroll notes that 'a critical reading of Derrida should have as
one of its goals to make a practical criticism derived from Derrida's work very diflicult, if
not impossible to realize' (p.207 n.3). Possibly Derrida's disciples, like those of Dooye-
weerd or Dewey or Hegel, misrepresent his genius, but Derridean authority is constantly
invoked on the world academie circuit today for its assembly-line scholarship of profes-
sional articles which continue to marginalize both philosophical and literary criticism. So
there is more warrant than chagrin to André Lefevere's sardonic remark: 'To produce
more and more interprétations of texts that have been interpreted for centuries may
appear to be a trifle redundant, except that it is a matter of bread and butter for most
interpreters.... (quoting Vincent Leitch, Deconstructive Criticism, 1983) 'There can never
be <correct> or <objective> readings, only more or less energetic, interesting, careful or
pleasurable misreadings.' Often the same person who writes this kind of thing then goes
home and grades the 'misreadings' of others, so that they, too, can take their place within
the academy, or be denied it, as the case may be.' Lefevere, '"Beyond Interprétation" or
The Business of (Re)Writing,' in Comparative Literature Studies 24 (no. 1, 1987): 18.
William Rowe, however, asks for a patient, 'more internai' critical reading of Derrida's
nomadic no-position. Cf. 'Critical study of [Sander Griffioen'sl The Problem of Progress',
in Philosophia Reformata 55 (no. 1, 1990): 80-83.<br>

Abstract: Scheler's position is precariously subtle: the "person" is neither exhausted in his "acts"
nor something subsisting through their temporal succession, but, rather, a supra-temporal
being who acts into time and who "is and experiences himself only as a being that executes
acts"; the "whole person is contained in every fully concrete act, and the whole person 'varies' in
and through every act - without being exhausted in his being in any of these acts, and
without 'changing' like a thing in time" (Formalismus, p. 395f. [English translation, p. 385]; see
above, n. 27, for full references).<br>

Abstract: Transparency is one of Kierkegaard's favorite terms to indicate that a person's freedom is
appropriately proportioned to that person's relationship to God. Persons may increase or loose
transparency (cf. Kierkegaard 1848). For my own account of this non-transparency (I use the
term speechlessness), see Glas (in press).<br>

Author(s): Glas Gerrit<br>
Abstract: Ouweneel (1986, 202-206) speaks of activated internal object functions of a biotic animal
structure (perceptive), a biotic mamal structure (sensitive), and a biotic human structure
(spiritive). The distinction internal-external concerning object functions has to do with being
part or not being part of the enkaptic structural whole. Activation of the aesthetic object
function of the bird's song does not proceed from the bird itself; it depends on the human
(and is therefore external). In a singing human person this disclosure is internal. The terms
'perceptive' and 'sensitive' point to a distinction in the psychical: Ouweneel holds that elemen-
tary instances of awareness (perceptions) should be distinguished from feelings, tendencies
and desires (the sensitive) (see IV.3.c). Ouweneel's term 'spiritive' points to what Dooyeweerd
calls act structure.<br>

Publisher: Murray Coombes Publishers<br>
Issue: e24805687<br>
Date: June 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): Mason Garth<br>
Abstract: In this article I examine Philip Qipa (P.Q.) Vundla’s Moral Rearmament-inspired (MRA) politics with a view to explicating the previously hidden currents at work in his political activism. In my analysis, I draw on the theoretical frameworks of Paul Ricoeur and Homi Bhabha. In terms of these conceptual foundations, I investigate Vundla’s involvement in two foundational events in the history of the South African struggle, namely the school boycott of 1955 and the bus boycott of 1957. The official history of these two events, written by social historians such as Tom Lodge, interprets them as the dawn of mass opposition against apartheid. However, I contend that a closer analysis of these two events via biographical material reveals a more complex history, implicitly connected to the person of P.Q. Vundla and his politics of negotiation and finding common ground between opposing ideologies. Vundla stands out within this context because he was a nonconforming ANC leader, who disagreed with the way the party leadership approached political activism. His approach was driven by MRA values, which sought political solutions through dialogue and aimed to benefit all communities within South Africa. Vundla can be seen as an early forerunner of the bridge-building politics of Nelson Mandela. It is hoped that, by examining the role of MRA values in Vundla’s activism, a fuller, more complex account of politics in the 1950s can be arrived at.<br>

Abstract: Much light can be shed on events which characterize or underlie scandals at firms such as Enron, Arthur Andersen, Worldcom, ImClone, and Tyco by appealing to the notion of ethical distance. Various inquiries have highlighted the difficulties in finding or identifying particular individuals to blame for particular events, and in the context of situations as complex as these it can sometimes be helpful to investigate the comparative ethical distance of various participants in these events. In this essay I offer a characterization of ethical distance in terms of moral responsibility, and in doing so I describe and illustrate the rough inverse correlation between moral distance and degrees of moral responsibility. I urge that the concept of ethical distance is capable of shedding light upon situations in which several people are involved in bringing about a state of affairs. I then argue that moral responsibility cannot do justice to all situations involving ethical distance. When the distance between a person and a state of affairs grows sufficiently large, a different type of treatment is called for, and I introduce the notion of moral taint to describe the moral status of agents in these situations.<br>

Abstract: The onset of dementia raises troubling questions. Does the person with dementia still recognize you? If someone cannot recognize you, can they still care about you? This essay takes such questions as the entry point for a broader inquiry into recognition, its linkages to care, and how claims to social and political "recognition" are linked to, or premised on, the demonstrated capacity to "recognize" people and things. In the words and actions of her severely impaired mother, the author finds guidance toward a better, more compassionate question to ask about dementia: how can we best strive to "keep the cares together"?<br>

Abstract: Alberto Guerreiro Ramos's intellectual trajectory is analyzed to show his permanent concern with the condition of contemporary humanity. Two moments in his trajectory are specifically addressed. In the first, under the strong influence of Christian intellectual thought, the category of human person was most important to him. In the second moment he sought to demonstrate autonomy from those earlier influences, secularized his thought, and coined the expression Parenthetical Man, which was central to his criticism of the social sciences and especially of organizational theory. From this he proposed his theory of social system delimitation. From this point of view, it is possible to affirm that Guerreiro Ramos's sociology is predominantly antropocentric, in other words, Ramos takes man as the main reference in his design of social systems.<br>

Abstract: Starting by the distinction made by Henrique Cláudio de Lima Vaz between the democratic ideal and real democracy, and to assume that we will only be able to build a true democratic community if we act within that same community as authentic persons, we defend in this article that being a person is constituted as a call to hope. We will divide the article into three parts. In the first part, we will explain in what sense the personalism is constituted as an option for hope. Then we indicate what it means to be a person for Lima Vaz. Finally, we show how we can become a person and what are the difficulties to this accomplishment. Only when we exist as authentical people we will be able to establish the right relationship between the democratic ideal and real democracy.<br>

Abstract: According to Philip Rieff, Freud affirms the distance of the individual from the com-
munity, and in this sense psychoanalysis agrees with liberalism. The Freudian individual is
aloof from politics and learns not to seek radical changes in society, avers Rieff. That individ-
ual adapts to society in a calculated way which suits his or her needs: 'a rationally alienated
person learns how to guard against social over-investments, and how to make them when
necessary' (Philip Rieff, Freud: The Mind of a Moralist (Garden City, NY, 1961), p. 278).
Freud, then, teaches that the individual's attachment to society should be dependent on a
rational, economic exercise—on the conscious distribution of instinctual energy. Moreover,
once psychoanalytic therapy becomes a way of life, it contributes to detachment from others
by enhancing self-absorption. 'While enjoining a person to be less severe with himself,
observes Rieff, 'Freudian analysis may also develop in the patient new qualities of self-
suspicion... The therapy manufactures a new sort of conscience, one which demands a more
accurate and yet more scrupulous self-centeredness' (ibid., pp. 106-7).<br>

Abstract: There are only a few studies of the formal and generic possibilities of
epistolary fiction. Amongst the best are François Jost, "Le roman
épistolaire et la technique narrative au XVIIIe siècle," Comparative Liter-
ature Studies, 3 (1966), 397-427, and "L'Evolution d'un genre : le roman
épistolaire dans les lettres occidentales," in his Essais de littérature
comparée, 2 (Europaena), 89-179, 380-402; Jean Rousset, "Le roman
par lettres," in his Forme et signification. Essais sur les structures lit-
téraires de Corneille à Claudel (Paris, 1964), pp. 65-108, and "La monodie
épistolaire : Crébillon fils" in his Narcisse romancier: Essai sur la première
personne dans le roman (Paris, 1973), pp. 114-26. There are several pas-
sages in this latter study that treat different aspects of first-person nar-
rative in general, and which are helpful to the critic of letter-fiction. See
also Jean-Luc Seylaz, Les "Liaisons dangereuses" et la création roma-
nesque chez Laclos (Geneva, 1958), Pierre Testud, "Les Lettres persanes,
roman épistolaire," RHLF, 66 (1966), 642-56, T. Todorov, Littérature et
signification (Paris, 1967). Finally, there is an excellent Ph. D. disserta-
tion which hopefully will be soon published, by Janet Altman, entitled
"Epistolarity : Approaches to a Form," Diss. Yale University, 1973.<br>

Article Title: Digitizing Lizards: The Topology of 'Vision' in Ecological Fieldwork<br>
Publisher: Sage Publications<br>
Issue: i212655<br>
Date: 10 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): Bowen G. Michael<br>
Abstract: In this paper, we describe and theorize the topology of 'vision' in field ecology, a domain considerably different from laboratory work in the physical sciences, and discuss the temporal extension of data-collection practices. Data collection in this field is characterized by widely varying measurements, measurement dimensions and temporal extension of data collection. We present the ecologists' field laboratory as a perceptual machinery with a heterogeneous and heteromaterial topology as it pertains to measures, precision, replication and other material practices. Because of the complexity of ecological fieldwork, considerable co-ordination and articulation work is necessary. Here, tables, tags and labels are central tools to achieve coherence of inscriptions. We topicalize the work that digitizes measurements conducted on lizards and their habitats, and that therefore imposes signs that lend themselves to mathematical and statistical processes. It is only through these digitizing processes that lizards become visible to other (interested) ecologists, most of whom have not seen this particular animal species in person. We thereby contribute in new ways to discussions of the topography and topology of scientific vision, to the relation of measurement to practice, and to the 'adequation' of nature and mathematics.<br>

Abstract: En marge de la liturgie des saints anges et de la figure anonyme de l'ange gardien que le catholicisme affecte à la protection de chaque fidèle, existe aujourd'hui une angélologie postulant l'existence de soixante-douze anges gardiens nommés et spécialisés, assignés à l'humanité entière en fonction de la date de naissance de l'individu. À travers l'étude des ouvrages concernant ces anges et de quelques entretiens, cet article analyse la construction de cette figure de l'ange, différente de celle que reconnaît l'Église. Cette production syncrétique reprend certains éléments de la conception catholique moderne de l'ange tutélaire et du saint, mais s'inspire aussi des spéculations théologiques des premiers siècles sur les anges, des doctrines kabbalistiques de la Remaissance, de l'occultisme du XIXe siècle et de l'astrologie zodiacale moderne. /// At the frontiers of the liturgy of the Holy Angels and the nameless figure of the guardian angel that catholicism assigns to protect each of the faithful, an angelology has now emerged, proposing the existence of seventy-two guardian angels each with their own name and specialized role, assigned to all humanity according to each person's date of birth. Studying published works on these angels and in the course of a number of interviews, the present article analyses the construction of this figure of the angel, an image that differs from the one recognized by the Catholic Church. This syncretic production takes up certain elements of the modern catholic conception of the angel as guardian and of the saints, but bases itself also on the theoretical speculations on the angels during the first centuries, on the kabbalistic doctrines of the Renaissance, on 19th century occultism and the modern astrology of the zodiac. /// Al margen de la liturgia de los santos ángeles y de la figura anónima del ángel custodio que el catolicismo destina a la protección de cada fiel, existen hoy especulaciones postulando la existencia de setenta y d~<br>

Abstract: This paper addresses several problems in experimental ethnographies: the integration of first- and third-person texts, ethnographic authority, and incorporation of dialogue in ethnographies. These problems can be traced to a relationship between discourse and text that hinges on splitting subject/object and process/product. Both splits are antithetical to dialogue in defining relationships between self and social life. A dialogic approach is developed through use of indexing in social distance, and discussed in Japanese usage of register. Implications for intersubjective, reflexive, and pluralistic approaches to social life are traced out.<br>

Abstract: This paper addresses several problems in experimental ethnographies: the integration of first and third person texts, ethnographic authority, and incorporation of dialogue into texts. These problems can be traced to a relationship between discourse and text that focuses on reference, and results in "representing" dialogue. This obscures dialogue in the larger sense of constituting social reality. An indexical, rather than a referential approach to dialogue is developed through examination of indexing of social distance, discussed in Japanese usage of register. Implications are traced out for intersubjective, reflexive, and pluralistic approaches to social life.<br>

Publisher: University of Alberta<br>

Author(s): Yankelovich Donald<br>
Abstract: A social psychologist dissatisfied with the oversocialized conceptions of man which predominate in sociology may well seek in the psychoanalytic theory of the instincts a countervailing individuality and a hard core of human nature as a basis for resistance to social determinism and relativism. Nevertheless, man appears to be a "denatured" and symbolling, rather than an instinctual creature. The mechanistic and biologistic psychoanalytic metapsychology has obscured Freud's central discovery of the unconscious dimensions of man's reality-constructing activity. Intrapsychic conflict and man's resistance to socialization arise not from any clash between nature (instinct) and culture (civilization), but from contradictions between conscious and unconscious fantasies and among the varying projects and definitions related to different moments of a person's biography. While social psychologists need to be reminded of man's unconscious symbolic action and interaction, psychoanalysts must be recalled (perhaps by the followers of Mead, as well as by disciples of Lacan) to the essentially semiotic character of their enterprise. In both disciplines the task is hermeneutic more than ontological: our aim is less to reveal Reality than to describe our varying (personal and social) "realities" and their expression in the myths and metaphors we live by -- consciously, preconsciously and unconsciously. /// Un psychologue social insatisfait des conceptions sursocialisées de l'homme qui prédominent en sociologie peut très bien chercher dans la théorie psychanalytique des instincts une individualité compensatoire, un noyau dur de nature humaine comme base de résistance au déterminisme et relativisme social. Néanmoins, l'homme paraît un être "dénaturé" et vivant de symboles plutôt qu'un être d'instinct. La métapsychologie psychanalytique (mecaniste et "biologitique") a obscurci la découverte centrale de Freud de la dimension inconsciente de l'activité constructive du réel de l'homme. Les~<br>

Abstract: The coherence of the "Dialogues" can be vindicated in opposition to the widespread view-notably espoused by Jean Starobinski-that their ethical position overturns the Rousseauian synthesis elaborated in earlier systematic works. Rousseau's "Dialogues" amount to a transcendental problem which accepts the self it portrays as given: an account is needed of how this self arises by arguments that move from stated facts to points of principle offered in Rousseau's philosophy. Only then can we recover agency concealed by the rhetorically infelicitous objective, third-person optic Rousseau adopts to present and defend his self.<br>

Abstract: In this article, I examine the politics and practices of apprenticeship in the "traditions" of Turkish folk music through playing the bağama, or saz. The saz has become iconically representative of a folk music collected and preserved in the era of nationalism, and I examine the meaning of such a self-conscious and reflexive tradition's claims to traditionality. I outline the ways in which that tradition is acquired as an aesthetics of self, requiring one to consciously shape the self to become the type of person who can play the saz and, hence, improvise within the sensibility of a tradition.<br>

Abstract: This paper formulates the categories of "ethics," "self," and "subject" for an analysis of classical rabbinic ethics centered on the text, "The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan." Early rabbis were concerned with the realms of life that today's scholars describe as ethics and self-cultivation, yet they had no overarching concepts for either the self/person or for ethics. This analysis, then, cannot rely only upon native rabbinic terminology, but also requires a careful use of contemporary categories. This paper first sets out basic features of "Rabbi Nathan" and presents appropriate formulations of the relevant scholarly terms. The latter sections address possibilities for employing and revising these categories in descriptive and comparative studies more broadly, first surveying relevant scholarship on Christian, Muslim, and Manichaean sources, and then turning to ancient East Asian sources with a particular focus upon passages in the "Zhuangzi".<br>

Abstract: There is something profoundly disturbing in the concept of politics as an agon, a site of contestation, struggle, and competition. Action in a world of pervasive and irreducible conflict risks exposing the individual to the contingency of all unity, including the unity of the self, and thus forces individuals to recognize their own internal divisions and contradictions. This article considers the possibility of enduring, surviving, and excelling at agonistic politics. It asks what kind of individuality, what mode of thinking about and addressing the person's inner plurality, might provide the capacities to survive participation in the democratic agon and thus sustain democracy as a form of politics. Accounts of agonistic politics concur in imagining the individual as engaged in what might be called an inner agonism; therefore my analysis focuses on the reasons for this mimetic relationship between individuality and politics. I argue that mimesis in political imagination draws out particular sorts of affective responses, orienting the person to her political world in ways that might provide precisely the sorts of resources needed for action.<br>

Abstract: In this paper I develop a phenomenology of falling ill by presenting, interpreting and developing the basic model we find in Jean-Paul Sartre's Being and Nothingness (1956). The three steps identified by Sartre in this process are analysed, developed further and brought to a five- step model: (1) pre-reflective experience of discomfort, (2) lived, bodily discomfort, (3) suffered illness, (4) disease pondering, and (5) disease state. To fall ill is to fall victim to a gradual process of alienation, and with each step this alienating process is taken to a new qualitative level. Consequently, the five steps of falling ill have not only a contingent chronological order but also a kind of logical order, in that they typically presuppose each other. I adopt Sartre's focus on embodiment as the core ground of the alienation process, but point out that the alienation of the body in illness is not only the experience of a psychic object, but an experience of the independent life of one's own body. This facticity of the body is the result neither of the gaze of the other person, nor of a reflection adopting the outer perspective of the other in an indirect way, but is a result of the very otherness of one's own body, which addresses and plagues us when we fall ill. I use examples of falling ill and being a patient to show how a phenomenology of falling ill can be helpful in educating health-care personnel (and perhaps also patients) about the ways of the lived body.<br>

Abstract: O presente artigo mostra até que ponto a transferência psicanalítica, produto de marca da aliança terapêutica, tem por vocação ser ultrapassada mediante a progressiva tomada de consciência que a pessoa analisada faz do caráeter instrumental da transferência. A transferência, com efeito, está destinada a dissolver-se no final da cura analítica. É verdade que a psicanálise, na sua técnica, contém sérios problemas; o artigo, porém, mostra como o seu "trabalho" essencial consiste em promover a transformação que o próprio sujeito opera mediante a sua palavra criativa, palavra esta que Ihe proporciona o seu próprio nascimento de si. /// This article tries to evince how the psychoanalytical transference, as a regular product of the therapeutic alliance, is meant to be overcome by a progressive consciousness that the patient acquires of its instrumental character. The transference is destined to be dissolved at the end of the analysis. It is true that psychoanalysis, in its technique, harbours serious problems; its essential « travail » , however, is to promote the transformation that a person realizes through his/her own creative word that pushes him/her to give birth to him/herself.<br>

Abstract: The quest for recognition of subjectivity and human dignity is at the heart of current social activism. Africans have struggled for recognition since they were stripped of human dignity, first by the slave trade and later by colonialism. Their struggle has been revealed essentially through writing and monotheism. This article suggests looking at the performative elaboration of the self. On the continent as well as in the diaspora, the construction of the subjectivity and dignity of the modern African / black person is represented in all its autonomy. The empirical example chosen is that of Central Africa. /// La quête pour la reconnaissance de la subjectivité et la dignité est au coeur des mouvements sociaux actuels. Les Africains se battent pour obtenir la reconnaissance depuis l'époque où la traite des esclaves et plus tard la colonisation les ont dépouillés de leurs qualités humaines. Ces combats ont été essentiellement révélés par l'écriture et le monothéisme. L'article actuel suggère aux lecteurs de considérer la construction performative du moi où la subjectivité Africaine / Noire est représentée dans toute son autonomie. L'exemple empirique proposé est celui de l'Afrique centrale.<br>

Abstract: A partir de la conception de la biographie développée par A. L. Strauss et de la philosophie du temps de G. H. Mead, trois niveaux d'organisation du temps de l'expérience biographique sont mis au jour. D'abord en examinant comment s'articulent l'irréversibilité du temps et le caractère partiellement indéterminé du passé. Toute restitution rétrospective de l'expérience biographique s'inscrit dans ce cadre. Ensuite, ce temps biographique, constitué dans l'après-coup au sein d'interactions avec autrui, se structure principalement autour des événements marquants, lesquels forment le plus souvent un calendrier privé. Mais, avant cela, ces événements ont leur temporalité propre liée à leur parcours sémantique : la constitution du sens de l'événement est ellemême un processus temporel partiellement contingent - la réduction du tranchant de l'événement ne va pas de soi - et la stabilisation d'un sens appropriable par la personne est la condition pour que l'événement qui « a été » ne « soit plus », que Von puisse tourner la page. Out of the conception of biographical time as developed by A. L. Strauss and G. H. Mead's philosophy of time, three levels for organizing the time of biographical experiences come to light. First of all, any retrospective reconstruction of a biographical experience involves examining how time's irreversibility is linked to the partly indeterminate nature of the past. Next, this biographical time, reconstructed afterwards through interactions with others, mainly takes shape around significant events, which usually form a private calendar. Previously however, these events had their own temporality linked to their semantic itinerary : the construction of an event's meaning is itself a partly contingent temporal process — reducing the cutting edge of an event cannot be taken for granted — and the stabilization of a meaning that the person can appropriate is the condition for the event that « was » to be « no longer » , so that one can be able to make af~<br>

Abstract: In this paper a distinction is made between two conceptions of the ego in freudian metapsychology. According to the first conception, a conception which Freud never gave up, the ego is conceived as a specific function on the surface of the living organism ; it is the result of a progressive differentiation of the Id ('Es') under the driving power of internal stimuli and external reality. Fitted with specific neutral, i.e. non-conflictual functions as perception, memory, control of the bodily motions and consciousness, the ego has to defend the individual as a biological living organism against the threats from without and within. In this conception the ego is treated as an instance that doesn't take part in the different psychic conflicts. We analyse the philosophical presuppositions and show the metapsychological disadvantages of this hypothesis that has been worked out especially in the American ego-psychology. According to the second conception, that takes into account important clinical pheno mena as identification, idealisation, narcissism, ideal of the ego, the ego is conceived as a metaphorical effect of a specific psychic act. With Lacan, we try to analyse and to interpret this specific act as an act that causes an infinite splitting in the ego : the ego is constituted as a subject that from its origin is separated from itself. Instead of being a biological function that lives in the immediate metonymical prolongiation of the living organism, it rather has to defend a certain representation of himself. This point of view doesn't exclude a purely functional description of the ego ; but the different functions have now to be interpreted differently because the ego is the effect of conflicts in which it takes part (consciousness is interlaced with unconsciousness, perception with denying...). In the last part of our study we show how Freud makes the philosophically important distinction between the ego as an object of the Id and the ego as a subject that has to~<br>

Abstract: En réaction au libéralisme rawlsien pour qui le droit est référé à la liberté d'action des individus, le mouvement communautarien a voulu référer le droit à l'identité culturelle (individuelle ou collective), lui assignant, ultimement, la fonction de stabiliser cette identité. Pour ces auteurs, le lien entre identité et droit est interne, ce qui ouvre la voie à ce qu'on a appelé « les paradoxes de l'identité démocratique » et conduit à la notion problématique de droits collectifs. On montrera ici comment une telle notion repose sur une « réduction identitaire » , par principe opérée au point de vue objectivant de la troisième personne, privant par là même les acteurs sociaux de leur capacité d'autodétermination, À cette vision anti-libérale dans son fondement, qui fait de la sécurité identitaire son horizon, on opposera la vision d'une identité risquée qui ne préjuge pas dogmatiquement des constituants identitaires de chacun et ouvre ainsi la voie aux authentiques principes de la coexistence multiculturelle. In reaction to Rawlsian liberalism, which relates law to freedom of action, the Communitarian movement wants to relate law to cultural identity (individual or collective), assigning it, ultimately, the function to stabilize this identity. For Communitarianism the relationship between identity and law is internal, which opens the path to what has been called « the paradoxes of democratic identity » , and leads to the problematic notion of « collective rights » . It is shown here how such a notion rests on an « identity-reduction » , which by principle is operated from a third-person perspective, depriving individuals of their capacity of self-determination. In opposition to this fundamentally anti-liberal vision, the notion of an open identity is proposed, which doesn't dogmatically predetermine the identities of everyone and opens therefore the path to the basic principles of a multicultural coexistence.<br>

Abstract: Cet article explore les dynamiques de l'échange communicationnel à l'époque de Stalin et son impact sur la formation de l'opinion. Alors que les journaux, qui présentent leurs auteurs dans un état solitaire de monologue intérieur, révèlent souvent des étendues d'ambiguité et de doute, une communication engagée, particulièrement entre personnes se faisant confiance, est beaucoup plus à même de donner naissance à des jugements et des opinions clairs, ce qui est de la plus haute importance sur le plan de la capacité critique. La riche correspondance personnelle de la famille Kravčenko-Spunde, famille de vieux bolcheviks engagés, montre à quel point un échange ouvert peut susciter et renforcer tant le soutien que la critique la plus âpre du système. Ces documents mettent en lumière un changement majeur, le passage d'un soutien quasi inconditionnel au régime stalinien à sa critique de « fossoyeur de la révolution » , condamnation qui émerge du débat politique tenu dans le cercle étroit de la famille. De plus, la défense d'un bien commun à l'encontre du discours public pousse les discutants à transcender leur cercle restreint et à chercher un contre-public indispensable pour lever le soupçon de particularité qui pèse sur les « biens » défendus au sein de ce cercle et pour confirmer ainsi leur caractère de « bien commun ». La tentative d'élargissement du cercle communicationnel mène à une nouvelle activité dans l'écriture mémorielle qui se propose aussi bien de dévoiler les mensonges du système que de révéler un héritage révolutionnaire distinct de la représentation officielle monopolisée par le régime. L'expérience des relations personnelles pendant la révolution joue un rôle essentiel pour cette revendication dissidente d'un héritage révolutionnaire. Camaraderie et confrontation unie face à l'ennemi pendant la guerre civile doivent être distinguées de l'énonciation et de l'élaboration d'opinions lors de débats publics. Seule cette seconde expérience, basée sur la récipro~<br>

Abstract: Professeur célèbre, reconnu comme un maître, Heidegger s'est pourtant toujours voulu un simple enseigneur, soit un maître sans doctrine, qui n'en est pas moins un maître de lecture et, finalement, un maître d'école, dont la tâche consiste à apprendre les éléments à partir desquels tout s'apprend. Enseignant précisément ces rudiments, à savoir apprendre à écouter d'une part - c'est-à-dire apprendre à dialoguer, donc apprendre à lire et, par là même, apprendre à penser - et apprendre ce qu'apprendre veut dire de l'autre -à savoir prendre connaissance de ce que nous portons en nous, en sorte qu'apprendre, c'est enseigner, et cela parce qu'enseigner, ce n'est ni plus ni moins qu'apprendre -, philosophe, Heidegger apparaît tout autant comme un pédagogue. A well-known professor, acknowledged as a master, Heidegger always took himself but for a mere pedagogue, i.e. a doctrineless master who still remains a master in teaching how to read and, when all is said, a school master whose task, however consists in nothing more than teaching the element wherefrom everything should be learnt. Precisely teaching those rudiments, i.e. on the one hand, teaching how to learn dialogue, hence to learn how to read, hence to learn how to think - and, on the other hand, to learn how to learn means about the other person, i.e. knowing how to come into close touch with what we carry within ourselves, hence learning is teaching since teaching is nothing more or less than learning : Thus Heidegger is also altogether a pedagogue.<br>

Abstract: Cet article (1) présente une réflexion théorique sur la notion de genre, de ses définitions et ses usages en sciences sociales. S'opposant à l'approche dominante qui conçoit le genre comme identité ou attribut socialement construits des personnes, conception qu'elle considère comme essentialisante ou substantialisante, l'auteur argumente en faveur d'une approche relationnelle du genre conçu comme modalité des relations sociales. Elle se fonde pour cela sur des travaux d'anthropologie comparative et historique qui contraignent à reconsidérer le dualisme du moi et du corps constitutif de l'idéologie individualiste de la personne, et critique I'hypostase du Moi comme homoncule constitué à partir d'une absolutisation de la première personne. Analysant le système sexué des trois personnes grammaticales, elle soutient que, n'étant pas référentiel, « le je de l'interlocution n'a ni sexe, ni genre ». Les apports croisés de l'anthropologie et de la philosophie analytique la conduisent à revoir la notion de personne pour mieux penser la capacité proprement humaine de se reconnaître comme d'un sexe sans être jamais assigné à celui-ci. This article presents a theoretical work on the idea of gender, its definitions and uses in social science. The author objects to the mainstream approach that sees gender as an identity or an attribute that some people socially construct. She sees that idea as essentializing or substantializing. She argues in favor of a relational approach of gender conceived as mode of social interactions. Her approach is based on comparative and historical works of anthropologists that lead to consider the dualism of the ego and the body which make the individualistic ideology of a persona, and she criticizes the hypostasis of the ego as homunculus made up from absolutizing the id. Analyzing the gender system of the three grammatical persons, she asserts that, as it is not a reference, the other person's "I" does not have a sex nor a gender. The contributions f~<br>

Author(s): Wiley Douglas<br>
Abstract: This article argues for a synthesis of George Herbert Mead's conception of the temporal and intersubjective nature of the self with Paul Ricoeur's hermeneutic theory of narrative identity. Combining the insights of Ricoeur's philosophical analysis with Mead's social-psychological orientation provides a subtle, sophisticated, and potent explanation of self-identity. A narrative conception of identity implies that subjectivity is neither a philosophical illusion nor an impermeable substance. Rather, a narrative identity provides a subjective sense of self-continuity as it symbolically integrates the events of lived experience in the plot of the story a person tells about his or her life. The utility of this conception of identity is illustrated through a rereading of Erving Goffman's study of the experience of mental patients. This example underlines the social sources of the self-concept and the role of power and politics in the construction of narrative identities.<br>

Abstract: In Unamuno criticism there has been an irresistible temptation to see him as a precursor of some of the later twentieth-century developments in linguistics and literary theory. But a comparison of his ideas on language with those of certain nineteenth-century linguistic philosophers, with whom he was acquainted through his early philological training, shows that his ideas are reworkings of early-nineteenth-century thinkers. Two in particular, Friedrich Schleiermacher and Wilhelm von Humboldt, appear to have exercised a shaping and lasting influence on Unamuno's ideas on language, which he formulated throughout his life. This article considers how Unamuno came across these two thinkers, and compares his and their ideas on language and thought, language and person, language and nation, and language and creativity.<br>

Abstract: The study of early Christian asceticism, which formerly focused strictly on ascetic practices, has been transformed in recent years. In addition to ascetic practices, scholars analyze the discourse of asceticism, which emphasizes the decentering of the self, the problematizing of the person's ability to govern the body and be considered righteous before God. Although this approach has pushed back the origins of ascetic discourses in Christianity, the decentering of the self can be observed in Qumran texts. In the present article this ascetic discourse of the decentered self is traced in other pre-Christian Jewish texts and in an unexpected context-novelistic texts. This approach allows for an exploration of literary, ritual, and ascetic aspects of the texts, and some consideration is given to the social context of these important developments.<br>

Abstract: As a consequence of the systematic use of the French « passé composé » , the style of Albert Camus's best-known novel deviates from the traditional French novel. But it is indeed the basic function of tenses and time adverbs which is deconstructed : actions and events can no longer be located relatively to the time of utterance. The stylistic innovation of the novel cannot be separated from the enunciative choices. The article examines how Albert Camus goes from « La Mort heureuse » (a novel written in the third-person and the French « passé simple » which he never published) to a novel which is a landmark in French fiction. The stylistic choices are studied through a comparison of the opening pages of the two novels and in a fragment of « La Mort heureuse » which Camus takes up again almost literally in « L'Etranger ».<br>

Abstract: Kant's progressive philosophy of history is an integral aspect of his critical system, yet it is often ignored or even treated as an embarrassment by contemporary scholars. In this article, I defend Kant and argue for the continuing relevance of his regulative assumption of historical progress. I suggest, furthermore, that the first-person stance of practical belief exemplified in Kant's conception of hope offers new resources for thinking about the relationship between the ideal and the real in political theory.<br>

Abstract: A broad conceptual framework is presented for utilizing spirituality in group psychotherapy. The author considers (a) selected concepts and theory relevant to the spiritual aspect of psychotherapy practice; (b) the change in assumptions about the person and the group they imply; (c) the mystical aspects of the listening/observing process; and (d) aspects of the new sciences compatible with spiritual principles. Using a psychospiritual paradigm, the author offers a view of group therapy that emphasizes the therapist as a contemporary mystic, the group as a sacred space, and a return to profound, timeless, nonrelativist spiritual values and goals, nonsensory infinite dimensional experience leading to deep transformation of the self, and the compatibility of contemporary scientific frameworks with spiritual principles that can form the basis of new theorizing and group interpretations.<br>

Author(s): Wright Barbara B.<br>
Abstract: This paper analyzes the presenter in advertisements by means of a theoretical framework drawn from literary criticism. The paper adapts literary theory to explore the advertising "who" -- the presenter of a message. It turns to dramaturgy and narratology theory to formulate a trichotomy of advertising "points of view" -- first-person narrator, third-person narrator, and dramatic character. The formal and functional properties of each are discussed with advertising examples. Advertising consequences are illustrated with examples taken from Advertising Age's "Best Advertising of 1989" compilation. These are discussed in terms of media patterns, message strategy, and overall communication objectives. The discussion also suggests the need for additional research to understand hybrid and parody forms.<br>

Abstract: The essay focuses on the term textuality and foliows and comments the changes of its use and meaning. It examines the link between Russian Formalist concept of literariness (mostly Jakobson and Tynianov), its Bakhtinian switch to intertextuality, developed in quite contrastive but distinet ways by Julia Kristeva and Gerard Genette, and finally it interprets the use of the term textuality in Derridian deconstruction and Foucault’s semiotics of the world. The point of the essay is to show the importance of the deconstructive challenge of the traditionally supposed opposition between speech and writing as well as between the world and the seif. Following Hugh Silverman’s concept of the autobiographical textuality, the essay makes attemps to suggest an interpretation of ali Kundera’s writings (both „fiction“ and „essays“) as one undistinguishable textuality without óbvious boundaries of a genre or identity of the person who speaks.<br>

Author(s): Ezzy Douglas<br>
Abstract: Two central unresolved problems in labour process theory are the disjuncture between structure and agency and the problem of what constitutes 'good' work. This paper argues that a hermeneutic conception of the self as constructed through narrative provides a resolution to these two issues. Hermeneutics conceptualises the self as neither a solitary entity impervious to the influence of others, nor as a mere reflection of objective structures or 'discourses of power'. Rather, in the process of self-interpretation a person uses socially learnt cultural discourses to construct and reconstruct a coherent sense of narrative-identity. Substantive illustrations are drawn from labour process theory, recent developments in management theory, and some more general studies of the meaning of working.<br>

Author(s): Fludernik Monika<br>
Abstract: The narratological category "person" needs to be replaced by a different conceptual framework. The traditional distinctions between narrative levels and between story and discourse are inadequate to an explanation of much postmodernist writing. Classic narratological categories correlate with a realist understanding of story and with a realist conceptualization of story telling with some postmodernist techniques of writing, such as second-person fiction, refusing to play by such conceptualizations. Gabriel Josipovici's Contre-jour is an instance of a radical deconstruction of realist parameters. Realist recuperations or naturalizations of intractable writing have to be evaluated as readings against the anti-mimetic grain of such texts, and the possibility of such narrative recuperation does not provide evidence for the reinstatement of traditional narratological distinctions. The failing of current narratology to account for second-person narrative is due to the inapplicability of traditional narratological categories, a break-down that is motivated by the ideological commitments of much postmodernist, and especially second-person, fiction since these deliberately question realistic frames of cognition and story understanding.<br>

Abstract: Le texte récuse l'opinion selon laquelle la métaphore ne se paraphrase pas. La paraphrase est censée ne rendre que la référence, non le sens d'une expression. Afin de montrer que la paraphrase peut bien intervenir au sens d'une métaphore, le personnage fictif est invoqué comme paradigme pour la constitution du sens. L'entité de sens qu'est un personnage fictif ç est pas réductible à une expression unique, mais dépend de l'interaction au sein d'un réseau d'expressions différentes. Si le sens de la métaphore se constitue de manière analogue, force est de conclure que la reformulation ne relève ni de l'aplatissement ni de la distorsion, mais qu'elle est constitutive du sens. The paper argues against the common assumption that metaphors cannot be paraphrased. Paraphrase is assumed to capture only the reference not the meaning of an expression. In order to show that a paraphrase may well concern the meaning of a metaphor, the case of fictive persons is considered as a paradigm for meaning constitution. The meaning entity that a fictive person constitutes is not reducible to a single expression but depends upon the interaction within a network of different expressions. If the meaning of metaphors is constituted in an analogous way, it must be asserted that reformulations neither trivialize nor distort their meaning but constitute it.<br>

Abstract: Selon la philosophie moderne la pensée est une production de la subjectivité, la volonté est une auto-détermination et le temps est une auto-affection. Kierkegaard offre une autre compréhension de la vie volontaire en envisageant une volonté brisée par le prochain, par le temps et par Dieu. La patience n'est pas pour Kierkegaard un accident de notre caractère, mais la condition pour devenir une personne. Cela suppose de laisser de côté toute compréhension purement psychologique de la patience. La vraie persévérance s'oppose totalement à l'obsession de se blinder par rapport au monde. Entre l'endurance stoïcienne et la patience chrétienne comme patience dans l'espérance il n'y a pas d'essence commune. Kierkegaard montre que la patience de l'amour est une passivité qui est la voie du salut. For modem philosophy meaning is a product of subjectivity, will is a self-determination, and time is a self-affection. Kierkegaard gives us another meaning for a voluntary life by considering desire that is broken by the will of another man, time and God. Patience is not for Kierkegaard an accident of character but is the condition to becoming a person. It is necessary to ignore a purely psychological understanding of patience. True perseverance is radically opposed to an obsessive existence blinded to the world. Between the stoic conception of endurance and Christian patience there is no common essence. For Kierkegaard, the patience of love is a form of passivity that can save Mankind.<br>

Abstract: A ideia de máquina ultrapassa as suas concretizações materiais sugerindo um certo tipo de objetividade e autonomia, inerente ao funcionamento de sistemas como o Direito. A conceção do Direito como uma espécie de máquina jurídica é ambivalente, mostrando tanto a imparcialidade do Direito como as suas perversões anti-humanas. A relação entre mente e corpo é central no Direito da responsabilidade, sugerindo, porém, uma máquina humana em que a responsabilidade corresponde apenas a uma técnica de preservação de um sistema. A pessoa, todavia, não tem de ser reduzida a um algoritmo como diz Penrose. É a configuração do objeto do Direito que o reduz a um funcionamento limitado e incapaz de uma justiça criativa. A redefinição do objeto humano no Direito reclama um novo pensamento, associado aos conhecimentos não jurídicos sobre o comportamento humano. The idea of machine exceeds its material embodiments suggesting a certain kind of objectivity and autonomy inherent to the functioning of systems such as Law. The conception of Law as a kind of legal machine is ambivalent, showing both the impartiality of the law as their anti-human perversions. The relationship between mind and body is central to the law of responsibility, even though suggesting a human machine on which liability is merely a technique for preserving a system. The person, however, need not be reduced to an algorithm as Penrose says. It is the configuration of the object of knowledge as a system identical to a machine and the subjects of norms as human machines which reduces it to a limited and incapable of running a creative justice. The redefinition of the human object in Law calls for a new thinking, not necessary associated with the legal knowledge about human behavior.<br>

Abstract: In Britain, as in France, 'mainstream' anthropologists were hesitant to acknowledge studies within their own country as proper subjects for anthropological enquiry. British social anthropology defined itself as the study of 'other cultures' and became entrenched in a tradition in which Otherness was confused with manifest difference. This naivete, elevated into a scientific principle, precluded the recognition of 'self as anything other than a scientific instrument; but also led to the invention of a generalisable Other, and thereby ignored the complexity of variation within the cultures it studied. By the same token, it blinded anthropologists to heterogeneity within their 'own' local cultures as well, and was finally changed only by a series of related paradigm leaps. Our understanding of culture changed from a set of prescriptive influences which integrated society, to a ragged and non-systemic array of interpretive tools which aggregated society. Consequent upon this change, symbols were acknowledged as vehicles of expression and of negotiable meaning rather than as having stipulated and invariant referents. The demise of modernist theories liberated anthropology from its scientific illusions and positivistic pretensions, enabling it to acknowledge the personal and speculative nature of the enterprise. This admission of the subjective, of the anthropologist's self, was necessary in order to see Otherness as inhering in 'person' rather than in an abstraction such as 'culture' and, therefore, to be enabled to recognise diversity within cultures rather than merely between them. This enhanced perception of internal heterogeneity clearly places the Self of the anthropologist at the centre of the stage and has led to the contemporary debates about the nature of ethnographic writing and the status of ethnographic 'authority'. It has also had obvious consequences for anthropological research, including the raising anew of the relationship of individual to society; and t~<br>

Abstract: Theories of recognition provide an understanding of selfhood as based on narrative identity. In striking up and maintaining a relationship with the Other through telling my story, I am acknowledged as a conversation partner and as a self, endowed with a personal history and biographical experience. The driving force of this process is the hope or struggle for recognition, for being seen and acknowledged by the Other. This essay uses Paul Ricoeur's concept of recognition to read fictional first-person narration as a scenario of encounter between narrator and addressee. It draws from narrative psychology, autobiography theory, and narratological concepts of reader positioning to consider how readers encounter a fictional narrator. The relevance of such a reception-based model is illustrated by revisiting two classics of twentieth-century American literature featuring narrators who raise their voices from the margins: J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye and Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man. By reading these novels as narratives of recognition, I argue that the rise to iconic status of the narrators, Holden Caulfield and the Invisible Man, can be related to the intense scenario of address that calls readers to recognize these fictional tellers.<br>

Abstract: Fondé en 1945, Réforme offre un réel pluralisme politique et il se présente plutôt comme le journal où les intellectuels protestants sont en mesure de s'exprimer. En face de la Guerre d'Algérie, il possède une ligne politique générale que l'on appelle alors « libérale », c'est-à-dire favorable à une évolution progressive, qui n'écarte pas l'idée, à long terme, d'une indépendance de l'Algérie où les Français pourraient continuer à vivre. À partir de 1958, son directeur, A. Finet, fait confiance au général de Gaulle pour résoudre le problème ; mais une partie de ses rédacteurs sont nettement plus à gauche, sans négliger, pour autant, la détresse des Français d'Algérie. The review Réforme, founded in 1945, offers a genuine variety of political views, and sees itself as the forum where Protestant intellectuals can express themselves. Confronted with the Algerian War, it adopted a general political stance then known as "liberal", that is to say, in favour of gradual evolution which would not exclude, in the long term, the idea of independence for an Algeria in which the French could continue to live. From 1958 on its director, A. Finet, put his faith in General de Gaulle as the person to solve the problem ; but some of his editorial colleagues were distinctly more left-wing, without however ignoring the distress of the Algerian French. Die 1945 gegründete Wochenzeitung Réforme (Reformation) bietet politisch einen wirklichen Pluralismus und bietet den protestantischen Intellektuellen die Möglichkeit, ihre Meinung zu äußern. Zum Algerienkrieg hat « Réforme » eine allgemeine politische Linie, die man damah « liberal » nannte, nämlich dass eine langsame Entwicklung angestrebt wurde, die auch die Unabhängigkeit Algeriens, in dem die Franzosen weiterhin leben könnten, nicht ausschloss. Der Direktor von « Réforme » , A. Finet, vertraut ab 1958 General de Gaulle, dass er eine Lösung finden könnte, während einige Redakteure des Blatts eine deutlich linke Position einnehmen, ohne ~<br>

Abstract: Psychology has uncritically adopted the individual person as its object of study without examining the concept and role of personhood within contemporary society and Western culture more generally. We examine three perspectives that challenge this familiar and unexamined object of our disciplinary inquiry: (1 ) Critical Theory's concept of the bourgeois individual as psychology's subject of ideology; (2) Poststructuralism's challenge to the concept of personhood as an integrated and self-present center of consciousness and action; (3) System Theory's alternative epistemology in which relations rather than entities have primacy. Each perspective introduces a concept of personhood that significantly differs from our present understanding of psychology's subject and that lays the foundation for a new subject of psychological inquiry: a multicentered, multidimensional subject.<br>

Abstract: Since much of modern discourse, extending from cognitivism to connectionism, has been greatly inclined to look at human behavior in relation to processes where the subjective factor plays little if any causal role, it would not be inaccurate to say that the person has been left with but a trivial part to play in the overall script. The intent of this paper is to address this theoretical disproportionality by offering a more symmetrical account of creativity — one that reconsiders the reconstructive nature and generative capabilities of the person while not ignoring the contributions of technical and scientific thought.<br>

Abstract: Où situer le danger ? Qui court un risque et qui le fait courir à qui ? Il s'agit de présenter deux analyses inverses de la notion de danger. Leur originalité tient au fait qu'il ne semble pas y avoir pour elles d'équité ou de réciprocité dans le danger: la menace vient exclusivement d'un côté de la relation. Pour Hegel, c'est le moi qui est l'objet de menaces. L'auteur de ces menaces est toujours l'autre, celui que je ne suis pas, et c'est précisément son altérité qui en fait une puissance dont je peux craindre la violence. C'est pourquoi la vérité – et la sécurité – se trouve toujours du côté de la réduction de la transcendance de l'autre. Pour cette raison, Levinas affirme qu'il n'y a pas d'autre dans la philosophie de Hegel, absence qu'il analyse justement comme un danger: c'est l'autre qui court un risque, et la menace vient de moi. La menace n'émane plus de l'étrangeté de l'autre, mais au contraire de la suppression de cette étrangeté. Ce qu'il est à craindre est, pour Hegel, que l'autre mette la main sur moi, et, pour Levinas, que je mette la main sur l'autre. Where is the danger? Who is at risk and who is a menace to whom? This article presents two opposite analyses of the notion of danger. Their originality lies in the fact that there seems to be no fairness or reciprocity in danger: the threat comes exclusively from one side of the relationship. For Hegel, oneself is always the object of threats. The source of these threats is always the other person, the one I am not, and it is precisely the other's alterity which is a force whose violence I should fear. That is why truth - and security – are always to be found in reducing the transcendence of the other. For this reason, Levinas claims that there is not an other in the philosophy of Hegel, an absence which he analyses as a danger; it's the other who is at risk, and the threat comes from me. The threat no longer emanates from the strangeness of the other, but, on the contrary, from the suppression of this ~<br>

Abstract: La sociobiologie, née au cours des années 1970 dans le cadre des théories darwiniennes, a été déclarée persona non grata en France pour des raisons essentiellement idéologiques. Elle a pourtant suscité outre-Atlantique de fructueux débats entre diverses disciplines ; la théologie comprise. Celle-ci ne peut rester indifférente aux propos des scientifiques sur la place occupée par le sentiment religieux dans l'évolution humaine ou encore par les comportements de survie et d'altruisme que l'espèce humaine partage avec le reste du vivant. Elle est ainsi invitée à poursuivre sa propre découverte de la personne humaine, comme sujet éthique et créature divine. Sociobiology, born during the 1970's in the context of Darwinism, was declared persona non grata in France for reasons basically ideological. It has however given rise to fruitful discussion in the United States between various disciplins including Theology. This latter cannot go on ignoring scientists' declarations on the place of religious sense in human evolution, or that of survival behaviour and altruism that the human species shares with the rest of the living world. Thus is Theology called to pursue its own discovery of the human person as ethical subject and divine creature.<br>

Abstract: Le témoin n'est ni un spectateur, ni un propriétaire, ni un conservateur, ni un producteur, ni un juge, mais il est celui qui accueille ce qui se donne à lui et se reçoit de cette épreuve d'une altérité irréductible. La force des analyses de Kierkegaard est de montrer que l'élucidation de l'essence du témoignage, qui conduit à la substitution du témoin au je, ne peut être séparée d'une elucidation de l'essence de la vérité. La vérité n'étant pas ce que je produis, mais ce qui me touche et m'éclaire, le témoignage se donne comme une communication directe-indirecte qui consiste à dire la vérité tout en l'existant Exister c'est témoigner en faisant de sa vie une tâche dans la passion essentielle de la vérité. En cela seul le témoignage chrétien révèle véritablement l'essence du témoignage puisque seul il donne vraiment à voir le saut du témoignage, qui conduit à ne pas se contenter de persister dans l'être pour s'ouvrir à la possibilité de devenir tout autre en s'abandonnant à la vérité et en acceptant de souffrir pour elle dans le monde. Dans cette philosophie du témoignage, le témoin devient alors le vrai nom de la personne contre l'abstraction du sujet-substance. A witness is neither a spectator, a proprietor, a preservator, a producer nor a judge, he is the one that receives what is given to him and who, from this test of irreducible alterity, receives himself. The strength of Kierkegaard's analyses is in showing that the elucidation of the essence of witnessing, which leads to the witness being substituted to the "I-myself", is inseparable from the elucidation of the essence of truth. Truth being not what I make but what marks and enlightens me, witnessing is given to be a direct-indirect communication which consists of saying the truth while being it. To be is to give witness by making one's life a task in the essential passion of truth. For this, Christian witness alone truly reveals the essence of witnessing for it alone truly allows one to see the leap of witn~<br>

Author(s): WiedemannAbstract: Since antiquity, Sallust has been said to have modeled his historiography after Thucydides. Focusing on the voice of the narrator, this article draws attention to an aspect that distinguishes Sallust from Thucydides and reminds us more of Herodotus. While Thucydides's narrative seems to unravel itself, Sallust makes his presence as narrator strongly felt by first-person interventions and expressions of uncertainty (I). Moreover, he integrates other voices at the extradiegetic level (II). These features of Sallust's voice give his account a strong mimetic aspect, underscore his reliability and engage the readers in the "act of reading."<br>

Abstract: This paper is an advocacy for the employment of psychoanalytical concepts within sociological theorizing about the individual. Through an exposition of Freud's views on the development of intra-psychic structure and a critique of Parson's reduction of psychoanalysis to a branch of learning theory, I attempt to show that the sociological approach to the individual is implicitly behavioural and imprisoned in a series of assumptions which, among other things, treats subjectivity as epiphenomenal and identity as an unmediated reflection of some external reality. In contrast, psychoanalysis presents to us a picture of the individual as flawed and ambivalent in his relation to society, formed by but at odds with the demands of culture. In particular, the psychoanalytic concept of identification reveals that the acquisition of identity is a hard-won achievement marked by the renunciation of lost and forbidden objects. I argue, following Freud and Lacan, that the ego, far from being an agency of reason, somehow directly 'plugged into' reality, constitutes itself in the fantasied image of another and that the quality of this identification crucially affects the way the world is experienced and believed by the individual. This argument is elaborated through a discussion of Peter Berger's remarks on the social causes of identity crisis which, when set against the work of object-relations theorists on those suffering from disturbances of identity such as, for example, schizoid personalities, are shown to be both superficial and misleading. I conclude the paper by arguing that while psychoanalysis can enhance our understanding of the way in which the individual is formed by and through culture it also cautions us against making simple generalizations about the impact of culture upon the person, showing that the individual never submits himself unequivocally to its demands and interdicts.<br>

Abstract: In this article, I use Obeyesekere's concept of the work of culture to examine a case of magical poisoning among the Toraja (South Sulawesi, Indonesia). I argue that episodes of suffering must be situated not only culturally but also within the context of the individual sufferer's life experience, and suggest that we must consider carefully why only certain symbolic transformations of painful emotions may "work" for a given individual, why a symbolic transformation that "works" for one person may not for another, and why even apparently successful transformations of suffering may bring only temporary relief.

Abstract: Studies of gender in the XIX century have privileged women writers. To approach these discourses there are several theories in the literary and feminist fields. However, this incidence of class, race, sex in gender relations and in the formation of feminine subjectivities is a theme which has been less studied. In this article I aim to relate these concepts with a focus on Black and Brown-skinned slaves, without abandoning the wider social interpretation. The written sources on this issue are fragmentary, in addition to distortions suffered by the interpretation of a third person: public prosecutor, liquidator of slaves, scribe and even historians and editors who participated in the organization of these written sources. The study presented deals with the processes of transformation of gender relations and feminine subjectivities with the unusual increase in the number of slaves in the nineteenth century Cuban.<br>

Abstract: David Jenkins persistently recommended that in reading the Bible the reader has always to ask ‘How did people think then which led them to put it like that?’ He provided the following as an example. The writers of the gospels lived at a time when demon possession was the available conceptuality if a person fell to the ground writhing and foaming at the mouth. In the Middle Ages, the conceptuality within which explanation arose was that of the humours of the body and the cure would have been blood-letting. In medicalized 21st century conceptuality, it would be said that the person was having an epileptic fit and the needed response is to keep calm and re-assure.<br>

Abstract: This paper scrutinizes the fundamental assumption governing Gunther Teubner's theory of societal constitutionalism, namely that societal constitutions are ultimately about the regulation of inclusion and exclusion in global function systems. While endorsing the central role of inclusion/exclusion in constitutions, societal or otherwise, I argue that inclusion and exclusion are primordial categories of collective action, rather than functional categories. As a result, the self-closure which gives rise to a legal collective is spatial as much as it is temporal, and subjective no less than material. Inasmuch as legal orders must establish who ought to do what, where, and when, this entails, or so I argue, that any legal order we could imagine—including a global legal order such as cyberlaw—is necessarily bounded in space, time, content, and membership. This impinges directly on the inclusion/exclusion difference: that there can be no inclusion without exclusion entails, most fundamentally, that there can be no (il)legality without alegality, i.e. comportment that contests, sometimes radically, how a legal order draws the distinction between legality and illegality. In this fundamental sense, all legal orders have an outside—literally. Building on this insight, I suggest that the functional cosmopolitanism advocated by a theory of societal constitutionalism retains a residue of the logic of totalization it seeks to overcome. I conclude by exploring how a first-person plural theory of law both supports and transforms the insight that constitutions regulate the inclusion/exclusion difference by putting into place constitutive and limitative rules.<br>

Abstract: An alternative optic on contemporary writing becomes available if we look back to Latin America nearly one hundred years ago. At the same time as the “Cannibalist Manifesto” was being written and circulated in Brazil, the polemic surrounding the reception of the Spanish-speaking poetic vanguard clustered around three major issues: the significance of technique; the existence of genuine novelty in avant-garde poetry; and creative sincerity and profundity.
         
               Consider, alongside the “Cannibalist Manifesto,” another, earlier founding document of Latin American letters, a short text by José Martí. Martí, an originator of54
            modernismoand a revolutionary leader in the Cuban struggle for independence, introduced a late nineteenth-century volume of his poems with a prose piece that declares, “These are my verses. I borrowed them from no one.”
               He continues:55
            
               Martí invokes Aristotelian mimesis as crucial to the writing of a poem: in this tale of literary composition, the writer filters reality and imagination and copies his perceptions onto the page. Yet the process of “copying” does not introduce any falsehood or deception. Quite to the contrary, Martí stakes out a poetics of sincerity and authenticity rooted in his own physical person, springing from his “own blood” rather than intellectual abstraction or a hodgepodge of combinatoric procedures. Martí states that the writer himself serves as his own warrant of truth, his own guarantor, because he has acquired knowledge through sensory experience (“None of them has emerged from my mind, warmed over, artful and beautified; they have come like tears springing from the eyes or blood spurting out from a wound…. I did not stitch together bits of this and that, but cut deep into myself. These poems emerged written not in academic ink but in my own blood. Whatever I place on view here I once have seen (
            Ihave seen it: me), and I have seen much~<br>

Abstract: Fitzgerald uses several tools to create
      the nostalgic aesthetic of Gatsby. The plot is fundamentally analeptic in construction (told in flashbacks), while the narration is subsequent (narratedafterthe main story takes place). The narrator, Nick Carraway, fits the definition of a homodiegetic perspective (a narrator who is also part of the story he tells): as countless commentaries have discussed, Nick is a distanced observer, retelling the events of the summer of 1922 in first-person singular, infusing through his commentary value into their importance, a technique that creates a distinct “now” and “then” between the time of the story and the time of the narration. Additionally, theorderof the narration is not chronological but jumps back and forth in time in order to support the emotional experience of inner time instead of clock time.
            Furthermore, the choice of words in2
         The Great Gatsbyis often undeniably romantic, alluding to Keats or simply evoking nostalgic sentiments using romantic conventions: “For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face” (Gatsby14). This essay will not deal with all of Fitzgerald's nostalgic strategies in his most famous novel but will focus on one particular and highly original method: the use of the reader's textual memory in order to create a nostalgic experience within the text as an enhancement of the novel's nostalgic themes.<br>

Abstract: Are we in the position to provide him with answers to his bewildering questions? Do we know where his wife and children are? These questions are designed to put us on the spot and to embarrass us. In our helplessness, we might be tempted to point fingers. We know that the major culprits in the war are the warlords who may have conscripted his boys and killed his wife. But knowing the names of the warlords is not enough. That is not even what the speaker or the poet demands of us. The search, the questions addressed to an unnamed passerby, one whom the speaker calls friend, is an open invitation to the reader to take the place of this distraught questioner. It is an ethical call to empathize in the manner that Primo Levi urged in the epigraphic poem above. By switching perspectives, which is exactly what empathy achieves, by putting ourselves in the position of the sufferer, or, in this case, the grieving person, we begin to understand the devastation so completely as to be compelled to prevent its recurrence. This, to me, is at the core of Jabbeh Wesley's poetics of testimony. She foresees that anyone capable of fully experiencing another's pain will not likely stand by and allow that pain to be inflicted on others. It is true that the human tendency toward aggression offers no assurance that such shifts of perspective will prevent anyone from inflicting more pain on others. Yet the writer hopes that much can be achieved by keeping the consciousness of the human condition alive.<br>

Furthermore, this fabulous fantasy of painless death disavows the reality that we don't know how to define what constitutes consciousness of death because firsthand testimony is impossible. As long as Lawrence Brewer, recently executed in Texas, goes out snoring as if in a sound sleep (which he apparently did), at some level we can reassure ourselves that his death is the least cruel, most usual, and perhaps even the most desired, namely, dying in his sleep.<br>

Abstract: Here is a final evocation of the unique nonsortal essence, which implicitly, I believe, argues for a nonsortal sense of oneself, works against the temptation to see “I” as merely a numerical individuation comparable to two identical peas, and thus also suggests a filled significant or existential-moral meaning for the question of nonsortal individuality.
            
                  It perhaps is to be found first in Leibniz and then in the formulation in C. S. Pierce and John M. E. McTaggart, but I will share Roderick Chisholm's version of it with you.32
               
                  What is at stake here is not whether memory is essential for identifying by way of criteria oneself throughout time but, rather, whether there is a nonsortal loose and odd sense of oneself and one's identity that may be more basic and may persist in the absence of memory—as the basis for our proper strong sense of having an identifying knowledge of ourselves. We may consider that even prior to such a thought experiment as I here propose we are already perhaps familiar with the small child's ability to make first-person references without having an arsenal of identifying properties that the parent and others have, for example, regarding his physiognomy, voice timbre, kind, lineage, gender, kinship, ethnicity, nationality, and so on and so forth. And we are more or less familiar with real or imagined cases of the amnesiac who says “I” and yet does not know who in the world she is; that is, she is bereft of any identifying properties but still achieves “I” inerrantly.33<br>

Abstract: Four years later I was in Munich reading
         Theory of Communicative Actionand defending it in, among all places,Der Spiegel.Spiegelhad published a terrible review of the book shortly after it came out in 1981, and I awoke one morning finding myself banging out a critique of the review. My German friends informed me that contrary to U.S. procedure, one should attack not the person who wrote the review but the magazine that published it. My general line as I recall it was thatSpiegelwas so utterly incompetent that it hired a person to review the book who hadn't the slightest capacity to understand it. This, of course, was not untrue.Spiegel, the master of journalistic irony, must have loved my reaction because just two weeks after the review appeared it published my commentary along with others under the byline taken from my contribution, “Nicht begreifen,” he didn't get it.<br>

Abstract: There are perceptible changes in the orientation of SPEP papers in the 1960s. The eleven papers from the first two programs that James Edie edited and published in 1965 range within the phenomenological/existential area from issues of perception, lifeworld, and Husserlian horizons to authentic existence, solitude, and avoidance of the void.
         
               The next three meetings broadened the range of topics considerably by featuring papers that connected phenomenology to artificial intelligence, natural science, linguistics, schizophrenia, body image, social roles, tragedy, the experience of the holy, Hume, Kant, and Wittgenstein. A new person in the European scene, Jacques Derrida, was invited to the fifth conference, but he was unable to attend (he sent a mimeographed copy of his paper that was available in French for those at the conference who might wish to read it).1<br>

Abstract: I think that what Meillassoux calls “correlationism” is a red herring and, since this is his root complaint, the new realism is the fruit of a poisoned tree. Even in the case of Husserl—there are statements in Husserl that have left us all wondering—the best scholarship today has made it plain that Husserl is not serving up metaphysical idealism but, rather, a theory of what sorts of acts are necessary on the part of the subject in order that objects may appear to the subject.
            
                  Objects do not drop from the sky—and that goes for scientific objects.28
               
                  But the history of phenomenology after Husserl, especially nervous about pure transcendental phenomenology, mounted a sustained insistence on the reality of our being-in-the-world, to adopt the formulation of a young sometime Catholic Aristotelian realist named Heidegger, to which Merleau-Ponty added later on that being-in-the-world is a radically incarnational phenomenon. Levinas made an argument for the radical alterity—read irreducible “reality”—of the other person. Interestingly enough the new realists will sometimes cite Levinas's “reversal” of intentionality and his plea for radical “exteriority” as a residual trace of a quickly evaporating realism among the phenomenologists.29
               
                  When faced with the charge that deconstruction has locked us all within the prison house of language, Derrida replied, a bit nonplussed, that everything he has to say concerns the “other” of language and hence represents a discourse on the real.30

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.46.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 1998<br>
Abstract: The concept of public memory has brought with it the idea that human agency permeates the entire process of historical interpretation, representation, and appropriation. For good or ill, the emergence of memory as an analytical category has extended the right to participate in this process of representation beyond the professional historian. As Carl Becker presciently noted in a 1932 American Historical Society address, every person has become a historian. Agents contributing to the process of public memory include historical personages (e.g., George Washington, Harriet Tubman, or your suffragist great-great-grandmother), the contemporaries that produced and preserved their historical records, historians who fix and “objectify” the historical record, teachers who use historical texts in their classrooms, politicians and activists who advocate for inclusion of certain versions of history, community leaders who critique faulty historical representations, children who learn and read about individuals from long ago, and many more. Each of these agents contributes to the process of public memory creation and circulation in a different way, sometimes performing various roles simultaneously. It is clear that these many agents are related through their involvement in this process. But how, precisely, are they connected? I have suggested that the agential spiral may help us begin to answer that question.<br>

Journal Title: Shaw<br>
Article Title: Bernard Shaw and Paul Ricoeur<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>

Abstract: Furthermore, like Ricoeur, Shaw rejects the Pauline concepts of original sin and vicarious atonement. We enter the world spotless, Shaw believes, and no gentleman—Shaw's shorthand for the virtuous person, male or female—would ever allow an innocent other to pay for her misdeeds. The crux is not to ignorantly transgress to the heart's content and then brazenly appeal to a sacrificial scapegoat to wash away the dirt with unblemished blood and tears. Rather, as Jesus proclaims, the recalcitrant should have a change of heart and sin no more. For Shaw, “Christ stands in the world for that intuition of the highest humanity that we, being members of one another, must not complain, must not scold, must not strike, nor revile nor persecute nor revenge nor punish.”
         
               What most intrigues and inspires Shaw about Jesus is not his purported special status in the cosmic order among adherents of traditional Christianity, but the type of person he embodies in the flesh. Thus, he is, as Ricoeur views him, a paradigmatic metaphor, a timeless “intuition” in the Shavian lexicon, of precisely the kind of exemplary individual Shaw believes every child has the capacity to become in its maturity: a reverent adult who heeds Micah's (6:8)44
            
               admonition to do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with your God.45
            
               In Shaw's (as well as Ricoeur's) eyes, there is no means of remedying the world's ills other than discovering practical and compassionate ways of implementing politically the core of Jesus's message, which he takes to be the basic principles of Fabian socialism.46

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: To delve into the foundations of some of these views, the most obvious representative is Kenneth Burke—who is a veritable field of study in himself. Because he has been so foundational and influential in contemporary rhetorical studies, it will serve my purpose (that is, to introduce rhetorical studies to utopists) only to comment on the utopian aspects of his work. Like many others in rhetorical studies and utopian studies, Burke is difficult to pigeonhole in a single discipline. His ideas have been used in literary criticism, political theory, sociology, and all manner of textual and cultural studies. Burke saw rhetoric as having a curative and peacekeeping function at its best and as the root cause of war at its worst. Symbols, he argues in
         A Rhetoric of Motives(1950), are tools that cause people to identify with others individually or in groups. The concept has Freudian roots: When one person identifies with another person, or with a particular cause or country, that person becomes consubstantially one with the other person or cause. Rhetoric, for Burke, is this process of identification, which he says does not replace the classical notion of persuasion but, rather, expands it for modern understanding. The utopian aspect of his thought has to do with the integration of dialectic, rhetoric, and poetic myth in a function of discourse that he called “dialectical-rhetorical transcendence.” This process was most recently explored by James Zappen.
