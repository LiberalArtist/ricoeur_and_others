  CHAPTER 2  Exploring the Distinctiveness of Neo-Latin Jesuit Didactic Poetry in Naples: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1163/j.ctt1w76ttq">Exploring Jesuit Distinctiveness</a><br>
  Author(s) Schindler Claudia<br>
  Abstract: The Jesuit Nicolò Partenio Giannettasio (1648–1715) was one of the most intriguing and influential authors of seventeenth-century Naples.¹ Born in 1648, in Parthenope (i.e., Naples), as he used to call his home city, he entered the Jesuit order at the age of sixteen, having lost his family during the plague of 1656. Like other members of the Society of Jesus, Giannettasio was a highly educated man with a wide range of interests: he studied Scholastic philosophy at Palermo, taught mathematics at the Collegio Massimo in Naples for more than ten years, traveled in Egypt,² and designed the Santa Maria<br>

  Book Title: Mimetic Theory and World Religions-  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Schenk Richard<br>
  Abstract: Those who anticipated the demise of religion and the advent of a peaceful, secularized global village have seen the last two decades confound their predictions. René Girard's mimetic theory is a key to understanding the new challenges posed by our world of resurgent violence and pluralistic cultures and traditions. Girard sought to explain how the Judeo-Christian narrative exposes a founding murder at the origin of human civilization and demystifies the bloody sacrifices of archaic religions. Meanwhile, his book
      Sacrifice, a reading of conflict and sacrificial resolution in the Vedic Brahmanas, suggests that mimetic theory's insights also resonate with several non-Western religious and spiritual traditions. This volume collects engagements with Girard by scholars of Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism and situates them within contemporary theology, philosophy, and religious studies.<br>

  Girard and the Feminist Critique of Religion: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1vjqqj6">Mimetic Theory and World Religions</a><br>
  Author(s) Reineke Martha<br>
  Abstract: After thirty years, as feminist theories in the philosophy of religion, theology, and religious studies approach middle age, on what basis can we reflect on Girard and that feminist critique? Surely, we would most productively move forward were we to home in on aspects of feminist theorizing about religion that have maintained the most saliency. Moreover, feminist theorists of religion would most productively engage Girard in dialogue were they to share with him a sense of urgency about the world that he has conveyed in his most recent works, especially in
                  Battling to the End. On both counts, an observation<br>

  Book Title: Intellectual Sacrifice and Other Mimetic Paradoxes-  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Bubbio Paolo Diego<br>
  Abstract: Intellectual Sacrifice and Other Mimetic Paradoxesis an account of Paolo Diego Bubbio's twenty-year intellectual journey through the twists and turns of Girard's mimetic theory. The author analyzes philosophy and religion as "enemy sisters" engaged in an endless competitive struggle and identifies the intellectual space where this rivalry can either be perpetuated or come to a paradoxical resolution. He goes on to explore topics ranging from arguments for the existence of God to mimetic theory's post-Kantian legacy, political implications, and capacity for identifying epochal phenomena, such as the crisis of the self, in popular culture. Bubbio concludes by advocating for an encounter between mimetic theory and contemporary philosophical hermeneutics-an encounter in which each approach benefits and is enriched by the resources of the other. The volume features a previously unpublished letter by René Girard on the relationship between philosophy and religion.<br>

  CHAPTER 2  Historical Forms of Mystification from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1ws7x0t">Intellectual Sacrifice and Other Mimetic Paradoxes</a><br>
  Abstract: In the previous chapter, we saw that for Girard the Gospels are not mythical texts, but the greatest form of demystification of mimetic victimage. In the Gospels there is no kind of confrontation with philosophy, understood as a discipline based on rational investigation. That confrontation rather takes place in the Pauline texts, where “knowledge of God” (σοφίᾳ τοῦ Θεοῦ) is contrasted with “worldly knowledge” (σοφία τοῦ κόσμου) (1 Corinthians 1:20). The former is the knowledge of God that was revealed first in the Old Testament and then by means of Christ; this must be the object of

  Conclusion from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1ws7x0t">Intellectual Sacrifice and Other Mimetic Paradoxes</a><br>
  Abstract: In the preceding chapter we considered the possibility of a non-sacrificial knowledge and, even if with many caveats, we resolved that question in the affirmative. There is still one dimension of Girard’s mimetic theory, however, that in our journey through the history of the relationship between philosophy and religion we have not yet adequately examined: the “apocalyptic” dimension.<br>

  Mimetic Theory and Hermeneutic Communism from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1ws7x0t">Intellectual Sacrifice and Other Mimetic Paradoxes</a><br>
  Abstract: In the last fifteen years, Girard has engaged in a dialogue with the Italian philosopher Gianni Vattimo. Vattimo is famous for a philosophical approach named
                  pensiero debole(weak thought). “Weak thought” is basically concerned with arguing for philosophical antifoundationalism: drawing on the philosophy of Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Gadamer, Vattimo advocates the rejection of metaphysics and a reinterpretation of truth as the opening of horizons. Vattimo has explained that he came to recognize a “completion” of Heidegger in Girard by reading “the weakening of Being as its sole form of manifesting itself beyond metaphysical oblivion” as “an analogon of the dissolution<br>

  The Self in Crisis from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1ws7x0t">Intellectual Sacrifice and Other Mimetic Paradoxes</a><br>
  Abstract: Research work in the humanities in general, and in philosophy in particular, is today looked at with a certain degree of suspicion, for various, and sometimes even opposed, reasons. On one hand, work on subtle epistemological questions and/or historical analysis of the thought of past philosophers is regarded as a navel-gazing activity, otiose at best, wasteful at worst. On the other hand, when philosophy and intellectual analysis come to focus on popular culture phenomena, such as comics, movies, and TV programs, they are regarded as trivializing ideas and as committing themselves to marginal and eventually unimportant work. One possible solution<br>

  The Gender of Rhetoric, Reason, and Realism from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt5q8">Post-Realism</a><br>
  Author(s) Peterson V. Spike<br>
  Abstract: This chapter argues that moving beyond realism—to post-realism—requires moving beyond the gender-blindness of conventional accounts.¹ My argument weaves together areas of inquiry that are usually treated in isolation. Intellectual developments associated with the rise of systematic inquiry in ancient Greece—marked by the shift from rhetoric to philosophy and its foundational dichotomies of reason over affect, mind over body—comprise one area of inquiry. Another is the study of historical-political developments—the shift to centralized authority and its dichotomies of public over private, civilized over “other”—within which Western science and political theory “emerged.” A third area of<br>

  Book Title: For René Girard-Essays in Friendship and in Truth<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Williams James G.<br>
  Abstract: In his explorations of the relations between the sacred and violence, René Girard has hit upon the origin of culture-the way culture began, the way it continues to organize itself. The way communities of human beings structure themselves in a manner that is different from that of other species on the planet.Like Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, Émile Durkheim, Martin Buber, or others who have changed the way we think in the humanities or in the human sciences, Girard has put forth a set of ideas that have altered our perceptions of the world in which we function. We will never be able to think the same way again about mimetic desire, about the scapegoat mechanism, and about the role of Jewish and Christian scripture in explaining sacrifice, violence, and the crises from which our culture has been born.The contributions fall into roughly four areas of interpretive work: religion and religious study; literary study; the philosophy of social science; and psychological studies.The essays presented here are offered as "essays" in the older French sense of attempts (essayer) or trials of ideas, as indeed Girard has tried out ideas with us. With a conscious echo of Montaigne, then, this hommage volume is titled

  Author(s) Dumouchel Paul<br>
  Abstract: I first read René Girard when I was an undergraduate philosophy student, twenty-one or twenty-two years old. I bought
                  La Violence et sacréin Canada during the summer of what must have been 1972 or 1973. At that time, I worked evening shifts (from 4:00 PM to midnight) on a summer job in a shelter for street kids, mainly young addicts and victims of family violence. I read the book in early September on the plane that brought me back to France and on the train between Paris and Aix-en-Provence where I was studying. I could not put it down.<br>

  Abstract: There are several goals in this chapter. One goal is to cover some of the main findings by linking them back to some basic ideas from phenomenology. Another goal is to connect some of what has been uncovered in the previous chapters to the work of others. In the latter part of the chapter some consideration is given to applications in mental health. For example, it is noted that bracketing from phenomenological philosophy finds applications in mental health work, particularly in the study of empathy. Specifically we note that empathy is used by Husserl to understand the consciousness of another<br>

  Book Title: The Red Sea-In Search of Lost Space<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Wick Alexis<br>
  Abstract: The Red Sea has, from time immemorial, been one of the world's most navigated spaces, in the pursuit of trade, pilgrimage and conquest. Yet this multidimensional history remains largely unrevealed by its successive protagonists. Intrigued by the absence of a holistic portrayal of this body of water and inspired by Fernand Braudel's famous work on the Mediterranean, this book brings alive a dynamic Red Sea world across time, revealing the particular features of a unique historical actor. In capturing this heretofore lost space, it also presents a critical, conceptual history of the sea, leading the reader into the heart of Eurocentrism. The Sea, it is shown, is a vital element of the modern philosophy of history.Alexis Wick is not satisfied with this inclusion of the Red Sea into history and attendant critique of Eurocentrism. Contrapuntally, he explores how the world and the sea were imagined differently before imperial European hegemony. Searching for the lost space of Ottoman visions of the sea,
      The Red Seamakes a deeper argument about the discipline of history and the historian's craft.<br>

                  wa jaʿalnā min al-māʾi kulla shayʾ in ḥayyin,21:30); it is implicit in Genesis I, where the earth and the heavens are created by a division of the waters; it forms a basic truth claim in modern astronomical science, so that the mere presence of water on a planet may be a sign of life; it is found in many creation myths and much common sense. Thales, who launched the great adventure of Greek philosophy, also affirmed as much. There is<br>

  Author(s) SILVA RAMÓN MEDINA<br>
  Abstract: The poetry of reversals described by the maraʹakáme (shaman), Ramón Medina Silva, of San Sebastian, Mexico, is part of the Huichol peyote hunt and ritual (see below, p. 225). The tactic is common to the languages, acts, and dream-work of shamans and sacred clowns throughout the world. Its Crow Indian manifestation, for example, took the form of warrior societies of ʺcontrariesʺ (Crazy Dogs) whose behavior included ʺsaying the opposite of what you mean & making others say the opposite of what they mean in returnʺ (Rothenberg 1972: 195).

  Abstract: The surprising popularity of psychoanalysis has made the fortunes of certain key-words: image, symbol and symbolism have now become current coin. At the same time, systematic research devoted to the mechanisms of “primitive mentality” has revealed the importance of symbolism in archaic thinking and also the fundamental part it plays in the life of any and every primitive society.

  Book Title: Alef, Mem, Tau-Kabbalistic Musings on Time, Truth, and Death<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Wolfson Elliot R.<br>
  Abstract: This highly original, provocative, and poetic work explores the nexus of time, truth, and death in the symbolic world of medieval kabbalah. Demonstrating that the historical and theoretical relationship between kabbalah and western philosophy is far more intimate and extensive than any previous scholar has ever suggested, Elliot R. Wolfson draws an extraordinary range of thinkers such as Frederic Jameson, Martin Heidegger, Franz Rosenzweig, William Blake, Julia Kristeva, Friedrich Schelling, and a host of kabbalistic figures into deep conversation with one another.
      Alef, Mem, Taualso discusses Islamic mysticism and Buddhist thought in relation to the Jewish esoteric tradition as it opens the possibility of a temporal triumph of temporality and the conquering of time through time. The framework for Wolfson's examination is the rabbinic teaching that the wordemet,"truth," comprises the first, middle, and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet,alef, mem,andtau,which serve, in turn, as semiotic signposts for the three tenses of time-past, present, and future. By heeding the letters ofemetwe discern the truth of time manifestly concealed in the time of truth, the beginning that cannot begin if it is to be the beginning, the middle that re/marks the place of origin and destiny, and the end that is the figuration of the impossible disclosing the impossibility of figuration, the finitude of death that facilitates the possibility of rebirth. The time of death does not mark the death of time, but time immortal, the moment of truth that bestows on the truth of the moment an endless beginning of a beginningless end, the truth of death encountered incessantly in retracing steps of time yet to be taken-between, before, beyond.<br>

  Abstract: The various themes and narrative threads that constitute Canto XXI all come together in Canto XXII : the interrelated notions of thresholds and conversion; the shift from philosophy to theology and from philosophical prose to religious poetry; the confrontation of human reason and its limitations with profound religious mysteries; and the bittersweet celebration of the ancient world, of Virgil for the excellence of his poetic model, and of Virgil’s works for the moral and spiritual influence they reputedly exerted.

  Abstract: It was the summer before our daughter, Freya, began high school, and my wife and I had rented a cabin at Forest Lake. Freya brought Hermann Hesse’s

The prose was tautologous and inelegant, the philosophy obtuse, and it was only a matter of time before she asked if I could read it to her and explain what it was about. And so we sat on the porch together in the evening, as a ruby-throated hummingbird flickered at the nectar-filled<br>

  Book Title: Carnal Thoughts-Embodiment and Moving Image Culture<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Sobchack Vivian<br>
  Abstract: In these innovative essays, Vivian Sobchack considers the key role our bodies play in making sense of today's image-saturated culture. Emphasizing our corporeal rather than our intellectual engagements with film and other media,
      Carnal Thoughtsshows how our experience always emerges through our senses and how our bodies are not just visible objects but also sense-making, visual subjects. Sobchack draws on both phenomenological philosophy and a broad range of popular sources to explore bodily experience in contemporary, moving-image culture. She examines how, through the conflation of cinema and surgery, we've all "had our eyes done"; why we are "moved" by the movies; and the different ways in which we inhabit photographic, cinematic, and electronic space.Carnal Thoughtsprovides a lively and engaging challenge to the mind/body split by demonstrating that the process of "making sense" requires an irreducible collaboration between our thoughts and our senses.<br>

  Abstract: In the last chapter, I attempted to distinguish care ethics from Confucianism, Christian agape, and more generally virtue ethics. Now we must look at the school of moral theory often thought to be the philosophical forebear of care ethics—moral sentimentalism. Michael Slote, in explaining the possibility of a care ethics more widely applicable than that described in feminist philosophy, remarks: “The ethics of care is historically rooted in the moral sentimentalism of Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, Hume, and Adam Smith, all of whom were men.”¹ And Annette Baier has suggested that David Hume might be considered “the woman’s philosopher.”² There is<br>

  Book Title: Gadamer’s Repercussions-Reconsidering Philosophical Hermeneutics<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Krajewski Bruce<br>
  Abstract: Certainly one of the key German philosophers of the twentieth century, Hans-Georg Gadamer also influenced the study of literature, art, music, sacred and legal texts, and medicine. Indeed, while much attention has been focused on Gadamer's writings about ancient Greek and modern German philosophy, the relevance of his work for other disciplines is only now beginning to be properly considered and understood. In an effort to address this slant, this volume brings together many prominent scholars to assess, re-evaluate, and question Hans-Georg Gadamer's works, as well as his place in intellectual history. The book includes a recent essay by Gadamer on "the task of hermeneutics," as well as essays by distinguished contributors including Jürgen Habermas, Richard Rorty, Gerald Bruns, Georgia Warnke, and many others. The contributors situate Gadamer's views in surprising ways and show that his writings speak to a range of contemporary debates—from constitutional questions to issues of modern art. A controversial final section attempts to uncover and clarify Gadamer's history in relation to National Socialism. More an investigation and questioning than a celebration of this venerable and profoundly influential philosopher, this collection will become a catalyst for any future rethinking of philosophical hermeneutics, as well as a significant starting place for rereading and reviewing Hans-Georg Gadamer.<br>

  Abstract: I would first like briefly to justify the theme I have chosen, namely: “from word to concept.” The subject matter is a topic belonging both to philosophy and to hermeneutics. In truth, concepts are really one of the distinguishing marks of philosophy. Indeed, philosophy first entered Western culture in this form. For this reason the concept is the first thing I would like to discuss. Of one thing I am sure: the concept, which very often presents itself as something strange and demanding, must begin to speak if it is to be really grasped. For this reason I would first<br>

  Abstract: The contemporary Western philosophical scene can be characterized in terms of divisions and interactions between approaches to philosophy which assume that their task is inextricably linked to the development of the natural sciences and approaches which often regard this assumption with considerable suspicion. Philosophers who adopt the former approach have the obvious advantage that the project of which they see themselves as a part produces more and more results which are in principle—if not in practice—publicly testable and which appear to confirm their underlying assumption that science is converging towards an already constituted reality as it is “in<br>

  Author(s) KELLY MICHAEL<br>
  Abstract: There are three main critiques through which Hans-Georg Gadamer develops his conception of aesthetics, which has a central role in his philosophical hermeneutics, which in turn is his principal contribution to philosophy in the twentieth century, all of which he amazingly witnessed. He offers a critique of the philosophy of art which regards art as a lie and that denies it is capable of making truth claims; a critique of aesthetic consciousness as an alienated abstraction from the experience of truth in art; and a critique of the subjectivization of modern aesthetics, which he traces back to Immanuel Kant’s

  Abstract: The reflections that follow are a response to Catherine Zuckert’s interesting and provocative book,

In addition to Nietzsche, Zuckert examines four other thinkers—Heidegger, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Leo Strauss, and Jacques Derrida—who share the conviction that Plato must be confronted<br>

  Book Title: Late Godard and the Possibilities of Cinema-  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Morgan Daniel<br>
  Abstract: With
      Late Godard and the Possibilities of Cinema, Daniel Morgan makes a significant contribution to scholarship on Jean-Luc Godard, especially his films and videos since the late 1980s, some of the most notoriously difficult works in contemporary cinema. Through detailed analyses of extended sequences, technical innovations, and formal experiments, Morgan provides an original interpretation of a series of several internally related films-Soigne ta droite(Keep Your Right Up, 1987),Nouvelle vague(New Wave, 1990), andAllemagne 90 neuf zéro(Germany 90 Nine Zero, 1991)-and the monumental late video work,Histoire(s) du cinéma(1988-1998). Taking up a range of topics, including the role of nature and natural beauty, the relation between history and cinema, and the interactions between film and video, the book provides a distinctive account of the cinematic and intellectual ambitions of Godard's late work. At the same time,Late Godard and the Possibilities of Cinemaprovides a new direction for the fields of film and philosophy by drawing on the idealist and romantic tradition of philosophical aesthetics, which rarely finds an articulation within film studies. In using the tradition of aesthetics to illuminate Godard's late films and videos, Morgan shows that these works transform the basic terms and categories of aesthetics in and for the cinema.<br>

  Abstract: From Archytas’s challenging conundrum we can derive a more momentous question: not whether an outstretched hand or staff can reach out into something (or nothing) but whether
                  the whole world(Le., the physical cosmos as one entity) can move. And if the world moves,in what, into what,does it move? These questions vexed philosophers and theologians of the Middle Ages—construing this period as the entire era stretching between A.D. 600 (a date that marks the demise of Hellenistic and Neoplatonic philosophy) and A.D. 1500 (when the Renaissance was fully alive in Italy).

  Abstract: Descending from its position as a supreme term within Aristotle’s protophenomenological physics, place barely survived discussion by the end of seventeenth century. By the end of the eighteenth century, it vanished altogether from serious theoretical discourse in physics and philosophy. At moment, we can say of place what Aristotle believes has to be said of time: “It either is not at all or [only] scarcely and dimly” (
                  Physics217b34). How this radical dissolution and disappearance of place occurred—how place ceded place fully to space in the course of just two centuries—is the subject of the next four chapters,<br>

  Abstract: To turn to the seventeenth century is to plunge into a turbulent world in which alchemy vied with physics, theology with philosophy, politics with religion, nations with each other, individuals with their anguished souls. No single treatment can do justice to this multifarious period of human history. We can, however, pick our way through it by attending to an assortment of figures who occupied themselves expressly with questions of place and space: Gassendi, Newton, Descartes, Locke, and Leibniz. Each of these thinkers—with the exception of Locke—was also a prominent scientist, and this double identity is no accident. To<br>

  Abstract: For over a century, the relationships between the humanities and the sciences have been largely defined by opposition:
                  Geistes- versusNaturwissenschaften, ideographic versus nomothetic, interpretative versus explanatory, past- versus future-oriented. These oppositions were hammered out in theFestredenof Dilthey, Windelband, Helmholtz, and other leading lights of bellwether German universities and reflected the rising prestige and power of the natural sciences in the final quarter of the nineteenth century. Since then, the history and philosophy of science in most European traditions has been dominated by inquiries into the natural sciences: a comparable history of the humanities is just beginning to<br>

  Author(s) Paul Herman<br>
  Abstract: Manuals on historical method from around 1900 are like neoscholastic philosophy textbooks: books that are supposed to be so dull and dreary that only few scholars dare venture into them. Although methodology manuals were once a flourishing genre, especially in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when such emerging academic disciplines as history, art history, and church history were in need of methodological signposts and boundary markers, the hundreds of pages that these manuals typically devote to the minutiae of internal and external source criticism now read like neoscholastic meditations on the

  Abstract: A century ago, one of the most important modes of research in the professional study of Greco-Roman antiquity as well as in a number of other fields was a recently developed specialty called by its admirers (back then it had no opponents) ‘

By decomposing the compilatory handbooks produced by the erudition of late antiquity into their various sources and establishing the relations of dependence among them, the adepts of this method sought to trace back reports about a variety of aspects of the ancient world – primarily philosophy and history, but also religion, law, sculpture, and other matters –<br>

  Author(s) Romeijn Jan-Willem<br>
  Abstract: In comparison to the natural and social sciences, the humanities have received comparatively little attention from the analytic philosophy of science. This discipline has been concerned primarily with the sciences narrowly construed. In particular confirmation theory, the systematic study of theory evaluation, shows remarkable lacunas when it comes to the methodology of the humanities. But developments in the humanities and in conformation theory invite us to reconsider this situation. First, due to the fast uptake of empirical and computational methods in several humanities disciplines, the humanities are presently very much in flux, and much more amenable to methodological elucidation.

  Abstract: During the nineteenth century we witness an extraordinary progress and increasing specialization in the natural sciences as well as the growth and professionalization of universities in Germany.¹ At the same time, after the deaths of Goethe and Hegel, the epoch of Romanticism and German Idealism had come to an end.² While the sciences diversified and emancipated from their philosophical past, philosophy itself fragmented into competing schools and currents,³ and in many respects, precipitated into an existential crisis.⁴ For a long time in the mainstream historiography of philosophy the nineteenth century was considered to harbor only epigones or predecessors.⁵ However, there<br>

  Book Title: In Defense of Doctrine-Evangelicalism, Theology, and Scripture<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Putman Rhyne R.<br>
  Abstract: Questions surrounding the relationship of Scripture and doctrine are legion within the Protestant tradition. How can doctrine develop over time and maintain fidelity to the sacred text, especially for communities who cling to the Reformation principle of sola scriptura? Does not an appeal to contemporary, constructive theology belie commonly held Protestant and Evangelical convictions about the sufficiency of Scripture? Does admission and acceptance of doctrinal development result in a kind of reality-denying theological relativism? And in what way can a growing, postcanonical tradition maintain a sense of continuity with the faith of the New Testament? This study is an apologetic for the ongoing, constructive theological task in Protestant and Evangelical traditions. It suggests that doctrinal development can be explained as a hermeneutical phenomenon and that insights from hermeneutical philosophy and the philosophy of language can aid theologians in constructing explanatory theses for particular theological problems associated with the facts of doctrinal development, namely, questions related to textual authority, reality depiction, and theological identity. Joining the recent call to theological interpretation of Scripture, Putman provides a constructive model that forwards a descriptive and normative pattern for reading Scripture and theological tradition together.<br>

  Book Title: To Make the Hands Impure: Art, Ethical Adventure, the Difficult and the Holy-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): NEWTON ADAM ZACHARY<br>
  Abstract: How can cradling, handling, or rubbing a text be said, ethically, to have made something happen? What, as readers or interpreters, may come off in our hands in as we maculate or mark the books we read? For Adam Zachary Newton, reading is anembodied practice wherein "ethics" becomes a matter of tact in the doubled sense of touch and regard. With the image of the book lying in the hands of its readers as insistent refrain, To Make the Hands Impure cuts a provocative cross-disciplinary swath through classical Jewish texts, modern Jewish philosophy, film and performance, literature, translation, and the material text. Newton explores the ethics of reading through a range of texts, from the Talmud and Midrash to Conrad's Nostromo and Pascal's Le Memorial, from works by Henry Darger and Martin Scorsese to the National September 11 Memorial and a synagogue in Havana, Cuba. In separate chapters, he conducts masterly treatments of Emmanuel Levinas, Mikhail Bakhtin, and Stanley Cavell by emphasizing their performances as readers a trebled orientation to Talmud, novel, and theater/film. To Make the Hands Impure stages the encounter of literary experience and scriptural traditions he difficult and the holy through an ambitious, singular, and innovative approach marked in equal measure by erudition and imaginative daring.<br>

  Abstract: In the history of religion the arrival of the millennium is often imagined as the έσχατον, an end of history or “end-time” that brings an apocalyptic and ultimate answer to all human questions. But the perennial quarrel between religion and philosophy can hardly be illustrated with greater force than by recalling that for Socrates the practice of philosophy remains forever marked by άπορεία. It is a mode of critical interrogation or

  Book Title: Ostension-Word Learning and the Embodied Mind<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Engelland Chad<br>
  Abstract: Ostension is bodily movement that manifests our engagement with things, whether we wish it to or not. Gestures, glances, facial expressions: all betray our interest in something. Ostension enables our first word learning, providing infants with a prelinguistic way to grasp the meaning of words. Ostension is philosophically puzzling; it cuts across domains seemingly unbridgeable -- public--private, inner--outer, mind--body. In this book, Chad Engelland offers a philosophical investigation of ostension and its role in word learning by infants. Engelland discusses ostension (distinguishing it from ostensive definition) in contemporary philosophy, examining accounts by Quine, Davidson, and Gadamer, and he explores relevant empirical findings in psychology, evolutionary anthropology, and neuroscience. He offers original studies of four representative historical thinkers whose work enriches the understanding of ostension: Wittgenstein, Merleau-Ponty, Augustine, and Aristotle. And, building on these philosophical and empirical foundations, Engelland offers a meticulous analysis of the philosophical issues raised by ostension. He examines the phenomenological problem of whether embodied intentions are manifest or inferred; the problem of what concept of mind allows ostensive cues to be intersubjectively available; the epistemological problem of how ostensive cues, notoriously ambiguous, can be correctly understood; and the metaphysical problem of the ultimate status of the key terms in his argument: animate movement, language, and mind. Finally, he argues for the centrality of manifestation in philosophy. Taking ostension seriously, he proposes, has far-reaching implications for thinking about language and the practice of philosophy.<br>

Instead, animate movement effectively enables our minds to commune so that we can subsequently share the world in speech. In this chapter on metaphysics, I wish to clarify conceptually the resources involved in sharing the world.<br>

He was responding to Mortimer Adler, an Aristotelian and Great Books enthusiast, who maintained that professional philosophy no longer appealed to the general literate public. Quine acknowledges that the menu of philosophy has become exotic, and only connoisseurs will appreciate its offerings today. But Quine takes umbrage at the suggestion that this specialization should be taken as a shortcoming. It rather constitutes philosophy’s maturation into a scientific discipline. The linguistic turn had the great merit of undermining modern introspective notions, which proved inadequate for accounting for our<br>

  Abstract: Paradise Lostis rich above all other epics in the graver import of the universal or the archetypal. Critics, however, have left unexcavated some of the richest veins of its graver import. Bringing them to light requires two fundamental changes. First, we must give archetypal elements priority over historical influences and Milton’s conscious designs, those surface veins of meaning critics commonly pursue. Second, we must supplement standard critical methods with philosophical and psychological methods designed to probe the archetypal. Implementing these changes, this chapter will utilize the combined methods of modern philosophy and Jungian psychology to explore the graver import<br>

  Book Title: Aspects of Alterity: Levinas, Marcel, and the Contemporary Debate-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): TREANOR BRIAN<br>
  Abstract: Every other is truly other, but no other is wholly other.This is the claim that Aspects of Alterity defends. Taking up the question of otherness that so fascinates contemporary continental philosophy, this book asks what it means for something or someone to be other than the self. Levinas and those influenced by him point out that the philosophical tradition of the West has generally favored the self at the expense of the other. Such a self-centered perspective never encounters the other qua other, however. In response, postmodern thought insists on the absolute otherness of the other, epitomized by the deconstructive claim every other is wholly other.But absolute otherness generates problems and aporias of its own. This has led some thinkers to reevaluate the notion of relative otherness in light of the postmodern critique, arguing for a chiastic account that does justice to both the alterity and the similitude of the other. These latter two positions-absolute otherness and a rehabilitated account of relative otherness-are the main contenders in the contemporary debate.The philosophies of Emmanuel Levinas and Gabriel Marcel provide the point of embarkation for coming to understand the two positions on this question. Levinas and Marcel were contemporaries whose philosophies exhibit remarkably similar concern for the other but nevertheless remain fundamentally incompatible. Thus, these two thinkers provide a striking illustration of both the proximity of and the unbridgeable gap between two accounts of otherness.Aspects of Alterity delves into this debate, first in order understand the issues at stake in these two positions and second to determine which description better accounts for the experience of encountering the other.After a thorough assessment and critique of otherness in Levinas's and Marcel's work, including a discussion of the relationship of ethical alterity to theological assumptions, Aspects of Alterity traces the transmission and development of these two conceptions of otherness. Levinas's version of otherness can be seen in the work of Jacques Derrida and John D. Caputo, while Marcel's understanding of otherness influences the work of Paul Ricoeur and Richard Kearney.Ultimately, Aspects of Alterity makes a case for a hermeneutic account of otherness. Otherness itself is not absolute, but is a chiasm of alterity and similitude. Properly articulated, such an account is capable of addressing the legitimate ethical and epistemological concerns that lead thinkers to construe otherness in absolute terms, but without the absolute aporiasthat accompany such a characterization.<br>

  Abstract: These passages, both alluded to by Levinas in various places, underscore the impetus of his thought, which argues that ethical responsibility is more fundamental than ontology, inverting twenty-five hundred years of philosophy by showing that “man’s relation to the other is prior to his ontological relation to himself (egology) or to the totality of things that we call the world (cosmology).”¹ Although his work is exceptionally focused in its concern for the other, Levinas’s philosophy is extensive enough that a complete treatment of it is beyond the scope of this project, which demands that we summarize Levinas’s philosophy and focus<br>

  Abstract: Jean-Luc Marion’s body of work has already secured his place among the top rank of twentieth-century philosophers; it seems inconceivable that his reputation will not grow even further in the twenty-first century and beyond. Though equally renowned for his scholarly work on early modern philosophy and on Husserl and Heidegger, Marion is perhaps best known for his renewal of phenomenology, for his remarkable, ongoing inquiry into the question of God, and for work bridging all of these areas.

  Abstract: The terms of the title—glory, idolatry, kairos—are Christian, not Greek, if we understand Greek as the Greek of classical philosophy. Kairos is a Greek word meaning the opportune moment, but prior to Christianity it had little philosophical significance¹; idolatry comes from

  Abstract: In “Education and Prayer,” Emmanuel Levinas complains that our prayer has too often become a purely isolated and individuated experience and that we have lost the social and collective dimension of prayer.¹ Prayer, he suggests, always has a liturgical and communal function. Prayer requires openness and truth and hence has ethical significance and import. Jean-Luc Marion is profoundly influenced by Levinas’s philosophy. His own account of prayer bears traces of Levinas’s thought and orients itself along Levinasian suggestions regarding relation to the other. Yet Marion’s account of prayer lacks precisely the communal, social, and ethical dimension for which Levinas calls.<br>

  Book Title: Gazing Through a Prism Darkly: Reflections on Merold Westphal's Hermeneutical Epistemology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): PUTT B. KEITH<br>
  Abstract: Merold Westphal has been in the foremost ranks of philosophers who proclaim a new postsecular philosophy. By articulating an epistemology sensitive to the realities of cognitive finitude and moral weakness, he defends a wisdom that begins in both humility and commitment, one that always confesses that human beings can encounter meaning and truth only as human beings, never as gods.The present volume focuses on this wisdom of humility that characterizes Westphal's thought and explores how that wisdom, expressed through the redemptive dynamic of doubt, can contribute to developing a postsecular apologetic for faith.This book can function both as an accessible introduction to Westphal for those who have not read him extensively and also as an informed critical appreciation and extension of his work for those who are more experienced readers.<br>

  Book Title: Questioning the Human: Toward a Theological Anthropology for the Twenty-First Century-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Van Stichel Ellen<br>
  Abstract: Theological anthropology is being put to the test: in the face of contemporary developments in the spheres of culture, politics, and science, traditional perspectives on the human person are no longer adequate. Yet can theological anthropology move beyond its previously established categories and renew itself in relation to contemporary insights? The present collection of essays sets out to answer this question. Uniting Roman Catholic theologians from across the globe, it tackles from a theological perspective challenges related to the classical natural law tradition (part 1), to the modern conception of the subject (part 2), and to the postmodern awareness of diversity in a globalizing context (part 3). Its contributors share a fundamental methodological choice of a critical-constructive dialogue with contemporary culture, science, and philosophy. This collection integrates a wider range of approaches than one usually finds in theological volumes, bringing together experts in systematic theology and in theological ethics. Authors come from different American contexts, including Black and Latino, and from a European context that include both French and German. Moreover, the interdisciplinary insights upon which the different contributions draw stem from both the natural sciences (such as neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and ethology) and the humanities (such as cultural studies, philosophy, and hermeneutics). This volume will be essential reading for anyone seeking a state-of-the-art account of theological anthropology, of the uncertainties it is facing, and of the responses it is in the process of formulating. The shared Roman Catholic background of the authors of this collection makes this volume a helpful complement to recent publications that predominantly represent views from other theological traditions.<br>

  Abstract: Taking a phenomenological approach to allegory, Structures of Appearing seeks to revise the history of aesthetics, identifying it as an ideology that has long subjugated art to philosophical criteria of judgment. Rather than being a mere signifying device, allegory is the structure by which something appears that cannot otherwise appear. It thus supports the appearance and necessary experience of philosophical ideas that are otherwise impossible to present or represent. Allegory is as central to philosophy as it is to literature. Following suggestions by Walter Benjamin, Machosky argues that allegory itself must appear allegorically and thus cannot be forced into a logos-centric metaphysical system. She builds on the work of Maurice Blanchot and Emmanuel Levinas to argue that the allegorical image is not a likeness to anything, not a subjective reflection, but an absolute otherness that becomes accessible by virtue of its unique structure. Allegory thus makes possible not merely the textual work of literature but the work that literature is. Machosky develops this insight in readings of Prudentius, Dante, Spenser, Hegel, Goethe, and Kafka.<br>

  Abstract: The name of Hegel is a mighty invocation for philosophy. A model of rigor, and from start to finish grounded in
                  Wissenschaft(science), Hegel’s philosophy has infiltrated far corners of the globe. Although often disputed, Hegel’s judgments are not easily dismissed. Nonetheless, as Paul de Man astutely observed about Hegel’s influence, “Few thinkers have so many disciples who never read a word of their master’s writings” (“Sign and Symbol” 93).³ Early in his career, Karl Marx expressed a similar sentiment with regard to the Young Hegelians of his time. Hegelians have used Hegel with great effect, often, as Marx observed<br>

Others of the best philosophers whom I count among my friends share my faith. But they are not postmodernists. Decidedly not. At varying degrees along a spectrum that runs from mildly allergic to wildly apoplectic, they are inclined to see postmodernism as nothing but warmed-over Nietzschean atheism, frequently on the short list of the most dangerous anti-Christian currents of thought as an epistemological relativism that leads ineluctably to moral nihilism.

  Book Title: Language, Eros, Being: Kabbalistic Hermeneutics and Poetic Imagination-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): WOLFSON ELLIOT R.<br>
  Abstract: This long-awaited, magisterial study-an unparalleled blend of philosophy, poetry, and philology-draws on theories of sexuality, phenomenology, comparative religion, philological writings on Kabbalah, Russian formalism, Wittgenstein, Rosenzweig, William Blake, and the very physics of the time-space continuum to establish what will surely be a highwater mark in work on Kabbalah. Not only a study of texts, Language, Eros, Being is perhaps the fullest confrontation of the body in Jewish studies, if not in religious studies as a whole.Elliot R. Wolfson explores the complex gender symbolism that permeates Kabbalistic literature. Focusing on the nexus of asceticism and eroticism, he seeks to define the role of symbolic and poetically charged language in the erotically configured visionary imagination of the medieval Kabbalists. He demonstrates that the traditional Kabbalistic view of gender was a monolithic and androcentric one, in which the feminine was conceived as being derived from the masculine. He does not shrink from the negative implications of this doctrine, but seeks to make an honest acknowledgment of it as the first step toward the redemption of an ancient wisdom.Comparisons with other mystical traditions-including those in Christianity, Buddhism, and Islam-are a remarkable feature throughout the book. They will make it important well beyond Jewish studies, indeed, a must for historians of comparative religion, in particular of comparative mysticism.Praise for Elliot R. Wolfson:Through a Speculum That Shines is an important and provocative contribution to the study of Jewish mysticism by one of the major scholars now working in this field.-Speculum<br>

  Abstract: The rise of religious fundamentalism in the closing decades of the twentieth century continues to have enormous repercussions not only for politics, but also for the disciplines of the human sciences, philosophy, and theology. The sociology of religion, perhaps the paradigmatic achievement of the discipline of sociology, has been dealing with the effects of the crisis of its theories of secularization. The so-called deprivatization of religion has forced on the table the old-age question of the relation between God and society, or faith and the constitution of community, with the added complication that the community at stake nowadays is a<br>

  Book Title: Rethinking God as Gift: Marion, Derrida, and the Limits of Phenomenology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Horner Robyn<br>
  Abstract: Rethinking God as Gift is situated at the intersection of philosophy, critical theory and theology. The first sustained study of the work of Jean-Luc Marion in English, it offers a unique perspective on contemporary questions and their theological relevance. Taking its point of departure from the problem of the gift as articulated by Jacques Derrida, who argues that the conditions of possibility of the gift are also its conditions of impossibility, Horner pursues a series of questions concerning the nature of thought, the viability of phenomenology, and, most urgently, the possibility of grace. For Marion, phenomenology, as the thought of the given, offers a path for philosophy to proceed without being implicated in metaphysics. His retrieval of several important insights of Edmund Husserl, along with his reading of Martin Heidegger and Emmanuel Lvinas, enables him to work out a phenomenology where even impossiblephenomena such as revelation and the gift might be examined. In this important confrontation between Marion and Derrida issues vital to the negotiation of postmodern concerns in philosophy and theology emerge with vigour. The careful elucidation of those issues in an interdisciplinary context, and the snapshot it provides of the state of contemporary debate, make Rethinking God as Gift an important contribution to theological and philosophical discussion.<br>

The question is directed in the first instance at autobiography, as a question concerning its ability to go beyond the representation of the subject to write the encounter with the absolutely other for which Levinas’s ethical philosophy calls. But it is also, in the second instance, a question for Levinas, concerning the potential of autobiography to represent an alterity perhaps not fully accounted for by his philosophy.

  Book Title: Crossover Queries: Dwelling with Negatives, Embodying Philosophy's Others-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): WYSCHOGROD EDITH<br>
  Abstract: Exploring the risks, ambiguities, and unstable conceptual worlds of contemporary thought, Crossover Queries brings together the wide-ranging writings, across twenty years, of one of our most important philosophers.Ranging from twentieth-century European philosophy-the thought of Heidegger, Foucault, Derrida, Levinas, Janicaud, and others-to novels and artworks, music and dance, from traditional Jewish thought to Jain andBuddhist metaphysics, Wyschogrod's work opens radically new vistas while remaining mindful that the philosopher stands within and is responsible to a philosophical legacy conditioned by the negative.Rather than point to a Hegelian dialectic of overcoming negation or to a postmetaphysical exhaustion, Wyschogrod treats negative moments as opening novel spaces for thought. She probes both the desire for God and an ethics grounded in the interests of the other person, seeing these as moments both of crossing over and of negation. Alert to the catastrophes that have marked our times, she exposes the underlying logical structures of nihilatory forces that have been exerted to exterminate whole peoples. Analyzing the negationsof biological research and cultural images of mechanized and robotic bodies, she shows how they contest the body as lived in ordinary experience.Crossover Queries brings together important essays on a remarkable range of topics by one of our most insightful cultural critics. Commenting on philosophical and theological issues that have shaped the recent past as well as scientific and technological questions that will preoccupy us in the near future, Wyschogrod consistently alerts us to the urgency of problems whose importance few recognize. To avoid the challenge these essays pose is to avoid responsibility for a future that appears to be increasingly fragile.-Mark C. Taylor, Columbia University<br>

  Abstract: Two objections arise repeatedly in connection with Emmanuel Levinas’s philosophy of language. First, it is argued, in the spirit of Jürgen Habermas and K. O. Apel, for whom ethics is grounded in discursive reason, that for Levinas ethics is an unmediated relation to the other and, as such, transcends linguistic and conceptual structure. Ethics is not a matter of moral argument but of solicitation by the other, who by virtue of sheer otherness resists violence. Levinas’s access routes to the other are nonlinguistic: they include the human face, an idea of the infinite that exceeds any description of it, and<br>

  Book Title: Interstices of the Sublime: Theology and Psychoanalytic Theory-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Interstices of the Sublime represents a powerful theological engagement with psychoanalytic theory in Freud, Lacan, Kristeva and Zizek, as well as major expressions of contemporary Continental philosophy, including Deleuze, Derrida, Marion, and Badiou. Through creative and constructive psycho-theological readings of topics such as sublimation, schizophrenia, God, and creation ex nihilo, this book contributes to a new form of radical theological thinking that is deeply involved in the world. Here the idea of the Kantian sublime is read into Freud and Lacan, and compared with sublimation. The sublime refers to a conflict of the Kantian faculties of reason and imagination, and involves the attempt to represent what is intrinsically unrepresentable. Sublimation, by contrast, involves the expression and partial satisfaction of primal desires in culturally acceptable terms. The sublime is negatively expressed in sublimation, because it is both the sourceof sublimation as well as that which resists being sublimated. That is, the Freudian sublime is related to the process of sublimation, but it also distorts or disrupts sublimation, and invokes what Lacan calls the Real. The effects of the sublime are not just psychoanalytic but, importantly, theological, because the sublime is the main form that Godtakes in the modern world. A radical postmodern theology attends to the workings of the sublime in our thinking and living, and provides resources to understand the complexity of reality. This book is one of the first sustained theological readings of Lacan in English.<br>

  Abstract: In this book I conduct an investigation of important religious, theological, and psychoanalytic concepts, primarily through a reading of sublimation. Sublimation is a privileged term that is closely connected with the notion of the sublime, a Kantian term that also has psychoanalytic and theological connotations. Investigating sublimation and the sublime as important terms for theological discourse brings together psychoanalytic theory from Freud to Lacan, Kristeva, and Žižek along with more conventional philosophical discourses, including contemporary continental philosophy. To orient ourselves toward considering the significance of psychoanalysis for thinking about religious and theological topics, I will begin with a concrete example<br>

  Abstract: Amid the multitudinous variety of historical, ethnographic, and cultural studies taking place within the academy, one can detect a certain crisis or at least confusion regarding theoretical discourse about religion. This confusion refers to the felt discord among heterogeneous languages and incommensurable modes of description and questioning. Such languages include traditional theology, analytic philosophy of religion, hermeneutics and other symbolic-semiotic languages, methodological approaches to the history of religions, and various forms of postmodernism. This confusion is felt at the same time as religion is being taken up by many philosophers and theorists as an important topic for understanding, in part<br>

This description of the reception of psychoanalysis could also refer to the contemporary American reception of postmodernism.

  Abstract: The problem of thinking is a problem of sublimation. To have language, meaning, and thereby religion, science, culture, and art, there must be sublimation in a broad sense. This book has traced some of the intricacies of sublimation through psychoanalytic theory as it impresses upon theology. Sublimation means that meaning is not direct and unmediated but consists of a detour. At the same time, my readings of theology, continental philosophy, and psychoanalytic theory suggest that sublimation is not an elevation above a material reality. In chapter 1, I appealed to Deleuze to question the two-level model of reality that sublimation<br>

  Book Title: Saintly Influence: Edith Wyschogrod and the Possibilities of Philosophy of Religion-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): KAVKA MARTIN<br>
  Abstract: Since the publication of her first book, Emmanuel Levinas: The Problem of Ethical Metaphysics, in 1974-the first book about Levinas published in English-Edith Wyschogrod has been at the forefront of the fields of Continental philosophy and philosophy of religion. Her work has crossed many disciplinary boundaries, making peregrinations from phenomenology and moral philosophy to historiography, the history of religions (both Western and non-Western), aesthetics, and the philosophy of biology. In all of these discourses, she has sought to cultivate an awareness of how the self is situated and influenced, as well as the ways in which a self can influence others.In this volume, twelve scholars examine and display the influence of Wyschogrod's work in essays that take up the thematics of influence in a variety of contexts: Christian theology, the saintly behavior of the villagers of Le Chambon sur Lignon, the texts of the medieval Jewish mystic Abraham Abulafia, the philosophies of Levinas, Derrida, and Benjamin, the practice of intellectual history, the cultural memory of the New Testament, and pedagogy.In response, Wyschogrod shows how her interlocutors have brought to light her multiple authorial personae and have thus marked the ambiguity of selfhood, its position at the nexus of being influenced by and influencing others.<br>

  Author(s) WESTPHAL MEROLD<br>
  Abstract: In her project of revisioning moral philosophy, Edith Wyschogrod takes a decisive turn from moral theory to hagiography, from abstract analysis and argument to concrete life stories. The negative motivation for this turn is a critique of moral theory. Two elements of this critique strike me as especially forceful. First, moral theory depends on arguments that do not persuade those outside the hermeneutic circle within which the arguments occur. Thus she points to “the circularity of standard modes of rationality.”¹ The problem is that “background claims … cannot be agreed upon. If there is no common frame of reference, no<br>

It is this desire and the ability to bring widely differing genres, discourses and traditionally separate intellectual orbits into productive coalitions that have increasingly distinguished her writings.

  Book Title: Postmodern Apologetics?: Arguments for God in Contemporary Philosophy-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: This book provides an introduction to the emerging field of continental philosophy of religion by treating the thought of its most important representatives, including its appropriations by several thinkers in the United States. Part I provides context by examining religious aspects of the thought of Martin Heidegger, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jacques Derrida. Christina Gschwandtner contends that, although the work of these thinkers is not apologetic in nature (i.e., it does not provide an argument for religion, whether Christianity or Judaism), it prepares the ground for the more religiously motivated work of more recent thinkers by giving religious language and ideas some legitimacy in philosophical discussions. Part II devotes a chapter to each of the contemporary French thinkers who articulate a phenomenology of religious experience: Paul Ricoeur, Jean-Luc Marion, Michel Henry, Jean-Louis Chretien, and Jean-Yves Lacoste. In it, the author argues that their respective philosophies can be read as an apologetics of sorts-namely, as arguments for the coherence of thought about God and the viability of religious experience-though each thinker does so in a different fashion and to a different degree. Part III considers the three major thinkers who have popularized and extended this phenomenology in the U.S. context: John D. Caputo, Merold Westphal, and Richard Kearney. The book thus both provides an introduction to important contemporary thinkers, many of whom have not yet received much treatment in English, and also argues that their philosophies can be read as providing an argument for Christian faith.<br>

Several theologians, such as Rudolf Bultmann, Karl Rahner, and Paul Tillich, were inspired by his philosophy and used it extensively in their own writings. Janicaud himself makes Heidegger to some extent responsible for the religious turn, while drawing on other aspects of Heidegger’s thought for his desire to keep philosophy pure and safe from theological contamination.¹ Heidegger’s corpus is vast indeed and I will make no attempt to treat it in its entirety here. Rather, I will focus on the<br>

  4  Paul Ricoeur: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0495">Postmodern Apologetics?: Arguments for God in Contemporary Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: Ricoeur was one of the most prolific French philosophers in his long life, authoring over thirty books on a great variety of topics. He was born in 1913 and died in Paris in 2005, having taught for many years in Straβburg, Paris, and Chicago. Ricoeur is known primarily as a hermeneutic thinker, although his hermeneutic work always also refers to and assumes phenomenology and interacts with various other philosophical approaches. In fact, in many ways a possible conversation between various philosophical traditions, approaches, and discourses could be said to be a distinctive mark of Ricoeur’s philosophy. Richard Kearney suggests that<br>

  6  Michel Henry: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0495">Postmodern Apologetics?: Arguments for God in Contemporary Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: Michel Henry (1922–2002) was one of the early phenomenologists working in France, more or less contemporaneous with Emmanuel Lévinas and Paul Ricoeur. He is most well-known for developing a “material” phenomenology, or, as he later called it, a “phenomenology of the flesh.” Many of his early writings are heavily influenced by the philosophy of Karl Marx. Only his more recent (and final) writings are more explicitly religious.¹ Although some hints of these concerns are present in his earlier works (such as an analysis of Meister Eckhart’s mysticism in Section III of his major work

  Abstract: Emmanuel Falque (born in 1963), along with Jean-Louis Chrétien, belongs to the next generation of French thinkers. He was a student of Jean-Luc Marion and Jean Greisch and is presently dean of the faculty of philosophy at the Institut catholique in Paris. He has degrees in both philosophy and theology and merges the two disciplines far more fully than any of the other thinkers, occasionally even challenging the boundaries between these subject matters as unnecessary and superficial.¹ Falque’s work is especially characterized by a phenomenological reading of theological doctrines and thinkers.

  Abstract: Merold Westphal, recently retired as Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at Fordham University, is one of the most significant figures to have appropriated French thought about the divine and religious experience for an American audience, focusing especially on the dimensions of faith. Most of his works circle around the coherence and viability of Christian faith, seeking to show that postmodernity and faith are not as incompatible as they might seem. Deeply influenced by the work of Søren Kierkegaard to whom several of his writings are devoted, he has continually sought to translate postmodern philosophy for a Christian audience.

  Abstract: John D. Caputo, recently retired as Thomas J. Watson Professor of Religion and Humanities at Syracuse University and David R. Cook Professor Emeritus of philosophy at Villanova University where he taught for many years, is most well-known for his friendship with Derrida and for highlighting the religious dimension of Derrida’s thought. Caputo’s work is perhaps best understood as a form of postmodern hope (especially in contrast to Westphal’s emphasis on faith and Kearney’s concern with charity).

  Author(s) Utsler David<br>
  Abstract: Environmental hermeneutics is, as the subtitle of this book claims, an “emerging field.” It is not the case that philosophical hermeneutics and environmental discourse have not been thought together before. But a “field” suggests a body of knowledge that is at once diverse yet coherent: Diverse, in that there are multiple perspectives and applications; coherent, in that there are recognizable characteristics that make environmental hermeneutics identifiable as a particular way of engaging environmental philosophy. Hermeneutics itself is widely recognized and understood to have multiple applications across a wide variety of disciplines and themes. Indeed, “environmental hermeneutics” might be simply defined<br>

  Abstract: Narrative identity has been a significant area of focus in environmental hermeneutics. This concept of identity builds on Paul Ricoeur’s formulation of the ethical intention of the self: “

My intention in this essay is to examine Ricoeur’s ethic as it applies to environmental ethics and philosophy.

Even if something like nature in fact existed, the argument goes, we would have little to say about it, locked as we are into a self-referential meaning system,<br>

  Book Title: Finding God in All Things: Celebrating Bernard Lonergan, John Courtney Murray, and Karl Rahner-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stagaman David<br>
  Abstract: Three of the most influential Catholic theologians of the twentieth century-Bernard Lonergan, John Courtney Murray, and Karl Rahner-were all born in 1904, at the height of the Church's most militant rhetoric against all things modern. In this culture of suspicion, Lonergan, Murray, and Rahner grew in faith to join the Society of Jesus and struggled with the burden of antimodernist policies in their formation. By the time of their mature work in the 1950s and 1960s, they had helped to redefine the critical dialogue between modern thought and contemporary Catholic theology. After the dtente of the Second Vatican Council, they brought Catholic tradition into closer relationship to modern philosophy, history, and politics. Written by leading scholars, friends, and family members, these original essays celebrate the legacies of Lonergan, Murray, and Rahner after a century of theological development. Offering a broad range of perspectives on their lives and works, the essays blend personal and anecdotal accounts with incisive critical appraisals. Together, they offer an accessible introduction to the distinctive character of three great thinkers and how their work shapes the way Catholics think and talk about God, Church, and State.<br>

Some consider Lonergan to be primarily a philosopher; more consider him to be a theologian. There is also growing interest in his economic manuscripts, the fruit of his life-long avocation. Yet, he himself once remarked: “Fortunately, I don’t think I come under any single label.”²<br>

  Book Title: Political Theologies: Public Religions in a Post-Secular World-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SULLIVAN LAWRENCE E.<br>
  Abstract: What has happened to religion in its present manifestations? In recent years, Enlightenment secularization, as it appeared in the global spread of political structures that relegate the sacred to a private sphere, seems suddenly to have foundered. Unexpectedly, it has discovered its own parochialism-has discovered, indeed, that secularization may never have taken place at all.With the return of the religious,in all aspects of contemporary social, political, and religious life, the question of political theology-of the relation between politicaland religiousdomains-takes on new meaning and new urgency. In this groundbreaking book, distinguished scholars from many disciplines-philosophy, political theory, anthropology, classics, and religious studies-seek to take the full measure of this question in today's world. This book begins with the place of the gods in the Greek polis, then moves through Augustine's two cities and early modern religious debates, to classic statements about political theology by such thinkers as Walter Benjamin and Carl Schmitt. Essays also consider the centrality of tolerance to liberal democracy, the recent French controversy over wearing the Muslim headscarf, and Bush's God talk.The volume includes a historic discussion between Jrgen Habermas and Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI, concerningthe prepolitical moral foundations of a republic, and it concludes with explorations of new, more open ways of conceptualizing society.<br>

In both France and Germany, philosophy, history, the novel, and poetry all testify to that. This conviction is not, of course, entirely new, and it can be traced far back in history.

  Abstract: To clarify it again, what, then, is the difference between religion and philosophy? A core distinction would be that the latter can subsist without a conception of the divine. In other words, philosophy does not necessitate a conception of another, higher world, with which to slander or to beautify, or to authorize its work in this world. It need not traffic in super-earthly hopes. Of what consequence then, is this emergent conception of a “post-secular” world where it is religion that is (so much stronger? or only more distinctly?) an intervening force in the practical affairs of this world, enmeshed<br>

It is critical, then, to avoid the danger of the confusion resulting from “badly put or badly analyzed problems.” Philosophy, or at least its significance, stands or falls with the problems it is capable of setting up.

  Book Title: Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness traces the reflections of the French philosopher and musicologist Vladimir Jankelevitch on the conditions and temporality of forgiveness in relation to creation, history, and memory. The author demonstrates the influence of Jewish and Christian thought on Jankelevitch's philosophy and compares his ideas about the gift character of forgiveness, the role of retributive emotions in conceptions of justice, and the limits of reason with those of Aristotle, Butler, Kant, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Scheler, Arendt, Derrida, Levinas, and Ricoeur. The Shoah was the pivotal historical event in Jankelevitch's life. As this book shows, Jankelevitch's question "Is forgiveness possible as a response to evil?" remains a potent philosophical conundrum today. Paradoxically, for Jankelevitch, evil is both the impetus and the obstacle to forgiveness.<br>

Traditionally, a first philosophy provides the cornerstone on which the rest of a thinker’s philosophy is constructed either upward in the architectonics of systematic structures or outward in concentric circles extending from the initial pulse of inspiration at the epicenter. Jankélévitch is fond of citing Henri Bergson, who wrote that a philosopher of value has said only one thing and the rest of his life and work is dedicated to that single point.¹ Or more poignantly, Jankélévitch’s philosophy follows Bergson’s insight that there is “something simple, infinitely simple, so<br>

It is Jewish, Christian, and Islamic and thus Hebrew, Greek, and Arabic, with, as Derrida emphasizes, a strong Christian Latin imprint.¹ The multiplicities of histories and their marks on language can be read from the translations of the word
                  repentanceitself. The Hebrew word for repentance,teshuva, means “to return” and has its Greek cognates instrepheinandepistrephein. The Greek term that is most commonly used in ancient philosophy and in the New Testament to designate repentance, however, ismetanoia, which means<br>

  Abstract: Richard Kearney is a possibility thinker, a philosopher, novelist, and poet fired by a passion for/of God. For Kearney, philosophy links imagination and affectivity with reason in a rhetoric of persuasion aiming for individual and societal transfiguration. In other words, as I read him, philosophy is not an abstract-theoretical exercise dedicated to getting things straight, finding solutions for particular theoretic problems. Rather, for Kearney, philosophy is a way of life, a spiritual exercise¹ working toward the incitement of passion for visionary transformation and cultural change rather than the elaboration of grand systems and the elimination of paradoxes.

  Abstract: In his own day, at Harvard University at the turn of the twentieth century, Josiah Royce was one of America’s premier philosophical exports, as well as a prominent interpreter of European and Asian thought to a domestic audience. Royce and his colleague William James were probably the two most prominent figures in American philosophy. Indeed, the arguments between Royce and James were played out for an international audience in numerous lectures, publications, and classrooms (the dialogue is evident, for example, in their respective Gifford Lectures, delivered between 1898 and 1902).¹ But after Royce’s death, and after two world wars, the<br>

  Author(s) Tunstall Dwayne<br>
  Abstract: During the last few decades of the nineteenth century and the first decade of the twentieth century, there was what we could call an idealist consensus among most US philosophers. This idealist consensus emerged in the late 1870s as American postsecondary education underwent a profound transformation. As research universities emerged from 1875 until 1910,¹ philosophy transitioned from being a subject studied primarily in the senior seminar in moral philosophy, and often taught by the president of a college, to being an autonomous discipline which trained professionals who were qualified to teach the main areas of philosophy (e.g., logic, metaphysics, and<br>

  Abstract: While scholarly attention has been paid to the influence of German idealism on the thought of Josiah Royce, few scholars have examined the relationship between Royce and Greek philosophy. When sustained attention has been given to this relationship, the focus has been on connections between Plato and Royce.¹ It is undeniable, however, that Royce also engaged the thought of Aristotle throughout his philosophical career.² In fact, some of his earliest writings, from his undergraduate days at the University of California at Berkeley, attest to Royce’s interest in Aristotle. “The Aim of Poetry” (1875) and “The Life-Harmony” (1875) are short essays,<br>

  Author(s) Kegley Jacquelyn Ann K.<br>
  Abstract: Josiah Royce, like other American philosophers of the first decade of the twentieth century, stressed the importance of philosophy for human affairs.¹ Royce argued ethics grounded all philosophy² and, like William James and John Dewey, he believed that one of philosophy’s tasks was to clarify social issues and to facilitate formulation of effective solutions to personal and social problems. One of the critical problems of his time was racial conflict, a problem that continues to be critical in our time. In 1908, Royce published a book called

  Abstract: The specter of centrifugal forces, which threaten to tear our country apart, has haunted us throughout our history. Josiah Royce stands out as one of our most perceptive critics and the creator of a philosophy that could heal the dangerous tendency toward fragmentation and disintegration. Royce’s work lies before us as a national treasure, but mostly a buried treasure.

  Author(s) Mahowald Mary B.<br>
  Abstract: As a philosophy graduate student in the 1960s, I was struck by the statement of Royce that his entire philosophy was encapsulated in his conception of community. Initially, my interest was sparked by the fact that I lived in a small community, and the term, as I understood it, identified an appealing ideal of how human beings in general might live or aspire to live together. I also thought, perhaps naively, that this ideal could be practically implemented, at least in part. So I wrote my dissertation on Royce, tracking how a pragmatic element intertwined with idealism in the development<br>

  Abstract: As we saw in Chapter 1, one of the achievements of Arendt’s and Benjamin’s critiques of history is to have drawn attention to the ways in which modern history effectively eliminates the dimension of human experience from its discursive structure. The question remains, though, as to how to situate the concept of experience with respect to this devaluation, especially given that one of the single most important innovations of modern philosophy was to have grounded knowledge in experience itself. In short: If modern history all but eliminates experience from its discourse, it is no less the case that the modern<br>

  Book Title: Technologies of Life and Death: From Cloning to Capital Punishment-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Oliver Kelly<br>
  Abstract: The central aim of this book is to approach contemporary problems raised by technologies of life and death as ethical issues that call for a more nuanced approach than mainstream philosophy can provide. To do so, it draws on the recently published seminars of Jacques Derrida to analyze the extremes of birth and dying insofar as they are mediated by technologies of life and death. With an eye to reproductive technologies, it shows how a deconstructive approach can change the very terms of contemporary debates over technologies of life and death, from cloning to surrogate motherhood to capital punishment, particularly insofar as most current discussions assume some notion of a liberal individual. The ethical stakes in these debates are never far from political concerns such as enfranchisement, citizenship, oppression, racism, sexism, and the public policies that normalize them. Technologies of Life and Death thus provides pointers for rethinking dominant philosophical and popular assumptions about nature and nurture, chance and necessity, masculine and feminine, human and animal, and what it means to be a mother or a father. In part, the book seeks to disarticulate a tension between ethics and politics that runs through these issues in order to suggest a more ethical politics by turning the force of sovereign violence back against itself. In the end, it proposes that deconstructive ethics with a psychoanalytic supplement can provide a corrective for moral codes and political cliches that turn us into mere answering machines.<br>

  Abstract: Insofar as Western philosophy, like Christianity, begins with a scene of capital punishment—that of Socrates being sentenced and put to death—doesn’t it also have its beginnings in the death penalty? Derrida answers that philosophers from Kant to Levinas justify the death penalty and “just” wars on the basis of

  Book Title: Reading Descartes Otherwise: Blind, Mad, Dreamy, and Bad-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Lee Kyoo<br>
  Abstract: Focusing on the first four images of the Other mobilized in Descartes' Meditations--namely, the blind, the mad, the dreamy, and the bad--Reading Descartes Otherwise casts light on what have heretofore been the phenomenological shadows of "Cartesian rationality." In doing so, it discovers dynamic signs of spectral alterity lodged both at the core and on the edges of modern Cartesian subjectivity. Calling for a Copernican reorientation of the very notion "Cartesianism," the book's series of close, creatively critical readings of Descartes' signature images brings the dramatic forces, moments, and scenes of the cogito into our own contemporary moment. The author patiently unravels the knotted skeins of ambiguity that have been spun within philosophical modernity out of such cliches as "Descartes, the abstract modern subject" and "Descartes, the father of modern philosophy"--a figure who is at once everywhere and nowhere. In the process, she revitalizes and reframes the legacy of Cartesian modernity, in a way more mindful of its proto-phenomenological traces.<br>

  Book Title: Thinking Through the Imagination: Aesthetics in Human Cognition-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Jones Jude<br>
  Abstract: Use your imagination! The demand is as important as it is confusing. What is the imagination? What is its value? Where does it come from? And where is it going in a time when even the obscene seems overdone and passe? This book takes up these questions and argues for the centrality of imagination in human cognition. It traces the development of the imagination in Kant's critical philosophy (particularly the Critique of Aesthetic Judgment) and claims that the insights of Kantian aesthetic theory, especially concerning the nature of creativity, common sense, and genius, influenced the development of nineteenth-century American philosophy. The book identifies the central role of the imagination in the philosophy of Peirce, a role often overlooked in analytic treatments of his thought. The final chapters pursue the observation made by Kant and Peirce that imaginative genius is a type of natural gift (ingenium) and must in some way be continuous with the creative force of nature. It makes this final turn by way of contemporary studies of metaphor, embodied cognition, and cognitive neuroscience.<br>

  Abstract: The imagination is notoriously difficult to define.¹ Indeed, this difficulty may explain the fact that prior to the Enlightenment there was no attempt to develop a unified theory of the imagination. In the history of ancient Greek philosophy, its amorphous character contributed to its being treated in two distinct, albeit related, ways. On the one hand, imagination was defined in terms of inspired artistic expression, outside the realm of explanation and description. On the other, it was described as a mysterious mental faculty that somehow accomplished the impossible, bridging the divide between the world of sensation and the world of<br>

  Abstract: For the past several decades, continental philosophy has exhibited an ongoing concern with what we might call liminal phenomena, among them friendship, the gift, mourning, responsibility, forgiveness, and hospitality. Of course, to call these “phenomena” already begs the question, or at least a question, the question of whether and to what extent these events actually take place. Thinking in the wake of Jacques Derrida it is impossible to ignore, for example, the excess of the call to forgiveness over the sort of forgiveness that actually takes place in concrete situations. In the case of hospitality, this excess is apparent in<br>

  Book Title: The Human Eros: Eco-ontology and the Aesthetics of Existence-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): ALEXANDER THOMAS M.<br>
  Abstract: The Human Eros: Eco-ontology and the Aesthetics of Existence explores themes in classical American philosophy, primarily that of John Dewey, but also in the thought of Ralph Waldo Emerson, George Santayana, and Native American traditions. The primary claim is that human beings exist with a need for the experience of meaning and value, a "Human Eros." Our various cultures are symbolic environments or "spiritual ecologies" within which the Human Eros can thrive. This is how we inhabit the earth. Encircling and sustaining our cultural existence is nature. Western philosophy has not generally provided adequate conceptual models for thinking ecologically. Thus the idea of "eco-ontology" undertakes to explore ways in which this might be done beginning with the primacy of Nature over Being, but also including the recognition of possibility and potentiality as inherent aspects of existence. I argue for the centrality of Dewey for an effective ecological philosophy. Both "pragmatism" and "naturalism" need to be contextualized within an emergentist, relational, non-reductive view of nature and an aesthetic, imaginative, non-reductive view of intelligence.<br>

I have also tried to establish connections with Asian philosophy, especially Buddhism, and with Native American wisdom traditions. The overall trajectory of these writings is to contextualize the ideas of “pragmatism” and “naturalism,” as popularly understood, within a broader and deeper philosophy of<br>

                  philosophiaas “the love of wisdom.”¹ But, as anyone reading on discovers, the ideal of wisdom itself is long gone. In its place is the view that philosophy provides exceedingly clever and conflicting answers to puzzles that do not particularly relate to the conduct of life or the discovery of its profoundest meanings. Most of those puzzles have to do with the problems of the justification of beliefs, putting philosophy in an auxiliary relationship to the project of knowledge.

  FOUR  THE BEING OF NATURE: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0c0w">The Human Eros: Eco-ontology and the Aesthetics of Existence</a><br>
  Abstract: American philosophy has been dominated by the theme of “Nature.”¹ From Edwards to Emerson to Dewey to Dennett, American thought has variously invoked Nature. But to articulate a philosophy of Nature is not thereby to espouse a form of “naturalism.” In fact, philosophies undertaken in the name of “naturalism” seem to have a different temperament than those that begin with the
                  thoughtof Nature as such. As a theme, “Nature” invites an expansive mood for reflection, while “naturalism” sounds constrictive and combative. “Nature” disposes the mind to musement, “pondering,”theoria, Denken—to becoming Emerson’s “transparent eyeball.” “Naturalism” has something of<br>

  Abstract: I wish here to explore the relation between our desire to exist meaningfully through action and the question that this poses for philosophy. My thesis is simple: We are erotic beings. Our Eros, however, is neither divine nor animal. It is distinctively human: We are beings who seek meaning imaginatively through each other, and the locus of this transformative encounter is the community. This model of human nature contrasts with the dominant view in analytic philosophy of humans as “minds” consisting of “states,” as purely “epistemic subjects” whose primary function is thought to lie in generating propositional claims about the<br>

  Abstract: The last decades have witnessed an important series of changes in Anglo-American philosophy, not least of which has been the revival of an interest in the classical phase of American pragmatism. The work of the pragmatists seems once again to speak to the current philosophical dilemmas. Former “analytic philosophers” like the late Richard Rorty, Joseph Margolis, and Hilary Putnam came to embrace some form of neopragmatism. By and large, however, this revival has come in the domain of epistemology and the debate on realism. I would like to show here how a reappraisal of an aspect of pragmatic moral theory<br>

Santayana was a careful writer, so already we should remark on those three key words: “discipline,” “mind,” and “heart.” This theme provides a guiding focus for understanding Santayana’s later work and illuminates what might appear to be the excessively eclectic nature of his ontology.

Among the throngs that fill the philosophical bestiary of the twentieth century, Santayana may be the one genuine contemplative of note. The majority of doctrines dominant in the century have been directed either toward the goal of action (Marxism, pragmatism, existentialism) or the problem of knowledge, truth, and meaning (pragmaticism, positivism, analytic philosophy, phenomenology).

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0c0w">The Human Eros: Eco-ontology and the Aesthetics of Existence</a><br>
  Abstract: It is more than an understatement to say that philosophy today is not associated with “spirituality.” Professional philosophers disdain the topic. Some may try to approach it with a philosophical method, analytic or phenomenological, that is not itself inherently spiritual but cognitive. Those philosophers writing within a spiritual tradition—for example, people like Søren Kierkegaard, Gabriel Marcel, Martin Buber, or D. T. Suzuki—are segregated as “religious thinkers” or, like Emmanuel Levinas, seen as leading double lives. Otherwise the term “spirituality” suggests the range of New Age nostrums seeking to fill the void left by abandoned faiths and vapid materialism.<br>

It is unsettling to anyone who wants to think of Dewey primarily as a “pragmatist,” since Dewey says the aim of philosophy should be to deal with the meaning of culture and not “inquiry” or “truth.” He says, “Meaning is wider in scope as well as more precious in value than is truthm and philosophy is occupied with meaning rather than with truth” (LW, 3:4). Truths are one kind of meaning, but they are only an “island” lying in “the ocean of meanings to which truth and<br>

  Book Title: Malicious Objects, Anger Management, and the Question of Modern Literature-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kreienbrock Jörg<br>
  Abstract: Why do humans get angry with objects? Why is it that a malfunctioning computer, a broken tool, or a fallen glass causes an outbreak of fury? How is it possible to speak of an inanimate object's recalcitrance, obstinacy, or even malice? When things assume a will of their own and seem to act out against human desires and wishes rather than disappear into automatic, unconscious functionality, the breakdown is experienced not as something neutral but affectively--as rage or as outbursts of laughter. Such emotions are always psychosocial: public, rhetorically performed, and therefore irreducible to a "private" feeling. By investigating the minutest details of life among dysfunctional household items through the discourses of philosophy and science, as well as in literary works by Laurence Sterne, Jean Paul, Friedrich Theodor Vischer, and Heimito von Doderer, Kreienbrock reconsiders the modern bourgeois poetics that render things the way we know and suffer them.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0cj5">Styles of Piety: Practicing Philosophy after the Death of God</a><br>
  Author(s) Statler Matthew<br>
  Abstract: Styles of Pietyexplores questions of value in light of the problem of nihilism articulated in Nietzsche’s pronouncement of the death of God. With the accomplishment of a thoroughly rationalized world, the categories that had promised to give meaning to experience proved untenable. The problem of the irrational appeared to be immanent to reason rather than merely an aberration from its proper functions, the aspirations of philosophy appeared to be inherently contradictory, and its ideals seemed to harbor coercive deceptions and tyrannies. Nevertheless, philosophers since Nietzsche have continued to pursue questions of value; indeed, they have found new avenues to<br>

  Author(s) Oliver Kelly<br>
  Abstract: In
                  On the Genealogy of Morals, Nietzsche describes Judeo-Christian morality as a result of the resentment of the weak who affirm themselves only by hating others: “Slave morality from the outset says No to what is ‘outside,’ what is ‘different,’ what is ‘not itself.’”¹ God in all His forms and the pious adherence to religion, philosophy, or science are the creations of weak wills who need something transcendent in order to justify and redeem earthly life. The master morality, on the other hand, is not so much the affirmation of difference or an embrace of others as a noble indifference<br>

  Author(s) Statler Matthew<br>
  Abstract: According to Aristotle’s
                  Metaphysics, the most distinctly unfunny thing about philosophy is the principle of noncontradiction. Indeed, we are encouraged as philosophers to respect this most serious and fundamental principle, namely, that “the same thing cannot at the same time and in the same respect both belong and not belong to the same object.”¹ Aristotle certainly refuses to take the matter lightly, providing eight different proofs and maintaining that the principle holds as a law with absolute psychological as well as ontological governance. With regard to the psychological application of the law, Aristotle insists that our thought and our actions<br>

  Abstract: The genealogist can no more exorcise the chimeras of origin around which philosophy traditionally performs its most pious dances, than the philosopher can cast out the shadows of his or her soul. Nor does genealogy seek to do so, as long as it is understood as the reflexive art of tracing implications, lineages, and inheritances, for such extirpation would at once neutralize the very possibility of genealogy, denying the lines of descent (
                  Herkünfte) that it interprets and exposes. The plurality of these lines of descent is opposed to the unity of origin (Ursprung) and exposes it as chimerical, just as<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0ckp">Doing Philosophy Personally: Thinking about Metaphysics, Theism, and Antiblack Racism</a><br>
  Abstract: Gabriel Marcel’s theistic philosophy traditionally has been labeled as a form of religious existentialism. While this is an accurate description of Marcel’s philosophy, I prefer to describe his philosophy as a sort of
                  reflective method. This way of describing his philosophy allows us to trace it back to its Kantian transcendentalist roots. Once we recognize the Kantian transcendentalist roots of his reflective method, we can better appreciate why he performs a detailed examination of the meaningfulness of human existence through such detrimental, life-affirming, or life-altering events as the death of a loved one, religious faith, despair, communion, hope, and love:<br>

  Abstract: I think that we are now in a position to outline, in very broad strokes, a Marcellian reflective method that takes seriously Gordon’s existential phenomenological account of antiblack racism. Such a modified Marcellian reflective method is still a phenomenological metaphysics. What I mean by
                  phenomenological metaphysicsis a metaphysics in which one refuses to investigate the essential structures of a mind-independent reality and concentrates, instead, on examining those ethical and religious values (for example, hope and faith) that enable persons to be closer to one another in a spiritual sense.

  Abstract: Heirs to the tradition deriving from Locke and his enlightened followers tend to be antipathetic to the varieties of philosophy that have appeared on the Continent—whether idealistic, materialistic, or existentialistic. Ideologically the English Channel is, as it were, wider than the Atlantic Ocean, and one might even say that the same climate of opinion that unites the Americans with the English alienates both from the turbulent atmosphere of Continental thought.

  Abstract: With the familiar twentieth century “revolution in philosophy” Karl Jaspers has had nothing to do: without involvement, rebellion is impossible. From his youth on he found academic orthodoxies incredible and irrelevant to the human situation. The teachers of philosophy seemed to him to be “personally pretentious and dogmatic,”¹ while their teaching struck him as “not really philosophy: for all its scientific pretensions it was always threshing out things not vital to the basic questions of our existence [Dasein].”² Later on, as a full professor, while recognizing that to be in any sense effective “we must proceed in conjunction with the<br>

How can we recommend either individual or social support of an exhausting intellectual enterprise that produces no practical results, leads to no unanimity, provides no reliable knowledge, and solves no problems? If, as Jaspers tells us, “we are scarcely entitled to say that we have progressed beyond Plato,”¹ is there any reason to continue? What powerful motives serve to perpetuate groundless speculations whose apparent futility is notorious?<br>

  Author(s) KOSELLECK REINHART<br>
  Abstract: The main difficulty in discussing chance in historiography is the fact that this subject has its own history, which as yet is unwritten. It is certainly impossible to discuss the role of chance in any given situation without first taking into account the whole terminology of the historian concerned. One needs to ask what is the opposite term that will exclude chance, or what is the overall term that makes it relative. Raymond Aron, for instance, begins his introduction to the philosophy of history with the antithesis, based on Cournot, between “

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x1c90">Interpreting Modern Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: In every creative field, but perhaps especially in philosophy, we tend to use the term “contemporary” not only in a eulogistic way but also as expressing our relief at escaping the burden of the past. The term often conveys the sense of crossing a territorial border and cutting off a bridge behind ourselves, a bridge that would have permitted the great dead philosophers to count for too much in our present inquiries. We sometimes feel that their presence would be overbearing and would inhibit our own efforts at innovation and argument. Not a historical sense of perspective but a liberation<br>

  II  The Insistency of Modern Sources from:

  Abstract: In functional terms, the historian of philosophy is an inquirer who finds his way around in some region of sources and who tries to aid others to achieve a similar familiarity. Whatever theoretical and cultural comparisons he may draw from other disciplines, they can never constitute the heart of his peculiar task. Primarily, he is responsible for accepting the discipline of the sources constituting a definite era of philosophy. His effectiveness is judged, above all, by the relative skill with which he makes everything else subserve the main work of improving our understanding and use of these primary texts. The<br>

  Abstract: Anyone working in a historical discipline experiences within himself, at certain times, a sympathetic reverberation of Stephen Dedalus’s cry that history is a nightmare from which he must awake. This feeling of suffocation steals over the philosopher when he attends to the long tradition of texts and studies in his field. Then, the history of philosophy seems to be an externally imposed and pressing structure, controlled entirely by lines of investigation laid out in the far distant past and extending into one’s present activity only in order to cramp and discourage the creative mind. This is indeed a nightmarish view<br>

  Abstract: We sometimes imagine the history of philosophy as being a Janus-faced colossus.¹ One of its legs is firmly planted in times past and the other in the present, just as one face is pointed resolutely toward the sources and the other toward contemporary discussion. This metaphor serves a good purpose in suggesting the wide diversity of materials and comparative questions which fall within the historian’s responsibility. But it blurs over the ground of their “interface” or communicative union, and hence it cannot ward off the tendency to introduce a neat split, down the middle, between man’s historical interests looking to<br>

Until now, the emphasis has fallen upon the elements in our general theory and their unification in actual historical writings and the learning situation. Were we to stop the examination at this point, however, we would be omitting one essential requirement and one distinctive viewpoint upon the entire process of understanding the modern sources. For the co-ingredient factors show their significance not only in reference to some forms of their actual unification and expression but also in reference to<br>

  Book Title: Value and Values-Economics and Justice in an Age of Global Interdependence<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Hershock Peter D.<br>
  Abstract: Especially in the aftermath of what is now being called the Great Recession, awareness has mounted of the imperative to question the modern divorce of economics from ethics. While the domains of economics and ethics were from antiquity through at least the eighteenth century understood in many cultures to be coterminous and mutually entailing, the modern assumption has been that the goal of maximizing human prosperity and the aim of justly enhancing our lives as persons and as communities were functionally and practically distinct. Working from a wide array of perspectives, the contributors to this volume offer a set of challenges to the assumed independence of the quantitative and qualitative dimensions of human and planetary well-being. Reflecting on the complex interrelationship among economics, justice, and equity, the book resists "one size fits all" approaches and struggles to revitalize the marriage of economics and ethics by activating cultural differences as the basis of mutual contribution to shared human flourishing. The publication of this important collection will stimulate or extend critical debates among scholars and students working in a number of disciplines in the social sciences and humanities, including philosophy, history, environmental studies, economics, and law.<br>

  Abstract: I worry that our best ethics are not up to the task of protecting the global environment from our worst economics. This is not a practical claim; it is a philosophical one.

  Abstract: What can comparative philosophy contribute to thinking about values, economics, and justice? Can we directly apply philosophy in general, and comparative philosophy in particular, to these problems? Martin Heidegger, one of the protagonists of this essay, has on occasion made it clear that philosophy is literally “useless,”¹ and so let me start with one of my favorite Heidegger quotes, to give an indication of what I will argue in this essay: “Philosophy . . . cannot be directly applied, or judged by its usefulness in the manner of economic or other professional knowledge.

  Abstract: Dōgen and Aristotle appear to stand in diametrical opposition to each other on the value of poverty. Dōgen repeatedly admonishes monks and nuns to be poor and advises laypeople that even they would be better off if they gave up all their worldly possessions. Aristotle, on the other hand, famously describes poverty as “the parent of revolution and crime.”¹ This marked divergence is noteworthy not because we should expect Dōgen and Aristotle to march in lockstep together but because Aristotelian philosophy and Buddhist philosophy both advocate finding a middle path between extremes. Thus, it is surprising to find two thinkers<br>

  Book Title: Muscially Sublime: Indeterminacy, Infinity, Irresolvability-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wurth Kiene Brillenburg<br>
  Abstract: Musically Sublime rewrites musically the history and philosophy of the sublime. Music enables us to reconsider the traditional course of sublime feeling on a track from pain to pleasure. Resisting the notion that there is a single format for sublime feeling, Wurth shows how, from the mid eighteenth century onward, sublime feeling is, instead, constantly rearticulated in a complex interaction with musicality. Wurth takes as her point of departure Immanuel Kant's Critique of Judgment and Jean-Francois Lyotard's aesthetic writings of the 1980s and 1990s. Kant framed the sublime narratively as an epic of self-transcendence. By contrast, Lyotard sought to substitute open immanence for Kantian transcendence, yet he failed to deconstruct the Kantian epic. The book performs this deconstruction by juxtaposing eighteenth- and nineteenth-century conceptions of the infinite, Sehnsucht, the divided self, and unconscious drives with contemporary readings of instrumental music. Critically assessing Edmund Burke, James Usher, E.T.A. Hoffmann, Novalis, Friedrich Holderlin, Arthur Schopenhauer, Richard Wagner, and Friedrich Nietzsche, this book re-presents the sublime as a feeling that defers resolution and hangs suspended between pain and pleasure. Musically Sublime rewrites the mathematical sublime as differance, while it redresses the dynamical sublime as trauma: unending, undetermined, unresolved. Whereas most musicological studies in this area have focused on traces of the Kantian sublime in Handel, Haydn, and Beethoven, this book calls on the nineteenth-century theorist Arthur Seidl to analyze the sublime of, rather than in, music. It does so by invoking Seidl's concept of formwidrigkeit ("form-contrariness") in juxtaposition with Romantic piano music, (post)modernist musical minimalisms, and Lyotard's postmodern sublime. It presents a sublime of matter, rather than form-performative rather than representational. In doing so, Musically Sublime shows that the binary distinction Lyotard posits between the postmodern and romantic sublime is finally untenable.<br>

Genealogy, for Foucault, was no longer naïve, in that it no longer searched for the pure origin of things but rather showed how such origins were constituted out of incoherent fragments, accidents, errors, and failings.

  Book Title: Intention Interpretation-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): ISEMINGER GARY<br>
  Abstract: "...an excellent and comprehensive discussion of a debate that was initiated in this century in William Wimsatt's and Monroe C. Beardsley's influential article 'The Intentional Fallacy.'...this is a splendidly conceived and very useful collection of essays. Readers will want to take issue with the arguments of individual authors, but this is to be expected in a volume at the cutting edge of a fertile philosophical controversy." --David Novitz, The Philosophical Quarterly "What is the connection, if any, between the author's intentions in (while) writing a work of literature and the truth (acceptability, validity) of interpretive statements about it?" With this question, Gary Isminger introduces a literary debate that has been waged for the past four decades and is addressed by philosophers and literary theorists in Intention and Interpretation. Thirteen essays discuss the role of appeals to the author's intention in interpreting works of literature. A well-known argument by E.D. Hirsch serves as the basic text, in which he defends the appeal to the author's intention against Wimsatt and Beardsley's claim that such an appeal involved "the intentional fallacy." The essays, mostly commissioned by the editor, explore the presuppositions and consequences of arguing for the importance of the author's intentions in the way Hirsch does. Connections emerge between this issue and many fundamental issues in metaphysics and the philosophy of mind as well as in aesthetics. The (old) "New Criticism" and current Post-Structuralism tend to agree in disenfranchising the author, and many people now are disinclined even to consider the alternative. Hirsch demurs, and arguments like his deserve the careful attention, both from critics and sympathizers, that they receive here. Literary scholars and philosophers who are sympathetic to Continental as well as to Anglo-American styles of philosophy are among the contributors. "This is a timely book appearing as it does when postmodernist views of the death of the author are disappearing quickly from the scene. As a collection it exemplifies the best work that is being done on this problem at the moment, and it will no doubt inspire further debate." --The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism "[T]his volume contains important articles illuminating the central debate over the role and relevance of authorial intentions in literary interoperation." --British Journal of Aesthetics<br>

  Book Title: The Roots Of Thinking-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): Sheets-Johnstone Maxine<br>
  Abstract: "A significant contribution to the study of early humans, this book is a philosophical anthropology.... it makes genuinely novel, and highly persuasive, claims within the field itself." --David Depew In this ground-breaking interdisciplinary study about conceptual origins, Maxine Sheets-Johnstone shows that there is an indissoluble bond between hominid thinking and hominid evolution, a bond cemented by the living body. Her thesis is concretely illustrated in eight paleoanthropological case studies ranging from tool-using/tool-making to counting, sexuality, representation, language, death, and cave art. In each case, evidence is brought forward that shows how thinking is modeled on the body-specifically, how concepts are generated by animate form and the tactile-kinesthetic experience. Later chapters critically examine key theoretical and methodological issues posed by the thesis, Sheets-Johnstone demonstrates in detail how and why a corporeal turn in philosophy and the human sciences can yield insights no less extraordinary than those produced by the linguistic turn. In confronting the currently popular doctrine of cultural relativism and the classic Western metaphysical dualism of mind and body, she shows how pan-cultural invariants of human bodily life have been discounted and how the body itself has not been given its due. By a precise exposition of how a full-scale hermeneutics and a genetic phenomenology may be carried out with respect to conceptual origins, she shows how methodological issues are successfully resolved. "Ranging across the humanities and sciences, this thoroughly original book challenges both traditional metaphysics and contemporary cultural relativism. In their place, it persuasively develops a phenomenonological, tactile-kinesthetic account of the origins of thinking. This philosophical anthropology could not be more timely. It replaces the 'linguistic turn' with a promising new 'corporeal turn.'" --John J. Stuhr, University of Oregon "This work takes a much-needed stand in the inter-disciplinary field of philosophical anthropology. Sheets-Johnstone is well-read in the history of philosophy and in contemporary anthropology. The point of view she offers is inventive, insightful, well-established, and fruitful." --Thomas M. Alexander, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt14bt7sz">Studies in Philosophy for Children</a><br>
  Abstract: PHILOSOPHY FOR CHILDREN is an attempt to reconstruct and present the history of philosophy in such a way that children can appropriate it for themselves so as to reason well in a self-correcting manner. For children to develop the ability to think well for themselves about matters of importance, what is required is an educational enterprise consisting of philosophical dialogue within the context of a classroom community of inquiry. Such a community concerns itself with the development of good critical and creative thinking and the cultivation of good judgment. But it is much more than this: Philosophy for Children is<br>

  Author(s) Lipman Matthew<br>
  Abstract: THE PROJECT of connecting philosophical concepts in the Philosophy for Children curriculum with the concepts in academic philosophy from which they were derived (or that they resemble) can be of considerable value for teachers and scholars wishing to ascertain the grounds of the curriculum in the philosophical tradition. We should not, however, restrict such an inquiry to philosophical concepts and the history of philosophy. A parallel enterprise might seek to show how the skills of logic have been employed at key points in any history (whether of philosophy, of science, of technology, or of the humanities) so as to provide<br>

                     Harry Stottlemeier’s Discoveryand the other Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children (IAPC) materials join philosophical wonder with childhood. Ironically, I doubt that Aristotle would be pleased, at least not in regard to IAPC’s approach to moral education.

  Author(s) Sharp Ann Margaret<br>
  Abstract: THERE IS SOMETHING wonderful, yet shocking, about waking up one morning and finding yourself in the midst of feminism in philosophy and Philosophy for Children. It seems like such a short time ago that both concepts were not only unheard of in professional philosophical circles but not even considered as possibilities in education. I remember myself in my freshman year at a Catholic girls’ high school. It was spring, and the nuns had told us that we would have a five-day retreat.

  Abstract: In the second century ce, Tertullian asked the question, “What indeed has Athens to do with Jerusalem?”¹ It is a question that has continued to echo through the learned books and journals, the lecture halls and classrooms of theological institutions in the ensuing centuries. What is the relationship, if any, between philosophical reason, captured by the symbol of Athens, the home of Greek philosophy, and Christian faith, captured in the symbol of Jerusalem? Whatever one might think of the question and its theoretical answers, historically there has been a strong tendency for philosophical questions and issues to arise within the<br>

  Abstract: This chapter discusses theological foundations for knowledge of God. Our approach emphasizes the conversion of the theologian and builds on previous chapters by illustrating how a theologian’s fourfold conversion determines the horizon within which discourse about God becomes meaningful. The chapter begins by identifying the main lines or themes of several major conversations about knowledge of God in the history of philosophy and theology. In this way, the reader may gain a sense of how our discussion of foundations allows us to revisit classic themes or questions about God.<br>

My college roommate and I invented it in our dorm room as a way of finding answers to some of our most contentious debates. We were religion and philosophy majors, which means we argued about religion and politics as a kind of recreational sport.

  Abstract: There is more than one fool in the Bible, and I would like to start with another fool than Paul’s, but whose legacy in the history of theology (and philosophy) has been equally significant. I want to talk about the fool from Psalms 14 and 53, who dares to say in his heart: “There is no God.” How is the foolishness of this fool (

  Author(s) Banham Gary<br>
  Abstract: Since the beginning of the 1990s there has been a marked revival of interest in both Kant and aesthetics.¹ This revival has been accompanied with a move beyond the theoretical positions that sought to displace the notion of aesthetics and often requires a rethinking of the relationship between criticism and philosophy. I wish to present here an account of Kant’s ‘invention’ of aesthetics that allows its terms to become both operative within and yet also transformed by the practice of critical engagement with literary and visual works of art. It is important to mention however that the context for this<br>

  Book Title: The subject of love-Hélène Cixous and the feminine divine<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Renshaw Sal<br>
  Abstract: *The Subject of Love: Hélène Cixous and the Feminine Divine* is about abundant, generous, other-regarding love. In the history of Western ideas of love, such a configuration has been inseparable from our ideas about divinity and the sacred; often reserved only for God; and rarely thought of as a human achievement. This book is a substantial engagement with her philosophies of love, inviting the reader to reflect on the conditions of subjectivity that just might open us to something like a divine love of the other. Renshaw follows this thread in this genealogy of abundant love: the thread that connects the subject of love from 5th century B.C.E. Greece and Plato, to the 20th century protestant theology of agapic love of Anders Nygren, to the late 20th century poetico-philosophy of Hélène Cixous. This study will be of particular interest to academics and students of the history of gender, cultural studies, criticism and gender studies<br>

  Book Title: Aesthetics and subjectivity-  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): BOWIE ANDREW<br>
  Abstract: New, completely revised and re-written edition. Offers a detailed, but asccesible account of the vital German philosophical tradition of thinking about art and the self. Looks at recent historical research and contemporary arguments in philosophy and theory in the humanities, following the path of German philosophy from Kant, via Ficthe and Holderlin, the early Romantis, Schelling, Hegel, Scleimacher, to Nietzsche. Develops the approaches to subjectivity, aesthetics, music and language in relation to new theoretical developments bridging the divide between the continental and analytical traditions of philosophy. The huge growth of interest in German philosophy as a resource for re-thinking both literary and cultural theory, and contemporary philosophy will make this an indispensible read.<br>

  INTRODUCTION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jcnj">Aesthetics and subjectivity</a><br>
  Abstract: In recent years it has become apparent that many questions which first became manifest during the emergence of philosophical aesthetics at the end of the eighteenth century play a decisive role both in mainstream philosophy and in literary theory. The critiques of the idea that the world is ‘ready-made’ by Hilary Putnam and other pragmatically oriented thinkers, the concomitant attention by Nelson Goodman, Richard Rorty and others to the ‘world-making’ aspects of language, the related moves in the philosophy of language on the part of Donald Davidson and others towards holistic accounts of meaning, and the orientation in post-structuralism towards<br>

  1  Modern philosophy and the emergence of aesthetic theory: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jcnj">Aesthetics and subjectivity</a><br>
  Abstract: The importance attributed to aesthetic questions in recent philosophy becomes easier to grasp if one considers the reasons for the emergence of modern aesthetic theory. Kant’s main work on aesthetics, the ‘third Critique’, the
                  Critique of Judgement(CJ) (1790), forms part of his response to unresolved questions which emerge from hisCritique of Pure Reason(CPR) (1781) andCritique of Practical Reason(1787).¹ In order to understand the significance of theCJone needs therefore to begin by looking at the first two Kantian Critiques.² The essential problem they entail, which formed the focus of reactions to Kant’s work at<br>

  2  German Idealism and early German Romanticism from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jcnj">Aesthetics and subjectivity</a><br>
  Abstract: The immediate consequences from the 1790s onwards of the perceived failure of Kant’s attempt to ground philosophy in the principle of subjectivity are apparent in two areas of philosophy which carry the broad names ‘German Idealism’, which is mainly associated with Fichte, Schelling and Hegel; and ‘early Romanticism’, which is mainly associated with Novalis, Friedrich Schlegel and (in some respects) Friedrich Schleiermacher.¹ There are, as we shall see, crucial respects in which these two currents of thought can be distinguished. It would, though, be mistaken to regard either German Idealism or early Romanticism as unified philosophical schools, which is one<br>

  5  Hegel: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jcnj">Aesthetics and subjectivity</a><br>
  Abstract: Hegel’s work has come in recent years to exemplify many of the choices facing contemporary philosophy. The changed status of Hegel can, though, seem rather odd, given the labyrinthine nature of his texts, the huge divergences between his interpreters from his own time until today, and the fact that some of the philosophers who now invoke him come from an analytical tradition noted for its insistence on a clarity not always encountered in Hegel himself. Even contemporary interpreters range between those who still pursue his grand aims by trying to show how he offers a systematic answer to the major<br>

  6  Schleiermacher: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jcnj">Aesthetics and subjectivity</a><br>
  Abstract: The recent growth of interest in German Idealist and Romantic philosophy has tended to focus on Fichte and Hegel, and, to a lesser extent, on Schelling. However, given the philosophical motivation for the new attention to the thought of this period, it is actually rather strange that its main focus has not been the work of F.D.E. Schleiermacher (1768–1834). The contingent reasons for the neglect of Schleiermacher are, admittedly, quite simple. Schleiermacher’s theological work, as the major Protestant theologian of the nineteenth century, has largely determined his reputation, and he did not produce de fi nitive versions of his<br>

  7  Music, language and literature from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jcnj">Aesthetics and subjectivity</a><br>
  Abstract: The divergent interpretations of the relationship between music and language in modernity are inseparable from the main divergences between philosophical conceptions of language. The attempt to explain language in representational terms in the empiricist tradition that eventually leads to analytical philosophy, and the understanding of language as a form of social action and as constitutive of the world we inhabit in the hermeneutic tradition give rise to very different conceptions of music. One paradigmatic contrast has emerged in the preceding chapters, which can somewhat crudely be summarised as follows. On the one hand, music can be regarded as a deficient<br>

  8  Nietzsche and the fate of Romantic thought from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jcnj">Aesthetics and subjectivity</a><br>
  Abstract: The alternatives in some of the most controversial debates in recent philosophy often come down to whether what is at issue is in essence a Hegelian, or a Nietzschean position. The differences between Habermas and Rorty, or between the early Derrida and Davidson, for example, can be seen in these terms. These figures are all what Habermas would call ‘post metaphysical’ thinkers. However, despite their renunciation of the idea of a foundational ‘first philosophy’, Habermas and Davidson wish to sustain a universalist conception of rationality; Rorty and Derrida, in contrast, think that such a conception is a residue of a<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jdgf">Time and world politics</a><br>
  Abstract: THIS chapter examines accounts of political time that are premised on the critique of philosophy of history and historicism. We will begin by looking briefly at two thinkers at the end of the nineteenth century who offered alternatives to the conflation of
                  kairosandchronosin historicist and scientific accounts of time, Nietzsche and Bergson. This then sets the scene for exploring ways in which the assumptions and implications of historicism, in particular Marxist versions of historicism, have been challenged by the following thinkers: Arendt, Benjamin, Derrida and Deleuze. The arguments of these thinkers differ, but they all involve rejecting<br>

  Abstract: Origen of Alexandria (c. 185–c. 254) lived through a turbulent period for the Christian Church, when persecution was widespread and little or no doctrinal consensus existed among the various regional churches. In this environment Gnosticism flourished, and Origen was the first not only to refute Gnosticism, but also to offer an alternative Christian system that was more rigorous and philosophically respectable than the mythological speculations of the various Gnostic sects. Although Origen was also an astute critic of the pagan philosophy of his era, he also learned much from it and adapted its most useful and edifying teachings to<br>

  Abstract: Hans Urs von Balthasar (1905–1988) was born in Lucerne, Switzerland. He was a man of remarkable energy, discipline, and talent, and the breadth and profundity of his publications place him at the forefront of twentieth-century Catholic theologians. He never held an academic post, and he adhered to none of the reigning theological movements of his day. Although he studied philosophy and theology as a Jesuit novitiate, his doctoral education was in German studies, a blend of philosophical and literary analysis. His theology was forged in critical debate with the biblical authors, Greco-Roman philosophy, ancient and medieval theology, and modern<br>

  CHAPTER 6  Education That Integrates Culture and Religion from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt15zc91j">A Godly Humanism</a><br>
  Abstract: In the united states, at the mention of “religion,” what people often think of first is a moral code. We’re a pragmatic people; we’re practical people; we’re concerned about how to do things and how to act. In fact, pragmatism as a philosophy argues that theorizing follows action. Whereas classical Western wisdom stresses the thinking first and only thereupon the action that follows, Americans are very strong on action, and when it comes to defining religion, we tend to divide religions according to how they influence people’s behavior. Is it a “strict” religion? Is it an “easy” religion? What does<br>

  Book Title: God's Word and the Church's Council-Vaticann II and Divine Revelation<br>
  Publisher: ATF Press<br>
  Author(s): Monaghan Christopher<br>
  Abstract: The publication of the Vatican II document on Divine Revelation (Dei Verbum) was an exciting and challenging moment for the Church. While honouring the tradition, it also marked a quite dramatic development in the Church’s attitude to modern critical analysis of the Bible and encouraged study and reflection on it by all members of the Church. The golden jubilee of its publication is a timely moment for a book such as this. It contains essays on various aspects of Dei Verbum by authors from around the world. They write from the perspective of their respective disciplines of biblical studies, patristics, theology, liturgy, philosophy, and communications media. They situate the document within the Jewish-Christian tradition, assess its reception since Vatican II, and its implications for the future.<br>

  Author(s) Owens John F<br>
  Abstract: The relation between
                  Dei Verbum (DV) and the philosophy of Hans-Georg Gadamer can be discerned in a contrast that is drawn in a key paragraph in whichDVaddresses the question of interpretation. The paragraph begins by endorsing use of the historical-critical method, recommending attention to what the authors of the sacred texts originally meant, the literary forms they used, customary patterns of expression which prevailed at the time of composition, and so on. But the Council fathers add a qualifying paragraph, insisting that the scholarly enterprise should keep in mind ‘the content and unity of the whole of Scripture’,<br>

  Abstract: Postmodernism, a loosely related group of memes in philosophy, cultural theory, gender relations, design, the arts and popular culture, also has its own literary hermeneutics.

  Book Title: Redemptive Hope: From the Age of Enlightenment to the Age of Obama-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Campbell Timothy C.<br>
  Abstract: This is a book about the need for redemptive narratives to ward off despair and the dangers these same narratives create by raising expectations that are seldom fulfilled. The quasi-messianic expectations produced by the election of President Barack Obama in 2008, and their diminution, were stark reminders of an ongoing struggle between ideals and political realities. Redemptive Hope begins by tracing the tension between theistic thinkers, for whom hope is transcendental, and intellectuals, who have striven to link hopes for redemption to our intersubjective interactions with other human beings. Lerner argues that a vibrant democracy must draw on the best of both religious thought and secular liberal political philosophy. By bringing Richard Rorty's pragmatism into conversation with early-twentieth-century Jewish thinkers, including Martin Buber and Ernst Bloch, Lerner begins the work of building bridges, while insisting on holding crucial differences in dialectical tension. Only such a dialogue, he argues, can prepare the foundations for modes of redemptive thought fit for the twenty-first century.<br>

  Abstract: What is the future of Continental philosophy of religion? These forward-looking essays address the new thinkers and movements that have gained prominence since the generation of Derrida, Deleuze, Foucault, and Levinas and how they will reshape Continental philosophy of religion in the years to come. They look at the ways concepts such as liberation, sovereignty, and post-colonialism have engaged this new generation with political theology and the new pathways of thought that have opened in the wake of speculative realism and recent findings in neuroscience and evolutionary psychology. Readers will discover new directions in this challenging and important area of philosophical inquiry.<br>

  Abstract: The future has always figured prominently in Continental philosophy of religion. Indeed, we might even say that the (relatively short) history of Continental philosophy of religion has been defined by the future. So by way of introduction, our task will be to chart the concept of the future that has animated, inspired, and propelled this burgeoning discourse, which, by our reckoning, has both come into its own and reached a turning point, if not a terminal point or a fork in the road. Put otherwise, by posing the question of the future of Continental philosophy of religion, we are posing<br>

For a younger generation of philosophers, the so-called theological turn is the last straw. If the religious turn is where Continental philosophy ends up, supplying a final place for religion to hide before the “singularity” arrives,² then Continental philosophy is dead.

  Abstract: The relationship between contemporary Continental philosophy of religion and “the new metaphysics” (twenty-first-century metaphysics in the Continental tradition, otherwise referred to as “the new metaphysics,” “the new materialism,” “the new realism,” or, more controversially, “speculative realism”) so far remains largely an unexplored relationship, especially regarding areas of mutual concern, influence, or crossover.¹ Despite new and exciting inroads made by philosophers such as Iain Grant and his articulations of a neo-Platonic–Hegelian Absolute (a perspective not entirely unconducive to the nature theologies of the German idealists), François Laurelle’s non-philosophy and surrounding work on “non-theology,” or even Bruno Latour’s explorations of the<br>

  Abstract: A case could be made that philosophy is the safeguard of human freedom. For if our environmental, economic, and cultural worlds are determined primarily by
                  howwe think, and only subsequently bywhatwe think, then all power passes through thought, and thinking otherwise is the essence of liberation. Thus liberation would be conceived as liberation from oppression, injustice, ignorance, and illusion.

  Abstract: Claims about the future involve perceptions of the present and discourses about the past. This is especially so in the case of money. As a peculiar social technology that indexes value and regulates relations of credit and debt, it reflects and shapes expectations and, hence, projects a future. In consideration of the course this monetary future might take in the West, theology and the philosophy of religion are necessary resources with which to engage. As genealogies of modernity and capitalism have laid bare, theological and religiously inflected philosophical discourses have been determinative for the Western sociopolitical imaginary.¹ Money has likewise<br>

  Abstract: Whichever continent, real or imagined, it is aligned with, philosophy of religion in the United States occupies a somewhat uneasy position alongside other disciplines and institutional arrangements. Scholars who work on or within Asian philosophical traditions find themselves facing much the same predicament as those who locate themselves somewhere within the vaguely post-phenomenological landscape called “Continental philosophy of religion.” To what disciplinary genus does this species of scholarship—which has also become a recognizable
                  styleof scholarship—belong? To philosophy? To religious studies? To theology? Perhaps to none of these options? In what follows, I would like to think about<br>

  Author(s) Vahanian Noëlle<br>
  Abstract: The general theme of this current volume is that of the future of Continental philosophy of religion. One could focus on established or more recently introduced authorial paradigms—for instance and to name but a few, Derrida, Deleuze, Caputo, Malabou, Goodchild, Westphal, Laruelle, and so on—and assess their legacy, debate their future, or perhaps even establish a vanguard. But in the vanguard or not, these contemporary thinkers and their followers attest to the recent so-called return to religion of Continental phenomenological thought. Cast in this way, the volume’s theme could suggest not merely that faith and religious thought have<br>

  Abstract: In this essay I want to explore Schelling’s cosmological philosophy by comparing it to early Indian philosophy on one hand and the philosophy of Luce Irigaray on the other hand. In the first section I begin with a comparison of Schelling’s cosmogonical question from
                  Ages of the Worldand the Indian Vedic cosmogonic hymn “Nasadasiya.” The basic question of this section on the “philosophy of beginning” is whence comes the creation of the world. There is no direct textual evidence in Schelling’s writings that he read this particular Vedic hymn, but there are striking similarities between Schelling’s cosmogonical concepts and<br>

  Author(s) Goh Irving<br>
  Abstract: In seeking to outline a future of Continental philosophy of religion, as is the objective of this volume, perhaps we first need to trace the trajectory of the future of Continental philosophy itself. It could be said that the latter endeavor had already been put in place by Jean-Luc Nancy sometime in 1986, when he posed the question of
                  qui vient après le sujet,or “who comes after the subject,” a question coming in the wake of the dissolution, or the putting to death, of thesubjectby Continental philosophy since the late 1960s. What Nancy’s question implies is that<br>

  Book Title: Degrees of Givenness-On Saturation in Jean-Luc Marion<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): GSCHWANDTNER CHRISTINA M.<br>
  Abstract: The philosophical work of Jean-Luc Marion has opened new ways of speaking about religious convictions and experiences. In this exploration of Marion's philosophy and theology, Christina M. Gschwandtner presents a comprehensive and critical analysis of the ideas of saturated phenomena and the phenomenology of givenness. She claims that these phenomena do not always appear in the excessive mode that Marion describes and suggests instead that we consider degrees of saturation. Gschwandtner covers major themes in Marion's work-the historical event, art, nature, love, gift and sacrifice, prayer, and the Eucharist. She works within the phenomenology of givenness, but suggests that Marion himself has not considered important aspects of his philosophy.<br>

  INTRODUCTION: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gz4t7">Degrees of Givenness</a><br>
  Abstract: As the subtitle of
                  Being Givenindicates, Marion’s philosophy can be defined as a “phenomenology of givenness.” The term “givenness” featured already in his earlier preparatory workReduction and Givennesswhere he first developed the notion of a “third reduction” to givenness. “Givenness” translates the French donation, which ostensibly translates the German termGegebenheit,which is an important Husserlian term also used by Heidegger, as Marion contends in a more recent essay on that topic (RoG, 35–49; FP, 45–58). This translation of Gegebenheit withdonationand givenness is not uncontroversial, and Marion has been challenged on this.¹ The<br>

  Book Title: Kierkegaard and Death-  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): BUBEN ADAM<br>
  Abstract: Few philosophers have devoted such sustained, almost obsessive attention to the topic of death as Søren Kierkegaard. Kierkegaard and Death brings together new work on Kierkegaard's multifaceted discussions of death and provides a thorough guide to the development, in various texts and contexts, of Kierkegaard's ideas concerning death. Essays by an international group of scholars take up essential topics such as dying to the world, living death, immortality, suicide, mortality and subjectivity, death and the meaning of life, remembrance of the dead, and the question of the afterlife. While bringing Kierkegaard's philosophy of death into focus, this volume connects Kierkegaard with important debates in contemporary philosophy.<br>

  Author(s) Muench Paul<br>
  Abstract: Doing philosophy may be hazardous to your health, resulting in a condition of “absentmindedness” or distraction in which you forget yourself.¹ In such a case, philosophy becomes an activity that positively interferes with the age-old Socratic task of attending to and caring for the self, and may even have the opposite effect of making people “incompetent to act” (CUP, 1:135/SKS 7, 126). If you are the type of person who is drawn to philosophy and perhaps insufficiently aware of its hazards, then what could be more valuable than a book that seeks to alert you to these dangers, and in<br>

  Abstract: “A free man thinks of nothing less than of death”¹ according to proposition 47 of Spinoza’s
                  Ethics,in which death is portrayed as a saddening thought, one which, moreover, depletes our potential to work and to think. The refusal to think about death, and specifically its association with sadness and pain for those left behind, is a constant theme in the history of philosophy. The image of Socrates presented inPhaedo,happy to accept his own death, is emblematic of the philosopher who has learned how to die. Xanthippe, his wife, is expelled from this scene in which philosophy and<br>

  Book Title: Phenomenology in Anthropology-A Sense of Perspective<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): JACKSON MICHAEL<br>
  Abstract: This volume explores what phenomenology adds to the enterprise of anthropology, drawing on and contributing to a burgeoning field of social science research inspired by the phenomenological tradition in philosophy. Essays by leading scholars ground their discussions of theory and method in richly detailed ethnographic case studies. The contributors broaden the application of phenomenology in anthropology beyond the areas in which it has been most influential-studies of sensory perception, emotion, bodiliness, and intersubjectivity-into new areas of inquiry such as martial arts, sports, dance, music, and political discourse.<br>

  Author(s) Houston Christopher<br>
  Abstract: What is phenomenology? And why should anthropologists, as well as students of history, psychology, education, or political economy be interested in it? Within philosophy, phenomenology is as diverse as its practitioners. Indeed, Moran (2000: 3) in an introduction to philosophical traditions of phenomenology finds it important to warn readers not to overstate the degree to which phenomenology “coheres into an agreed method, or accepts one theoretical outlook, or one set of philosophical theses about consciousness, knowledge, and the world.” Some of this diversity continues to be a feature of anthropological uses of phenomenology, as we show here.

  Book Title: Stanley Cavell, Religion, and Continental Philosophy-  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): DAHL ESPEN<br>
  Abstract: The American philosopher Stanley Cavell (b. 1926) is a secular Jew who by his own admission is obsessed with Christ, yet his outlook on religion in general is ambiguous. Probing the secular and the sacred in Cavell's thought, Espen Dahl explains that Cavell, while often parting ways with Christianity, cannot dismiss it either. Focusing on Cavell's work as a whole, but especially on his recent engagement with Continental philosophy, Dahl brings out important themes in Cavell's philosophy and his conversation with theology.<br>

  ONE  Modernism and Religion from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gz98c">Stanley Cavell, Religion, and Continental Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: Right from his entrance on the philosophical scene in the late 1960s, Stanley Cavell has insisted that philosophy is confronted with the same cultural problems, burdens, and commitments—collectively known as modernism—that confront art. From some moment during the nineteenth century, artistic conventions for representation and composition no longer seemed to be adequate bearers of contemporary expression; along with the corrosion of the given framework of conventions, the stable relation between artist and audience also became more fragile, at times broken. As Cavell sees it, this situation is mirrored in philosophy: after Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Wittgenstein, there is no<br>

  THREE  Acknowledging God from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gz98c">Stanley Cavell, Religion, and Continental Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: Having presented Cavell’s openness toward the problem of religion, I now proceed to more theologically charged territory in order to explore some possibilities offered by Cavell’s philosophy. In doing so, I focus on one of Cavell’s signature concepts, namely acknowledgment. Although acknowledgment has a wide application in Cavell’s thinking—including our relation to the world, others, different modernist artistic media, and our own conditions as speaking animals—it was initially developed in response to the skeptical problem of other minds. Since the problem of other minds has remained at the center of Cavell’s concerns, and since this problem highlights features<br>

  FOUR  Skepticism, Finitude, and Sin from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gz98c">Stanley Cavell, Religion, and Continental Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: Acknowledgment is an interpretation of knowledge, Cavell insists, or perhaps an interpretation of what lies at the heart of any knowledge, entailing a certain sense of receptivity or responsiveness, a willingness to confess and reveal oneself in a practical and responsible reply to the other, the world, or as I have suggested, to God. But such acknowledgment presupposes a separation from that which one responds to, or more generally, it presupposes finitude. Central to Wittgenstein’s philosophy, and thus also to Cavell’s own philosophy, is therefore the acknowledgment of human limitation, an acknowledgment that, however, seems hard to achieve. A significant<br>

  CONCLUSION: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gz98c">Stanley Cavell, Religion, and Continental Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: In this book I have tried to elaborate the analogies and overlappings between Cavell’s philosophy and his religious perspective, either expressed philosophically or theologically. If such an undertaking might be deemed risky, it is because of Cavell’s own repeated resistance toward certain Christian depictions of the human state as helpless, fixed, awaiting supernatural aid, pursuing untimely theologizing, and the like. This resistance has been emphasized by his commentators and has often been taken as Cavell’s prevalent attitude. Especially in chapter 1 but also in the subsequent chapters, I have tried to oppose such interpretations—not because they are wrong (indeed,<br>

  Book Title: Gadamer-A Philosophical Portrait<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Keane Niall<br>
  Abstract: Hans-Georg Gadamer (1900-2002), one of the towering figures of contemporary Continental philosophy, is best known for Truth and Method, where he elaborated the concept of "philosophical hermeneutics," a programmatic way to get to what we do when we engage in interpretation. Donatella Di Cesare highlights the central place of Greek philosophy, particularly Plato, in Gadamer's work, brings out differences between his thought and that of Heidegger, and connects him with discussions and debates in pragmatism. This is a sensitive and thoroughly readable philosophical portrait of one of the 20th century's most powerful thinkers.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gzb9c">Gadamer</a><br>
  Abstract: The name hans-georg gadamer is intimately bound up with philosophical hermeneutics. Like only a few other contemporary currents, hermeneutics has exerted a widespread influence that goes well beyond the limits of philosophy and that has a depth and range difficult to evaluate. From aesthetics to literary
                  criticism, from theology to jurisprudence, from sociology to psychiatry, there is almost no area of the “humanities” without a hermeneutic substratum. Not even epistemology has remained neutral. Assessing the widely differentiated, international effects of hermeneutics within philosophy is still more difficult. Gadamer was not only a witness of, but also an interlocutor for, the<br>

  6  An Ethics Close to Life from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gzb9c">Gadamer</a><br>
  Abstract: To understand means to apply; understanding is always put into practice and thus becomes a form of action in itself, in the world, and with others. It should come as no surprise that hermeneutics, as it recuperates the theoretical as well as practical value it has had since antiquity, develops in proximity to
                  practical philosophy.Gadamer emphasizes this point in his 1972 essay, “Hermeneutics as Practical Philosophy” (RAS88–112/VZW78–109). Here theethicaldimension of hermeneutics becomes clearer: it does not lie in understanding as such, and even less in the alleged task or duty of understanding, but rather in<br>

  7  The Enigma of Socrates: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gzb9c">Gadamer</a><br>
  Abstract: It is impossible to imagine philosophical hermeneutics without Greek philosophy. Nonetheless, hermeneutics is not a retreat from the questions of contemporary philosophy to the historical-philological study of Greek texts, nor should Gadamer’s project be reduced to a mere “application” of Greek ideas. Greek philosophy plays a decisive role for hermeneutics, which has not yet been sufficiently recognized.<br>

Gadamer’s work found great resonance, insofar as it was soon recognized as one of the most significant contributions to twentieth-century philosophy, which is evinced by the numerous reviews from the 1960s onward.¹ The widespread enthusiasm with which it was received in Europe, as well as in North America, gives a sense of its potential, which extends far beyond the horizon of philosophy.<br>

  Abstract: Putting

Nietzsche’s writing style along with his rejection of theSpirit of Gravity¹ would seem to oppose the very goal of the phenomenological project as well as its foundational and scientific ambition. To Nietzsche scholars, his philosophy would be irreducible to any kind of philosophical school or movement and would need to be treated on its own if one wants to respect the claim for singularity conveyed by his philosophy. To would-be phenomenologists, the socalled nihilistic enterprise led by Nietzsche should not be<br>

  Abstract: In

  Abstract: The question of suffering played a prominent part in philosophical reflections until the end of the nineteenth century. In contemporary philosophy, this question is almost entirely forgotten. Of course, one could object to such a claim and suggest that nowadays philosophers address suffering
                  indirectlywhen they turn to the question of pain—an issue by no means uncommon in contemporary philosophical discussions. And yet in these analyses pain is addressed as a phenomenon that falls into the larger class of sensations known as bodily sensations, such as itches, tingles, and tickles.¹ It is highly doubtful whether such a framework can<br>

  Abstract: Nietzsche’s role in European thought has been preponderant for at least fifty years. First relegated to literary studies, then, with Hitler’s rise to power, to the domain of ideology (by Alfred Baümler, in particular),¹ his work only begins to be considered as philosophy with the publication of Jaspers’s monograph in 1936² and the lectures Heidegger gave from 1936 to 1940 but did not publish until 1961. The following decade saw the flowering of what may be called “French Nietzscheism” with the publication in 1962 of Deleuze’s

  Abstract: It has been little remarked that Nietzsche’s
                  Birth of Tragedy¹ made Raphael’s magnificent painting of the transfiguration of Christ the “monogram” of Nietzsche’s account of the origin of tragedy and his philosophy of art. Moreover, since that work introduces us to the figure of Dionysus, who plays an increasingly definitive role for Nietzsche’s entire philosophy as it unfolds in the later writings, we can add more emphatically that Raphael’sTransfiguration, as ironic as it may seem, is the monogram of the philosophy of the death of God. The goal of this paper will be to show how this is the<br>

  Abstract: How can the seemingly separate lives of philosopher, feminist, and follower of a religious tradition come together in one person's life? How does religious commitment affect philosophy or feminism? How does feminism play out in religious or philosophical commitment? Wrestling with answers to these questions, women who balance philosophy, feminism, and faith write about their lives. The voices gathered here from several different traditions-Catholic, Protestant, Quaker, Jewish, and Muslim-represent diverse ethnicities, races, and ages.

  Abstract: Commitment to any one of the terms listed in the title of this volume seems to preclude commitment to either of the other two. Philosophical skepticism seems inimical to religious faith. Traditional religious faith is often understood as standing over against feminism. And feminist theories have frequently placed themselves in opposition to male-stream philosophy. So how can one live with the seemingly immiscible combination of being a philosopher, belonging to a traditional religion, and being a feminist?

After two botched attempts to outline such an essay, I came to realize that I had nothing to say on the topic because I have no difficulties reconciling philosophy, feminism, and faith. Instead, all three pursuits converge in my understanding of tradition. This understanding is not an intellectual achievement, but a way of life. It is difficult for me to rip this way of life far enough out of its context to articulate it<br>

  THIRTEEN  A Skeptical Spirituality from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gzdbv">Philosophy, Feminism, and Faith</a><br>
  Author(s) NODDINGS NEL<br>
  Abstract: When we try to answer the question whether philosophy, feminism, and faith can be reconciled, we see that many people have attempted the reconciliation, and quite a few have done so to their own satisfaction. Despite the multitude of personally satisfying accounts, no universally accepted reconciliation has ever been constructed. To argue for the compatibility of philosophy, feminism, and faith, then, is not a mathematical sort of task—one that can be completed to the satisfaction of some professionally constituted public. Part of the difficulty lies in the fact that neither philosophy nor feminism is a unitary body of thought.<br>

  Abstract: I recall vividly the utter astonishment of a fellow traveler on a flight from New York to San Francisco, when she discovered that I claimed to be a believer, a philosopher, and a teacher of Christian philosophy at a Christian university in South Africa. In her perception, the mix of womanhood, philosophy, and religion seemed incongruous, not to mention the even stranger notion of a woman claiming to teach Christian philosophy at a Christian university in a country with a political reputation which at the time certainly raised questions about the authenticity of Christianity.

  Book Title: Material Feminisms-  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hekman Susan<br>
  Abstract: Harnessing the energy of provocative theories generated by recent understandings of the human body, the natural world, and the material world, Material Feminisms presents an entirely new way for feminists to conceive of the question of materiality. In lively and timely essays, an international group of feminist thinkers challenges the assumptions and norms that have previously defined studies about the body. These wide-ranging essays grapple with topics such as the material reality of race, the significance of sexual difference, the impact of disability experience, and the complex interaction between nature and culture in traumatic events such as Hurricane Katrina. By insisting on the importance of materiality, this volume breaks new ground in philosophy, feminist theory, cultural studies, science studies, and other fields where the body and nature collide.<br>

  Author(s) Alaimo Stacy<br>
  Abstract: Despite the tremendous outpouring of scholarship on “the body” in feminist theory and cultural studies and the simultaneous outpouring of environmental philosophy, criticism, and cultural studies, these two streams of scholarship rarely intermingle. Although there are notable exceptions, by and large two isolated conversations have evolved—conversations that would be complicated and enriched by collisions and convergences. Most feminist analyses of the body, in particular, sever their topic from the topos of “nature.” Indeed, from an environmentalist-feminist standpoint, one of the most unfortunate legacies of poststructuralist and postmodern feminism has been the accelerated “flight from nature” fueled by rigid commitments<br>

  Abstract: Justifying religious faith through thinking consciousness: this is arguably the highest aspiration of the philosophy of religion. Whether this aspiration is itself justifiable, however, is another question. Can religious faith be grasped and grounded, so that its content is justified by the necessity of the philosophical concept? Does religious faith have its telos in philosophical consummation? Or does there remain some residual opacity that philosophy cannot penetrate, some otherness that philosophy cannot reconcile within its own conceptual scheme? How should philosophy approach a reality that claims to be an irresolvable scandal for philosophical thinking?<br>

  Abstract: The Insistence of God presents the provocative idea that God does not exist, God insists, while God's existence is a human responsibility, which may or may not happen. For John D. Caputo, God's existence is haunted by "perhaps," which does not signify indecisiveness but an openness to risk, to the unforeseeable. Perhaps constitutes a theology of what is to come and what we cannot see coming. Responding to current critics of continental philosophy, Caputo explores the materiality of perhaps and the promise of the world. He shows how perhaps can become a new theology of the gaps God opens.<br>

This criticism has been set in motion by the theological turn, or the return of religion, which is taken to be a regrettable consequence of continental antirealism.

Its central pillar is an account of meaning derived from a new reading of Wittgenstein that departs radically from the traditional account, entrenched for many centuries in Western philosophy, of how language connects with reality. According to that traditional account, to bestow meaning upon a noun is automatically to connect it to reality, since to bestow meaning on a noun is,<br>

  Abstract: Only what is difficult can sustain thought. Today in philosophy one of these difficulties comes from the end of a myth that took philosophy as the child of Western rationalism, with its origins in Greek thought. Philosophy today is changing; the field of philosophy is undergoing a new dawn with the formation and inclusion of world philosophies that bear origins, experiences, overlappings, encroachments, and transformations well beyond the modern North American and European traditions. The new world philosophies open possibilities of unfathomable and fecund thinking as one engages and is exposed to unbridled senses of existence, to lineages, configurations of<br>

  1  The Question of a Latin American Philosophy and Its Identity: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gzkjc">Latin American Philosophy from Identity to Radical Exteriority</a><br>
  Abstract: Philosophy and Western culture have been synonymous at least since Hegel’s philosophy of history. Even when philosophy has been ignored, degraded, reappropriated, or put into question and even when philosophers have sought to “destroy” it, philosophy has been taken as a given inseparable from Western culture and born of it. Practically speaking, no one from the West or educated under the Western tradition, no matter how critical of it, would put into question the existence of European, French, German, or Italian philosophy. In Latin America the situation is different: The question that animates the very arising into existence and the<br>

  Abstract: As we have just seen, at the heart of Leopoldo Zea’s thought appears Western philosophy as a creative force that results in the domination of other peoples and cultures who have not likewise developed their reflexive rationality. Two major Latin American philosophers who engage directly with the kind of existence that results from experiencing such domination are the Venezuelan Ernesto Mayz Vallenilla and the Peruvian Augusto Salazar Bondy. The first offers a deep phenomenological analysis of the abyssal existence Simón Bolívar introduces in his “Jamaica Letter” when he articulates the difficulty of Latin American existence.

  3  Latin American Philosophy and Liberation: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gzkjc">Latin American Philosophy from Identity to Radical Exteriority</a><br>
  Abstract: In the previous chapters we found a call for recognizing Latin American philosophy, which may be traced back to the 1940s and 1950s in the work of Leopoldo Zea, along with other Latin American philosophers such as Arturo Ardao in Uruguay and Francisco Romero in Argentina. For these philosophers the fundamental questions were those of the identity, sense, and possibilities of a Latin American philosophy. As discussed in chapter 2, Salazar Bondy responded to these questions in 1968, and Leopoldo Zea engaged with that negative critique in 1969 in

                  aboutLatin America but figures a yet unthought delimitation of the very system we have come to know as modernity and modern philosophy. The exposure to this situation offers an opening for thinking from beyond the instrumental rationalism of contemporary modernity, from radical exteriority. Latin America is a concrete living and articulate reality that, as the underside of modernity, displaces the Western North American and European claims to a hegemonic, selfsufficient, and autonomous power and causes a fecund opening for understanding anew philosophical thought.

  Abstract: Throughout this book I have underlined an issue that accompanies the various discourses of liberation and decolonial thought in Latin America, namely, the issue of its aesthetic dimension. As we saw, Dussel’s philosophy of liberation is based on a pre-rational and pre-linguistic sensibility, a sense of radical exteriority, that distinguishes humans. Quijano exposes a pre-rational disposition or sensibility that sustains the coloniality of power and knowledge. Moreover, as he goes on to uncover and engage ana-chronic simultaneity in Latin American existence, Quijano turns to the writers, poets, and artists of Latin America, who articulate senses of existence beyond and otherwise<br>

                  On Escape,a statement that could be easily dismissed as a passing swipe at the eighteenth-century thinker.¹ No doubt, Levinas would have ambivalent feelings about Rousseau, whose philosophy is often cited as influential in the French Revolution and the development of the French Republic. Yet, Levinas’s stab at Rousseau’s emphasis on self-sufficiency is not simply a throwaway line; self-sufficiency lies at the heart of a humanism that would develop out of modernity and to which Levinas offers a sustained response. In short, “self-sufficiency” sums up everything that<br>

Most of them have come to occupy an equally important position in the discourse of new materialist theory broadly speaking, which draws on material feminism but also taps additional sources, such as phenomenology and the philosophy of science, for ideas.<br>

In his own way, Weiss is even more ample than the omnivorous Hegel, who, after all, never elaborated a philosophy of sport. But then again, many seem inclined to reverse Shakespeare’s line in Weiss’s case: “There are more things in Weiss’s philosophy<br>

  Book Title: Speak Thus-Christian Language in Church and World<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Hovey Craig R.<br>
  Abstract: In its various forms, speech is absolutely integral to the Christian mission. The gospel is a message, news that must be passed on if it is to be known by others. Nevertheless, the reality of God cannot be exhausted by Christian knowledge and Christian knowledge cannot be exhausted by our words. All the while, the philosophy of modernity has left Christianity an impoverished inheritance within which to think these things. In Speak Thus, Craig Hovey explores the possibilities and limits of Christian speaking. At times ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical, these essays go to the heart of what it means to be the church today. In practice, the Christian life often has a linguistic shape that surprisingly implicates and reveals the commitments of people like those who care for the sick or those who respond as peacemakers in the face of violence. Because learning to speak one way as opposed to another is a skill that must be learned, Christian speakers are also guides who bear witness to the importance of churches for passing on a felicity with Christian ways of speaking. Through constructive engagements with interlocutors like Ludwig Wittgenstein, George Lindbeck, Jeffrey Stout, Stanley Hauerwas, John Howard Yoder, Thomas Aquinas, and the theology of Radical Orthodoxy, Hovey offers a challenging vision of the church'able to speak with a confidence that only comes from a deep attentiveness to its own limitations while able to speak prophetically in a world weary of words.<br>

Recent philosophical trends within postmodernity, however, provide fresh models for reassessing Anabaptism in terms more attuned to Anabaptism’s unique character. Some working within the Anglo-American strains of postmodernity have addressed and advanced post-Enlightenment thought in a remarkably successful manner, especially in regard to theology.¹ In this idiom, George Lindbeck is prominent among recent scholars using postmodern philosophy to help us imagine new ways of thinking about theology, particularly regarding the nature of religion, doctrine, and<br>

  Book Title: Mind in Architecture-Neuroscience, Embodiment, and the Future of Design<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Pallasmaa Juhani<br>
  Abstract: Although we spend more than ninety percent of our lives inside buildings, we understand very little about how the built environment affects our behavior, thoughts, emotions, and well-being. We are biological beings whose senses and neural systems have developed over millions of years; it stands to reason that research in the life sciences, particularly neuroscience, can offer compelling insights into the ways our buildings shape our interactions with the world. This expanded understanding can help architects design buildings that support both mind and body. In
      Mind in Architecture, leading thinkers from architecture and other disciplines, including neuroscience, cognitive science, psychiatry, and philosophy, explore what architecture and neuroscience can learn from each other. They offer historical context, examine the implications for current architectural practice and education, and imagine a neuroscientifically informed architecture of the future. Architecture is late in discovering the richness of neuroscientific research. As scientists were finding evidence for the bodily basis of mind and meaning, architecture was caught up in convoluted cerebral games that denied emotional and bodily reality altogether. This volume maps the extraordinary opportunity that engagement with cutting-edge neuroscience offers present-day architects.ContributorsThomas D.

  Abstract: Transdisciplinary and intermedial analysis of the experience of music Nowadays musical semiotics no longer ignores the fundamental challenges raised by cognitive sciences, ethology, or linguistics. Creation, action and experience play an increasing role in how we understand music, a sounding structure impinging upon our body, our mind, and the world we live in. Not discarding music as a closed system, an integral experience of music demands a transdisciplinary dialogue with other domains as well. Music, Analysis, Experience brings together contributions by semioticians, performers, and scholars from cognitive sciences, philosophy, and cultural studies, and deals with these fundamental questionings. Transdisciplinary and intermedial approaches to music meet musicologically oriented contributions to classical music, pop music, South American song, opera, narratology, and philosophy.<br>

  Author(s) Chagas Paulo C.<br>
  Abstract: Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951) is an intellectual myth of the 20
                  thcentury and certainly one of the most original thinkers that Western culture has ever produced.¹ The philosophy of Wittgenstein reflects on issues of logic, mathematics, language, psychology, ethics, aesthetics, religion, etc. His philosophical method combined the rejection of metaphysics and the scientific spirit with clarity and a simple, colloquial-like language, however pushed to such a level of logical precision that it seems to stretch the limits of thinking. The unorthodoxy of Wittgenstein emerges as much in his life as in his thought. For the reader unfamiliar with him, his writing<br>

  The Other Semiotic Legacy of Charles Sanders Peirce: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt180r0s2">Music, Analysis, Experience</a><br>
  Author(s) Huron David<br>
  Abstract: Charles Sanders Peirce was a remarkable scholar with broad ranging interests in many areas of philosophy, logic, and metaphysics. The influence of Peirce’s ideas in the modern field of semiotics is well known. Less well known is the influence Peirce had on another discipline, the field of ethology (the study of animal behavior). Largely a European undertaking, the founders of ethology—notably Konrad Lorenz and Nico Tinbergen—were influenced by semiotic concepts in their studies of animal displays and calls. This presentation pays tribute to the achievements of ethology by returning insights from animal behavior back to the humanities and<br>

  Book Title: Religion Without Redemption-Social Contradictions and Awakened Dreams in Latin America<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Löwy Michael<br>
  Abstract: The world’s eyes are on Latin America as a place of radical political inspiration and as an alternative to the neoliberal model. Each country in the region deals differently in its method of government, yet there are common cultural themes that tie the continent’s trajectory together. Religion without Redemption looks at the sociology of religion, political philosophy and the history of ideas of the continent, in an attempt to show how Western understanding fails to come close to a correct analysis of how and why political and economic characteristics work as they do. Luis Martínez Andrade focuses on how the centrality of religion for the people of Latin America has influenced how they interact with the changes in the modern economic system. Capitalism, for example, has taken on religious characteristics: it has sacred places of worship (the shopping mall) as well as its own prophets. Martínez Andrade discusses how this form of ‘cultural religion’ accompanies many aspects of life in a contradictory manner: not only does it fulfil the role of legitimating oppression, it also can be a powerful source of rebellion, unveiling thus a subversive side to the status quo. Religion Without Redemption advances the ideas of liberation theory into the 21st century, and challenges the provincialism to which many Latin American thinkers are usually consigned.<br>

  Abstract: The twenty-first century heralded serious environmental damage, a significant increase in poverty and the highest levels of social exclusion that radically put into question the very paradigm of civilisation. In the light of current events that have arisen over recent years (‘preventative’ wars, treacherous massacres against civilian populations and the institutionalisation of the ‘State of Exception’ among others), it is important to ask ourselves about the role and contribution of philosophy and theology in the development of alternative projects and in counterposing the hegemonic narrative.

  Abstract: Like the other social sciences, anthropology has fairly recent origins. It developed as an academic discipline during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, but it has important forerunners in earlier historiography, geography, travel writing, philosophy, comparative linguistics and jurisprudence. There are many ways of writing the history of anthropology, just as there may exist, in any given society, competing versions of national history or origin myths, promoted by groups or individuals with diverging interests. History is not primarily a product of the past itself, but is rather shaped by the concerns of the present. As these concerns change, past<br>

  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): MJAALAND MARIUS TIMMANN<br>
  Abstract: In this phenomenological reading of Luther, Marius Timmann Mjaaland shows that theological discourse is never philosophically neutral and always politically loaded. Raising questions concerning the conditions of modern philosophy, religion, and political ideas, Marius Timmann Mjaaland follows a dark thread of thought back to its origin in Martin Luther. Thorough analyses of the genealogy of secularization, the political role of the apocalypse, the topology of the self, and the destruction of metaphysics demonstrate the continuous relevance of this highly subtle thinker.<br>

  Abstract: The destruction of metaphysics is a favored topic in twentieth-century philosophy, in terms of a positivist critique, an overcoming, an
                  Abbau,a rejection, or a deconstruction of traditional metaphysical notions and concepts. But where and when does this discussion of a general destruction of metaphysics start? I argue that theHeidelberg Disputationplays a key role here.¹ In this short disputation, Luther presents forty theses giving a principal justification of his position, twenty-eight of them theological and the other twelve philosophical. In the explanation to thesis 21, he argues that the cross is a good thing, since itdestructs(destruuntur;<br>

His many more or less uncouth comments on philosophers as sophists, mad, or impious, of reason as a whore, and so forth, should be treated with a grain of salt and ascribed to his image as a barbarian and simple spokesman of the truth from the northern provinces of the Roman Empire.

  Abstract: Medium, Messenger, Transmissionuses the figure of the messenger as a key metaphor for the function of all transmission media. Sybille Krämer illustrates this argument with a diverse range of situations involving some form of transmission, including the circulation of money, the translation of languages, the spread of infectious diseases, processes of transference and countertransference as seen in psychoanalysis, and even the development of cartography. This rich study provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of media philosophy while illuminating transmission media as active mediators in all systems of exchange.<br>

  Abstract: In what sense did the 1950s reveal a generally favorable, although unavoidably ambiguous, reception of Heidegger’s thought in France? Although one will discover it gradually in this chapter, one already detects that the principal criterion of this ambiguity could not reside exclusively in the division between the partisans and the opponents of that thought: that would be to confuse the scope of a philosophy with the kind of influence associated with an ideology or a political party. Of course, I will have to make room for the reservations or attacks. But one has to take other disagreements into account, and<br>

  Book Title: Recognizing the Gift-Toward a Renewed Theology of Nature and Grace<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortres<br>
  Author(s): Rober Daniel A.<br>
  Abstract: Recognizing the Gift puts twentieth-century Catholic theological conversations on nature and grace, particularly those of Henri de Lubac and Karl Rahner, into dialogue with Continental philosophy, notably the thought of Jean-Luc Marion and Paul Ricoeur. It argues that a renewed theology of nature and grace must build on the accomplishments of the recent past while acknowledging that an engagement with the political is unavoidable for theology. Ultimately, the aim is to revive and broaden discussion of nature and grace by drawing together the insights of contemporary theologians and Continental philosophers. Too often these areas of inquiry remain quite separate, in part due to differing priorities. This work tries to open that conversation, in part by critically pointing out, in dialogue with Ricoeur, the need in Marion’s work for an acknowledgment of recognition, reciprocity, and the political. It thus argues for a theology of nature and grace in terms of recognition of the gift, drawing out the reciprocal and political nature of gift and givenness in opposition to those, including Marion, who would seek to avoid politics and reciprocity as a proper avenue of inquiry for theology.<br>

In particular, it turns to the work of the philosopher Paul Ricoeur as a resource for reformulating Marion’s concept of a gift in such a way as to answer the criticisms posed by Milbank and Tanner while retaining important parts of the overall project. Ricoeur notably brings forward a conception of

  Abstract: Paul Ricoeur was one of the leading French philosophers of the twentieth centuries. He was also one of the most erudite. From his starting point in phenomenology, Ricoeur ventured into structuralism, psychoanalysis, biblical studies, linguistics, narrative theory, historiography, and even neuroscience. Ricoeur’s exploration in these diverse fields is part of his overarching project of philosophical anthropology, which asks the questions of human being, self-understanding, and action. These questions also provide the context for Ricoeur’s work in the philosophy of religion, which is where Bonhoeffer’s influence on Ricoeur is most evident.<br>

  Book Title: Quiet Powers of the Possible: Interviews in Contemporary French Phenomenology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): HACKETT W. CHRIS<br>
  Abstract: Quiet Powers of the Possible offers an excellent introduction to contemporary French phenomenology through a series of interviews with its most prominent figures. Guided by rigorous questions that push into the most important aspects of the latest phenomenological research, the book gives readers a comprehensive sense of each thinker's intellectual history, motivations, and philosophical commitments. The book introduces readers to debates that have not previously been accessible to the English-speaking world, such as the growing interest in the phenomenological concept of life in its affective and even vital dimensions, the emerging dialogue with the analytic philosophy of mind and language, and reassessments of the so-called theological turn. The diversity of approaches collected here has its origin in a deeper debate about the conceptual and historical foundations of phenomenology itself. In this way the book offers the most accessible and wide-ranging introduction to French phenomenology to have appeared in the English-speaking world to date.<br>

  Abstract: The American reception of contemporary French phenomenology, however fecund, has been both selective and cloistered. For many, the “theological turn,” an expression initially coined as an epithet by Dominique Janicaud (and that, like many epithets, has become something of a rallying cry this side of the Atlantic), unquestionably represents what, for better or worse, distinguishes phenomenology from other trends in contemporary philosophy, be they French or Anglo-American. No doubt, French phenomenology has demonstrated a remarkable capacity for describing phenomena hitherto deemed beyond the pale of reason. But according to what (or whose) concept of reason?

  Abstract: Whereas most of the eminent European thinkers of the second half of the nineteenth century and in the twentieth century were a-religious or at least believed that modernization would necessarily lead to secularization, the American history of ideas took a different route. Particularly, the philosophy of pragmatism represents this specifically American approach to the viability of the sacred or the ideal under the new conditions of rapid industrialization and urbanization. The question that at least the first generation of American pragmatists struggled with is: How can you defend a religious stance toward the world if you not only don’t want<br>

  Author(s) Seibert Christoph<br>
  Abstract: The task I would like to work on is a very broad one.¹ It can be looked at from various points of view. For example, it can be dealt with in the way of comparing a pragmatic-oriented philosophy of religion with other philosophical outlooks. It can be illumed in the light of the question which particular version of pragmatic thinking is more appropriate to religion as its subject matter. Finally, it can be approached by regarding some particulars of the methodological question bound to pragmatic thinking as such. In my argument, I will focus on the latter, drawing on the<br>

  Author(s) Pihlström Sami<br>
  Abstract: This chapter will examine the relation between religion and morality from a pragmatist point of view, focusing on the fundamental importance of a certain kind of attitude toward the reality of evil and suffering based on Jamesian pragmatism. My discussion differs from many other treatments of pragmatist philosophy of religion and moral philosophy due to what might be called its “via negativa” methodology. I am not trying to positively characterize, or to interpret James’s characterizations of, such notions as the “good life,” the “goods,” or “fruits” of religious life and religious experiences—even though I do regard (Jamesian) pragmatism as<br>

  Abstract: For some years now, I have attempted to contest what others see—what they
                  onlysee—in John Dewey. I refer to the naturalistic lines, edges, and boundaries that must be there, because if they are not plainly there, then Dewey is not there. In my efforts, I have been aided by a variety of influences, some in philosophy, some in literature, and some in the arts. I believe that Dewey deeply valued phenomenological accuracy, the kind of accuracy that John Updike noted in his acceptance speech for the 1964 National Book Awards prize: “Reality is—chemically, atomically, biologically—a<br>

  Author(s) Jung Matthias<br>
  Abstract: Instrumentalism” and “naturalism” are terms often associated with John Dewey’s philosophy. As we shall see, his naturalism goes indeed down to the core, thus creating a significant tension with his all-embracing concept of experience. But to label Dewey as an instrumentalist with a primary interest in assembling philosophical tools for achieving human goals taken for granted is deeply misleading. In his admirable book on “John Dewey and the Transcendent,” Victor Kestenbaum argues for what he calls the “primacy of meaning thesis”¹ and for the connection of meaning and transcendence as a key for understanding Dewey—and I completely agree with<br>

  Author(s) Proudfoot Wayne<br>
  Abstract: The word “naturalism” is used in many different ways in contemporary philosophy. For some, it has required that a properly naturalistic account appeal only to what is countenanced by the natural sciences, but there have been a number of recent attempts to formulate more liberal approaches to naturalism that allow for natural accounts that recognize the normative character of beliefs, practices, actions, and institutions.¹ A certain priority is rightly given to the sciences in the sense that, as Huw Price has put it, science tells us that humans are natural creatures, and any naturalistic approach should honor that.² But that<br>

  Author(s) Linde Gesche<br>
  Abstract: As with all the classical pragmatists, Peirce’s interest in the subject of religion is subordinate to his more central questions. What Peirce has to say about God, creation, the church, faith, and love is systematically derived from a philosophy that, having semiotics at its core, spans a broad range of topics, such as mathematics, logic, epistemology, cosmology, linguistics, and occasionally even bridges design and engineering. It is this subsidiary status that, to my mind, lends methodological soundness as well as modernity to Peirce’s reflections, because the clear implication is that religion is not a primary phenomenon but something that develops<br>

  Abstract: When studied carefully, Royce’s mature thought—in general, as well as in the field of his philosophy of religion—has the potential to stimulate interest in ideas that, in a narrowly professionalized discourse, tend to be out of sight today. By learning from James’s explorations of religious experience, and by critically reassessing and redimensioning James’s pragmatism in a “Peirceanized” manner,¹ Royce develops a community-oriented, postdialectically dialectical,² semiotically informed, “reflective” theory of interpretation. This theory is of relevance not only to contemporary philosophical discourse in general but to any attempt to rethink (in the age of progressive individualization and commodification) the<br>

  Author(s) Deuser Hermann<br>
  Abstract: As a theory of action, classical pragmatism—founded by the scientifically trained philosophers Charles S. Peirce and William James in New England—is also always a philosophy of religion. Human experience is not (as in the German tradition) divided according to practical experience, on the one hand, and scientific empiricism, on the other. Instead, it is precisely the interplay of belief in relation to action that explains our everyday behavior as much as the scientific method and religious experience. While different conceptions of god have inevitably resulted from the latter over time, the images, narratives, and symbols are nonetheless comparable.<br>

  Book Title: Husserl's Missing Technologies-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): IHDE DON<br>
  Abstract: Husserl's Missing Technologies looks at the early-twentieth-century "classical" phenomenology of Edmund Husserl, both in the light of the philosophy of science of his time, and retrospectively at his philosophy from a contemporary "postphenomenology." Of central interest are his infrequent comments upon technologies and especially scientific instruments such as the telescope and microscope. Together with his analysis of Husserl, Don Ihde ventures through the recent history of technologies of science, reading and writing, and science praxis, calling for modifications to phenomenology by converging it with pragmatism. This fruitful hybridization emphasizes human-technology interrelationships, the role of embodiment and bodily skills, and the inherent multistability of technologies. In a radical argument, Ihde contends that philosophies, in the same way that various technologies contain an ever-shortening obsolescence, ought to have contingent use-lives.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt19x3jd4">Husserl's Missing Technologies</a><br>
  Abstract: Phenomenology as a twentieth-century philosophy has since its classical beginnings been portrayed as a subjective philosophy and frequently claimed to be antiscience. I argue that both characterizations are false or distortions of phenomenology, and so a modification of classical phenomenology is needed, and that is postphenomenology. This chapter follows that trajectory in a somewhat different way. The late twentieth century began to see two science paradigm shifts in the Kuhnian sense. The first was a revival and renewal of interest in consciousness and the other, often closely related, in animal studies. Here I interweave these two contemporary movements to a<br>

  Book Title: Radical Theology-An Essay on Faith and Theology in the Twenty-First Century<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Dalferth Ingolf U.<br>
  Abstract: Ingolf U. Dalferth develops a “radical theology" that unfolds the orienting strength of faith for human life from the event of God’s presence to every present. In a concise and clear manner, Dalferth outlines the theological and philosophical approaches to hermeneutics in the modern era, in order to promote a convincing and defensible theology for the twenty-first century, critically carrying on Martin Heidegger and Rudolf Bultmann, without forgetting Karl Barth. The result of his reconstruction is a “radical theology" that neither glorifies premodern theology in an antimodern attitude nor seeks a mystical deepening of the secular, but argues for a radical change in theological perspective of the possible. In doing so, theology unfolds “limit concepts" that restrict the claims of science and philosophy critically, and develops “ideas of orientation" that illumine the ways in which human life is understood and lived in radically new ways in faith. From here, Dalferth unfolds the reality of revelation and the Christian sense of an unconditional hope that fundamentally transcends all beliefs based on mundane realities and orients the world on something beyond its own temporal horizon—its loving Creator.<br>

Cognitive linguistics is part of this revolutionary discovery.

  Book Title: Grand Hotel Abyss-Desire, Recognition and the Restoration of the Subject<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): Safatle Vladimir<br>
  Abstract: Long-expected translation of the Portuguese academic bestseller Grande Hotel Abismo. In the last two decades recognition - arguably one of the most central notions of the dialectical tradition since Hegel - has once again become a crucial philosophical theme. Nevertheless, the new theories of recognition fail to provide room for reflection on transformation processes in politics and morality. This book aims to recover the disruptive nature of the dialectical tradition by means of a severe critique of the dominance of an anthropology of the individual identity in contemporary theories of recognition. This critique implies a thorough rethinking of basic concepts such as desire, negativity, will and drive, with Hegel, Lacan and Adorno being our main guides. The Marxist philosopher György Lukács said that the Frankfurt School (Horkheimer, Adorno, etc.) left us with nothing but negativity towards the state of the world. Their work failed to open up a concrete possibility of practical engagement in this world. All too eager to describe the impasses of reason, the Frankfurt philosphers remained trapped in a metaphorical Grand Hotel Abyss (Grand Hotel Abgrund). It was as living and being guardian of lettered civilization in a beautiful and melancholy grand hotel, of which the balconies face a gaping abyss. But perhaps in this way Lukács gave – and no doubt without realizing it himself – a perfect definition of contemporary philosophy, namely to confront chaos, to peer into what appears to a certain rationality as an abyss and to feel good about it. Touching Hegelian dialectics, critical theory and psychoanalysis, Grand Hotel Abyss gives a new meaning to the notion of negativity as the first essential step for rethinking political and moral engagement.<br>

  Book Title: Nowhere in the Middle Ages-  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): LOCHRIE KARMA<br>
  Abstract: Drawing on a range of contemporary scholarship on utopianism and a broad premodern archive, Lochrie charts variant utopian strains in medieval literature and philosophy that diverge from More's work and at the same time plot uncanny connections with it. Examining works such as Macrobius's fifth-century
      Commentary on the Dream of Scipio,Mandeville's Travels, and William Langland'sPiers Plowman, she finds evidence of a number of utopian drives, including the rejection of European centrality, a desire for more egalitarian politics, and a rethinking of the division between animals and humans.Nowhere in the Middle Agesinsists on the relevance and transformative potential of medieval utopias for More's work and positions the sixteenth-century text as one alternative in a broader historical phenomenon of utopian thinking. Tracing medieval utopianisms forward in literary history to reveal their influences on early modern and modern literature and philosophy, Lochrie demonstrates that looking backward, we might extend future horizons of utopian thinking.<br>

  Book Title: Crossing the Rubicon: The Borderlands of Philosophy and Theology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Shank Reuben<br>
  Abstract: In France today, philosophy--phenomenology in particular--finds itself in a paradoxical relation to theology. Some debate a "theological turn." Others disavow theological arguments as if such arguments would tarnish their philosophical integrity, while nevertheless carrying out theology in other venues. In Crossing the Rubicon, Emmanuel Falque seeks to end this face-off. Convinced that "the more one theologizes, the better one philosophizes," he proposes a counterblow by theology against phenomenology. Instead of another philosophy of "the threshold" or "the leap"--and through a retrospective and forward-looking examination of his own method--he argues that an encounter between the two disciplines will reveal their mutual fruitfulness and their true distinctive borders. Falque shows that he has made the crossing between philosophy and theology and back again with audacity and perhaps a little recklessness, knowing full well that no one thinks without exposing himself to risk.<br>

  Abstract: Many formalised discourses of the human sciences—such as law, liberal political philosophy and neo-classical economics—work with a notion of the singular human being as a unit that is characterised by its indivisibility, for those reasons also called the individual. An additional assumption about the guiding orientation or behaviour of these units then needs to be introduced to arrive at ways of conceptualising stable collectivities. In the discourses mentioned above, this assumption is basically one of rationality, with specific variations. In liberal political theory, their capacity for rationality leads the individuals to enter into a social contract for their<br>

However, recent interdisciplinary work in philosophy and law emphasizes “positionality,” and calls into question the abstract, disembodied quality of conventional Western theories of knowledge (epistemologies) which ground the Western conception of law.

  Book Title: Religion: Beyond a Concept-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): de VRIES HENT<br>
  Abstract: What do we talk about when we talk about religion? Is it an array of empirical facts about historical human civilizations? Or is religion what is in essence unpredictable-perhaps the very emergence of the new? In what ways are the legacies of religion-its powers, words, things, and gestures-reconfiguring themselves as the elementary forms of life in the twenty-first century?Given the Latin roots of the word religion and its historical Christian uses, what sense, if any, does it make to talk about religionin other traditions? Where might we look for common elements that would enable us to do so? Has religion as an overarching concept lost all its currency, or does it ineluctably return-sometimes in unexpected ways-the moment we attempt to do without it? This book explores the difficulties and double binds that arise when we ask What is religion? Offering a marvelously rich and diverse array of perspectives, it begins the task of rethinking religionand religious studiesin a contemporary world. Opening essays on the question What is religion?are followed by clusters exploring the relationships among religion, theology, and philosophy and the links between religion, politics, and law. Pedagogy is the focus of the following section. Religion is then examined in particular contexts, from classical times to the present Pentacostal revival, leading into an especially rich set of essays on religion, materiality, and mediatization. The final section grapples with the ever-changing forms that religionis taking, such as spirituality movements and responses to the ecological crisis.Featuring the work of leading scholars from a wide array of disciplines, traditions, and cultures, Religion: Beyond a Concept will help set the agenda for religious studies for years to come. It is the first of five volumes in a collection entitled The Future of the Religious Past, the fruit of a major international research initiative funded by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research.<br>

Stanley Cavell’s work bears traces of such problematic engagement with religion, entwined as it is in the vocabulary of faith, sacrifice, redemption, incarnation, conversion, and confession. While Cavell’s engagement with religion is not of a straightforwardly affirmative kind, we can’t call it straightforwardly dismissive, either. Rather, we could perhaps speak about a transformation, a “transfiguration” (to use his own vocabulary) of religion taking place in his work.<br>

  Book Title: Death's Following: Mediocrity, Dirtiness, Adulthood, Literature-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): LIMON JOHN<br>
  Abstract: Almost all twentieth-century philosophy stresses the immanence of death in human life-as drive (Freud), as the context of Being (Heidegger), as the essence of our defining ethics (Levinas), or as language (de Man, Blanchot). In Death's Following, John Limon makes use of literary analysis (of Sebald, Bernhard, and Stoppard), cultural analysis, and autobiography to argue that death is best conceived as always transcendentally beyond ourselves, neither immanent nor imminent. Adapting Kierkegaard's variations on the theme of Abraham's near-sacrifice of Isaac while refocusing the emphasis onto Isaac, Limon argues that death should be imagined as if hiding at the end of an inexplicable journey to Moriah. The point is not to evade or ignore death but to conceive it more truly, repulsively, and pervasively in its camouflage: for example, in jokes, in logical puzzles, in bowdlerized folk songs. The first of Limon's two key concepts is adulthood: the prolonged anti-ritual for experiencing the full distance on the look of death. His second is dirtiness, as theorized in a Jewish joke, a logical exemplum, and T. S. Eliot's "Ash Wednesday": In each case, unseen dirt on foreheads suggests the invisibility of inferred death. Not recognizing death immediately or admitting its immanence and imminence is for Heidegger the defining characteristic of the "they," humanity in its inauthentic social escapism. But Limon vouches throughout for the mediocrity of the "they" in its dirty and ludicrous adulthood. Mediocrity is the privileged position for previewing death, in Limon's opinion: practice for being forgotten. In refusing the call of twentieth-century philosophy to face death courageously, Limon urges the ethical and aesthetic value of mediocre anti-heroism.<br>

  Abstract: It would certainly be ironic, as they say, if it turned out that one of the most celebrated theorists and practitioners of irony in the twentieth century had actually misconstrued what makes irony into such an unruly and troublesome factor within the discourses of literature and philosophy alike. Such may indeed be the case for Thomas Mann, whose critical essays and literary fictions are regularly cited whenever romantic and postromantic irony becomes a topic for serious consideration. For if, in the case of Socrates, Kierkegaard wondered just how serious the Greek thinker could be about irony, since while rightfully maintaining<br>

  Abstract: Contestation over the line between life and death is perhaps the defining problem of contemporary philosophy no less than of today’s politics. From chemical weapons to drones to climate change, we confront negotiations over what counts as life as well as over the right, or the authority, to end it, if not also the responsibility to preserve it. The stakes are real in these efforts to mark off a singular line between life and death, the living and the nonliving, what will live and what will die, what is living within us and what is not.

  Abstract: As trauma theory narrated shattering endings, it turns, in a new century, to imagine impossible beginnings. How do we figure life? The task of carnal hermeneutics, as described by Richard Kearney, is to read between text and body, to think with multiple senses about the meaning of (embodied) life. How might carnal hermeneutics, as it draws on multiple senses, participate in the work of refiguring traumatic wounds? The essays in this volume note the privileging of the visual as the dominant sense in Western philosophy. The study of trauma, largely a Western enterprise, is often referred to through the image<br>

  Book Title: Re-treating Religion: Deconstructing Christianity with Jean-Luc Nancy-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Nancy Jean-Luc<br>
  Abstract: One of the most complicated and ambiguous tendencies in contemporary western societies is the phenomenon referred to as the turn to religion.In philosophy, one of the most original thinkers critically questioning this turnis Jean-Luc Nancy. Re-treating Religion is the first volume to analyze his long-term project The Deconstruction of Christianity,especially his major statement of it in Dis-Enclosure.Nancy conceives monotheistic religion and secularization not as opposite worldviews that succeed each other in time but rather as springing from the same history. This history consists in a paradoxical tendency to contest one's own foundations-whether God, truth, origin, humanity, or rationality-as well as to found itself on the void of this contestation. Nancy calls this unique combination of self-contestation and self-foundation the self-deconstructionof the Western world.The book includes discussion with Nancy himself, who contributes a substantial Preambleand a concluding dialogue with the volume editors. The contributions follow Nancy in tracing the complexities of Western culture back to the persistent legacy of monotheism, in order to illuminate the tensions and uncertainties we face in the twenty-first century.<br>

It recalls the analysis of the Eucharist in his earlier work Corpus, according to which the phraseHoc est enim corpus meumis seen as an assertion, tirelessly repeated, of the immediate presence of God, an affirmation that “God’sbodyisthere” (C3).

  Book Title: On the Anarchy of Poetry and Philosophy-A Guide for the Unruly<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRUNS GERALD L.<br>
  Abstract: Marcel Duchamp once asked whether it is possible to make something that is not a work of art. This question returns over and over in modernist culture, where there are no longer any authoritative criteria for what can be identified (or excluded) as a work of art. As William Carlos Williams says, A poem can be made of anything,even newspaper clippings.At this point, art turns into philosophy, all art is now conceptual art, and the manifesto becomes the distinctive genre of modernism. This book takes seriously this transformation of art into philosophy, focusing upon the systematic interest that so many European philosophers take in modernism. Among the philosophers Gerald Bruns discusses are Theodor W. Adorno, Maurice Blanchot, Arthur Danto, Stanley Cavell, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Franois Lyotard, Jean-Luc Nancy, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, and Emmanuel Levinas.As Bruns demonstrates, the difficulty of much modern and contemporary poetry can be summarized in the idea that a poem is made of words, not of any of the things that we use words to produce: meanings, concepts, propositions, narratives, or expressions of feeling. Many modernist poets have argued that in poetry language is no longer a form of mediation but a reality to be explored and experienced in its own right. But what sort of experience, philosophically, might this be? The problem of the materiality or hermetic character of poetic language inevitably leads to questions of how philosophy itself is to be written and what sort of communitydefines the work of art-or, for that matter, the work of philosophy.In this provocative study, Bruns answers that the culture of modernism is a kind of anarchist community, where the work of art is apt to be as much an event or experience-or, indeed, an alternative form of life-as a formal object. In modern writing, philosophy and poetry fold into one another. In this book, Bruns helps us to see how.<br>

  Book Title: Writings on Medicine-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Meyers Todd<br>
  Abstract: At the time of his death in 1995, Georges Canguilhem was a highly respected historian of science and medicine, whose engagement with questions of normality, the ideologization of scientific thought, and the conceptual history of biology had marked the thought of philosophers such as Michel Foucault, Louis Althusser, Pierre Bourdieu, and Gilles Deleuze. This collection of short, incisive, and highly accessible essays on the major concepts of modern medicine shows Canguilhem at the peak of his use of historical practice for philosophical engagement. In order to elaborate a philosophy of medicine, Canguilhem examines paramount problems such as the definition and uses of health, the decline of the Hippocratic understanding of nature, the experience of disease, the limits of psychology in medicine, myths and realities of therapeutic practices, the difference between cure and healing, the organism's self-regulation, and medical metaphors linking the organism to society. Writings on Medicine is at once an excellent introduction to Canguilhem's work and a forceful, insightful, and accessible engagement with elemental concepts in medicine. The book is certain to leave its imprint on anthropology, history, philosophy, bioethics, and the social studies of medicine.<br>

  Book Title: Constellations of a Contemporary Romanticism-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): McGrath Brian<br>
  Abstract: Constellations of a Contemporary Romanticism takes its title and point of departure from Walter Benjamin's concept of the historical constellation, which puts both "contemporary" and "romanticism" in play as period designations and critical paradigms. Featuring fascinating and diverse contributions by an international roster of distinguished scholars working in and out of romanticism--from deconstruction to new historicism, from queer theory to postcolonial studies, from visual culture to biopolitics--this volume makes good on a central tenet of Benjamin's conception of history: These critics "grasp the constellation" into which our "own era has formed with a definite earlier one." Each of these essays approaches romanticism as a decisive and unexpired thought experiment that makes demands on and poses questions for our own time: What is the unlived of a contemporary romanticism? What has romanticism's singular untimeliness bequeathed to futurity? What is romanticism's contemporary "redemption value" for painting and politics, philosophy and film?<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c999bq">Memory</a><br>
  Author(s) O’Connor Brian<br>
  Abstract: In Theodor W. Adorno’s philosophy, memory is analyzed as a form of knowledge that has become problematic. Adorno argues that what we can know through memory is threatened with eclipse by certain allegedly more rational forms. That eclipse, though, amounts to an act of forgetting that is, as he puts it, equivalent to a “destruction of memory.”¹ Now obviously not all events or all things can be remembered or ought to be remembered. Adorno’s considerations of the issue, in fact, pivot specifically both on the loss of
                  individualityand on the danger of forgettinghuman suffering. This places memory at<br>

  Book Title: Provocations to Reading: J. Hillis Miller and the Democracy to Come-J. Hillis Miller and the Democracy to Come<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kujundžić Dragan<br>
  Abstract: This book is a marker of the state of theorytoday. Its rich array of wideranging essays explores the dimensions and implications of the work of J. Hillis Miller, one of the most eminent literary scholars in America. For nearly half a century, Miller has been known for his close and imaginative engagement with the implications of European philosophical thought and for his passionate advocacy of close reading.Building on this intellectual legacy, the contributors instantiate and extend the practice and ethics of sustained close reading that is Miller's hallmark. The book culminates in a moving piece by Jacques Derrida, Miller's close friend of forty years, who engages Miller's readings of Gerard Manley Hopkins in a historic encounter between French philosophy and American reading practices.A provocation to reading for new generations of students and teachers, these essays offer important resources for grasping the question of language in historical perspective and in contemporary life-a task essential for any democratic future.

The origin is largely in the work of English philosophers who became prominent in the forties and fifties and whose approach has been variously described as linguistic philosophy, philosophical analysis and philosophy of language. The name most prominent is that of Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889- 1951). His

  Book Title: Archaeology and Memory-  Publisher: Oxbow Books<br>
  Author(s): Borić Dušan<br>
  Abstract: Memory can be both a horrifying trauma and an empowering resource. From the Ancient Greeks to Nietzsche and Derrida, the dilemma about the relationship between history and memory has filled many pages, with one important question singled out: is the writing of history to memory a remedy or a poison? Recently, a growing interest in and preoccupation with the issue of memory, remembering and forgetting has resulted in a proliferation of published works, in various disciplines, that have memory as their focus. This trend, to which the present volume contributes, has started to occupy the dominant discourses of disciplines such as sociology, philosophy, history, anthropology and archaeology, and has also disseminated into the wider public discourse of society and culture today. Such a condition may perhaps echo the phenomenon of a melancholic experience at the turn of the millennium. Archaeology and Memory seeks to examine the diversity of mnemonic systems and their significance in different past contexts as well as the epistemological and ontological importance of archaeological practice and narratives in constituting the human historical condition. The twelve substantial contributions in this volume cover a diverse set of regional examples and focus on a range of prehistoric and classical case studies in Eurasian regional contexts as well as on the predicaments of memory in examples of the archaeologies of 'contemporary past'. From the Mesolithic and Neolithic burial chambers to the trenches of World War I and the role of materiality in international criminal courts, a number of contributors examine how people in the past have thought about their own pasts, while others reflect on our own present-day sensibilities in dealing with the material testimonies of recent history. Both kinds of papers offer wider theoretical reflections on materiality, archaeological methodologies and the ethical responsibilities of archaeological narration about the past.<br>

  Book Title: Land and People-Papers in Memory of John G. Evans<br>
  Publisher: Oxbow Books<br>
  Author(s): O’Connor Terry<br>
  Abstract: This volume is derived, in concept, from a conference held in honour of John Evans by the School of History and Archaeology and The Prehistoric Society at Cardiff University in March 2006. It brings together papers that address themes and landscapes on a variety of levels. They cover geographical, methodological and thematic areas that were of interest to, and had been studied by, John Evans. The volume is divided into five sections, which echo themes of importance in British prehistory. They include papers on aspects of environmental archaeology, experiments and philosophy; new research on the nature of woodland on the chalklands of southern England; coasts and islands; people, process and social order, and snails and shells - a strong part of John Evans' career. This volume presents a range of papers examining people's interaction with the landscape in all its forms. The papers provide a diverse but cohesive picture of how archaeological landscapes are viewed within current research frameworks and approaches, while also paying tribute to the innovative and inspirational work of one of the leading protagonists of environmental archaeology and the holistic approach to landscape interpretation.<br>

  Abstract: As we have seen in the discussion of his biography, Satan is a paradoxical figure, showing contradictory characteristics and constantly evading definition. In this section, I explore how different satanic characters in literature represent manifestations of evil, in conjunction with the theological concepts of theodicy and theological discussions of evil. I refer to it as a literary exploration of postmodern or contemporary thoughts on evil in philosophy and theology. We have seen now how Satan is a literary figure and finds his

  Abstract: At this point in the book I think we have done enough background digging to realize that the deep-seated antipathy that modern Western philosophy and theology reflexively has towards Christian Platonism may well tell us more about modernity and nineteenth-century progressivism than it tells us about Christian Platonism. Further, I hope that it is clear that we can now no longer simply
                  assumethat Christian Platonism is obviously a bad and dead idea that is a travesty to both philosophy and theology. However, I would not be writing this book if it was not broadly assumed by academics and the<br>

  Book Title: The Atheist's Primer-  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Palmer Michael<br>
  Abstract: In The Atheist's Primer, a prominent philosopher, Dr Michael Palmer, reinstates the importance of philosophy in the debate about God's existence. The 'new atheism' of Richard Dawkins and others has been driven by largely Darwinian objections to God's existence, limiting the debate to within a principally scientific framework. This has obscured the philosophical tradition of atheism, in which the main intellectual landmarks in atheism's history are to be found. With an analysis of atheistic thought from the Ancient Greeks to the present day, Palmer explains and comments on the philosophical arguments warranting atheism, discussing issues such as evil, morality, miracles, and the motivations for belief. The emphasis placed on materialism and the limitations of our knowledge might seem disheartening to some; but Palmer concludes on a positive note, arguing – alongside Nietzsche, Marx and Freud and many others – that happiness and personal fulfilment are to be found in the very materialism that religious belief rejects. Michael Palmer first addressed these issues in his student-oriented edition, The Atheist's Creed, of which The Atheist's Primer is a revised abridgement for the general reader. Palmer has now stripped out the primary texts and expanded his commentaries into fluent and concise analyses of the arguments. Free of philosophical jargon and assumptions of prior knowledge, this is an important introduction to a major cultural debate.<br>

  2  The Origins of Atheism from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgdxp0">The Atheist's Primer</a><br>
  Abstract: The origins of Western atheism lie in classical antiquity, in which first developed a naturalistic and empirical explanation of the world. Already visible in Greece in the philosophy of the Sophists of the second half of the fifth century B.C., this replacement of divine by natural causation became much more pronounced in the later schools of Epicurean Materialism and Scepticism. It is not easy to say precisely why this occurred, and why the old mythological conception of the gods as the sole agents of creation should have declined so rapidly. Various explanations have been offered. Gaskin suggests that the multiple<br>

  Abstract: Levinas’ ethical philosophy has had a major impact on philosophical and religious thinking of the late 20th century. Notable amongst the number of writers who have been influenced by Levinas’ thought is well-known and controversial French philosopher, Jacques Derrida. In this chapter, we will explore the ways in which Levinas’ commendation of the priority of the ethical, manifested in concepts such as the “transcendence of the Other” and the “infinite responsibility” of the subject, are developed further by Derrida into the theme of “unconditional hospitality.” Defining and Delineating Derrida’s Deconstruction?

  Abstract: The work of Emmanuel Levinas and Jacques Derrida has been of major significance in its critique of the modern Western understanding of selfhood and identity. For both Levinas and Derrida, Western conceptions of human identity and personhood post-Descartes are deeply disturbing. In placing the

  Author(s) HART KEVIN<br>
  Abstract: The modern quest for a Christian theology without metaphysics properly begins with Albrecht ritschl who sought to separate theology from scholasticism, on the one hand, and the speculative philosophical theology practiced by Hegel, on the other.² Of course, one finds a good deal of theology since then, including Karl Barth’s, that wishes to limit or eliminate metaphysical adventure.

  Abstract: Schleiermacher’s influence continued in Dilthey’s (1833–1911) hermeneutical philosophy. As a student of Schleiermacher, he published in 1871 his monumental
                     Life of Schleiermacher. Dilthey began to see in hermeneutics the foundation for theGeisteswissenschaften(human studies, or human sciences, or the social and human sciences), which means the humanities and social sciences aiming at interpreting expressions of human inner life. Human understanding penetrates into alien expressions of life through a transposition of the fullness of one’s own experience. The cultural sciences seek transposition, transferring mental objectifications back into reproductive experience.¹<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf16n">The Hermeneutical Self and an Ethical Difference</a><br>
  Abstract: Dilthey in his later years came to appreciate Husserl’s (1859–1938) teachings, which avoid psychological reasoning and articulate the importance of the idea of evidence and a methodological procedure in cognitive analyses. Husserl’s
                  Logical Investigations, published in two volumes in 1900 /1901, created phenomenology, including a new insight into hermeneutical theory. Husserl takes issue with Dilthey’s notion of worldview associated with historicism, because he believes that Dilthey depends on knowledge of historical relativity, causing the absolute validity of any particular life-interpretation, religion, or philosophy to disappear. The formation of a historical consciousness destroys “the belief in the universal validity” undertaken<br>

  Abstract: The purpose of the present part is to examine the philosophical development of the hermeneutical subject and ethics of the Other in the Western context, viewing the struggle with the enlightenment project and also in the aftermath of modernity. A philosophical debate concerning the legacy of the Enlightenment finds its voice in a postcolonial argument in the aftermath of colonialism.

As possibly the most significant philosopher of religion in the second half of twentieth century, Hick’s contributions to the field of philosophy of religion in general, and in religious epistemology, theistic proofs, theodicy, death and eternal life, and mysticism, in particular, have widely been recognized.

  Abstract: Before I begin examining and evaluating the specifics of Hick’s Christology in the next chapter, it is important for the purposes of this study to obtain a general understanding of Hick’s philosophy of religious pluralism. More so than the other pluralist theologians I mentioned in the last chapter, Hick’s theology of pluralism is fundamentally dependent on his philosophical insights. As has already been mentioned, hick began his academic career not as a theologian but, significantly, as a philosopher of religion. Throughout the course of his distinguished career, Hick has been widely recognized for his important contributions in the field of<br>

  Abstract: Having considered hick’s philosophy of pluralism in the last chapter, I am now ready to examine Hick’s theology of pluralism, concentrating especially on his Christology for a pluralistic age. as one of the leading philosophers of religion of our time, hick has not only been active in the contemporary theological scene, his contributions, particularly in the area of Christology, have been very significant. Specifically, hick has attempted to advance the limits of the traditional boundaries of Christology beyond the understanding of Christ and Christianity to the world of religions. Traditionally, Christianity has always confessed Jesus of Nazareth as god incarnate,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf285">Jesus and the Cross</a><br>
  Abstract: In philosophy, some things are understood to be because they could not be otherwise; whereas other things could have been otherwise but just so happen to be. These vague intuitions are of course codified into more technical terms: it is
                  necessarythat some things are so, merelycontingentthat other things are so. A key metaphysical question for philosophers then, is to ask what things are necessary and what things are contingent.² From a theological perspective this question is often framed in terms of the distinction between God and the created realm.

There are, however, some further contributions that become apparent as one does an exposition of his theological and missiological thinking. There are also some challenges to his thinking that need to be addressed. Newbigin is not the first to confront Western culture as a missionary in the Twentieth Century.

While he believed them to be theological in origin, he saw them manifested in philosophy, art, and literature. Schaeffer’s attitude<br>

  Abstract: This book is a philosophical effort to deal with the problem of otherness, particularly as it has been bequeathed to contemporary thought by the legacy of German idealism, whose most challenging, influential thinker was Hegel. The problem of otherness is not just a contemporary issue, of course; because of its intimate link with dialectic, it reverberates throughout the entire tradition of philosophy.¹ In the wake of Hegel, many thinkers have come to see the philosophical tradition as invariably favoring sameness over otherness, identity over difference, unity over plurality.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf4pb">Desire, Dialectic and Otherness</a><br>
  Abstract: The search for origins is a recurrent theme in the tradition of philosophy. It tends to be approached in terms of either an origin that is other than human, in traditional transcendent metaphysics, or in terms of a source of meaning immanent in selfhood itself, as in modern transcendental philosophies. The search for origins has been criticized recently on both these scores, the first as so-called ontotheology, the second as in essence a nostalgic continuation of the same ontotheology, only now relocated and hidden within transcendental subjectivity (see Introduction). What these criticisms largely amount to is the accusation that the<br>

  Abstract: We must now develop in fuller detail the notion of a two-way mediation between desire and otherness. I propose to do this by focusing on the desire to know. This focus is determined by a number of considerations. First, the centrality of reflection on knowledge in philosophy hardly needs to be restated. Focusing on knowledge will allow a certain clarity with respect to the possible relations between self and otherness as explicitly defined by different traditional positions like idealism and realism. Second, our primary stress throughout on human desire, as the thread linking the episodes of our itinerary, does not<br>

  Book Title: Theology in Language, Rhetoric, and Beyond-Essays in Old and New Testament<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Lundbom Jack R.<br>
  Abstract: Theology in Language, Rhetoric, and Beyond' places before a broad audience of students and general readers theological essays on both the Old and New Testaments. Theology is seen to derive from a number of sources: the biblical language, biblical rhetoric and composition, academic disciplines other than philosophy, and above all a careful exegesis of the biblical text. The essay on Psalm 23 makes use of anthropology and human-development theory; the essay on Deuteronomy incorporates Wisdom themes; the essay called "Jeremiah and the Created Order" looks at ideas not only about God and creation but also about the seldom-considered idea of God and a return to chaos; and the essay on the "Confessions of Jeremiah" examines, not the words that this extraordinary prophet was given by God to preach, but what he himself felt and experienced in the office to which he was called. One essay on "Biblical and theological themes" includes a translation into the African language of Lingala, which weaves together the story of early Christianity with the more recent founding of churches in Africa and Asia. Jack R. Lundbom argues eloquently through these essays that theology is rooted in biblical words, in themselves, in rhetoric and their different contexts.<br>

  Abstract: As a beginning philosopher, Ricoeur found himself at the juncture of three major philosophical orientations: the French reflexive philosophy, the philosophy of existence of Gabriel Marcel and Karl Jaspers, and Husserl’s descriptive phenomenology.¹ French reflexive philosophy appears in Ricoeur’s own description as a way of thinking which can be traced back to the Cartesian
                  cogito, through Kant and the French post-Kantianism, having Jean Nabert as its most prominent figure.² If preoccupation with epistemological issues, translated in the predominance of matters of justification and certitude, has been the overriding concern of such a line of thought, what Ricoeur retains from reflexive<br>

  Abstract: So typically romantic were those verses that few could have guessed that Hegel would be able to turn this hopeless feeling of the “poverty of words” into the bliss of Absolute knowledge. Indeed, Hegel’s philosophy appears to be no less than an initiatory ascent, confident that it can break the silence, and make us hear the Truth again, or perhaps even more, stare it in the face and dwell in its presence.

I shall formally adopt a historical-systematic approach without delving too deeply into the details of Hegel’s conceptual intricacies. Nonetheless, some general clarifications will be attempted about both content and method, the nature of the subject matter, and the nature of the approach itself.

  Abstract: In the prior chapter, we were hesitant about appropriating any of the analytic epistemologies surveyed because they appeared incapable of addressing the broad sense of knowing required to do theology. However, there is a burgeoning group of philosophers and theologians who are advocating that theology might benefit from being more like analytic philosophy, at least, more like the analytic method. This most recent effort to encourage Christian theologians toward the analytic method was captured by the anthology

  Abstract: Pragmatism, even if limited to its specifically North American and philosophical trajectories, is quite diverse.¹ Not only are pragmatist philosophers working in various areas—e.g., philosophy of science, linguistics, logic, social theory—but they are also debating issues of validity and legitimacy regarding developments within the tradition itself. It is inevitable that the classical pragmatism of Peirce, Royce, and James would have inspired a wide spectrum of philosophical projects, and that these would have been extended by the legacy of “middle pragmatists” such as Dewey, G.

  Book Title: Facing the Other-John Paul II, Levinas, and the Body<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): de Malherbe Brice<br>
  Abstract: What is the significance of the body? What might phenomenology contribute to a theological account of the body? And what is gained by prolonging the overlooked dialogue between St. John Paul II and Emmanuel Levinas? Nigel Zimmermann answers these questions through the agreements and the tensions between two of the most important thinkers of the twentieth century. John Paul II, the Polish pope, philosopher, and theologian, and Emmanuel Levinas, the French-Jewish philosopher of Lithuanian heritage, were provocative thinkers who courageously faced and challenged the assumptions of their age. Both held the human person in high regard and did their thinking with constant reference to God and to theological language. Zimmermann does not shirk from the challenges of each thinker and does not hide their differences. However, he shows how they bequeath a legacy regarding the body that we would overlook at significant ethical peril. We are called, Zimmermann argues, to face the other. In this moment God refuses a banal marginalisation and our call to responsibility for the other person is issued in their disarming vulnerability. In the body, philosophy, theology, and ethics converge to call us to glory, even in the paradox of lowly suffering.<br>

In chapters 1–2, we introduced this theological transition by looking at the shift from Kant and Schleiermacher to Barth. In the last chapter, we discussed characteristics of postmodernity as understood within current social theory, and concluded that social theory, by itself, cannot provide an answer to the problem of moral epistemology in social ethics. Although social theory makes positive contributions to our understanding of the social world we inhabit, it fails to provide a<br>

  Author(s) Helps Lisa<br>
  Abstract: Despite the “veritable flood of books, conferences, and panels on body history, or bodies in history,” why, historian Kathleen Canning asks, has the body remained a largely “unexplicated and undertheorised historical concept.”¹ I would add that this lack of
                  historicaltheorization is particularly surprising in light of the veritable torrent of literature on the body over the last fifteen years in areas as diverse as geography, philosophy, anthropology, cultural studies, and biology, to name only a few. In addressing this disparate body of work, medieval historian Caroline Bynum has argued that “despite the enthusiasm for the topic, discussions of the<br>

  CHAPTER 2  HERMENEUTIC PHENOMENOLOGY AS FUNDAMENTAL ONTOLOGY from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1ckpcvp">Rephrasing Heidegger</a><br>
  Abstract: In Chapter 1 we discussed the history of the phenomenological movement and emphasized the themes and approaches that are particularly significant for an adequate comprehension of Heidegger’s philosophy as it is presented in his main work,
                  Being and Time.¹ We noted that in order to understand Heidegger’s phenomenological methodology, it is particularly important to begin with a basic knowledge of the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl. Without a knowledge of Husserl, it is very easy to confuse Heidegger’s philosophical methodology with a merely “descriptive” approach, a confusion that we will address in the course of the following sections. Of course, the<br>

  Book Title: Is There a Canadian Philosophy?-Reflections on the Canadian Identity<br>
  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>
  Author(s): HARRIS INGRID<br>
  Abstract: Is There a Canadian Philosophy?addresses the themes of community, culture, national identity, and universal human rights, taking the Canadian example as its focus. The authors argue that nations compelled to cope with increasing demands for group recognition may do so in a broadly liberal spirit and without succumbing to the dangers associated with an illiberal, adversarial multiculturalism. They identify and describe a Canadian civic philosophy and attempt to show how thismodus operandiof Canadian public life is capable of reconciling questions of collective identity and recognition with a commitment to individual rights and related principles of liberal democracy. They further argue that this philosophy can serve as a model for nations around the world faced with internal complexities and growing demands for recognition from populations more diverse than at any previous time in their histories.<br>

This was part of a larger project intended to take stock of the current place of philosophy in education and culture, with the aim of promoting the teaching of philosophy throughout the world. The basic theme of the book was that, as its title suggests, the fate of democracy is intimately linked to that of philosophy: “l’enseignement philosophique … a partie liée avec les processus de démocratisation” (Droit 1995, 71).

  Abstract: It is an old Canadian political impulse to seek reconciliation between apparent opposites both at the levels of political philosophy and practice. Perhaps a legacy of the historic agreement that brought together in a single nation cultures as diverse as the English, the French, and an assortment of aboriginal peoples, the practice of seeking political consensus through compromise—sometimes at the expense of principle—has long been the norm in Canadian political culture.

  Author(s) Harding Sandra<br>
  Abstract: The “modern” in “modern science” is a relatively unexamined concept within the sciences and in the philosophy, sociology and history of science; it is a concept for which theories have yet to be developed, this at a time when other aspects of Western sciences have been fruitfully explored in critical and illuminating ways, and when the exceptionalism and triumphalism characteristic of Western attitudes toward our sciences have been explicitly criticized and purportedly abandoned by many of the scholars working in science studies fields.

  Abstract: For many of us working in literary and cultural studies, the notion of “modernity in transit” marks a certain irony: if in the last two to three decades, modernity seemed to have withered away as a theoretical concept in a vast array of academic disciplines (including important branches of philosophy and the social sciences), and postmodernism seemed to have won the day in much of the humanities, modernity seems to have returned with a vengeance in recent years. Now it is the grand narration of the postmodern condition entailing a total break with modernity that seems on its way out,<br>

  Four  T. H. GREEN ON RIGHTS AND THE COMMON GOOD from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1ckpdx6">Philosophical Theory and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a><br>
  Author(s) Martin Rex<br>
  Abstract: T.H. Green’s posthumously published
                  Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation(1886) is one of the finest books in the philosophy of rights to date. In it, Green emphasized two distincf elements of rights: the requirement of social recognition and the idea of a common good. But this leads to a tension in his theory. Either of the two principal elements could plausibly be said to exist in the absence of the other. Where this happens, or could happen, does the element that stands alone lose all claim to the status of a right? An attempted resolution of this potential<br>

  Author(s) Nelson Ralph<br>
  Abstract: Surely one of the most remarkable occurrences in the last half of the twentieth century was the revival of human–formerly natural–rights theory. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948; the emergence of notions of human rights in political philosophy, especially liberal political philosophy; the use of the rhetoric of rights in international relations; the entrenchment of rights in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms; and last, but not least, the adoption by Pope John Paul II of the language of human rights bear testimony to this renewed interest.<br>

  Author(s) Feist Richard<br>
  Abstract: The founder of the phenomenological movement, Edmund Husserl (1859-1938), lived through a dynamic time for the sciences.¹ Not only were there major developments in mathematics and physics, but some of the greatest practitioners of these disciplines were pursuing foundational questions with an unprecedented depth and rigour. Although Husserl did not directly contribute to these developments, it is not correct to say that he simply sat on the sidelines. He personally knew and corresponded with several of the finest scientific and mathematical minds of the time. It is, therefore, not surprising that the relationship between Husserl’s philosophy and the sciences is<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1ckpfgz">Husserl and the Sciences</a><br>
  Author(s) Buckley R. Philip<br>
  Abstract: It is well known that for a long period within the phenomenological tradition itself, there was a tendency to view the
                  Crisis-texts of Husserl’s last years as marking a radical shift in his thought. Major figures such as Gadamer and Merleau-Ponty¹ are well-known exponents of this view, and even circumspect and insightful subsequent scholars such as Carr tend to stress the novelty, for example, of the infusion of history into Husserl’s later philosophy² Some treat this ‘novelty’ as a reaction to the historical crisis of the 1930s, and also imply that the proximity and popularity of Heidegger should not be<br>

  Book Title: Philosophical Apprenticeships-Contemporary Continental Philosophy in Canada<br>
  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>
  Author(s): Robinson Jason<br>
  Abstract: Philosophical Apprenticeshipsgathers fresh and innovative essays written by the next generation of Canada's philosophers on the work of prominent Canadian philosophers currently researching topics in continental philosophy. The authors--doctoral students studying at Canadian universities--have studied with, worked with, or been deeply influenced by these philosophers. Their essays present, discuss, and develop the work of their mentors, addressing issues such as time, art, politics, hermeneutics, and phenomenology. The result is a volume that introduces the reader to the work of current Canadian philosophers and to that of their successors, who will soon be making their own contributions to Canadian continental philosophy.Includes articles by Gabriel Malenfant on Bettina Bergo, Saulius Geniusas on Gary Madison, John Marshall on Samuel Mallin, François Doyon on Claude Piché, Stephanie Zubcic on Jennifer Bates, Alexandra Morrison on Graeme Nicholson, Scott Marratto on John Russon, and Jill Gilbert on John Burbridge.<br>

  Author(s) Marshall John<br>
  Abstract: Arguably one of the most difficult tasks of philosophy is to grasp where we are today. While undoubtedly this has something to do with the usual biases of the day, in that philosophers are as surely bound by mundane prejudices as everyone else, it also seems to derive from a factor peculiar to philosophy. It is no accident that philosophers have long dealt with the question of the good life. Philosophers have always wanted to leave the cave. Whether or not one fashions the departure in grand metaphysical terms, one can maintain, with fairly adequate justification, that a defining characteristic<br>

  Book Title: Northrop Frye-New Directions from Old<br>
  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>
  Author(s): Rampton David<br>
  Abstract: More than fifty years after the publication of
      Anatomy of Criticism, Northrop Frye remains one of Canada's most influential intellectuals. This reappraisal reasserts the relevance of his work to the study of literature and illuminates its fruitful intersection with a variety of other fields, including film, cultural studies, linguistics, and feminism. Many of the contributors draw upon the early essays, correspondence, and diaries recently published as part of theCollected Works of Northrop Fryeseries, in order to explore the development of his extraordinary intellectual range and the implications of his imaginative syntheses. They refute postmodernist arguments that Frye's literary criticism is obsolete and propose his wide-ranging and non-linear ways of thinking as a model for twenty-first century readers searching for innovative ways of understanding literature and its relevance to contiguous disciplines. The volume provides an in-depth examination of Frye's work on a range of literary questions, periods, and genres, as well as a consideration of his contributions to literary theory, philosophy, and theology. The portrait that emerges is that of a writer who still has much to offer those interested in literature and the ways it represents and transforms our world. The book's overall argument is that Frye's case for the centrality of the imagination has never been more important where understanding history, reconciling science and culture, or reconceptualizing social change is concerned.<br>

  Abstract: In “Averroes’ Search” Borges imaginatively reconstructs the effort of the greatest of the Western Muslim philosophers to deal with the
                  Poeticsof Aristotle.¹ Averroes’ commentaries on Aristotle were a powerful influence on Scholasticism, which means, of course, on the history of Western philosophy in general. But Averroes was dealing with an Aristotle in translation, an Aristotle, in fact, twice removed from Arabic, for Aristotle was first translated into Syriac by Christian Syrians and then into Arabic from the Syriac.² Knowing neither Greek nor Syriac, this monumental scholar, whom the Schoolmen honoured simply as the “the Commentator,” was twice removed from<br>

  CHAPTER 1  Kant’s Transcendental Problematic from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cn6r4p">Apperception, Knowledge, and Experience</a><br>
  Abstract: A traditional way of introducing Kant to an audience somewhat familiar with the history of philosophy is to view him as attempting to synthesize the primary insights of Continental rationalism and British empiricism. Although this approach tends to downplay Kant’s genuine originality as a thinker, its virtue lies in the ready access it provides to many of the more technically difficult themes of Kant’s epistemology. And that is why I shall employ it in these brief introductory remarks.<br>

  CHAPTER 3  The Closure of Kant’s Problematic: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cn6r4p">Apperception, Knowledge, and Experience</a><br>
  Abstract: Kant undertook the transcendental turn in philosophy to counter the scepticism of Hume; that is, he sought to provide an explanation of how it is possible to have knowledge that is both necessary and objective. Since knowledge derived from experience can never claim necessity, Kant concludes that such knowledge must be transcendental in origin. His account of how such knowledge is possible focusses on transcendental apperception and the order that it imposes upon the experience. We have seen, however, that his account fails to show that the categories can be derived entirely a priori, and that his final account of<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cn6r4p">Apperception, Knowledge, and Experience</a><br>
  Abstract: We have been reading certain developments in German philosophy as an attempt to close the gap between Kant’s transcendental apparatus and the world to which that apparatus gives order and coherence. We have seen, however, that none of the developments under consideration has been able to provide a completely transcendental or a priori account of the Kantian schema. Rather schemata appear to result from the interaction of the mind and the empirical data of experience. Hence we might conclude with Heidegger that it is through schemata that what we call a “world” is first opened up. In confronting these diverse<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cn6sd9">Roman Ingarden's Ontology and Aesthetics</a><br>
  Abstract: As we have seen, Ingarden’s primary philosophical concern lay not in aesthetics per se but in ontology. He undertook his extensive analyses of art in order not to gather material for the construction of a general ‘theory of art’ but rather to elucidate and, to some extent, ground his position with regard to the idealism/realism debate. Seen in this light, it is not at all surprising that his analyses of the different sorts of art do not yield a single conception of ‘the nature of art’,¹ which had been the goal of most traditional philosophy of art and aesthetic theory<br>

  Abstract: Generalizations about linguistic analysis and ethics are not likely to be very useful; nor, as a general rule, are general descriptions of linguistic methods in philosophy enlightening. Unless one has actually seen some live philosophical tangle unsnarled by such a technique, one will not be very convinced by even a very accurate general description of the methods used. On the other hand, sample analyses of moral concepts often do not make clear their relevance (direct or indirect) to actual moral perplexities.

  Author(s) O’CALLAGHAN JOHN P.<br>
  Abstract: A volume on the importance of philosophy for faith and theology is certainly a legacy of my teacher and friend Ralph McInerny. I hope that I can do honor to him, not just as a friend or teacher, but as a colleague precisely on a topic of such great moment in McInerny’s thought, the role of philosophy in the life of faith. One of his last books,
                  Praeambula Fidei, was a spirited defense of philosophy and the good it achieves in the life of faith, and thus for theology as reasoned reflection upon God’s revelation, what Aquinas called “sacra doctrina.”<br>

  Abstract: This book has for its general theme: the need of philosophy in theology.¹ My article invokes the legacy of a recently deceased colleague and friend, Ralph McInerny, one of whose last books was, in his own words, “a defense of a robust understanding of the teaching of St. Thomas Aquinas and of the Magisterium on
                     Praeambula Fidei.”² By the “praeambula fidei” he means those truths concerning God, and first of all the truth of his very existence, which can be demonstrated by philosophy, and which are essential for the life of supernatural faith.<br>

  Author(s) KOTERSKI JOSEPH<br>
  Abstract: There are numerous ways in which philosophy can be of service to theological education. There is something invaluable, for instance, in the art of making distinctions, and among the many ways of acquiring such facility, this skill is especially promoted by training in logic, philosophy of nature, and metaphysics. It is not just a matter of avoiding arbitrary distinctions without a basis in real differences but of devising distinctions that make their cuts between diverse natural kinds. Crucial to the theoretical justification for this activity is the notion that things have real natures that can be discovered by human inquiry.<br>

  CHAPTER EIGHT  Philosophical Starting Points: from:

  Abstract: To go by the first article of Aquinas’s
                     Summa theologiae, as well as by the traditional order of seminary courses, the place of philosophy in theological education would seem to be before, or at least at, the beginning. To go by theSummaas a whole, and by the way in which theology is customarily taught, philosophy permeates theological education from beginning to end, although it is changed in doing so. Philosophy in theological education is aprincipiumin two senses: it is both a point of departure and a continuing resource.<br>

  Author(s) BELLAMAH TIMOTHY<br>
  Abstract: At the outset of the
                  Metaphysics, Aristotle says that “all men suppose what is called wisdom (sophia) to deal with the first causes (aitia) and the principles (archai) of things,” and that it is these causes and principles that he proposes to study in this work.¹ During the thirteenth century the recent recovery of Aristotle’s works of natural philosophy (Physics, Metaphysics, De anima, Meteora), resulted in an evolution of the understanding of causality, which in turn resulted in remarkable developments in biblical interpretation.² Especially at the universities of Paris and Oxford commentators reevaluated conventional anthropological presuppositions and reassessed the human<br>

  Abstract: This habit of prescribing more of what has caused the problem is a mark of our age. Philosophers, aware that something has gone wrong in their discipline, do not see the need for a 180-degree turn. What are considered radical solutions, merely plunge us deeper into nihilism and relativism. In short, the culture and its philosophy have grown worse since 1879, and the remedy Leo XIII proposed remains the only cure. The human mind must again be<br>

  Abstract: This chapter seeks to honor the esteemed Ralph McInerny by exploring what Robert Sokolowski has to say about the role of philosophy in theology and theological education. He has addressed this issue many times, in many ways. I begin with some evidently sensible advice that he has given to seminary educators about philosophy. There follows a description of what he calls the “theology of disclosure.” Third, I gather up some of the “disclosures” he has made in Christology. Last, I try to press things just a little further in one or two matters Christological.<br>

  Abstract: This chapter aims to illuminate the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary. It views what the Church holds about her maternal mediation as an application of Aristotelian efficient instrumental causality within the order of grace. Specifically, the chapter evokes the notion of “physical causality” that the grand Thomist tradition employs when speaking about the sacraments. While the crisis over instrumental causality reaches beyond the theology of the sacraments, one nonetheless recognizes it rather acutely there. This crisis stems from several sources, such as developments in both natural philosophy and theological method. It is wondrous to observe that several approaches to<br>

  Book Title: The Wedding Feast of the Lamb-Eros, the Body, and the Eucharist<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hughes George<br>
  Abstract: Emmanuel Falque's The Wedding Feast of the Lamb represents a turning point in his thought. Here, Falque links philosophy and theology in an original fashion that allows us to see the full effect of theology's "backlash" against philosophy. By attending closely to the incarnation and the eucharist, Falque develops a new concept of the body and of love: By avoiding the common mistake of "angelism"--consciousness without body--Falque considers the depths to which our humanity reflects animality, or body without consciousness. He shows the continued relevance of the question "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?" (John 6:52), especially to philosophy. We need to question the meaning of "this is my body" in "a way that responds to the needs of our time" (Vatican II). Because of the ways that "Hoc est corpus meum" has shaped our culture and our modernity, this is a problem both for religious belief and for culture.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1d391qf">The Wedding Feast of the Lamb</a><br>
  Abstract: The traditional dualism of body and soul is now considered dated, but we have put a new binary structure in its place: that of flesh and body. Certainly this is an important step forward and one that has proved fruitful. When we talk of the “flesh” we describe the
                  lived experienceof our bodies, and we bring into view what we actually do, while we also bracket off theorganicquality of the “body,” seeing it as an obstacle to the body’s subjectivity. But there are some questions that we still need to consider: Hasn’t philosophy forgotten thematerialand<br>

One can philosophize to its limit, in the sense of a limit to what remains to be done, because no other solution seems possible (as when I have to miss a rendezvous evenat the very limitof the deadline because something more important has come up). More significantly, philosophers have been trying recently to do philosophyat its limit, precisely because they would then reach the limit of philosophy (rejecting the ascendancy of a predicative discourse, in phenomenology, as in analytic philosophy).

  Abstract: This theoretical inquiry into the concept of the
                  eventstarts with Heidegger’s thinking aboutdas Ereignis, usually translated as “event of appropriation,” by means of which he elaborates a philosophy of Being as event.¹ Indeed, Heidegger offers an important source in the study of the event insofar as it is considered not as a simple happening in the world but rather as that which makes any happening possible. The priority Heidegger assigns this term casts a new light on some acute traditional problems concerning the conception of time and presence, the identity of things, human being, and the essence of<br>

  Abstract: The return to the ontological questions of philosophy and their renewal is Gilles Deleuze’s most pressing project. It is his philosophical priority to refuse any transcendent ideas or transcendental conditions; instead, he tends to examine the vital forces of an immanent structure. Using the term “plane of immanence,” Deleuze suggests that thinking relates to the surface of a concrete reality that it absolutely does not transcend. Thinking does not merely depend on real experience: like a pre-Socratic sage of nature, Deleuze claims that the force of thinking, its astonishment and creativity, consists of the material movement of Being, as if<br>

  Abstract: While some theorists have suggested that translation is impossible (Payne 1971), to a large degree Western civilization and culture has depended upon translated documents originally written in one language into some other, usually more common, language. A large portion of our current understanding of philosophy, history, mythology, and religion comes to us through translated documents. What could we know of Aristotle, Plato, Moses, or Muhammad without contemporary translations of their writings into our mother tongue? From the philosophy of Immanuel Kant to the literature of Victor Hugo, the breadth of human knowledge is inextricably linked to the translation of documents<br>

  Book Title: Hermeneutics Ancient and Modern-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRUNS GERALD L.<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging meditation on the nature and purpose of hermeneutics, Gerald L. Bruns argues that hermeneutics is not merely a contemporary theory but an extended family of questions about understanding and interpretation that have multiple and conflicting histories going back to before the beginning of writing.What does it mean to understand a riddle, an action, a concept, a law, an alien culture, or oneself? Bruns expands our sense of the horizons of hermeneutics by situating its basic questions against a background of different cultural traditions and philosophical topics. He discusses, for example, the interpretation of oracles, the silencing of the muses and the writing of history, the quarrel between philosophy and poetry, the canonization of sacred texts, the nature of allegorical exegesis, rabbinical midrash, the mystical exegesis of the Qur'an, the rise of literalism and the individual interpreter, and the nature of Romantic hermeneutics. Dealing with thinkers ranging from Socrates to Luther to Wordsworth to Ricoeur, Bruns also ponders several basic dilemmas about the nature of hermeneutical experience, the meaning of tradition, the hermeneutical function of narrative, and the conflict between truth and freedom in philosophy and literature. His eloquent book demonstrates the continuing power of hermeneutical thinking to open up questions about the world and our place in it.<br>

  Abstract: It must be acknowledged that hermeneutics belongs to the realm of opinion, or rhetoric, rather than to the realm of truth, or philosophy.¹ But it seems part of every hermeneutical desire to cross the threshold of rhetoric and to speak, well, philosophically. My purpose in this chapter is to consider one or two ancient examples of this desire. These examples are related to the question of tradition, that is, the question of how we stand with respect to all that comes down to us from the past. A main problem about tradition is that things do not seem exactly to<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1dszwtv">Hermeneutics Ancient and Modern</a><br>
  Abstract: The title is meant to take us back to the quarrel between philosophy and poetry that Socrates already regarded as ancient. My sense is that every hermeneutical situation has the structure of this quarrel, which is governed by a logic that is by turns exclusionary and allegorical. Plato’s idea seems to have been that poetry embodies something (we’re not sure what) that interferes with the sort of discourse Socrates is trying to set up and that he seems to be practicing in texts like the
                  Republic, where one statement follows another more or less justifiably or according to some principle<br>

  Book Title: Citizen Subject-Foundations for Philosophical Anthropology<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Miller Steven<br>
  Abstract: What can the universals of political philosophy offer to those who experience the living paradox of an inegalitarian construction of egalitarian citizenship? Citizen Subject is the summation of +ëtienne BalibarGÇÖs career-long project to think the necessary and necessarily antagonistic relation between the categories of citizen and subject. In this magnum opus, the question of modernity is framed anew with special attention to the self-enunciation of the subject (in Descartes, Locke, Rousseau, and Derrida), the constitution of the community as GÇ£weGÇ¥ (in Hegel, Marx, and Tolstoy), and the aporia of the judgment of self and others (in Foucualt, Freud, Kelsen, and Blanchot)._x000D_ After the GÇ£humanist controversyGÇ¥ that preoccupied twentieth-century philosophy, Citizen Subject proposes foundations for philosophical anthropology today, in terms of two contrary movements: the becoming-citizen of the subject and the becoming-subject of the citizen. The citizen-subject who is constituted in the claim to a GÇ£right to have rightsGÇ¥ (Arendt) cannot exist without an underside that contests and defies it. HeGÇöor she, because Balibar is concerned throughout this volume with questions of sexual differenceGÇöfigures not only the social relation but also the discontent or the uneasiness at the heart of this relation. The human can be instituted only if it betrays itself by upholding GÇ£anthropological differencesGÇ¥ that impose normality and identity as conditions of belonging to the community._x000D_ The violence of GÇ£civilGÇ¥ bourgeois universality, Balibar argues, is greater (and less legitimate, therefore less stable) than that of theological or cosmological universality. Right is thus founded on insubordination, and emancipation derives its force from otherness._x000D_ Ultimately, Citizen Subject offers a revolutionary rewriting of the dialectic of universality and differences in the bourgeois epoch, revealing in the relationship between the common and the universal a political gap at the heart of the universal itself.<br>

  Book Title: Inca Garcilaso and Contemporary World-Making-  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Fernández Christian<br>
  Abstract: This edited volume offers new perspectives from leading scholars on the important work of Inca Garcilaso de la Vega (1539-1616), one of the first Latin American writers to present an intellectual analysis of pre-Columbian history and culture and the ensuing colonial period. To the contributors, Inca Garcilaso's
      Royal Commentaries of the Incaspresented an early counter-hegemonic discourse and a reframing of the history of native non-alphabetic cultures that undermined the colonial rhetoric of his time and the geopolitical divisions it purported. Through his research in both Andean and Renaissance archives, Inca Garcilaso sought to connect these divergent cultures into one world.This collection offers five classical studies ofRoyal Commentariespreviously unavailable in English, along with seven new essays that cover topics including Andean memory, historiography, translation, philosophy, trauma, and ethnic identity. This cross-disciplinary volume will be of interest to students and scholars of Latin American history, culture, comparative literature, subaltern studies, and works in translation.<br>

  Book Title: Transcendence and the Concrete-Selected Writings<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Moore Ian Alexander<br>
  Abstract: Jean Wahl (1888GÇô1974), once considered by the likes of Georges Bataille, Gilles Deleuze, Emmanuel Levinas, and Gabriel Marcel to be among the greatest French philosophers, has today nearly been forgotten outside France. Yet his influence on French philosophical thought can hardly be overestimated. Levinas wrote that GÇ£during over a half century of teaching and research, [Wahl] was the life force of the academic, extra-academic, and even, to a degree anti-academic philosophy necessary to a great culture.GÇ¥ And Deleuze, for his part, commented that GÇ£Apart from Sartre, who remained caught none the less in the trap of the verb to be, the most important philosopher in France was Jean Wahl.GÇ¥_x000D_ Besides engaging with the likes of Bataille, Bergson, Deleuze, Derrida, Levinas, Maritain, and Sartre, Wahl also played a significant role, in some cases almost singlehandedly, in introducing French philosophy to movements like existentialism, and American pragmatism and literature, and thinkers like Hegel, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Jaspers, and Heidegger. Yet Wahl was also an original philosopher and poet in his own right. This volume of selections from WahlGÇÖs philosophical writings makes a selection of his most important work available to the English-speaking philosophical community for the first time._x000D_ Jean Wahl was Professor of Philosophy at the Sorbonne from 1936 to 1967, save during World War II, which he spent in the United States, having escaped from the Drancy internment camp. His books to appear in English include The Pluralist Philosophies of England and America (Open Court, 1925), The Philosopher's Way (Oxford UP, 1948), A Short History of Existentialism (Philosophical Library, 1949), and Philosophies of Existence (Schocken, 1969).<br>

                  Recherches Philosophiques, “perhaps the most significant [journal] of its time,”² it was republished in 1938 as an appendix toÉtudes kierkegaardiennes, which would go on to become the most important book on Kierkegaard in France.

He offers a personal gathering of influences on his own work as guides to the uses of philosophy in our search for sense and meaning. In concise, direct, and deeply felt chapters, Peperzak moves from Plato, Plotinus, and the Early Christian theologians to Anselm, Bonaventure, Descartes, Pascal, Leibniz, Hegel, and Levinas. Throughout these carefully linked essays, he touches on the fundamental ideas-from reason and faith to freedom and tradition-that inform the questions his work has consistently addressed, most specifically those concerning philosophy as a practice.<br>

In contrast to those of his colleagues in theology and philosophy who proclaim at every turn that the human mind cannot know God, let alone prove his existence, Hegel agrees with Anselm that genuine faith not merely pennits but requires the believer to seek to understand what he believes. 2.

  Abstract: God has died, at least in science and philosophy. He is agonizing in religious study, perhaps even in some divinity schools. Atheism and a careful sequestration of God from current business are the two main forms in which academia deals with the long history of religion, which, notwithstanding academic reservations, goes on. For scholarship, faith, God, and religion have become curiosa. The theoretical intention has separated itself from religious commitments; it abhors edifying language and has forgotten or rejected the long history of its association with contemplation.

  Author(s) Goodchild Philip<br>
  Abstract: What is a Continental philosophy of religion?¹ Philosophy of religion, in English-speaking countries, has a clear and distinct identity, and has been enjoying a resurgence: it focuses largely on the truth-claims, rationality, and coherence of religious propositions, and particularly those of “classical theism.”² Yet for those who work in the traditions of philosophy derived from Germany and France, the problems, tasks, concepts, reasoning, and cultural location are markedly different from this identity.

  Abstract: In recent years two thinkers, Derrida and Levinas, have contributed decisively to shaping the concept of radical responsibility, both before the human other and what has been called the divine. Within the parameters of philosophy of religion, if we would understand the way in which the concept of responsibility opens new avenues of thinking about the meaning of human justice, then we must come to terms with what Derrida and Levinas have recently argued. Furthermore, both men’s thought—preeminently and explicitly that of Derrida—is as if haunted by the work of Kierkegaard.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1g2kncw">Rethinking Philosophy of Religion</a><br>
  Author(s) Ward Graham<br>
  Abstract: I want to argue for the significance of theology to philosophy and the importance today of philosophical theology rather than philosophy of religion. I want to demonstrate how a new space for analogical thinking has been opened up by certain poststructuralist discourses; how this is a space in which we can think again of an analogical world and a cosmological project; but how, left to poststructural critical thinking alone, this worldview can all too easily endorse a culture of sadomasochism, by enjoying and enjoining its own endless victimage. Only a theological account (not, note, foundation), as the necessary supplement to<br>

  Abstract: This much, at least, is clear: we continue to speak of
                  apophasis.Studies on the logic and language of apophatic discourse abound,¹ and more are on the way. But why this concern, today, with apophaticism? More specifically, why is it that apophatic theologies are (still? again?) being studied and discussed in certain segments of contemporary philosophy? And to what end? This essay will first hazard a few answers and offer some remarks on contemporary philosophy’s ongoing interests in-and appropriations of—apophatic theological language. Attention will then be called to an essential feature of these apophatic texts that many studies neglect,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1g2kncw">Rethinking Philosophy of Religion</a><br>
  Author(s) Sadler Gregory B.<br>
  Abstract: A question that confronts practicing Roman Catholics engaged in Continental philosophy is the relationship between the practices, tradition, and intellectual resources of the Catholic Church and the boundaries of what is called Continental philosophy. Often the discourses that allow a renewed philosophical boldness in speaking about Christianity are marked by an equally liberating and corrosive temerity that, claiming to speak for none, or perhaps only for the other or the guest, seems to easily to aim to speak for all, to judge for all, to legislate for all. We must ask whether it is true that orthodoxy, one’s self-location within<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1g2kncw">Rethinking Philosophy of Religion</a><br>

  Abstract: In this essay I discuss in part I some aspects of the approach to religion that Schelling developed in his late “positive philosophy.” In part II, I explain how these ideas were taken up and reworked by Ernst Bloch. In part III, I interpret the implications of these developments for the contemporary Continental philosophy of religion. The first two parts of the essay are fairly conventional; the third part is not. Since at least the seventeenth century, there have been attempts to challenge “stasis thinking” in the West. The most important challenge to stasis thought, however, occurred in the work<br>

  Author(s) Fox Sherry C.<br>
  Abstract: Mimesisis the imitation of nature and life in art or literature. According to Plato, all art is mimetic of life and therefore a reflection of reality. This theory has spawned an entire philosophy and study of art and the nature of reality and identity (i.e.Potolsky 2006, Halliwell 2009 — for a prehistoric example see Borić 2007). If art does indeed reflect reality, then this could present a window into the past, representing either ideal images for a particular period or specific individuals. In some cases, it is possible to observe the integration of a specific biological phenomenon into artistic<br>

  Author(s) Matteucci Giovanni<br>
  Abstract: The title of this paper refers to the peculiar and indeed special role played by the concepts of nature, in general, and natural beauty, in particular, in Adorno’s philosophy. In fact, since Adorno’s early works of the 1930s up to his mature works of the 1960s, nature seems to represent what has been systematically repressed in the course of civilization. Hence, if observed from a dialectical point of view and expressed in somehow Pinkfloydian terms, nature appears as something like “the dark side of the truth” (or, in a more Springsteenian fashion, the “darkness” that lies “at the edge of<br>

  Abstract: From

From a meditation (together with his friend and colleague Horkheimer) on the unavoidable polarity in the Modern between the dynamics of rationalization and the persistence of myth, to an arduous analysis of the relationship between the work of art and philosophy.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gr7dw2">Theodor W. Adorno: Truth and Dialectical Experience / Verità ed esperienza dialettica</a><br>
  Author(s) Zanotti Giovanni<br>
  Abstract: Although often overlooked, a passage from Marx’s
                  Manuscripts of 1844represents an important turning point in the history of dialectical philosophy. In this work, a theoretical perspective is opened, which I define as the “contingency of antagonism” – an Adornian concept. I will argue: (a) that this is an original perspective, irreducible to any previous philosophical positions, (b) that Marx’s intuition finds a more sophisticated reformulation in Adorno, and (c) that the idea of a contingent antagonism can provide a key to overcome the apparently antinomical outcome of negative dialectic.

  Author(s) Bolaños Paolo A.<br>
  Abstract: Theodor W. Adorno’s preoccupation with language is gleaned from the context of his theory of knowledge, particularly his critique of identity thinking. He tackles the problem of conceptual reification genealogically, that is, he traces conceptual reification via an analysis of the structure of language. My aim in this paper is to argue that Adorno’s engagement with the nature of language is informed by an implicit attempt at a revaluation of the language of philosophy, a revaluation that has significant consequences for a global understanding of how we conceive the world of objects, in general, and how philosophy’s configurative use of<br>

  Abstract: This valuable volume brings together in one place for the first time a number of essays by one of India’s (and indeed international sociology’s) most innovative thinkers, and one moreover who is committed to erasing the boundaries between social theory and practice. Essentially what is suggested in the following pages is an approach to social knowledge and to positive social transformation that transcends the normal boundaries that so commonly separate sociology from philosophy and both from religion and spirituality. To a great extent the social sciences have failed to deliver on their Enlightenment promises. Perhaps this was too much to<br>

  Abstract: It is Jürgen Habermas (1981) himself who quite some time ago had challenged us that now we need a new philosophy of science which is not scientistic. It is worth asking Habermas, and all of us sociologists for whom sociological engagement is nothing more than an elaboration of the agenda of modernity, whether we need an understanding of and relationship with modernity which is not modernistic. This inquiry is at the core of understanding paths of civil society and experiments with modernities, not only in India but also in Europe, East Asia, Africa, Latin America and around the world.

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gxpchs">Philosophy and Anthropology</a><br>
  Author(s) Giri Ananta Kumar<br>
  Abstract: Philosophy and anthropology have long been intellectual companions. In European continental philosophy in particular, the boundaries between the two disciplines have always been very porous. One thinks at once of the largely German project to construct a philosophy of man and of human’s place in nature (a project broadly known as philosophical anthropology), the constant border crossings between anthropology and philosophy of notable individuals such as Paul Cassirer and Martin Heidegger, and the importation into British analytical philosophy by way of Ludwig Wittgenstein of concerns that can only be called anthropological. Although from the other side of the disciplinary boundary<br>

  Chapter 1  THE PROJECT OF PHILOSOPHICAL ANTHROPOLOGY from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gxpchs">Philosophy and Anthropology</a><br>
  Author(s) Clammer John<br>
  Abstract: The notion of a philosophical anthropology has almost entirely dropped out of contemporary intellectual discourse, both in philosophy and in anthropology. Among the few places where it is alive as an active concept or form of intellectual inquiry is in Christian (mainly Roman Catholic) theology. There are reasons for this absence, which we will shortly elaborate on, but the virtual disappearance of the idea of a philosophical anthropology is an unfortunate one, as it is potentially a notion that can not only provide a bridge between anthropology and philosophy – linked as we shall see by many common concerns – but also<br>

  Author(s) Marquez Ivan<br>
  Abstract: Western philosophy has had a long engagement with the philosophicalanthropological issue of the nature of and prospects for humanity. Aristotle, for instance, placed humans within a functional, organic, cosmic totality, where the part–whole relation between humans and the rest of nature ascribed the
                  telosand proper flourishing of humans. Many seventeenth-century philosophers – rationalists like Descartes, materialists like Hobbes and empiricists like Locke – defined humans as rational, self-interested and atomistic. With eighteenthcentury French Enlightenment thought – especially the idea of progress in the work of de Saint-Pierre, Turgot, Voltaire, d’Holbach, Helvetius and Condorcet – and nineteenth-century German idealism, especially Hegel, human nature<br>

  Author(s) Kämpf Heike<br>
  Abstract: One of the most interesting and fruitful anthropological discussions of philosophy occurred within the so-called ‘interpretive turn’ in anthropology. This turn was inspired by philosophy and initiated a reconsideration of philosophical concepts. In particular, the reconsideration of the hermeneutic notion of ‘ understanding’ led to new anthropological readings of the works of Martin Heidegger, Hans-Georg Gadamer and Paul Ricoeur. At the same time this anthropological discussion had its impact on philosophy. On the one hand, hermeneutic and analytic philosophy came closer together while questioning the possibilities of understanding alien cultures: Peter Winch and Richard Rorty dealt with the problem of<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gxpchs">Philosophy and Anthropology</a><br>
  Author(s) Šuber Daniel<br>
  Abstract: With some considerable delay, the German philosopher Wilhelm Dilthey (1833–1911) was, in 1986, declared the ‘new anthropological ancestor’ (Bruner 1986, 4). Although he had been acknowledged as having exerted some influence on major figures of anthropology, like Boas and Benedict well before, the recent turn to Dilthey was meant to go far beyond the historical concern. This move contrasts sharply with the result of an examination of the indexes of relevant textbooks on basic anthropological theory, where Dilthey’s name hardly ever appears. What then are the common points of contact between late twentieth-century anthropology and turn-of-the-century German philosophy? In<br>

  Abstract: Clifford Geertz (1926–2006) was one of the main figures to build a new kind of anthropology, beginning in the 1960s. In doing so, he borrowed many ideas from philosophy. Although some of his works have been read by philosophers too, the influence of his anthropology on philosophy is negligible. The reception of his thoughts does not conform to the generally accepted significance of his writings, appropriate to their philosophical content. Most often, Geertz is read only superficially and the reading is confined to his two most famous texts – ‘Thick Description’ (1973) and ‘Deep Play: Notes on Balinese Cockfight’ (1972).<br>

  Author(s) Kresse Kai<br>
  Abstract: An anthropological investigation into philosophy can provide us with insights and information about traditions of knowledge and intellectual practice elsewhere in the world, in social contexts very different from our own. The project needs to engage with – and first of all be able to identify – philosophy as part of social discourse, and as a social practice, within any given region. Here, I am carving out one particular approach about how this could work, in relation to the Swahili context and against the background of discussions in African philosophy. Philosophy, as socialized discourse and practice, overlaps with other (more established) areas<br>

  Author(s) Browne Craig<br>
  Abstract: The discipline of sociology partly originated from a perception of the limitations of political philosophy. The transition to modernity demanded new ways of addressing the questions that political philosophy had typically posed, such as the nature of authority, the conditions of the good life, the definition of justice, the degrees of freedom, and the prerequisites of inclusion in a community. Classical sociological theory reflected the modern appreciation of the independence of ‘the social’ relative to ‘the political’ and the need to understand the internal dynamics of ‘the social’ in their own terms. In a stronger sense, sociological theory suggested that<br>

I am interested in how this relationship has changed, particularly over the last thirty years; I think that there may have been a significant change in this relationship.

  Abstract: Pierre Bourdieu’s conception of habitus marks a theoretical step which no adequate understanding of social reality can ignore. By introducing habitus, Bourdieu is able both to integrate and to transcend major insights of the linguistic turn in philosophy, most prominently the idea that conscious intentional understanding necessarily relies on a host of implicit, practical, and holistic background assumptions which constitute meaning while being themselves unrepresented (Searle, 1989). The concept of habitus incorporates this idea since it shows that individual agency and its self-understanding are constituted by relying on an acquired social sense, the cognitive habitus, which defines how an agent<br>

This necessity is doubled when we recognize that the

The problem arises because we believe, on one hand, that the individual human being has autonomy, freedom, and dignity—values that are considered most worthwhile and ought therefore to be respected by the society; we believe, on the other hand, that the individual not only is a natural member of the human society but needs society and all that it makes available for the realization of the individual’s potential, and for living a life that is<br>

  Abstract: In the texts from the caribbean included here, the generative themes of African philosophy find expression in the context of the black diaspora forced by the Atlantic slave trade. The ontological emphasis on a relational con ception of reality plays a particularly important role in helping define the black community as something distinct from the European community of slaveholders. In turn, the Caribbean philosophical tradition presented here devotes much attention to the issues of constructing notions both of identity and self-determination and of culture and ethos within the framework of the black community.

  Abstract: There are idealist views of philosophy that see it as an affirmation of the autonomy of a thinking subject. As the primary instrument of this absolute subject, philosophy shares in its autonomy and therefore is a discipline that rises above the determinations of history and everyday life. The distinguishing characteristics of Afro-Caribbean philosophy do not support this view. Here we find a tradition of philosophy so indelibly marked by the forces of an imperial history, and by its intertextual relations with neighboring discourses, that it is necessary to begin with a general characterization of philosophy that is more appropriate to<br>

  Abstract: The black experience in north America shares important historical roots with that in the caribbean: in both regions, slavery assaulted the black community while reinforcing the need for this community, and strategies of dehumanization were integral to the dominant group’s maintenance of its domination. Thus, as in the caribbean, black philosophy in north America—at least that north American tradition we highlight here—works with the generative themes of the African philosophical tradition in ways that stress the importance of community in preserving and refiguring identity.

But modernity is predicated on the ecological emergency that has given rise to a new geological epoch: the A NTHROPOCENE. “Modernity” is how the Anthropocene has appeared to us historically thus far. Dividing the world into NATURE and culture is precisely anti-ecological insofar as it participates in the logistics that enabled humans to act as a geophysical force on a planetary scale. The Anthropocene is the moment when Western philosophy restricted itself to the (human) subject-world correlate (Meillassoux 2008, 5). This self-imposed<br>

The second part provides a historical overview of the doctrine of grace: in Scripture (especially the teaching of the book of Genesis on humans 'made in the image of God', as well as Paul and John), among the Fathers (in particular the oriental doctrine of 'divinization' and Augustine), during the Middle Ages (especially Thomas Aquinas) and the Reformation period (centered particularly on Luther and the Council of Trent), right up to modern times. The third part of the text, the central one, provides a systematic understanding of Christian grace in terms of the God's life present in human believers by which they become children of God, disciples, friends and brothers of Christ, temples of the Holy Spirit. This section also provides a reflection on the theological virtues (faith, hope and charity), on the relationship between grace and human freedom, on the role of the Church and Christian apostolate in the communication of grace, and on the need humans have for divine grace. After considering the relationship between the natural and the supernatural order, the fourth and last part deals with different philosophical aspects of the human condition, in the light of Christian faith: the union between body and soul, humans as free, historical, social, sexual and working beings. The last chapter concludes with a consideration of the human person, Christianity's greatest and most enduring contribution to human thought.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1j1nw0t">Seamus Heaney as Aesthetic Thinker</a><br>
  Abstract: In an ever-growing list of studies on the work of Seamus Heaney, this book will attempt something different. His poetry will not be the focus of analysis, except where it is relevant to the main theme, which is an outline of Heaney as an aesthetic thinker in the European intellectual tradition. This tradition, generally located in the sphere of Continental philosophy and cultural theory, sees the aesthetic as a valid epistemological mode of thinking. From Plato through Immanuel Kant and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel to contemporary philosophical and theoretical writers such as Martin Heidegger, Theodor Adorno, Jacques Lacan, Jacques Derrida,<br>

  Book Title: Placing Aesthetics-Reflections on the Philosophic Tradition<br>
  Publisher: Ohio University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wood Robert E.<br>
  Abstract: Examining select high points in the speculative tradition from Plato and Aristotle through the Middle Ages and German tradition to Dewey and Heidegger,
      Placing Aestheticsseeks to locate the aesthetic concern within the larger framework of each thinker's philosophy.In Professor Robert Wood's study, aesthetics is not peripheral but rather central to the speculative tradition and to human existence as such. In Dewey's terms, aesthetics is "experience in its integrity." Its personal ground is in "the heart," which is the dispositional ground formed by genetic, cultural , and personal historical factors by which we are spontaneously moved and, in turn, are inclined to move, both practically and theoretically, in certain directions.Prepared for use by the student as well as the philosopher,Placing Aestheticsaims to recover the fullness of humanness within a sense of the fullness of encompassing Being. It attempts to overcome the splitting of thought, even in philosophy, into exclusive specializations and the fracturing of life itself into theoretical, practical, and emotive dimensions.<br>

  I  INTRODUCTION: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1j7x66b">Placing Aesthetics</a><br>
  Abstract: There is surely sense to the notion that one ought to approach every study in terms of empirical acquaintance with the objects of the study. In fact, how else could one begin? Thus in approaching matters aesthetic, one should have firsthand acquaintance with art objects as well as with the beauties of nature and, if possible, with artistic practice. We are surely not exempt from that requirement. However, every study except philosophy begins with certain presuppositions which it is not the task of that study to analyze. Thus Euclidean geometry takes its point of departure from the possibility of beginning<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1j7x66b">Placing Aesthetics</a><br>
  Abstract: In my treatment of Plato, the first of the great philosophers to address matters aesthetic, I begin to flesh out more fully the framework considerations I have offered in the previous chapter by an interpretation that builds a whole world of meaning, encompassing every aspect of human existence. There is a sense in which one might say that Plato’s philosophy is essentially an aesthetic. Beauty plays a central role in his thought, though he has some harsh things to say about its appearance in art. However, in spite of the latter, his own works exhibit an artistry unmatched in the<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1j7x66b">Placing Aesthetics</a><br>
  Abstract: One might say that the founding experience of Friedrich Nietzsche’s philosophy is the experience of the death of God. It is announced, like Plato’s thought, in poetic form through the Parable of the Madman in
                  The Gay Science. Nietzsche describes a madman who lit a lantern in the morning hours and went in search of God, like Diogenes, who claimed that the light of day was not sufficient to reveal an honest man. The madman’s audience of unbelievers mocked him, asking whether God had gotten lost or emigrated. The madman proclaimed that God was dead and that he and they<br>

  Abstract: Outside of hegel and Schelling, there is no major philosopher who has devoted as much attention to the aesthetic or given it as central a role as John Dewey. This may come as a surprise to some. In their standard two-volume survey of American philosophy, Elizabeth Flower and Murray Murphey do not even mention Dewey’s
                     Art as Experience, in spite of their relatively extensive period-by-period, work-by-work survey of his publications.¹ And yet for Dewey the aesthetic furnishes the basic measure of everything human.<br>

  Abstract: From martin heidegger’s first major work,
                  Being and Time, his thought has focused on the notion of Being, but the method of his approach was phenomenology, the method characterizing my own introduction. Heidegger’s approach falls in the line of his teacher, Edmund Husserl, the founder of Phenomenology. Husserl understood Phenomenology to be comprehensive philosophy; it is at least permanent prolegomenon, acknowledged or not, to any philosophy. Phenomenology comes from two Greek terms,phainomenon, appearance, andlogos, essence. Phenomenology is a comprehensive descriptive inventory of all the essential ways in which appearance—that is, presence to consciousness—occurs: direct evidence in<br>

  Book Title: Prophetic Politics-Emmanuel Levinas and the Sanctification of Suffering<br>
  Publisher: Ohio University Press<br>
  Author(s): HAROLD PHILIP J.<br>
  Abstract: In
      Prophetic Politics,Philip J. Haroldoffers an original interpretation of the political dimension of Emmanuel Levinas's thought. Harold argues that Levinas's mature position inOtherwise Than Beingbreaks radically with the dialogical inclinations of his earlierTotality and Infinityand that transformation manifests itself most clearly in the peculiar nature of Levinas's relationship to politics.Levinas's philosophy is concerned not with the ethical per se, in either its applied or its transcendent forms, but with the source of ethics. Once this source is revealed to be an anarchic interruption of our efforts to think the ethical, Levinas's political claims cannot be read as straightforward ideological positions or principles for political action. They are instead to be understood "prophetically," a position that Harold finds comparable to the communitarian critique of liberalism offered by such writers as Alasdair MacIntyre and Charles Taylor. In developing this interpretation, which runs counter to formative influences from the phenomenological tradition, Harold traces Levinas's debt to phenomenological descriptions of such experiences as empathy and playfulness.Prophetic Politicswill highlight the relevance of the phenomenological tradition to contemporary ethical and political thought-a long-standing goal of the series-while also making a significant and original contribution to Levinas scholarship.<br>

  INTRODUCTION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1j7x78v">Prophetic Politics</a><br>
  Abstract: Emmanuel Levinas (1906–95) is a thinker who challenges the fundamental pretension of political philosophy to
                  evaluatepolitics. In Levinas’s mature thought, what is said to be “ethical” is a pre-theoretical and even pre-rational vulnerability or exposure to the “other.” As soon as we start to think about ethics, this otherness or alterity of the other, which is the source of ethics, dissipates. All theory, all philosophy, and all conscious thought is only spinning its wheels trying to reach what is properly ethical, of which it can only be a betrayal. Levinas generates a vocabulary for talking about what is<br>

  CHAPTER 1  DEATH, ESCAPE, AND THINKING BEYOND BEING from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1j7x78v">Prophetic Politics</a><br>
  Abstract: At the outset of his first original philosophical work,
                  On Escape, Levinas traces the path taken by modern philosophy. The modern approach begins with human freedom and the limitations the real imposes on that freedom—the “non-I” restricts the I, and the I “revolts” against this constraint. Subjectivity is understood as a substantial subject lying behind its accidental modifications: “The simplicity of the subject lies beyond the struggles that tear it apart.” These struggles are heroic attempts to overcome obstacles to fulfillment, understood as self-sufficiency. Being itself is thus conceived as sufficiency; and the subject enhances its being by becoming<br>

  CHAPTER 3  THE PHILOSOPHICAL ETHICS OF TOTALITY AND INFINITY from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1j7x78v">Prophetic Politics</a><br>
  Abstract: Throughout my interpretation of Levinas I have been opposing the interpretation that takes his thought to be a moral philosophy. Such a reading is ubiquitous in the literature. The I is a subject, under this view, enjoying itself selfishly until it meets another person, the “other” who breaks into my closed realm, decenters me, but also gives me a new (moral) identity deeper and more fulfilling than before. As Silvia Benso writes, “To renounce one’s own ontological power as an ego means to receive back the ethical power of the Me.”¹ Robert Gibbs puts it: “I become myself—I become<br>

  Abstract: Pacifism is a philosophy whose adherents reject violence, particularly war. The root meaning of the word comes from the Latin
                     pax(peace) andfacere(to make); i.e., to make peace. Pacifism is found from ancient times to the present, among both secular and religious persons, in simple societies as well as in advanced technological states. Pacifism is not to be confused with passivity. Making peace is active—adherents are committed to building a peaceful world.<br>

  Abstract: “Secularism” is a philosophy that holds that the affairs and organization of society should be arranged according to principles and rules derived from experience and human insight without reference to customs, revelations, or sacred books whose authority is derived from God or the gods or ancestors. It is distinct from the process of “secularization” whereby the state, professions such as medicine and law, and academic fields such as archeology gradually take over areas of human life once governed by religion and the church. Both words derive from the Latin word

  Abstract: In Ireland, especially in the post-Celtic Tiger era, we are witnessing a radical move toward a new historicity and a new feminism. It is almost as if we were given the chance to record time on a new scale and thereby, still resisting patriarchal and capitalistic systems, begin history again, starting from zero. As Alice A.

  Abstract: Romanticism is not necessarily hostile to science and technology. In chapter 2 I mentioned Novalis’s ideas about “magic science”—the view that Romantic philosophy aspired to a synthesis rather than a rejection of science and technology—and of course Gothic literature such as Mary Shelley’s, which was informed by and commented on science and technology and should not be reduced to a simple rejection of technology. In chapter 3 I also suggested that romanticism is not necessarily opposed to technology. In this chapter, I develop this line of thought and engage with histories of science to show how Romanticism is<br>

  Book Title: The Event of Literature-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): EAGLETON TERRY<br>
  Abstract: In a highly unusual combination of critical theory and analytic philosophy, the author sees all literary work, from novels to poems, as a strategy to contain a reality that seeks to thwart that containment, and in doing so throws up new problems that the work tries to resolve. The "event" of literature, Eagleton argues, consists in this continual transformative encounter, unique and endlessly repeatable. Freewheeling through centuries of critical ideas, he sheds light on the place of literature in our culture, and in doing so reaffirms the value and validity of literary thought today.<br>

  Abstract: The theory of fiction is perhaps the most difficult aspect of the philosophy of literature, as well as the one that has attracted the most sustained scholarly attention. For some curious reason, commentary on the subject has produced not only some penetrating insights but also more than its fair share of embarrassing banalities. Gregory Currie, for example, informs us that ‘we say that an inference is reasonable when it has a relatively high degree of reasonableness, unreasonable when its degree of reasonableness is very low’.¹ Peter Lamarque impresses on us the fact that ‘fictional characters, like Mr. Allworthy or Miss<br>

  Book Title: Who Was Jacques Derrida?-An Intellectual Biography<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): MIKICS DAVID<br>
  Abstract: Who Was Jacques Derrida?is the first intellectual biography of Derrida, the first full-scale appraisal of his career, his influence, and his philosophical roots. It is also the first attempt to define his crucial importance as the ambassador of "theory," the phenomenon that has had a profound influence on academic life in the humanities. Mikics lucidly and sensitively describes for the general reader Derrida's deep connection to his Jewish roots. He succinctly defines his vision of philosophy as a discipline that resists psychology. While pointing out the flaws of that vision and Derrida's betrayal of his most adamantly expounded beliefs, Mikics ultimately concludes that "Derrida was neither so brilliantly right nor so badly wrong as his enthusiasts and critics, respectively, claimed."<br>

  Abstract: During his lifetime, Derrida elicited both intense celebration and intense scorn. Rather than judging him in the manner of his disapproving critics, or celebrating him like his followers, I aim to explain his career. Now that Derrida is gone, it is time for a more measured assessment of his worth. His thought was neither as world changing as his disciples claimed nor as dangerous (or absurd) as his critics suspected. It does, however, offer us a necessary lesson concerning the self-imposed limits of philosophy: the way that it tries to purify itself, and the hazards of such purity. Derrida’s work,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1npdbz">Who Was Jacques Derrida?</a><br>
  Abstract: Derrida’s thought cannot be understood apart from his life. From the beginning, he was an intellectual outsider, a rebel. His efforts to redefine the discipline of philosophy took place against the rigid institutional system of the École Normale Supérieure. The young man from Algeria, a colonial backwater, confronted the powers that be in Paris, the vibrant center of advanced thought. Throughout his life, Derrida retained his early sense of being excluded from the sophisticated hierarchy that told students what and how to think. Even when deconstruction became a dominant institutional force in America, Derrida still felt that he was a<br>

  Abstract: In the sixties Derrida became aware of the futility of playing the skeptic, as he had done in his early critique of Husserl. Instead of restricting his role to deflating metaphysics, which, as he saw it, assumed a universe governed by the commanding self-consciousness of a thinking subject (Derrida’s charge against Husserl), Derrida turned to Jewish tradition and, at different moments, to Nietzsche in order to stake a far wider claim for his philosophy. He wanted to unveil a new world—though this world’s contours remained unclear. He assumed a prophetic tone in his treatment of Lévinas and Jabès, suggesting<br>

  Abstract: In the 1990s, as he neared the close of his life and his academic career, Derrida again sought an arena outside philosophy: a wider and more consequential place than arguments about the coherence of metaphysical texts could provide. His chosen term, increasingly, was politics. And the accent of Derrida’s political writings was a prophetic one, full of commanding ethical import. He relied more than before on a Lévinasian view of our responsibility toward others. Derrida was no doubt reacting to his own role in the de Man and Heidegger scandals, when he failed to confront the political commitments of these<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1nph7v">Simplexity</a><br>
  Abstract: Animal and human gestures are used for action but also as signposts, symbols, and to indicate intention. They are neither simple nor complex. They are simplex because, in a very global and immediate way, they enable the brain to grasp a reality, an emotion, a thought, or a complex social relationship. Gesture is a fundamental mark of culture and art, which are always simplex expressions. Gesture is essential to them. Drawing, painting, music, mime, acting, sculpture, and dance are always expressed in gestures. For this reason, we must not be content with a physiology (or a philosophy) of action. We<br>

  Abstract: We have now become accustomed to say that earliest Christianity was a sect of Judaism. This is useful language: it helps us avoid some kinds of anachronism, and it may assist Christians to approach the painful history of Jewish-Christian relations with appropriate humility. Moreover, there is ancient support for this terminology. It was Josephus who depicted the “Jewish philosophy” as made up of three or four “sects” (αìρέσεις,

  Abstract: The suppression of some conceptual elements and forms of discourse already found in ancient Jewish circles is characteristic of the rather homogeneous type of rabbinic discourse. Though allowing divergences of opinion and, one may even claim, encouraging, preserving, and studying them for generations, the ancient rabbis nevertheless controlled the nature of the topics on which divergences are allowed. No allegorical or symbolic interpretations of the Bible, abundant as they were in Alexandrian Judaism (especially Philo), were given access to the exegetical methods characteristic of rabbinic literature. Alchemy, astrology, philosophy, and physical sciences remained at the margin of rabbinic discourse. A<br>

  Abstract: Since David Hume (1711–1776), philosophy, as well as common sense, has differentiated science from morality. Science establishes facts (“what is”), whereas morality decides “what should be,” but many admit that we cannot distinguish what should be from what is. I shall consider whether it is plausible to take an opposite, although perhaps rather surprising, approach and ask whether we can favor what should be from our knowledge about what is. In fact, such a question belongs to a long philosophical tradition, including Hume, Henri de Saint-Simon (1760–1825), Auguste Comte, Charles Darwin, and contemporary ethologists. My idea is to<br>

Among the first were the Milesians: Thales (ca. 624–548 bce), Anaximander (ca. 611–547 bce), and Anaximenes (ca. 570–500 bce). As Geoffrey Lloyd recounted in 1970, this was a time of important technological progress, the end of the Bronze Age and the beginning of the Iron Age. Classification developed from observation and rationalization. These early philosophers discovered nature and distinguished between natural and supernatural, and they then avoided the supernatural. Thales declared that gods were everywhere, but he left them there.<br>

Whereas we are faced with the massive collection of manuscripts in the Husserl Archives at Louvain and the continuing publication of selections from them in the Husserliana series, Fink listened to Husserl himself, spoke with him, thought with him.

Transcendental phenomenologybeganin the recognition that the world had to be taken explicitly precisely as an overwhelmingly comprehensive structure that remained yet to be thematized properly in philosophy. The most famous methodological “devices” in Husserl’s phenomenology, the epoché and phenomenological reduction, are precisely moves by which the questioning of the world is to begin authentically, against the unwitting and unquestioned acceptance<br>

(Rational economic policy, Arrow suggests, would take into account the interests of future citizens only to the extent that there is a present preference among living individuals to do so.)¹ A similar observation applies to Arrow’s famous Impossibility Theorem. It relies on an understanding of rationality that, while characteristic of modern economic thought and much analytic philosophy, is untenably compressed in its temporality—compressed into the present.<br>

  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): KELLEY DONALD R.<br>
  Abstract: This book, the third volume of Donald Kelley's monumental survey of Western historiography, covers the twentieth century, especially Europe. As in the first two volumes, the author discusses historical methods and ideas of all sorts to provide a detailed map of historical learning. Here he carries the survey forward to our own times, confronting directly the challenges of postmodernism and historical narrative. Kelley offers highly original discussions of historians of the last half century (including friends and mentors), the "linguistic turn," the "end of history," the philosophy of history, and various new methods of histories.The book focuses first on the state of the art of history in France, Germany, Britain, and the United States on the eve of World War I. Kelley then traces every important historiographical issue and development historians have encountered in the twentieth century. With the completion of this trilogy, Kelley presents the only comprehensive modern survey of historical writing. He provides an unparalleled portrait of the rich variety of historical method along with an insider's view of the challenges of capturing history on the written page.<br>

  Book Title: Engaging the Moving Image-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Carroll Noël<br>
  Abstract: Noël Carroll, a brilliant and provocative philosopher of film, has gathered in this book eighteen of his most recent essays on cinema and television-what Carroll calls "moving images." The essays discuss topics in philosophy, film theory, and film criticism.Drawing on concepts from cognitive psychology and analytic philosophy, Carroll examines a wide range of fascinating topics. These include film attention, the emotional address of the moving image, film and racism, the nature and epistemology of documentary film, the moral status of television, the concept of film style, the foundations of film evaluation, the film theory of Siegfried Kracauer, the ideology of the professional western, and films by Sergei Eisenstein and Yvonne Rainer. Carroll also assesses the state of contemporary film theory and speculates on its prospects. The book continues many of the themes of Carroll's earlier work
      Theorizing the Moving Imageand develops them in new directions. A general introduction by George Wilson situates Carroll's essays in relation to his view of moving-image studies.<br>

Potentially enhancing his grim reputation is the fact that Carroll introduced the philosophy of horror as a systematic topic in contemporary aesthetics. Anyone who knows Carroll personally, however, will have trouble sustaining an image of him derived from Dr. Mabuse or the Creeper or some other monster of mayhem and subversion.

  Abstract: Perhaps no area of film theory invokes philosophy so quickly as does the discussion of nonfiction film. For inasmuch as a great many non-fiction films are meant to convey information about the world, film theorists are almost immediately disposed to reach for their favorite epistemological convictions in order to assess, and—nearly as often—to dispute the knowledge claims of nonfiction films.¹<br>

  Abstract: Gregory Currie’s

Covering such topics as the essence of cinema, the nature of representation in film, the relation of film to language, the nature of the spectator’s imaginative involvement in film, and problems of film narration and interpretation, the book addresses a gamut of classical questions of film theory and answers them, often in surprising ways, from a perspective richly informed by Currie’s impressive grasp of the philosophy of mind and<br>

  Abstract: Husserl seizes the opportunity of his inauguration as professor to present his philosophy—transcendental phenomenology, its method and its field of research—to the audience, his colleagues in Freiburg, who are not familiar with his newly developed mode of thinking.¹ Beginning with a quick reference to the revolutionary changes that have been taking place in the spiritual life of humankind, the dissolution of norms that previously were regarded as unchangeable, Husserl brings them all under the concept of “dissatisfied reason” (“die unbefriedigte Vernunft”). Even philosophy exhibits such a change. The well-established styles of doing philosophy were in flux. It is<br>

  12  Transcendental Logic II from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1npzng">Edmund Husserl's Freiburg Years</a><br>
  Abstract: In the year 1929, Husserl—in a hurried frenzy of writing—finished his
                  Formale und transzendentale Logik, which may be regarded as his second great systematic work after theIdeas(I deal with it in the next chapter). After finishing this work, Husserl was concerned about writing a more readable introduction to his philosophy of logic, becauseFormale und transzendentale Logikmoved on a much higher plane and was a relatively difficult work. He therefore asked his then assistant Ludwig Landgrebe to collect his manuscripts and lectures on transcendental logic. In 1919–20, Husserl had given a lecture course entitled<br>

In such cases, it is my claim that the otherness of others is constitutive of his philosophy.

  Book Title: Whose Freud?-The Place of Psychoanalysis in Contemporary Culture<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Woloch Alex<br>
  Abstract: One hundred years after the publication of
      The Interpretation of Dreams,Freud remains the most frequently cited author of our culture-and one of the most controversial. To some he is the presiding genius of modernity, to others the author of its symptomatic illnesses. The current position of psychoanalysis is very much at issue. Is it still valid as a theory of the mind? Have its therapeutic applications been rendered obsolete by drugs? Why does it still figure in debates about sexual identity, despite its rejection by many feminists? How does it contribute to cultural analysis?This book offers a new assessment of the status of psychoanalysis as a discipline and a discourse in contemporary culture. It brings together an exceptional group of theorists and practitioners, such partisans and critics of Freud as Frederic Crews, Judith Butler, Leo Bersani, Juliet Mitchell, Robert Jay Lifton, Richard Wollheim, Jonathan Lear, and others.These contributors, who are active in literature, philosophy, film, history, cultural studies, neuroscience, psychotherapy, and other disciplines, debate how psychoanalysis has enriched-and been enriched by-these fields.<br>

  Abstract: Roughly speaking, there are two ways to approach the concept of truth in psychoanalysis, “from the outside” and “from the inside.” In working “from the outside,” we bring a conception of truth, developed, say, in philosophy, to psychoanalysis as an object of study. Truth, then, is deployed as a
                  metatheoretical concept or predicate, applied to the assertions of psychoanalysis, and allowing us to see the conditions under which those assertions are true. By contrast, when we are working “from the inside,” we are concerned with how the issue of truth ariseswithinthe analytic situation. There is value in<br>

  Book Title: Becoming Human Again-The Theological Life of Gustaf Wingren<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Olson Daniel M.<br>
  Abstract: One of the most influential Swedish theologians of the twentieth century, Gustaf Wingren’s career spanned more than forty years of upheaval both in his field and around the globe. Provocative and challenging, Wingren revelled in a good argument and this attitude set the tone for much of his scholarship. A Swedish Lutheran, he made his name through his research into the theology of Martin Luther, breaking away from both traditional interpretations of Luther and the theology of his famous teachers, Karl Barth and Anders Nygren, before shifting his focus onto systematic theology. In a fresh take, Bengt Kristensson Uggla delves into the influence of Wingren’s second wife, Greta Hofsten, on the direction of his theology. Hofsten, a left-wing political activist who was searching for a new language of faith, wove Wingren’s work together with her own political philosophy to create an unusual kind of Christian socialism. Her thinking had a profound effect on Wingren, causing him to recontextualise his older work entirely. In Becoming Human Again, Uggla examines how Wingren’s combative nature often served him well as a theologian, driving him to engage with innovations in the field and re-examine his older views.<br>

Nonetheless, the May events had a profound effect on Foucault’s intellectual and political trajectory. Foucault himself acknowledged as much, observing that May was the unanticipated “political opening” that gave him the courage to investigate the mechanisms of power operating in Western societies and to “pursue [his] research in the direction of penal theory, prisons, and disciplines.”¹<br>

  Book Title: The Vision of the Soul-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): Wilson James Matthew<br>
  Abstract: Ours is an age full of desires but impoverished in its understanding of where those desires lead-an age that claims mastery over the world but also claims to find the world as a whole absurd or unintelligible. In
      The Vision of the Soul, James Matthew Wilson seeks to conserve the great insights of the western tradition by giving us a new account of them responsive to modern discontents. The western- or Christian Platonist-tradition, he argues, tells us that man is an intellectual animal, born to pursue the good, to know the true, and to contemplate all things in beauty. Wilson begins by reconceiving the intellectual conservatism born of Edmund Burke's jeremiad against the French Revolution as an eff­ort to preserve the West's vision of man and the cosmos as ordered by and to beauty. After defining the achievement of that vision and its tradition, Wilson off­ers an extended study of the nature of beauty and the role of the fine arts in shaping a culture but above all in opening the human intellect to the perception of the form of reality. Through close studies of Theodor W. Adorno and Jacques Maritain, he recovers the classical vision of beauty as a revelation of truth and being. Finally, he revisits the ancient distinction between reason and story-telling, between mythos and logos, in order to rejoin the two.Story-telling is foundational to the forms of the fine arts, but it is no less foundational to human reason. Human life in turn constitutes a specific kind of form-a story form. The ancient conception of human life as a pilgrimage to beauty itself is one that we can fully embrace only if we see the essential correlation between reason and story and the essential convertibility of truth, goodness and beauty in beauty. By turns a study in fundamental ontology, aesthetics, and political philosophy, Wilson's book invites its readers to a renewal of the West's intellectual tradition.<br>

We must ask, then, what is art itself and whence comes the truth it reveals? I shall discuss four ways of thinking about art that seem to command the attention of the skeptic who doubts its value as anything more than an empty gesture of liberal humanism.

Yet the conversation for constructive theology doesn’t end within the sphere of theology. Starting with its emphasis on philosophy, social sciences, and culture, constructive theology has been in conversation with other academic disciplines throughout its history. That is to say constructive theology is inherently interdisciplinary. In its effort to be an actionable, relevant form of theology, it has always, from the proto-constructive theologies of Ten Broeke and Meland, through the Workgroup’s textbooks and today, maintained the importance of incorporating insights from other disciplines into<br>

  Abstract: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has much in common with other forms of so-called traditional medicine, but it is also unique. It has its own theoretical system and terminology. It can also guide clinical practice effectively. The development of modern science and technology is the primary cause for the evolution from ancient Greco-Roman forms of traditional medicine to modern medicine. Most traditional medicine could not accommodate science and technology, and were largely overcome by it. Only TCM met this challenge, arming itself to prove its efficacy and the validity of its philosophy.¹ Over time, hundreds of modern doctors and professors who<br>

  Abstract: Medicine must wear a human face and make human judgments. Indeed, the question of how judgments are made is tacitly present throughout any work on philosophy of medicine in clinical medical education or, more recently, bioethics.

In this essay, I examine the role of various components of judging and the process by which judgments are made.<br>

Through research in art history, religious studies, philosophy, medical anthropology, and feminism, I first show how members of an international movement devoted to birth and art are actively using religious, secular, and re-sacralized art imagery in the visualization of labour and birth and as a ritualistic part of birth as a rite of passage.

  Abstract: This is a book about philosophy and criminology. There will be criminologists who question the need for closer engagement with philosophy and, likewise, philosophers who do not see a great deal of benefit from associating with criminology. My argument here is that philosophy is essential to criminology as philosophers have for centuries been asking questions concerning how we get on with one another – and what happens when we do not – that have direct bearing on criminological concerns. Philosophers might also gain from engagement with criminology and greater exposure to the messy and dirty ‘real world’. For some the subject of<br>

  Abstract: According to the British criminologist Anthony Bottoms (2002: 24), ‘if they are true to their calling, all criminologists have to be interested in morality’. Moral philosophy, or ethics, is concerned with how we live and how we ought to live with one another. It considers what is good or bad, as well as deontic judgements of rightness, wrongness, obligation, requirement, reason for doing and what
                  oughtto be. Such concerns should be central criminological concerns. Criminologists assert that crime – or harm or deviancy – is a social construction and ask what it is about such actions (or inactions) that makes them<br>

  Abstract: So far this book has considered philosophical ideas of values, morality, aesthetics, order and rules and how they relate to criminological concern. This chapter explores a positive way forward centred on the concept of respect. The meaning of ‘respect’ has been a concern for moral philosophy for some time (for example Darwall, 1977; Dworkin, 1977; Hill, 2000; Bagnoli, 2007; Carter, 2011).

  Abstract: In the previous chapter we outlined the various ways that terms like ‘agency’, ‘identity’ and ‘personhood’ have been understood within philosophy, and how such understandings have been applied particularly in response to the problems of mental infirmity in later life. We argued that the de-construction of the term ‘person’ into the separable issues of agency and identity may provide a more useful framework through which to interpret these problems than by approaches based on the more generic term ‘personhood’. Irrespective of their ‘powers’ to express agency and identity, the common humanity of people with infirmities can serve as the underlying<br>

Although care can be viewed through the lens of moral philosophy – as a moral duty that is realised through a set of practices embodying distinct virtues – care itself, we argued, can only ever be socially realised within particular forms of relationship. Questions such as who should receive and who should provide care, how and where care should be delivered, and what care means to those who are carers and to those who are cared for will elicit different answers at different<br>

In oracle bone and bronze inscriptions, it functions largely as an epithet for deceased ancestors and rulers and appears to mean something like “accomplished.”¹ In references to artifacts, it denotes stripes of the sort found on cowry shells or patterns woven into cloth.² It is the preferred pre-Qin word for “logograph.”³ In the writings of certain philosophers, most notably Xunzi, it becomes a more abstract sort of “pattern,” the<br>

  2.  Early Christian Approaches to Divine Simplicity from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1tm7gkh">Divine Simplicity</a><br>
  Abstract: The doctrine of divine simplicity has a long history involving complex accounts that interweave philosophy, scripture, and theology. Without a doubt, there is no single doctrine of divine simplicity that remained perfectly unaltered throughout the Christian tradition. Perhaps this is because, as Christopher Stead argues, throughout the early church various senses of divine simplicity were used to speak about God without ever clarifying which sense was in use. In other words, “we must not think that simplicity is itself a simple notion.”¹ However, the simplistic versions of divine simplicity represented in much contemporary theology—primarily from critics—might lead others<br>

  Author(s) Skinner Quentin<br>
  Abstract: Thomas Hobbes was much possessed by the phenomenon of laughter, and included an account of its causes and meaning in every version of his civil philosophy.¹ His analysis is in several ways distinctive, but my aim in what follows will be to show that he owed a substantial debt to the Italian humanist tradition of writing on

  JUSTICE AS FRATERNITY from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1tqx7xh">Civitas augescens. Includere e comparare nell'Europa di oggi</a><br>
  Author(s) Puyol Angel<br>
  Abstract: The French Revolution proclaimed an ethical and political ideal with its three principles that have not been improved on since: liberty, equality and fraternity. Since then, western political philosophy has put its greatest efforts into analysing the former two (liberty and equality), but has ignored, and even disdained, the third part of the revolutionary triad: fraternity. In my opinion, forgetting or underestimating fraternity as a political category is unjustifiable, given that so many injustices in our world are not only related to a lack of liberty and equality, but also to the scarcity, and sometimes inexistence, of fraternity.<br>

  Book Title: Antropologia-  Publisher: John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin, Faculty of Philosophy<br>
  Author(s): JANECZEK Ks. Stanisław<br>
  Abstract: Antropologia [Anthropology] is a gateway to the series of volumes devoted to particular disciplines of philosophy, taking into account their relationship with the Christian worldview and recognizing the need to include the philosophical and ideological diversity of contemporary culture. Antropologia covers Thomist tradition, enriching its achievements with other perspectives, especially Karol Wojtyla's personalism. Increasing influence of "third culture thinking", where the humanities are carried out in the context of the natural sciences, justifies the need to take up the difficult task of demonstrating complex problems of philosophical and natural anthropology. Anthropological considerations force us to realize the multifaceted nature of classical discussions on the nature of man, including theirs scientific and ideological facets, and to demonstrate them in a well-balanced manner. In this context, it enables readers to gain guidance in the debate on the philosophy of mind, providing ways of understanding and assessing the problem of the human soul (concerning the mind-body problem).<br>

  Abstract: Nietzsche's impact on the world of culture, philosophy, and the arts is uncontested, but his political thought remains mired in controversy. By placing Nietzsche back in his late-nineteenth-century German context,
         Nietzsche's Great Politicsmoves away from the disputes surrounding Nietzsche's appropriation by the Nazis and challenges the use of the philosopher in postmodern democratic thought. Rather than starting with contemporary democratic theory or continental philosophy, Hugo Drochon argues that Nietzsche's political ideas must first be understood in light of Bismarck's policies, in particular his "Great Politics," which transformed the international politics of the late nineteenth century.<br>

  INTRODUCTION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1wf4chc">Nietzsche's Great Politics</a><br>
  Abstract: Friedrich Nietzsche’s impact on the world of culture, philosophy, and the arts is uncontested, but his contribution to political thought remains mired in controversy. The source of that controversy resides in his political misappropriation by the Nazis during World War II, and we are still counting the cost of that appropriation for contemporary scholarship today. So the price that Walter Kaufmann—in his seminal
                  Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist, first published in 1950, now in its fourth edition—paid to rescue Nietzsche from the philosophical abyss he had fallen into after the war was to deny him any interest in politics.¹<br>

  CHAPTER 2  THE STATE from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1wf4chc">Nietzsche's Great Politics</a><br>
  Abstract: It has often been said that if Nietzsche expresses various views about the state, these do not amount to anything systematic enough to be considered a political theory. Leiter, a prominent commentator on Nietzsche, has written that the “interpretative question” concerning Nietzsche’s political philosophy is whether “scattered remarks and parenthetical outbursts add up to
                  systematicviews on questions of philosophical significance.” His own view is that Nietzsche “has no political philosophy, in the conventional sense of a theory of the state and its legitimacy.” If he “occasionally expresses views about political matters[,] … read in context, they do not add<br>

  1.  THE TROUBLE WITH LYING: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1wvwdtb">Rethinking Sincerity and Authenticity</a><br>
  Abstract: Immanuel Kant’s preoccupation with self-congruence reveals itself most famously—or infamously, depending on your point of view—in his absolute prohibition against lying. However, as this first chapter demonstrates, Kant mounts a passionate, repeated, and multidimensional endorsement of self-congruence that encompasses more than the conformity between what I think and what I say. Reading through Kant’s practical philosophy—from the early ethics lectures (1762) through
                  The Metaphysics of Morals(1797) and beyond—one finds Kant’s repeated affirmation of (1) truthfulness, (2) sincerity, (3) autonomy, and (4) character.¹ To clarify Kant’s views, the following discussion focuses on these specific forms of<br>

  Abstract: Like Immanuel Kant before him, Søren Kier kegaard exhibits modernity’s acute ambivalence toward self-congruence. Kierkegaard’s opposition to incongruence reveals itself in his career-long indictment of hypocrisy. Caught in the crosshairs of much of Kierkegaard’s work are the pretentious ambitions of Hegelian philosophy, whose practitioners claim to know more than they do,¹ and the insincere conformity of the Danish state church, whose members claim to believe more than they do.² Kierkegaard’s works (published and unpublished, pseudonymous and signed, philosophical and religious) exhort the reader to shun incongruence. Instead, they encourage the reader to be true to the actual, existing “single individual,”<br>

Or is this “just another label”—as many people (especially in Eastern Europe) have also come to think about the common label “left” (used by both social democrats and communists)? Is there in the United States a coherent “communitarian” school of political thought, moral philosophy and even of economic analysis?

  Abstract: In the 1930 preface to the English edition of
                  Ideas I, Husserl defines phenomenology as “the science of beginnings”—that is, as the resumption of the original idea of philosophy, found in Plato, as a “universal science.”¹ The idea of philosophy for Husserl is, and will be to the end, the idea of a rigorous science, as indicated by the title of the famous 1911 article “Philosophie als strenge Wissenschaft” (Philosophy as Rigorous Science).² As a “universal science” and a “rigorous science,” philosophy is radically distinct from every positive science and, as Husserl already said inThe Idea of Phenomenology<br>

Such is the very general question with which I would like to begin. As Husserl recalls at the very beginning of his lectures on the phenomenology of internal time-consciousness, the question of time and its contingency has always constituted the most crucial challenge for philosophy, marking the limits of its enterprise to intellectually possess the world because, as the very stuff of things, time seems to escape radically from<br>

  Abstract: The encounter with the Other has become a central issue in European philosophy of the last fifty years. This “issue” is, however, hardly more than a common name for a great variety of questions. Contemporary philosophical debates on rationalism versus relativism, universalism versus particularism, transculturalism versus multiculturalism, and so forth can be said to circle around the question of the Other as an emblematic figure representing difference, plurality, and strangeness.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xhr5td">The Face of the Other and the Trace of God</a><br>
  Author(s) Westphal Merold<br>
  Abstract: Levinas’s essay “God and Philosophy” is contemporaneous with
                  Otherwise Than Being or Beyond Essenceand develops theological implications of the argument left largely unthematized in what we might call themagnum opusof Levinas II.¹ Levinas sets the God of the Bible over against “the philosophical discourse of the West” and its interpretation of rationality; and he taunts “rational theology” for accepting “vassalage” to philosophy’s claim to be “the amplitude of an all-encompassing structure or of an ultimate comprehension” which “compels every other discourse to justify itself before philosophy” (GP153–54). We are reminded of Heidegger’s critique of onto-theology.<br>

  Abstract: Until recently the work of French philosopher and musician Vladimir Jankélévitch (1903–1985) has been scarcely acknowledged in the English-speaking world. Over the last few years, some of his texts have appeared in English translation, in part because of the growing recognition of the importance of his moral philosophy for figures such as Paul Ricoeur, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jacques Derrida.¹ It is little known, for example, that Emmanuel Levinas acknowledged Jankélévitch as a source of the notion of the “absolutely” or “wholly other” (

It is precisely what its name indicates-an epistemology oriented towards the genesis and development of knowledge. But as we have seen, it has a complex domain, including the growth of knowledge both in the individual person and in the history of science. As such, it is not merely an epistemology but also a philosophy of science.

  Book Title: Norms of Rhetorical Culture-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Farrell Thomas B.<br>
  Abstract: Rhetoric is widely regarded by both its detractors and advocates as a kind of antithesis to reason. In this book Thomas B. Farrell restores rhetoric as an art of practical reason and enlightened civic participation, grounding it in its classical tradition-particularly in the rhetoric of Aristotle. And, because prevailing modernist world views bear principal responsibility for the disparagement of rhetorical tradition, Farrell also offers a critique of the dominant currents of modern humanist thought.Farrell argues that rhetoric is not antithetical to reason but is a manner of posing and answering questions that is distinct from the approaches of analytic and dialectical reason. He develops this position in a number of ways: through a series of bold reinterpretations of Aristotle's
      Rhetoric; through a detailed appraisal of traditional rhetorical concepts as seen in modern texts from the Army-McCarthy hearings to Edward Kennedy's memorial for his brother, Mario Cuomo's address on abortion, Betty Friedan'sFeminine Mystique, and Vaclav Havel's inaugural address; and through a fresh appraisal of theories on the character of language and discourse found in contemporary philosophy, literary criticism, anthropology, deconstructionism, Marxism, and especially in Habermas's critical theory of communicative action.<br>

  Book Title: Return from Exile - Rückkehr aus dem Exil-Exiles, Returnees and Their Impact in the Humanities and Social Sciences in Austria and Central Europe<br>
  Publisher: Verlag der österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften<br>
  Author(s): PRISCHING MANFRED<br>
  Abstract: The tremendous loss to the humanities and social sciences in the 20th century resulting from the expulsion of thousands of scholars and artists from Austria and Central Europe has been well documented. The present collection of articles deals with a related but under-researched aspect – it combines analyses of the complex bureaucratic and the ideological obstacles which exiled scholars from a wide range of disciplines in the humanities and social sciences and creative artists faced when they were willing to return and specific essays documenting the varying opportunities for individual returnees to influence the development of their different disciplines after the end of the Nazi tyranny. The 27 essays highlight the roles of a number of returnees as generous mentors for younger scholars and their encouragement of modernization and internationalization in an atmosphere of stagnation and provincialism in the universities. Eminent experts in history, philosophy or political science who had returned were hampered by the denial of full academic appointments despite their highly stimulating initiatives, while theatre directors had a relatively strong impact on the programs in the theaters and the other media. The volume also illustrates personal factors, including the understandable hesitation of prominent intellectuals such as Oskar Morgenstern or Ernst Krenek to give up the advantages of US American citizenship for academic positions, especially in a country exposed to political threats in the Cold War; but the essays also bring out the fact that quite a few of the émigrés remained exiles on both sides of the Atlantic. A particular strength of the volume is the detailed consideration of the fortunes and the influence of the impressive array of exiled Austrian economists. Many of them returned from Britain, helping to shape economic theory and Austrian economic policy, even though necessarily mainly from outside the universities, while transatlantic exiles largely remained in the USA.<br>

  Abstract: Several years ago, Pantelis Kalaitzidis issued a clarion call to fellow Orthodox theologians to renew their dialogue with con temporary philosophy, lamenting that such an enterprise has in recent times been commonly held in disfavor in the Christian East—a perhaps unintended result, he suggests, of the twentieth-century “neo-patristic synthesis” promoted by the renowned Georges Florovsky (1893–1979).

  Abstract: Inspired by Ricoeur’s well-known aphorism “The symbol gives rise to thought,” this book has engaged the symbolic manifold of the Byzantine Rite, and specifically its Theophany “Great Blessing of Water,” by means of Ricoeur’s own hermeneutical philosophy. It has sought to make a contribution to Orthodox liturgical theology, inspired by the legacy of Schmemann, through whom I first discovered the power of a Weltanschauung grounded in the worship of the Church. While respecting Schmemann, I have sought to go “beyond” him by questioning, at various removes, what it means to “seek in the liturgy the vision implied in its own<br>

  Book Title: The Translator’s Doubts-Vladimir Nabokov and the Ambiguity of Translation<br>
  Publisher: Academic Studies Press<br>
  Author(s): TRUBIKHINA JULIA<br>
  Abstract: Using Vladimir Nabokov as its “case study," this volume approaches translation as a crucial avenue into literary history and theory, philosophy and interpretation. It attempts to bring together issues in translation and the shift in Nabokov studies from its earlier emphasis on the “metaliterary" to the more recent “metaphysical" approach. Addressing specific texts (both literary and cinematic), the book investigates Nabokov’s deeply ambivalent relationship to translation as a hermeneutic oscillation on his part between the relative stability of meaning, which expresses itself philosophically as a faith in the beyond, and deep metaphysical uncertainty. While Nabokov’s practice of translation changed profoundly over the course of his career, his adherence to the Romantic notion of a “true" but ultimately elusive metaphysical language remained paradoxically constant.<br>

  Abstract: This book singles out translation as a way of talking about literary history and theory, philosophy, and interpretation. Vladimir Nabokov is its case study. The advantage of making Nabokov a case study for an investigation of questions of translation is obvious. It is hard to separate Vladimir Nabokov from the act of translation, in all senses of the word—ranging from “moving across” geographical borders and cultural and linguistic boundaries to the transposing of the split between “here” and “there” and “then” and “now” (the essential elements of exile, components of every émigré experience) onto a metaphysical plane sometimes suggested<br>

  Book Title: Reasoning from Faith-Fundamental Theology in Merold Westphal’s Philosophy of Religion<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): SANDS JUSTIN<br>
  Abstract: Merold Westphal is considered to be one of the preeminent Continental philosophers of religion. His articulation of faith as the task of a lifetime has become a touchstone in contemporary debates concerning faith's relationship to reason. As Justin Sands explores his philosophy, he illuminates how Westphal's concept of faith reveals the pastoral, theological intent behind his thinking. Sands sees Westphal's philosophy as a powerful articulation of Protestant theology, but one that is in ecumenical dialogue with questions concerning apologetics and faith's relationship to ethics and responsibility, a more Catholic point of view. By bringing out these features in Westphal's philosophy, Sands intends to find core philosophical methodologies as well as a passable bridge for philosophers to cross over into theological discourses.<br>

  1.  OF HERMENEUTICS AND STYLE: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1zxxz58">Reasoning from Faith</a><br>
  Abstract: Beginning our investigation by understanding how Westphal thinks of and approaches philosophy and theology will inform us of his motivations and the subsequent implications of his writing. We start by investigating Westphal’s hermeneutics and his earlier writings to gain a particular ‘Westphalian’ perspective for things to come. What is important is to look at how he first receives his intellectual influences and carefully parses out their meaning before crafting his own original thinking. From here, one should see the foundations of Westphal’s own hermeneutics.<br>

  3.  WESTPHAL AND HEGEL: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1zxxz58">Reasoning from Faith</a><br>
  Abstract: Westphal’s reading of Hegel reveals the political nature of his own philosophy. Moreover, Westphal’s struggle with Hegel, as we shall see, can also be seen as a struggle with modernity and its resultant political, economic, and religious structures. With these thoughts in mind, Westphal’s second book on Hegel, entitled
                  Hegel, Freedom, and Modernity, is a prime source, as Westphal shapes the book to highlight these struggles, hoping to shed light upon the insights Hegel can give us and where he goes astray. This chapter explores Westphal’s journey with Hegel by focusing on Westphal’s political (and therefore religious) critique of Hegel.<br>

  4.  HEGELIANS IN HEAVEN, BUT ON EARTH . . .: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1zxxz58">Reasoning from Faith</a><br>
  Abstract: Westphal is attempting to craft a prophetic line of philosophy he finds sorely lacking, particularly with Hegel. This is also the case for Husserlian phenomenology, which he sees as replicating Hegel by being purely descriptive, never prescriptive.¹ At this point, it is clear that Westphal aims to push philosophy into the realm of action: to not just reasonably argue but to move those arguments toward helping the widow, orphan, and stranger. Westphal sees in Kierkegaard a possible way to adapt this preferential option for the poor into a postmodern framework; with Kierkegaard, Westphal finds a Christian response to a society<br>

  Abstract: Overcoming Onto-theologyfinds itself in two worlds: one that is suspicious of postmodern critique of religion and one whose appreciation of postmodern thought makes it suspicious of religion.¹ Speaking to both, Westphal situates the work as a primer for the Christian theist’s endeavor into postmodern philosophy. The book’s very first words set this trajectory:<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1zxxz58">Reasoning from Faith</a><br>
  Abstract: It is impossible to speak of Merold Westphal’s academic contributions without including the lengthy (and lifelong) debates he has held with John Caputo. Truly, the debates between Westphal and Caputo (also frequently involving Richard Kearney) have dominated Continental philosophy of religion in North America for quite some time, and stories of their witty jousting at conferences and symposia are familiar to many. One such account has been transcribed in
                  Modernity and Its Discontents, where Westphal and Caputo, along with James Marsh, hold a roundtable discussion exploring topics ranging from the issue of transcendence in postmodern thought to what counts as<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapter, we discussed Merold Westphal’s thought in light of his primary debate partner, John Caputo. As I argued, Westphal is almost always discussed alongside his friend Caputo as both represent different, opposing sides of various debates in Continental philosophy of religion in North America. On the one hand, Westphal argues for a ‘thick theology’—a hearty soup—that provides a theistic, religious appropriation of postmodern thought to nourish the believing soul. On the other hand, Caputo analyses theism through a radical critique of religion’s onto-theo-logico-centrism. Caputo’s postmodernism declares that religion must be rethought—even to the point<br>

  Book Title: In Praise of Heteronomy-Making Room for Revelation<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Westphal Merold<br>
  Abstract: Recognizing the essential heteronomy of postmodern philosophy of religion, Merold Westphal argues against the assumption that human reason is universal, neutral, and devoid of presupposition. Instead, Westphal contends that any philosophy is a matter of faith and the philosophical encounter with theology arises from the very act of thinking. Relying on the work of Spinoza, Kant, and Hegel, Westphal discovers that their theologies render them mutually incompatible and their claims to be the voice of autonomous and universal reason look dubious. Westphal grapples with this plural nature of human thought in the philosophy of religion and he forwards the idea that any appeal to the divine must rest on a historical and phenomenological analysis.<br>

  Abstract: Kant first develops his notion of autonomy in a
                  political senseas a plea for freedom to publish without censorship.¹ But in “What Is Enlightenment?” there are already overtones of a more far-reaching claim, and, as we have seen, Kant expands his concept of autonomy considerably in the context of hismoral philosophy. But the most extensive and systematic development of his theory of autonomy occurs in hisphilosophy of religion, most particularly inReligion Within the Boundaries of Mere Reason or Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone.² This title, however rendered, signifies far more than a book published<br>

  Abstract: The messianic tone of deconstruction was not at all evident at the start. Instead, in the midst of what looked more like a certain Nietzschean tone recently adopted in French philosophy in the 1960s, Derrida was visited with a suggestive “objection” that occasioned his first encounter with theology. “[V]ery early on,” he says, “I was accused of—rather than being congratulated for—resifting the procedures of negative theology” (

He is a Jew who is “rightly described as an atheist,” of an “assimilated” family, raised in an Arab country, whose native language, culture, and education are thoroughly French—“Christian Latin French” (

  Abstract: In the introduction to his habilitation dissertation at Freiburg,
                  The Doctrine of Categories and of Meaning in Duns Scotus(1916), the young Martin Heidegger praised the “objective” orientation of medieval philosophy: “Scholastic psychology, precisely inasmuch as it is not focused upon the dynamic and flowing reality of the psychical remains in its fundamental problems oriented toward the objective and noematic, a circumstance which greatly favors setting one’s sight on the phenomenon of intentionality” (DS, 15).¹ While modern philosophy is characterized by a keen sense of subjective experience, the Scholastic thinker is concerned primarily with the object of knowledge, with “being.”<br>

  Abstract: Derrida’s work is often mistakenly criticized as a kind of linguistic subjective idealism which traps us inside a chain of linguistic signifiers, unable to do anything but play vainly with linguistic strings. In fact, Derrida’s thought is through and through a philosophy of “alterity,” of openness to the other, which provides a rich and vigorous catalyst for religious thought. After demonstrating the wrongheadedness of the subjectivist reading of Derrida, I go on to show the richness of this philosophy of alterity for theology: first, in terms of the negative theology, where alterity refers to God as the absolutely Other; and<br>

                  Existence and Freedom, published some forty years ago, undertook one of the first important confrontations of Heidegger and Kierkegaard in English. 1 Schrag understood that a great deal of Continental philosophy originated in the decision made by Kierkegaard to expose philosophy to biblical categories, on the premise that if the categories of Greek philosophy are all we have, then the poor existing individual is lost.

  Abstract: What is intuition? Both philosophical and psychological understandings of the idea of intuition may have left feminist philosophy with more questions than answers. Is intuition a sixth sense? Is it cognitive or sensory or something else? Michèle Le Doeuff has pointed out that intuition, in classical philosophical language, designates a mode of immediate apprehension, a direct

  Abstract: My work, whether it is grounded in Nietzsche, Sartre, Beauvoir, or others, is informed by a desire to understand the human being’s presence in the world and seek to establish grounds for an ethics of flourishing. However, an ethical theory can be successful only if it is grounded in an adequate theory of subjectivity. Like many other feminist critics, I fail to be convinced by traditional rationalistic philosophy that paints a portrait of the relation between individual and world as straightforward and easily conceived. Instead I draw on the work of existentialists and phenomenologists, as well as structuralists and post-structuralists,<br>

  Book Title: Self-Understanding and Lifeworld-Basic Traits of a Phenomenological Hermeneutics<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): RAYMAN JOSHUA<br>
  Abstract: What are the foundations of human self-understanding and the value of responsible philosophical questioning? Focusing on Heidegger's early work on facticity, historicity, and the phenomenological hermeneutics of factical-historical life, Hans-Helmuth Gander develops an idea of understanding that reflects our connection with the world and other, and thus invites deep consideration of phenomenology, hermeneutics, and deconstruction. He draws usefully on Husserl's phenomenology and provides grounds for exchange with Descartes, Dilthey, Nietzsche, Gadamer, Ricoeur, and Foucault. On the way to developing a contemporary hermeneutical philosophy, Gander clarifies the human relation to self in and through conversation with Heidegger's early hermeneutics. Questions about reading and writing then follow as these are the very actions that structure human self-understanding and world understanding.<br>

They all found themselves challenged in their thinking by the questions of their time to a type of critical contemporaneity, which sought to posit a diagnosis of their respective historical situations with the means of philosophy.

This question is all the more urgent insofar as the critical objections that have arisen in the course of the discussion of Husserl’s last great transcendental meditation are taken as valid.

For another, beyond the fact of placing the starting point in life, the central question of his early work illuminates at the same time how “factical life-experience belongs in a wholly originary sense to the problematic of philosophy,”¹ in that<br>

Gasché's readings address the distinctively human space of the public square and the actions that occur there, and his valorization of persuasion, reflection, and judgment reveals new insight into how the philosophical tradition distinguishes thinking from other faculties of the human mind.<br>

Central to this debate is the Kantian distinction between determinant (i.e., cognitive) judgment and reflective (i.e., aesthetic or teleological) judgment.

By interpreting the significance of disparate events and integrating them into a coherent account, the disciplinary approaches of history typically assume a formal conception of time, in which a linear chronology can be represented by consciousness. In other words, past events are treated as intentional objects. This synchronization of time entails generalizing from people’s experiences, selectively emphasizing certain elements<br>

He interprets it as “the primary attitude of a soul faced with the whole of the real and its own destiny” (PH 13). Certainly Hitlerism was or is a form of ideology, but why should Levinas grace it with the name of what has systematically opposed dogmatism? Yet Levinas insists that the “awakening<br>

  Author(s): Tatman Lucy<br>
  Abstract: Part religious studies, part feminist theory, part philosophy, part indescribable: such is Numinous Subjects. Described by the author as 'a kaleidoscopic exploration of why three gendered figures of the sacred matter within western culture,' the experience of reading this text truly is akin to gazing through a constantly turning kaleidoscope. Images, concepts, phrases and quotes are continually revisited, recombined, though never repeated in quite the same way. From these tumbling constellations arises a new understanding and wary appreciation of the figures of the virgin, the mother, and the whore. Drawing on the insights of thinkers as diverse as Rudolph Otto, Julia Kristeva, Simone de Beauvoir, and Martin Buber, Numinous Subjects simultaneously expands and focuses our attention on the myth of the sacred and its implications for female subjects in western culture today.<br>

  Book Title: Desi Divas-Political Activism in South Asian American Cultural Performances<br>
  Publisher: University Press of Mississippi<br>
  Author(s): Garlough Christine L.<br>
  Abstract: Desi Divas: Activism in South Asian American Cultural Performancesis the product of five years of field research with progressive activists associated with the School for Indian Languages and Cultures (SILC), South Asian Americans Leading Together (SAALT), the feminist dance collective Post Natyam, and the grassroots feminist political organization South Asian Sisters. Christine L. Garlough explores how traditional cultural forms may be critically appropriated by marginalized groups and used as rhetorical tools to promote deliberation and debate, spur understanding and connection, broaden political engagement, and advance particular social identities. Within this framework she examines how these performance activists advocate a political commitment to both justice and care, to both deliberative discussion and deeper understanding. To consider how this might happen in diasporic performance contexts, Garlough weaves together two lines of thinking. One grows from feminist theory and draws upon a core literature concerning the ethics of care. The other comes from rhetoric, philosophy, and political science literature on recognition and acknowledgment. This dual approach is used to reflect upon South Asian American women's performances that address pressing social problems related to gender inequality, immigration rights, ethnic stereotyping, hate crimes, and religious violence.<br>

  II  Does Postmodernism Have a Substance? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284vhr">Postmodernism and Cultural Identities</a><br>
  Abstract: Let us step closer to the crucial questions of the present book. We just asked ourselves whether the decades that are now most often called “postmodernist” fit into any of the patterns of the philosophy of culture as understood until now or whether they signal a wide chasm between the “age of history” and the present or the future. We also asked ourselves whether an entirely new mode of understanding the philosophy of culture has to be forged, one that should be adapted to the new events of our contemporary time.<br>

  I  Toward a Definition from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284x5t">The Humanities in the Age of Technology</a><br>
  Abstract: To describe the awareness of the crisis of the humanities already expressed by Plato, I have quoted Callicles’ statements on philosophy. But humanities and philosophy are not synonymous terms; we rather associate the humanities with “Letters,” which until the nineteenth century, when the vernacular languages and literatures were introduced as disciplines at the universities, meant basically Latin and Greek philology. The ambiguity increases when we confront the natural sciences<br>

  VI  Reading from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284x5t">The Humanities in the Age of Technology</a><br>
  Abstract: The questions on the criteria of rigor in the humanities can be grouped around three words: reading, understanding, and knowing, and those that refer to their practical import, around two: usefulness and value. In the analysis of reading we shall take literary texts as examples, because the literary text is more complex than those in linguistics, history, philosophy, or theology. Reading Calderón’s 
                  La vida es sueño (Life is a Dream) we discover nuances of the phenomenon of reading that would not shine through in reading Ortega y Gasset’s essay The Dehumanization of Art. On the other hand, the conclusions about<br>

  Abstract: Heidegger’s statement about philosophy can be extrapolated to the humanities in general. In order to show how humanistic discourse can be intellectually rigorous I have analyzed Calderón’s 
                  Life is a Dream and in a less direct and comprehensive way Don Quijote. In the preceding chapter I have pointed out several things we can do with the humanities, but what we do with them must be founded on their objective value, that is, on what they can do with us. And what they can do, when cultivated as “rigorous knowledge” (Husserl’s idea as alpha and omega) is enlighten us about the<br>

  2  Resilience Input for a Virtue-Based Philosophical Anthropology from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284x9r">Resilience and the virtue of fortitude</a><br>
  Abstract: In this chapter, I investigate further the research on protective and risk processes.¹ I interpret the insights within a classic anthropological schema (temperament and emotion, cognitional and volitional processes, and familial and social contexts).² At the same time, I employ an overlapping division that differentiates natural characteristics from religious and spiritual ones. This meta-analysis of the resilience findings inductively identifies resources that make some difference in resilience outcomes. It offers elements for a renewed philosophy of nature and philosophical anthropology.<br>

  FOREWORD from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284zh3">Person, Being, and History</a><br>
  Abstract: At the University of Toronto, where he is professor emeritus, Kenneth Schmitz was known as “the Educator.” Earlier in his career, students followed him from Loyola Marymount University to Marquette University when Marquette began its doctoral program in philosophy. His teaching itinerary moved through Indiana University to the Catholic University of America, and finally back to his native Canada at the University of Toronto. Even at his advanced age, he still teaches in Washington, D.C., where students from the John Paul II Institute and the School of Philosophy at Catholic University continue to be drawn more deeply into philosophy through<br>

  1.  THE PHILOSOPHY OF KENNETH L. SCHMITZ: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284zh3">Person, Being, and History</a><br>
  Author(s) Kow James<br>
  Abstract: Why take up philosophy? Kenneth L. Schmitz recalls that, while returning from leave in wartime England and browsing in a bookstall, he was astonished to find a book entitled 
                     Does the World Exist? In his words: “Recall the times. That world, too much with us.... What a fantastic mind that could raise such a question! I bought the book and philosophy had trapped a new victim.”¹ A gracious victim, entrapped maybe, but a unique person, who has liberated many of his students and colleagues with his breadth of spirit and mind since then.<br>

  Author(s) Crooks James<br>
  Abstract: In the realm of abstract speculation that seems now to encompass all the discursive spaces of the academy—from the university senate to the faculty/student barbecue—one tends to imagine the future of philosophy either as a response to economic, technological, and ideological forces external to it or as the steadfast resistance of those forces.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284zh3">Person, Being, and History</a><br>
  Author(s) Russon John<br>
  Abstract: When I undertook graduate studies in the 1980s, the University of Toronto was internationally recognized as a center for study in the history of philosophy. The presence of Kenneth L. Schmitz in the department made it especially strong as a center for the study of Hegel’s philosophy, and I had the great privilege and pleasure of attending many courses that he taught on Hegel, Kant, and German idealism. The jewel in this crown was his graduate seminar on Hegel’s 
                  Science of Logic, in which I was able to participate in three different years. Hegel’s Science of Logic is much maligned,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284zh3">Person, Being, and History</a><br>
  Author(s) Lampert Jay<br>
  Abstract: Some modern and postmodern philosophers favor violence as a means of outflanking authoritarian forms of peace and philosophy, and find promising concepts of violence in the great philosophers, above all in Hegel. This motivation is not altogether incorrect, but perhaps there are other ways besides violence to slip out of classical constraints. Kenneth Schmitz’s philosophy of freedom is, among other things, a move away from modern violence philosophies. Yet with all his classical philosophical commitments, Schmitz is as modern a philosopher as there is, particularly regarding the modern proof of unconditioned freedom. For these reasons, his work is not only<br>

  13.  SCHELER ON THE ESSENCE OF CHRISTIAN RELIGIOUS CONSCIOUSNESS from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284zh3">Person, Being, and History</a><br>
  Author(s) Dahlstrom Daniel O.<br>
  Abstract: One of Kenneth Schmitz’s major and undoubtedly lasting accomplishments is his demonstration of the distinctive contribution made by Karol Wojtyla to philosophy. In Schmitz’s masterful expositions, Wojtyla’s philosophical project comes alive as an effort to understand action phenomenologically and realistically, as something that proceeds from and reveals, not consciousness, but the whole person “as a being among other beings.”¹ In this connection, among other things, Schmitz corrects a common misunderstanding of the extent of Wojtyla’s philosophical debt to Scheler’s thought. To be sure, Wojtyla plainly acknowledges the importance to him of both Scheler’s critique of Kant’s ethics and its basis<br>

  Author(s) Anderson Thomas C.<br>
  Abstract: I imagine that Ken Schmitz was responsible for a number of his students pursuing the exalted vocation of philosopher. That was certainly true in my case. I was an engineering student when I took my first philosophy course from him, and it was the beginning of my life-long pursuit of wisdom and my affection for Dr. Schmitz.<br>

  Author(s) Busch Thomas W.<br>
  Abstract: Early in the 1960s, I had completed my first year of graduate study. While I found my professors to be good people, I was discouraged because none of the courses I had taken had gripped me to the point of personal involvement. I was beginning to wonder whether I had made a wise career choice. Then this blast of fresh air from Canada arrived on the scene and abruptly reassured me. Professor Kenneth Schmitz introduced me to Kierkegaard, Jaspers, Heidegger, Marcel, and Sartre. I just had to go on in philosophy. What a role model this man was: brilliant, scholarly,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284zh3">Person, Being, and History</a><br>
  Author(s) Wood Robert E.<br>
  Abstract: Kenneth Schmitz is my teacher. His courses on existentialism, on modern philosophy, and on Hegel and Nietzsche had a decisive impact on my own subsequent approach to philosophy. Existentialism and its background in phenomenology, as well as both Nietzsche and Hegel, continue to be focal points in my own studies. His interest in Paul Weiss led me to Weiss’s systematic approach to philosophy; his interest in the aesthetics of Hans Urs von Balthasar led me to a comprehensive review of

  7.  Gregory Nazianzen and Philosophy, with Remarks on Gregory’s Cynicism from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284zwd">Re-Reading Gregory of Nazianzus</a><br>
  Author(s) CHIODO CAROL<br>
  Abstract: It is well known that for the Cappadocian fathers—and especially for Gregory of Nazianzen—the term “philosophy” signifies “the Christian life” or “the contemplation of Christian truth.”¹ When referring to the contemplation of Christian truth, 
                     philosophein and theologein are almost equivalent in Gregory’s works, though philosophein occurs with greater frequency. Yet, in addition to these basic senses, philosophein carries a controversial meaning, as well. This polemical sense reflects Gregory’s sophistic art and his refined use of logoi: “[the doctor] discoursing learnedly on your disease after you are dead,” as he puts it in one of his orations.²<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt28508k">Spirit's Gift</a><br>
  Abstract: No question is foreign to metaphysics, Bruaire contends, because metaphysics deals with that most important issue which is presupposed in all the other disciplines.¹ Philosophy addresses the decisive, eternal question: “what is being?”² Yet, according to Bruaire, to ask about “that which is” is to pose the question concerning the nature of the principle that sustains whatever exists, namely, the absolute, which in theological terms is called God.³ This is philosophy’s inevitable prejudice: every philosophy has as its object the absolute, as Schelling stated.⁴ Bruaire considers that the question of the absolute is the question that must be confronted, because<br>

  Abstract: The face of armed conflict changes every week and every day, but the underlying moral questions remain, remarkably, much the same. Taking this continuity as our point of departure, we focus in the present volume on some basic issues in ethics and philosophy that are related to the use of armed force as these were developed by thinkers in late antiquity and the Middle Ages. We do not remain in centuries-old history, however. Moving ahead from the historical and philosophical background, we also introduce several pressing issues of our own day.<br>

  CHAPTER SIX  The Modesty of the Critical Philosophy from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2851gx">Necessity and Possibility</a><br>
  Abstract: It is not uncommon in introductory philosophy courses to receive a picture of Kant that paints him as a paradigmatic old-fashioned, detached Prussian scholar, whose walks were so predictable that the residents of Königsberg could set their clocks by them, and whose life passed as the most regular of regular verbs. Such an image is reinforced by the overwhelming attention to what might be called the “positive” dimension of Kant’s philosophy, for example, the Transcendental Analytic. There we find obscure arguments couched in arcane, inscrutable terminology, as well as intricate, elaborate proofs of synthetic a priori concepts and principles. All<br>

  Author(s) Hibbs Thomas S.<br>
  Abstract: Perhaps no alteration in the landscape of Anglo-American philosophy in the last thirty years has been more surprising, more sustained, and more fruitful than the resurgence of interest in the ethics of virtue. Most discussions of the history of twentieth-century moral philosophy trace the return of virtue to Elizabeth Anscombe’s essay from the late 1950s, “Modern moral philosophy.”¹ A jeremiad against Kantian and utilitarian ethical theories, Anscombe’s essay urged that, given the present state of philosophical ethics—with its incoherent conceptions of obligation, its lack both of terminological clarity and of an adequate philosophical psychology—we should banish ethics totally<br>

  Abstract: At the time of his first 
                  doctor honoris causa, conferred by the theology faculty of the University of Munich in 1964, Josef Pieper strongly objected to the “error invicibilis” of those who recognized him as a theologian under the pretext that he considered pre-philosophical data in his philosophical act. Declaring his intention to “attack a notion of philosophy which rejects the grandeur of its own origin,”¹ he proposed a rediscovery of the concept of philosophy as presented by the Western tradition. His reflection in the aftermath of the Second World War is radically opposed to Barthian thought, for which the<br>

  CHAPTER 3  The Methodology from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2853bw">Destined for Liberty</a><br>
  Abstract: As we have seen, Wojtyła’s early writings indicate that he was conversant with the history of European philosophy. He knew Plato and Aristotle, was familiar with the Christian philosophy of St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas, and moved knowledgeably among such modern thinkers as David Hume, Jeremy Bentham, Immanuel Kant, and Max Scheler. However, Wojtyła’s early work also proves that he reached beyond mere historical exegesis. The young thinker showed an impressive ability to integrate into his own work the thought of other philosophers. For example, in 
                  Lublin Lectures, Wojtyła borrowed from the twentieth-century psychology of the will, Aquinas’s metaphysics,<br>

  CHAPTER 6  Conclusions from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2853bw">Destined for Liberty</a><br>
  Abstract: The subject of this book, the human person as the efficient cause of his own action, locates the very center of Wojtyła’s philosophy. One reason for this is the intrinsic unity and constant interrelation of anthropology and ethics in the thought of Wojtyła. In his anthropological publications, he always analyzes the ethical implications of the anthropological theses. Correspondingly, when he writes about ethics, he is always interested in the question: “What concept of man underlies a particular ethical theory?” I have been able, therefore, to explore the fundamental themes of Wojtyła’s anthropology and ethics while at the same time safeguarding<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2853gt">The Early Heidegger and Medieval Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: Heidegger began his career at Freiburg University in 1915 as an interpreter of the Catholic Middle Ages and as, to all appearances, a devout Roman Catholic: former seminarian and son of the sexton in Meßkirch. As his views on facticity and historicity developed, he became increasingly critical of “the system of Catholicism.” He came to believe that Catholicism inured itself from life through an architectonic of Scholastic concepts, a “pseudo-philosophy” with “police power” (GA60 313). Scholasticism (not identical to Catholicism in Heidegger’s mind but nonetheless inseparable from it) distorted Aristotle and compounded the forgetfulness of being already underway in antiquity<br>

It is the moving energy of thought at the center of much that has been called “postmodern.” Its birthplace is Paris, but it has reached North America’s universities through philosophy, linguistics, literary studies, sociology, political theory, and religious studies, and its influence among young teachers and scholars is already wide and diffuse. Its background was prepared by the hermeneutic work of German philosophers such as Heidegger, and by the work in linguistics and language by such thinkers as de Saussure and Wittgenstein.

  Abstract: Gabriel Marcel gave his phenomenological inquiries the name “Philosophy of the Concrete,”¹ and he made no bones about the distance between his philosophy and that of Thomism.² Between these philosophies there can be no question of an 
                  approchement of tone, nor even of manner, but at most a convergence of truths shared differently. Moreover, there can be no doubt that the two philosophies differ in their relation to experience.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2853wm">The Texture of Being</a><br>
  Abstract: There have been human persons since Adam delved and Eve span. And the word 
                  persona, prosopon—thickened and deepened by the revelation of the God-man Jesus Christ—has been with us since the great Councils of the Church. Is it not surprising, then, that we have had to wait until the twentieth century to hear of philosophies that bear the name “personalism”? Emmanuel Mounier suggests that the neo-Kantian idealist Charles-Bernard Renouvier first used the term to describe his own philosophy in 1903,¹ before it was rescued from idealism for Catholic thinkers by Max Scheler.² No doubt, the thing, the reality—<br>

  Book Title: Negotiating the Sacred-Blasphemy and Sacrilege in a Multicultural Society<br>
  Publisher: ANU E Press<br>
  Author(s): WHITE KEVIN<br>
  Abstract: This cross-disciplinary exploration of the role of the sacred, blasphemy and sacrilege in a multicultural society brings together philosophers, theologians, lawyers, historians, curators, anthropologists and sociologists, as well as Christian, Jewish and Islamic and secular perspectives. In bringing together different disciplinary and cultural approaches, the book provides a way of broadening our conceptions of what might count as sacred, sacrilegious and blasphemous, in moral and political terms. In addition, it provides original research data on blasphemy, sacrilege and religious tolerance from a range of disciplines. The book is presented in four sections: Section I: Religion Sacrilege and Blasphemy in Australia. Section II: Sacrilege and the Sacred Section III: The State, Religion and Tolerance Section IV: The Future: Openness and Dogmatism. The book will appeal to both those actively involved in religious negotiation and to scholars and students of religion in history, philosophy, anthropology, sociology and political science.<br>

  Abstract: The notion that in significant parts of Eurasia the middle centuries of the first millennium BCE mark a significant transition in human cultural history, and that this period can be referred to as the Axial Age, has become widely, but not universally, accepted. Since the very term “Axial Age” is unfamiliar to many, we may begin with a brief explication of it.

  Abstract: After the end of the cosmopolitism of the Enlightenment, Occidental uniqueness and superiority have become firm features of the Western self-understanding. Hegel’s statement that “the Oriental has to be excluded from the history of philosophy” (1940, 152) and Leopold Ranke’s echo that for understanding world history “one cannot start from the peoples of eternal standstill” (1888, viii) are two prominent examples for a conviction that became dominant in the historical disciplines.

Greece gave rise to a form of democracy based on decisions made after rational argument in the assembly; to philosophy, including formal logic (second-order reasoning); to at least the beginnings of science based on evidence and argument; not to mention that it also gave rise to extraordinary artistic and literary achievements. Some have been so overwhelmed by the culture of ancient Greece as to imagine a “Greek miracle” emerging, without forerunners or rivals, full-blown from the head of Zeus so to speak. The Greeks<br>

  Abstract: Notably underrepresented in the deliberations of the Pareto circle were Harvard’s psychologists. When Henderson’s seminar commenced in 1932, the institutional status of psychology at Harvard was just as uncertain as that of sociology, anthropology, and business administration. Since the 1870s, when William James established in Cambridge the nation’s first psychological laboratory, psychology at Harvard had existed in “forced cohabitation” with philosophy.¹ Very much the junior partner in this alliance, psychology would not attain independent departmental standing until 1934. Yet, marginal figures though they were, Harvard psychologists of the interwar decades—especially Edwin G. Boring, Karl Lashley, B. F. Skinner, and<br>

Throughout the early decades of the twentieth century, philosophy at Harvard was not in any obvious sense an interstitial enterprise—quite the opposite.

Neither Rudolf Carnap’s program of the Logic of Science nor Otto Neurath’s grandiose attempts to orchestrate a working alliance of the sciences registered strongly at Depression-era Harvard. Nevertheless, as S. S.

  Book Title: Dying for Time-  Publisher: Harvard University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hägglund Martin<br>
  Abstract: Novels by Proust, Woolf, and Nabokov have been read as expressions of a desire to transcend time. Hägglund gives them another reading entirely: fear of time and death is generated by investment in temporal life. Engaging with Freud and Lacan, he opens a new way of reading the dramas of desire as they are staged in both philosophy and literature.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2jbvn6">Dying for Time</a><br>
  Abstract: The debate between philosophy and literature begins over the question of desire. In Plato’s
                  Republic,Socrates’ main charge against Homer is that his poetry leaves us in the grip of the desire for mortal life.¹ The dramatic pathos in theIliadis generated when the heroes cling to what they will lose and cannot accept the death that awaits them. Even the bravest heroes, such as Hector and Achilles, lament the fact that their lives will have been so short. When this pathos is transferred to the audience, it opens a channel that allows the spectators to come into contact<br>

  INTRODUCTION: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2jc857">Time in the Philosophy of Gabriel Marcel</a><br>
  Abstract: The aim of this book is to shed light on the philosophy of a twentieth-century French thinker who is notoriously difficult to situate, namely Gabriel Marcel (1889–1973). Marcel stands somewhat outside the canon of twentieth-century French philosophers. As J. J. Benefield rightly notes: ‘Among the names of thinkers who are commonly listed as belonging to the French school of existentialism[,] that of Gabriel Marcel is often relegated to one side and promptly overlooked[,] if not forgotten’ (1973: 6). Furthermore, virtually every scholar who has attempted to engage with Marcel’s thought has commented on how difficult his work is to<br>

  CHAPTER 2  Phenomenological Time from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2jc857">Time in the Philosophy of Gabriel Marcel</a><br>
  Abstract: Chapter 1 introduced Marcel’s and Bergson’s shared desire to engage with the time of lived experience as opposed to thinking in abstraction. However, Marcel’s philosophy emerged as very different from that of Bergson and, as such, was suggested to be problematic: it appeared to subordinate time to an eternal present, and this seemed at odds with his assertions concerning (temporal) existence’s dynamic, dialectical nature. This potentially problematic relation between time and eternity was identified in the first part of Marcel’s
                  Journal(January–May 1914), before his thought evolved in reaction against his idealist leanings; but strangely, in spite of his<br>

  CHAPTER 3  Narrative Time from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2jc857">Time in the Philosophy of Gabriel Marcel</a><br>
  Abstract: Part I suggested the theory of time which underwrites Marcel’s philosophy to be problematic, for although he plainly declares his lack of interest in its ontology, he nevertheless is concerned with human Being. Owing to the temporal character of human existence, time is thus necessarily bound up with Marcel’s ontological investigations. The conclusions he draws from his phenomenological
                  approches concrètes, which make reference to both an experience of finitude and of eternity, therefore (indirectly) reify what Marcel only intended to be a phenomenological distinction between time and eternity. As such, Marcel’s philosophy of time emerges as paradoxically concerned, and unconcerned,<br>

  CHAPTER 4  Marcel’s Theatre: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2jc857">Time in the Philosophy of Gabriel Marcel</a><br>
  Abstract: As with Marcel and Ricœur, in Lévinas’s philosophy the Self’s (
                  le Moi) relation to time equally serves as a model for its relation to the Other (l’Autre/Autrui);¹ subjectivity and intersubjectivity are inextricably linked. Unlike Marcel and Ricœur, however, (authentic) Lévinassian time is not conceived in terms of presence, but is absolutely Other. Rather than justifying a totalizing return to the Self, Lévinas believes that the paradoxes of (temporal) identity bear witness to a time that simply cannot — and therefore should not — be resolved. Only if suchrupturesare accepted for what they are, he contends, can any relation with the<br>

  CHAPTER 5  Time and God from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2jc857">Time in the Philosophy of Gabriel Marcel</a><br>
  Abstract: If Chapter 3 suggested that a Ricœurian reading of Marcel might be possible, this was also inspired by similarities identified between Marcel and Augustine, whose philosophy of time Ricœur drew upon to support his argument that phenomenological and cosmological time are incommensurable. If Augustine’s concern with time is philosophical,¹ however, it is also linked to his religious outlook — just as, this chapter will suggest, might be argued for Marcel. However, this theological aspect is rather neglected in Ricœur’s interpretation of Augustine. For Ricœur, God’s eternity in Book XI of the
                  Confessionsmerely functions as time’s Other, intensifying and deepening our<br>

  GENERAL CONCLUSION: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2jc857">Time in the Philosophy of Gabriel Marcel</a><br>
  Abstract: In order to assess the success or even just the specificity of a philosophical position, one must first have an understanding of what philosophy is, of its status and role. However, this is precisely what Marcel questioned, challenging, in particular, Western philosophy’s inbuilt assumption that to philosophize always entails building a system: ‘le propre d’une expérience en cours n’est-il pas [plutôt] de présenter une inconsistance fondamentale?’ (
                  RA: 291), he asks in ‘Regard en arrière’ (1947). The problem of consistency that Chapter 1 points to, it therefore emerged, subscribed to the very tradition that Marcel was contesting. His metaphysical discussions of<br>

  Author(s): DALLMAYR FRED<br>
  Abstract: In addition to war, terrorism, and unchecked military violence, modernity is also subject to less visible but no less venomous conflicts. Global in nature, these "culture wars" exacerbate the tensions between tradition and innovation, virtue and freedom. Internationally acclaimed scholar Fred Dallmayr charts a course beyond these persistent but curable dichotomies in Integral Pluralism: Beyond Culture Wars. Consulting diverse fields such as philosophy, literature, political science, and religious studies, Dallmayr equates modern history with a process of steady pluralization. This process, which Dallmayr calls "integral pluralism," requires new connections and creates ethical responsibilities.<br>

  Abstract: It was with great sadness that I learned of the passing of two leading Indian philosophers: Daya Krishna and Ramchandra Gandhi. What renders the loss particularly grievous is the fact that they were not just ordinary academics but exemplary and even iconic Indian thinkers. In a way, during much of their lives they represented two different possibilities of Indian thought, two alternative conceptions of the meaning of philosophy. On the whole, Daya Krishna identified philosophy with critical analysis and the striving for exact knowledge, whereas Ramchandra Gandhi placed himself in the tradition of the great Indian seers, the teachings of<br>

  Abstract: Coming from the West, the contemporary traveler to India often has the sense of visiting another planet. Many customs and practices seem alien or remote, as do the underlying beliefs and motives. If this is true of contemporary India, how much greater would this sense of distance be if visiting medieval India? That place, with its philosophy, literature, and religion, would seem like a lost city, surrounded by nearly impenetrable underbrush. How would one approach such a place, from our modern angle, without disrupting or violating its intrinsic order? Clearly, if such a visit were attempted, one would have to<br>

  Abstract: In his approach to the problem of knowledge, Nicolaus of Cusa (1401–1464) can rightly be considered, as Ernst Cassirer observes, “the first modern thinker.” The title belongs to him because he first grasped a principle that modern Western philosophy has erected into an unimpeachable doctrine: the principle that rational or scientific knowledge, properly construed, has to be anchored in measurement and empirical comparison—methods that completely sideline traditional metaphysics (with its claim to deliver speculative knowledge). In his long string of writings, Nicolaus of Cusa never ceased to stress this need for measurement, but with a dramatic twist. Had<br>

  Book Title: The Philosophy of Science Fiction Film-  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Sanders Steven M.<br>
  Abstract: The science fiction genre maintains a remarkable hold on the imagination and enthusiasm of the filmgoing public, captivating large audiences worldwide and garnering ever-larger profits. Science fiction films entertain the possibility of time travel and extraterrestrial visitation and imaginatively transport us to worlds transformed by modern science and technology. They also provide a medium through which questions about personal identity, moral agency, artificial consciousness, and other categories of experience can be addressed. In The Philosophy of Science Fiction Film, distinguished authors explore the storylines, conflicts, and themes of fifteen science fiction film classics, from Metropolis to The Matrix. Editor Steven M. Sanders and a group of outstanding scholars in philosophy, film studies, and other fields raise science fiction film criticism to a new level by penetrating the surface of the films to expose the underlying philosophical arguments, ethical perspectives, and metaphysical views. Sanders's introduction presents an overview and evaluation of each essay and poses questions for readers to consider as they think about the films under discussion.The first section, "Enigmas of Identity and Agency," deals with the nature of humanity as it is portrayed in Blade Runner, Dark City, Frankenstein, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and Total Recall. In the second section, "Extraterrestrial Visitation, Time Travel, and Artificial Intelligence," contributors discuss 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Terminator, 12 Monkeys, and The Day the Earth Stood Still and analyze the challenges of artificial intelligence, the paradoxes of time travel, and the ethics of war. The final section, "Brave Newer World: Science Fiction Futurism," looks at visions of the future in Metropolis, The Matrix, Alphaville, and screen adaptations of George Orwell's 1984.<br>

  Book Title: The Philosophy of Neo-Noir-  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Conard Mark T.<br>
  Abstract: Film noir is a classic genre characterized by visual elements such as tilted camera angles, skewed scene compositions, and an interplay between darkness and light. Common motifs include crime and punishment, the upheaval of traditional moral values, and a pessimistic stance on the meaning of life and on the place of humankind in the universe. Spanning the 1940s and 1950s, the classic film noir era saw the release of many of Hollywood's best-loved studies of shady characters and shadowy underworlds, including Double Indemnity, The Big Sleep, Touch of Evil, and The Maltese Falcon. Neo-noir is a somewhat loosely defined genre of films produced after the classic noir era that display the visual or thematic hallmarks of the noir sensibility. The essays collected in The Philosophy of Neo-Noir explore the philosophical implications of neo-noir touchstones such as Blade Runner, Chinatown, Reservoir Dogs, Memento, and the films of the Coen brothers. Through the lens of philosophy, Mark T. Conard and the contributors examine previously obscure layers of meaning in these challenging films. The contributors also consider these neo-noir films as a means of addressing philosophical questions about guilt, redemption, the essence of human nature, and problems of knowledge, memory and identity. In the neo-noir universe, the lines between right and wrong and good and evil are blurred, and the detective and the criminal frequently mirror each other's most debilitating personality traits. The neo-noir detective -- more antihero than hero -- is frequently a morally compromised and spiritually shaken individual whose pursuit of a criminal masks the search for lost or unattainable aspects of the self. Conard argues that the films discussed in The Philosophy of Neo-Noir convey ambiguity, disillusionment, and disorientation more effectively than even the most iconic films of the classic noir era. Able to self-consciously draw upon noir conventions and simultaneously subvert them, neo-noir directors push beyond the earlier genre's limitations and open new paths of cinematic and philosophical exploration.<br>

  Book Title: In Search of the Whole-Twelve Essays on Faith and Academic Life<br>

  Abstract: The contributors to this inspiring anthology meet the challenge that everyone faces: that of becoming a whole person in both their personal and professional lives. John C. Haughey, SJ, has gathered twelve professionals in higher education from a variety of disciplines-philosophy, theology, health care, business, and administration. What they have in common reflects the creative understanding of the meaning of "catholic" as Haughey has found it to operate in Catholic higher education. Each essay in the first six chapters describes how its author has assembled a unique whole from within his or her particular area of academic competence. The last six chapters are more autobiographical, with each author describing what has become central to his or her identity. All twelve are "anticipating an entirety" with each contributing a coherence that is as surprising as it is delightful.<br>

  Book Title: Overcoming Our Evil-Human Nature and Spiritual Exercises in Xunzi and Augustine<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stalnaker Aaron<br>
  Abstract: Can people ever really change? Do they ever become more ethical, and if so, how?
      Overcoming Our Evilfocuses on the way ethical and religious commitments are conceived and nurtured through the methodical practices that Pierre Hadot has called "spiritual exercises." These practices engage thought, imagination, and sensibility, and have a significant ethical component, yet aim for a broader transformation of the whole personality. Going beyond recent philosophical and historical work that has focused on ancient Greco-Roman philosophy, Stalnaker broadens ethical inquiry into spiritual exercises by examining East Asian as well as classical Christian sources, and taking religious and seemingly "aesthetic" practices such as prayer, ritual, and music more seriously as objects of study. More specifically,Overcoming Our Evilexamines and compares the thought and practice of the early Christian Augustine of Hippo, and the early Confucian Xunzi. Both have sophisticated and insightful accounts of spiritual exercises, and both make such ethical work central to their religious thought and practice. Yet to understand the two thinkers' recommendations for cultivating virtue we must first understand some important differences. Here Stalnaker disentangles the competing aspects of Augustine and Xunxi's ideas of "human nature." His groundbreaking comparison of their ethical vocabularies also drives a substantive analysis of fundamental issues in moral psychology, especially regarding emotion and the complex idea of "the will," to examine how our dispositions to feel, think, and act might be slowly transformed over time. The comparison meticulously constructs vivid portraits of both thinkers demonstrating where they connect and where they diverge, making the case that both have been misunderstood and misinterpreted. In throwing light on these seemingly disparate ancient figures in unexpected ways, Stalnaker redirects recent debate regarding practices of personal formation, and more clearly exposes the intellectual and political issues involved in the retrieval of "classic" ethical sources in diverse contemporary societies, illuminating a path toward a contemporary understanding of difference.<br>

  Book Title: Wittgenstein Reads Freud: The Myth of the Unconscious-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Descombes Vincent<br>
  Abstract: Offering a critical view of all the texts in which Wittgenstein mentions Freud, Bouveresse immerses us in the intellectual climate of Vienna in the early part of the twentieth century. Although we come to see why Wittgenstein did not view psychoanalysis as a science proper, we are nonetheless made to feel the philosopher's sense of wonder and respect for the cultural task Freud took on as he found new ways meaningfully to discuss human concerns. Intertwined in this story of Wittgenstein's grappling with the theory of the unconscious is the story of how he came to question the authority of science and of philosophy itself. While aiming primarily at the clarification of Wittgenstein's opinion of Freud, Bouveresse's book can be read as a challenge to the French psychoanalytic school of Lacan and as a provocative commentary on cultural authority.<br>

The subtitle,Wittgenstein Reads Freud, defines the book’s subject—namely, Wittgenstein’s judgments on Freud and, more generally, his attitude toward the man and his enterprise. The title,Philosophy, Mythology, and Pseudo-Science, announces the ultimate thrust of the entire discussion by introducing three intellectual categories: a new idea can come from eitherphilosophy,mythology, orscience.

  Abstract: Relations between Wittgenstein and Freud can indeed be treated, following Assoun (cf.
                  Freud et Wittgenstein, pp. 13–14), as the confrontation between two types of rationality. The crucial difference, in my view, seems to be that Freud defends a kind of classical scientific rationalism, while Wittgenstein clearly belongs to quite another order of thought. Freud’s position in this regard is rather comparable to that of the Vienna Circle, as its members certainly recognized. Moreover, we can see that Freud’s attitude toward philosophy, if not, like theirs, the attitude of someone who would criticize it from within in order to reinvigorate<br>

  Abstract: “I am,” Charles Johnson states, “first and foremost, a writer of philosophical fiction” (McWilliams, “An Interview” 275). This marriage of the art of fiction and the traditions of philosophy stands behind everything Johnson writes, from his novels to his short stories to his essays (both literary and philosophical—they are one and the same to Johnson) to his book reviews. Johnson’s wide-ranging education and background have provided him with a formidable training in these disciplines: raised in the AME Church with a substantial background in Christianity and the Bible, he is also a formal student of western philosophy, holding a<br>

  Author(s) SELZER LINDA<br>
  Abstract: If historically the line between fiction and philosophy has often been blurred—as Plato’s dialogues, Nietzsche’s aphorisms, and the twentieth-century proliferation of existentialist literature in a number of genres all attest—this is especially true in the case of African American philosophy, which by necessity in America has had its roots in nonacademic forms of writing. As John P. Pittman points out in
                  African American Perspectives and Philosophical Traditions(1997), to define philosophy only in terms of a specialist discourse is to leave out “an entire world of intellectual life, and for traditionally excluded groups, any ‘representation’ at all” (xii).<br>

Foremost among these is American pragmatism, a tradition whose concerns may at first seem far removed from the emphatically spiritual and idealistic vision foregrounded in Johnson’s creative work.

  Abstract: Charles Johnson is an extraordinarily innovative American writer whose work revolves around profound ethical issues. Because his ethics emerge from the philosophy he studied in graduate school, his ethical outlook is complex and difficult to discern—primarily because his is a dissenting voice from current philosophical schools of ethics.¹ Contemporary Western philosophy usually treats ethics as primarily the moral evaluation of specific actions.² However, such an approach is insufficient for a novelist with Johnson’s convictions.

  Book Title: Truth Matters-Knowledge, Politics, Ethics, Religion<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Shuker Ronnie<br>
  Abstract: Why should we seek and tell the truth? Does anyone know what truth is? Many are skeptical about the relevance of truth. Truth Matters endeavours to show why truth is important in a world where the very idea of truth is contested. Putting philosophers in conversation with educators, literary scholars, physicists, political theorists, and theologians, Truth Matters ranges across both analytic and continental philosophy and draws on the ideas of thinkers such as Aquinas, Balthasar, Brandom, Davidson, Dooyeweerd, Gadamer, Habermas, Kierkegaard, Plantinga, Ricoeur, and Wolterstorff. Some essays attempt to provide a systematic account of truth, while others wrestle with the question of how truth is told and what it means to live truthfully. Contributors address debates between realists and anti-realists, explore issues surrounding relativism and constructivism in education and the social sciences, examine the politics of truth telling and the ethics of authenticity, and consider various religious perspectives on truth. Most scholars agree that truth is propositional, being expressed in statements that are subject to proof or disproof. This book goes a step farther: yes, propositional truth is important, but truth is more than propositional.

  Author(s) WALHOF DARREN R.<br>
  Abstract: Writing in the wake of the furor over her account of the Eichmann trial, Hannah Arendt reflects on why truth and politics are, in her words, “on rather bad terms.”¹ Her analysis rests on dividing truth into two different types. The first type, rational truth, is the subject of mathematics and philosophy. It has a long history of tension with politics, going back at least to Plato, who worried about the displacement of rational truth by mere opinion. In the modern age, Arendt says, opinion has generally won the day, rendering rational truth politically irrelevant.² The second type, factual truth,<br>

Crassus replies that this is a familiar theme among the Greeks, but when Plato is eloquent against eloquence, he exhibits a failure of self-comprehension. The orator cannot be potent without having grasped the subject he discusses (1.48). Unlike the<br>

  Abstract: Philosophical hermeneutics takes as its task the opening up of the hermeneutical dimension in its full scope, showing its fundamental significance for our entire understanding of the world and thus for all the various forms in which this understanding manifests itself: from interhuman communication to manipulation of society; from personal experience by the individual in society to the way in which he encounters society; and from the tradition as it is built of religion and law, art and philosophy, to the revolutionary consciousness that unhinges the tradition through emancipatory reflection.<br>

  Book Title: Rhetoric in an Antifoundational World-Language, Culture, and Pedagogy<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Glejzer Richard R.<br>
  Abstract: In this brilliant collection, literary scholars, philosophers, and teachers inquire into the connections between antifoundational philosophy and the rhetorical tradition. What happens to literary studies and theory when traditional philosophical foundations are disavowed? What happens to the study of teaching and writing when antifoundationalism is accepted? What strategies for human understanding are possible when the weaknesses of antifoundationalism are identified? This volume offers answers in classic essays by such thinkers as Richard Rorty, Terry Eagleton, and Stanley Fish, and in many new essays never published before.The contributors to this book explore the nexus of antifoundationalism and rhetoric, critique that nexus, and suggest a number of pedagogical and theoretical alternatives. The editors place these statements into a context that is both critical and evaluative, and they provide for voices that dissent from the antifoundational perspective and that connect specific, practical pedagogies to the broader philosophical statements. For those with an interest in rhetoric, philosophy, comparative literature, or the teaching of composition, this book sets forth a wealth of thought-provoking ideas.<br>

  Abstract: What is a consequent marxist view of the history and philosophy of science? Reference to Marx’s and Engels’s (or even Lenin’s) work will not yield a satisfactory answer, although certain signposts are evident. For example, there is the famous observation on method in the introduction to the
                  Grundrisse, which argues that, contrary to the procedures adopted in classical economy, where the starting point for investigation is apparently concrete phenomena from which abstract theoretical descriptions are then derived, “the method of rising from the abstract to the concrete is the only way in which thought appropriates the concrete, reproduces it as<br>

  V  Heidegger: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bfxq">Introduction to Philosophical Hermeneutics</a><br>
  Abstract: In the nineteenth century, hermeneutic reflection remained peripheral in certain respects (especially to philosophy). Though their founding intuitions were broadly based, the classic figures in hermeneutics who were representative of the century—Böckh, Schleiermacher, Droysen, and Dilthey—did not manage to develop a unified conception of hermeneutics or publish it in systematic form. Indicative of this state of affairs is that their hermeneutic inquiries had to be compiled from posthumous writings edited by their students and published mostly in the form of overviews and fragments. This situation slowly begins to change with Heidegger (1889–1976), who was demonstrably influenced early<br>

  Abstract: Early Greek philosophy defined the terms in which Western thought was to formulate transcendence. The Ionian search for a ground of nature beyond its appearance as well as the Pythagorean distinction between a principle of intelligibility and the reality it renders intelligible made the relation from the more fundamental to the less fundamental an unavoidable issue. Classical Greek philosophy eventually resolved it by means of the form principle. The form resided within the appearing objects of which it constituted the intelligible essence, yet as determining factor it also surpassed them. In his dialogue

  Abstract: In this chapter I will review three major attempts to overcome the theological dualism modern culture inherited from late medieval thought, namely, those of humanist religion, the early Reformation, and Jansenist theology. According to such Christian humanists as Valla, Erasmus, and Ficino, a universal divine attraction sanctifies the natural order and draws it back to its source. Archaic religion, ancient philosophy, Hebrew and Christian revelation—in an order of increasing intensity—all responded to the same divine impulse. Generally speaking, humanism offered more an alternative than an answer to the questions raised by fifteenth-century School theology. Humanists, even when acquainted<br>

  Abstract: In this book, a distinguished historian of medicine surveys the basic elements that have constituted psychological healing over the centuries. Dr. Stanley W. Jackson shows that healing practices, whether they come from the worlds of medicine, religion, or philosophy, share certain elements that transcend space and time.Drawing on medical writings from classical Greece and Rome to the present, as well as on philosophical and religious writings, Dr. Jackson shows that the basic ingredients of psychological healing-which have survived changes of name, the fall of their theoretical contexts, and the waning of social support in different historical eras-are essential factors in our modern psychotherapies and in healing contexts in general.<br>

  Book Title: Rhetorical Invention and Religious Inquiry-New Perspectives<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): OLMSTED WENDY<br>
  Abstract: This exceptional collection of writings offers for the first time a discussion among leading thinkers about the points at which rhetoric and religion illuminate and challenge each other. The contributors to the volume are eminent theorists and critics in rhetoric, theology, and religion, and they address a variety of problems and periods.Together these writings shed light on religion as a human quest and rhetoric as the origin and sustainer of that quest. They show that when pursued with intelligence and sensitivity, rhetorical approaches to religion are capable of revitalizing both language and experience. Rhetorical figures, for example, constitute forms of language that say what cannot be said in any other way, and that move individuals toward religious truths that cannot be known in any other way. When firmly placed within religious, social, and literary history, the convergence of rhetoric and religion brings into focus crucial issues in several fields-including philosophy, psychology, history, and art-and interprets relations among self, language, and world that are central to both past and present cultures.<br>

  Author(s) SHUGER DEBORA K.<br>
  Abstract: In a 1990 essay, Stanley Fish suggested that the history of Western thought from Plato through postmodernism could best be understood as a protracted debate between those who seek the truth and the sophists, or as what he terms the “quarrel between philosophy and rhetoric” (“Rhetoric,” 206, 209).¹ According to Fish, rhetoric is thus sophistic discourse, at once partisan and playful, and hence doubly “unconstrained by any sense of responsibility either to the Truth or to the Good”; it appeals to the emotions rather than the intellect and strives for victory rather than understanding. Philosophy, conversely, pursues “what is absolutely<br>

  Author(s) SHAPIRO SUSAN E.<br>
  Abstract: As the audience for Emmanuel Levinas’s philosophical and Jewish thought has grown, his claim that ethics rather than ontology is first philosophy has become a more familiar — if resisted — view. This claim is central to Levinas’s thought and indeed, as will be made clear, figures importantly in relation to problems of rhetoric, ideology, and idolatry within discourse. For without the priority of ethics, a critique of these functionings would, for Levinas, be impossible. In order to demonstrate the importance, relations among, and shifting character of the problems of rhetoric, ideology, and idolatry in Levinas’s writings, I shall first briefly trace<br>

  Book Title: Faces of History-Historical Inquiry from Herodotus to Herder<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): KELLEY DONALD R.<br>
  Abstract: In this book, one of the world's leading intellectual historians offers a critical survey of Western historical thought and writing from the pre-classical era to the late eighteenth century. Donald R. Kelley focuses on persistent themes and methodology, including questions of myth, national origins, chronology, language, literary forms, rhetoric, translation, historical method and criticism, theory and practice of interpretation, cultural studies, philosophy of history, and "historicism."Kelley begins by analyzing the dual tradition established by the foundational works of Greek historiography-Herodotus's broad cultural and antiquarian inquiry and the contrasting model of Thucydides' contemporary political and analytical narrative. He then examines the many variations on and departures from these themes produced in writings from Greek, Roman, Jewish, and Christian antiquity, in medieval chronicles, in national histories and revisions of history during the Renaissance and Reformation, and in the rise of erudite and enlightened history in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Throughout, Kelley discusses how later historians viewed their predecessors, including both supporters and detractors of the authors in question.The book, which is a companion volume to Kelley's highly praised anthology
      Versions of History from Antiquity to the Enlightenment,will be a valuable resource for scholars and students interested in interpretations of the past.<br>

  Abstract: Renaissance humanism is defined in large part in terms of its idealization of classical culture and its attempts, implicitly dependent on historical understanding, to imitate the ancient Romans and Greeks in moral, social, and political as well as literary terms.¹ Humanism is defined, too, by its particular attachment to the humanities
                  (studia humanitatis),which meant the first two members of the medieval trivium—grammar and rhetoric—together with moral philosophy, poetry, and history.

There were established chairs of history in the universities of Europe, especially in England, France, and Germany, as well as official historiographers, official collections of documents, and other kinds of private and public support for practitioners of history.¹ What was new in the Enlightenment was the encounters between history and philosophy, which had likewise, and even earlier, emerged as a professional field with an academic base.<br>

  Book Title: Metaphysics in Ordinary Language-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Rosen Stanley<br>
  Abstract: In this rich collection of philosophical writings, Stanley Rosen addresses a wide range of topics-from eros, poetry, and freedom to problems like negation and the epistemological status of sense perception. Though diverse in subject, Rosen's essays share two unifying principles: there can be no legitimate separation of textual hermeneutics from philosophical analysis, and philosophical investigation must be oriented in terms of everyday language and experience, although it cannot simply remain within these confines. Ordinary experience provides a minimal criterion for the assessment of extraordinary discourses, Rosen argues, and without such a criterion we would have no basis for evaluating conflicting discourses: philosophy would give way to poetry.Philosophical problems are not so deeply embedded in a specific historical context that they cannot be restated in terms as valid for us today as they were for those who formulated them, the author maintains. Rosen shows that the history of philosophy-a story of conflicting interpretations of human life and the structure of intelligibility-is a story that comes to life only when it is rethought in terms of the philosophical problems of our own personal and historical situation.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bsjw">Metaphysics in Ordinary Language</a><br>
  Abstract: In this essay, I make a suggestion about the role of Platonism in the development of the modern epoch. It has become quite common to find in the scholarly literature the claim that such originators of modernity as Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Descartes were influenced by Plato’s geometrical cosmology. According to this view, the mythical description of the cosmos as constructed from a variety of pure geometrical figures, which Plato records in the
                     Timaeus, is the prototype for the late Renaissance and early modern conviction that philosophy is written in the book of nature in the languages of mathematics.<br>

  Abstract: I propose to deal with the question of the relation between philosophy and ordinary experience. This sounds quite straightforward, but I am afraid that it is actually an unusually difficult problem. It is a striking fact of our century that philosophy has become increasingly concerned with ordinary experience, ordinary language, everyday life, or the life-world, to cite four often-used expressions. This concern is evident in both wings of the two major contemporary philosophical movements, which are popularly if inaccurately designated as the analytical and the continental or phenomenological schools. Interest in everyday or ordinary language has clearly been stimulated by<br>

  Abstract: This study pioneers the use of philosophy of religion in the study of the Hebrew Bible. After identifying the need for a legitimate philosophical approach to Israelite religion, the volume traces the history of interdisciplinary relations and shows how descriptive varieties of philosophy of religion can aid the clarification of the Hebrew Bible’s own metaphysical, epistemological, and moral assumptions. Two new interpretative methodologies are developed and subsequently applied through an introduction to what the biblical texts took for granted about the nature of religious language, the concept of deity, the properties of Yhwh, the existence of gods, religious epistemology, and the relation between religion and morality.<br>

  Abstract: Interdisciplinary research in the study of the Hebrew Bible is nothing novel.² In fact, it is impossible to do any other kind. All forms of biblical criticism have recourse to at least one auxiliary subject, be it linguistics, literary criticism, history, archaeology, anthropology, sociology, psychology, theology, philosophy, or another.

Consequently, this chapter offers a basic introductory metaphilosophical overview of that subject in order to set the scene for the discussion to follow. For let us suppose that the agenda of Hebrew Bible interpretation is essentially historical and descriptive. Whether there can be a hermeneutically justified philosophical approach to ancient Israelite religion within biblical scholarship at all will depend on what we understand under the concept of “philosophy of religion” itself.

Now we go one step further than theorizing about a philosophical perspective

  Abstract: The words “religious language” (henceforth RL) do not occur in the Hebrew Bible. In philosophy of religion, the concept refers to statements or claims made about divine beings. In that sense the RL of the Hebrew Bible denotes the god-talk of ancient Israelite religion. Most approaches to biblical god-talk in contemporary philosophy of religion have tended to be evaluative, either trying to make biblical god-talk seem philosophically credible or attempting to prove it nonsensical. Few philosophical inquiries are actually interested in the provisioning of a purely descriptive analysis of the RL of the Hebrew Bible for its own sake. This<br>

Interestingly, purely in terms of grammatical form, this question is not only linguistic, historical, literary, sociological, psychological, anthropological or theological in nature. Questions that take the form “What is X?” (where X is a concept, as in “What is knowledge?”/“What is justice?”/“What is a person?”/“What is an אל?”) are also typical of philosophy (conceptual analysis) in general and of

  Abstract: Nothing presents more problems for those who would enter the mentality of the medieval philosophical theologian than the task which has been set for this volume. Trying to judge the influence on Thomas Aquinas’s doctrine of one of his authoritative ancient sources requires us to surrender, at least provisionally, what we think we know about the authority in question. As heirs of Renaissance and modern philology, and of the modern constructions of the history of philosophy, we will almost certainly have a different, perhaps even opposed, view of the source than a medieval theologian would have had.

  The “Golden Age” of Jewish-Muslim Relations: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fgz64">A History of Jewish-Muslim Relations</a><br>
  Author(s) Cohen Mark R.<br>
  Abstract: In the nineteenth century there was nearly universal consensus that Jews in the Islamic Middle Ages—taking al-Andalus, or Muslim Spain, as the model—lived in a “Golden Age” of Jewish-Muslim harmony,¹ an interfaith utopia of tolerance and
                  convivencia.² It was thought that Jews mingled freely and comfortably with Muslims, immersed in Arabic-Islamic culture, including the language, poetry, philosophy, science, medicine, and the study of Scripture—a society, furthermore, in which Jews could and many did ascend to the pinnacles of political power in Muslim government. This idealized picture went beyond Spain to encompass the entire Muslim world, from Baghdad<br>

  Jewish and Muslim Philosophy: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fgz64">A History of Jewish-Muslim Relations</a><br>
  Author(s) Harvey Steven<br>
  Abstract: Muslim and Jewish philosophers not only studied, interpreted, and commented upon the writings of Aristotle, but also played an important, indeed crucial, role in transferring his philosophy and science to the Christian West. Indeed, the emergence of Aristotle as the philosopher in thirteenth-century Scholastic philosophy is due in great measure to the Latin translations from Arabic of the writings of Avicenna, Averroes, Maimonides, and others. The Middle Ages was the golden age for both Muslim and Jewish philosophy. It was a period of significant contributions in science, as well as in the development of a rational explication of revealed religion.<br>

  Abstract: Science and philosophy did not develop spontaneously within Judaism. The intellectual activities of traditional Jewish cultures generally focused on the canonical texts of the tradition: the Bible, the Mishnah, the Talmud. Any other type of knowledge, that is, any knowledge not vested with the authority of the canonical texts and of revelation, was considered “foreign.” This point, fundamental for understanding Jewish intellectual history, was forcefully stated in 1933 by the great historian Julius Guttmann: “The history of Jewish philosophy is a history of the successive absorption of foreign ideas.”¹<br>

  Abstract: Many commentators have suggested that translation is central to the ethical philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas. Not, clearly, translation from one language to another, in the sense of translating, say, German into French, nor translation in the sense of introducing intellectual developments from one national tradition into another, although Levinas is widely credited with introducing phenomenological thought into France in 1930. The commentators suggest that Levinas offers translation in a wider sense between what he calls “Hebrew” and “Greek,” where the names for the languages stand in for much wider frameworks or worldviews.

  Book Title: Allegory and Philosophy in Avicenna (Ibn Sina)-With a Translation of the Book of the Prophet Muhammad's Ascent to Heaven<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Heath Peter<br>
  Abstract: Islamic allegory is the product of a cohesive literary tradition to which few contributed as significantly as Ibn Sina (Avicenna), the eleventh-century Muslim philosopher. Peter Heath here offers a detailed examination of Avicenna's contribution, paying special attention to Avicenna's psychology and poetics and to the ways in which they influenced strains of theological, mystical, and literary thought in subsequent Islamic-and Western-intellectual and religious history. Heath begins by showing how Avicenna's writings fit into the context and general history of Islamic allegory and explores the interaction among allegory, allegoresis, and philosophy in Avicenna's thought. He then provides a brief introduction to Avicenna as an historical figure. From there, he examines the ways in which Avicenna's cosmological, psychological, and epistemological theories find parallel, if diverse, expression in the disparate formats of philosophical and allegorical narration. Included in this book is an illustration of Avicenna's allegorical practice. This takes the form of a translation of the Mi'raj Nama (The Book of the Prophet Muhammad's Ascent to Heaven), a short treatise in Persian generally attributed to Avicenna. The text concludes with an investigation of the literary dimension Avicenna's allegorical theory and practice by examining his use of description metaphor. Allegory and Philosophy in Avicenna is an original and important work that breaks new ground by applying the techniques of modern literary criticism to the study of Medieval Islamic philosophy. It will be of interest to scholars and students of medieval Islamic and Western literature and philosophy.<br>

  1  Avicenna and Islamic Allegory from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fhz90">Allegory and Philosophy in Avicenna (Ibn Sina)</a><br>
  Abstract: Islamic allegory represents a vast body of literature. It encompasses diverse genres—romance, “visionary recital,” exegesis, debate (
                  munâẓara), and fable. And its encoded “messages” stem from such varied disciplines as philosophy, mysticism, theology, political theory, and social and political satire. Despite this diversity in form and content, Islamic allegory is the product of a cohesive literary tradition. Writers of allegories belonged to a cosmopolitan class of Muslim elites who shared a common, often multilingual, educational background in the religious, intellectual, and literary sciences. One has only to note the frequency and ease with which individual scholars or writers moved throughout<br>

  3.  The Structure and Representation of the Cosmos from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fhz90">Allegory and Philosophy in Avicenna (Ibn Sina)</a><br>
  Abstract: Avicenna possessed an extraordinarily systematic vision of the structure of the cosmos—and of how it should be studied. Appreciating this fact is crucial if we are to understand his intellectual accomplishments; but it must also be kept in perspective. His passion for cohesiveness and completion led to the preoccupation with detail and demonstration that characterizes his logos writings: everything must fit, everything must hang together logically.¹ This being the case, it is not surprising that many later students of Avicenna, attracted by these very attributes of system, detail, and logical coherence, tend to view his philosophy through the prism<br>

  Abstract: Psychology, the study of the soul, held a particular fascination for Avicenna. That the subject clearly lies near the heart of his concern for philosophy is indicated by the fact that he devoted numerous major and minor tracts to the subject and returned repeatedly to its elaboration throughout his life.¹ Avicenna’s psychological doctrines are stable in their general parameters, but his individual presentations of them differ according to considerations of philosophical intent, generic format, and audience of address.² Like any psychology aspiring to comprehensiveness, Avicenna’s theory addresses four considerations:<br>

In exploring the new image of science that has been developing in the postempiricist philosophy and history of science, we have witnessed the recovery of the hermeneutical dimension of science in both the natural and the social sciences. In the philosophy of the natural sciences, this development has been characterized as having begun with an obsession with the meaning and reference of single terms (logically proper names and ostensive definition), moved to the search for a rigorous criterion for discriminating<br>

  Book Title: The Making of the Humanities-Volume 1- Early Modern Europe<br>
  Publisher: Amsterdam University Press<br>
  Author(s): Weststeijn Thijs<br>
  Abstract: This book is the first step towards the development of a comparative history of the humanities. Specialists in philology, musicology, art history, linguistics, literary theory, and other disciplines highlight the intertwining of the various fields and their impact on the sciences. This first volume in the series The Making of the Humanities focuses on the early modern period. Different perspectives reveal how the humanities developed from the 'liberal arts', via the curriculum of humanistic schools, to modern disciplines. The authors show in particular how discoveries in the humanities contributed to a secular world view, pointing up connections with the scientific revolution. The main themes are: the humanities versus the sciences; the visual arts as liberal arts; humanism and heresy; language and poetics; linguists and logicians; philology and philosophy; the history of history. Contributions come from a selection of internationally renowned European and American scholars, including Floris Cohen, David Cram, and Ingrid Rowland. The book offers a wealth of insights for specialists, students, and those interested in the humanities in a broad sense. This title is available in the OAPEN Library - http://www.oapen.org.<br>

  Book Title: The Children's Table-Childhood Studies and the Humanities<br>
  Publisher: University of Georgia Press<br>
  Author(s): DUANE ANNA MAE<br>
  Abstract: Like the occupants of the children's table at a family dinner, scholars working in childhood studies can seem sidelined from the "adult" labor of humanities scholarship. The Children's Table brings together scholars from architecture, philosophy, law, and literary and cultural criticism to provide an overview of the innovative work being done in childhood studies-a transcript of what is being said at the children's table. Together, these scholars argue for rethinking the academic seating arrangement in a way that acknowledges the centrality of childhood to the work of the humanities. The figure we now recognize as a child was created in tandem with forms of modernity that the Enlightenment generated and that the humanities are now working to rethink. Thus the growth of childhood studies allows for new approaches to some of the most important and provocative issues in humanities scholarship: the viability of the social contract, the definition of agency, the performance of identity, and the construction of gender, sexuality, and race. Because defining childhood is a means of defining and distributing power and obligation, studying childhood requires a radically altered approach to what constitutes knowledge about the human subject. The diverse essays in The Children's Table share a unifying premise: to include the child in any field of study realigns the shape of that field, changing the terms of inquiry and forcing a different set of questions. Taken as a whole, the essays argue that, at this key moment in the state of the humanities, rethinking the child is both necessary and revolutionary.

  Book Title: Moral Evil-  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Flescher Andrew Michael<br>
  Abstract: The idea of moral evil has always held a special place in philosophy and theology because the existence of evil has implications for the dignity of the human and the limits of human action. Andrew M. Flescher proposes four interpretations of evil, drawing on philosophical and theological sources and using them to trace through history the moral traditions that are associated with them.The first model, evil as the presence of badness, offers a traditional dualistic model represented by Manicheanism. The second, evil leading to goodness through suffering, presents a theological interpretation known as theodicy. Absence of badness-that is, evil as a social construction-is the third model. The fourth, evil as the absence of goodness, describes when evil exists in lieu of the good-the "privation" thesis staked out nearly two millennia ago by Christian theologian St. Augustine. Flescher extends this fourth model-evil as privation-into a fifth, which incorporates a virtue ethic. Drawing original connections between Augustine and Aristotle, Flescher's fifth model emphasizes the formation of altruistic habits that can lead us to better moral choices throughout our lives.Flescher eschews the temptation to think of human agents who commit evil as outside the norm of human experience. Instead, through the honing of moral skills and the practice of attending to the needs of others to a greater degree than we currently do, Flescher offers a plausible and hopeful approach to the reality of moral evil.<br>

  Book Title: Philosophy of Communication-  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Butchart Garnet C.<br>
  Abstract: To philosophize is to communicate philosophically. From its inception, philosophy has communicated forcefully. Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle talk a lot, and talk ardently. Because philosophy and communication have belonged together from the beginning--and because philosophy comes into its own and solidifies its stance through communication--it is logical that we subject communication to philosophical investigation. This collection of key works of classical, modern, and contemporary philosophers brings communication back into philosophy's orbit. It is the first anthology to gather in a single volume foundational works that address the core questions, concepts, and problems of communication in philosophical terms. The editors have chosen thirty-two selections from the work of Plato, Leibniz, Hegel, Husserl, Heidegger, Wittgenstein, Benjamin, Lacan, Derrida, Sloterdijk, and others. They have organized these texts thematically, rather than historically, in seven sections: consciousness; intersubjective understanding; language; writing and context; difference and subjectivity; gift and exchange; and communicability and community. Taken together, these texts not only lay the foundation for establishing communication as a distinct philosophical topic but also provide an outline of what philosophy of communication might look like.<br>

  Abstract: To philosophize is to communicate philosophically, and to communicate philosophically is to impart the wisdom of which philosophy speaks and which is spoken at the same time. Would philosophy—ever universalizing and universalized in its claims—be able to stand fast as what it claims to be if it did not impart anything, if it refused to communicate, if it simply remained silent? Even if philosophy managed somehow to keep silent, could this silence be anything other than philosophy’s choice of expression, an expression wisely chosen by philosophy to keep its silence?

It is a question one poses when one no longer has anything to ask for, but its consequences can be considerable. One was asking the question before, one never ceased asking it, but it was too artificial, too abstract; one expounded and dominated the question, more than being grabbed by it.

  Book Title: The Machine Question-Critical Perspectives on AI, Robots, and Ethics<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Gunkel David J.<br>
  Abstract: One of the enduring concerns of moral philosophy is deciding who or what is deserving of ethical consideration. Much recent attention has been devoted to the "animal question" -- consideration of the moral status of nonhuman animals. In this book, David Gunkel takes up the "machine question": whether and to what extent intelligent and autonomous machines of our own making can be considered to have legitimate moral responsibilities and any legitimate claim to moral consideration. The machine question poses a fundamental challenge to moral thinking, questioning the traditional philosophical conceptualization of technology as a tool or instrument to be used by human agents. Gunkel begins by addressing the question of machine moral agency: whether a machine might be considered a legitimate moral agent that could be held responsible for decisions and actions. He then approaches the machine question from the other side, considering whether a machine might be a moral patient due legitimate moral consideration. Finally, Gunkel considers some recent innovations in moral philosophy and critical theory that complicate the machine question, deconstructing the binary agent--patient opposition itself. Technological advances may prompt us to wonder if the science fiction of computers and robots whose actions affect their human companions (think of HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey) could become science fact. Gunkel's argument promises to influence future considerations of ethics, ourselves, and the other entities who inhabit this world.<br>

  Abstract: One of the enduring concerns of moral philosophy is deciding who or what is deserving of ethical consideration. Although initially limited to “other men,” the practice of ethics has developed in such a way that it continually challenges its own restrictions and comes to encompass what had been previously excluded individuals and groups—foreigners, women, animals, and even the environment. Currently, we stand on the verge of another fundamental challenge to moral thinking.

We have, in effect, sought to determine the line dividing who or what is considered a member of the community of moral subjects from who or what remains outside. And we have done so by, as Thomas Birch (1993, 315) explains, assuming “that we can and ought to find, formulate, establish, institute in our practices, a criterion for (a proof schema of) membership in the class of beings that are moral

Its basic definitions and distinctions were regarded as self-evident, and anyone who questioned them was contemptuously ignored as simply not a philosopher of science.

  Abstract: Traditionally, metaphysics searches for essences, but the post-metaphysical quest leans more toward potentials. Martin Heidegger puts it this way: “Higher than actuality lies
                  possibility.” Metaphysics as a branch of philosophy studies the nature of being and beings, existence, time, space, movement, and causality. It also involves underlying principles and theories that form the basis of a particular field of knowledge. Heidegger conceived the primary task of metaphysics as the clarification ofbeingin his book on phenomenological metaphysics,Being and Time. In the analysis of being, he holds that phenomenology and ontology characterize philosophy itself, and that we can best<br>

Ricoeur’s analysis is anchored to the established phenomenological precepts of Kant and Husserl, for in order that metaphor may refer, its transgressive character must ultimately be tamed by the master discourse of philosophy. However, according to Jacques Derrida’s deconstructive practice, the philosopher’s discourse is itself shot through with metaphor. It<br>

Even if there are events legitimately describable as unspeakable, it is hard to see why poetry deserves more opprobrium than any other way of framing them.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjjs1">Social Theory after the Holocaust</a><br>
  Author(s) ADLER JEREMY<br>
  Abstract: There are several worthwhile reasons for considering H.G. Adler in terms of the current debate about the Nazi genocide.¹ Not only did he begin to reflect on the problem of representing these events at an early date when, in 1942, he was deported, but his views, even when not cited, have been deeply implicated in the current discussion, whether because of their role in confrontation with Adorno’s philosophy, or because they are, albeit unwittingly, echoed almost word for word by Zygmunt Bauman in
                  Modernity and the Holocaust.² There is, so to speak, a public side to H.G. Adler’s role in<br>

  Book Title: Varieties of World Making-Beyond Globalization<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): WAGNER PETER<br>
  Abstract: Globalization has been the topic of heated debate in recent years, with one side asserting that it will produce a better standard of living for people around the world, and a fierce opposition arguing that it will ultimately lead to greater poverty and the destruction of unique human cultures. Varieties of World Making tackles the issue from a different angle, proposing that the contemporary global network of business, politics and culture be viewed from the inter-disciplinary perspective of ‘world making’. Drawn from the ranks of sociology, law, international relations, political philosophy and history, the distinguished contributors cut through polarized rhetoric to examine the current global situation. Their proposed diagnoses draw upon thoughtful analyses of various political dilemmas whose ripple effects are felt around the world, such as the volatile relationship between Islam and Europe, or the legal foundations for a true international order absent in the shadows of imperialism. Varieties of World Making will be an essential resource for all those grappling with the complex consequences of globalization for the future.<br>

  Book Title: V. Y. Mudimbe-Undisciplined Africanism<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): FRAITURE PIERRE-PHILIPPE<br>
  Abstract: VY Mudimbe: Undisciplined Africanism is the first English-language monograph dedicated to the work of Valentin Yves Mudimbe. This book charts the intellectual history of the seminal Congolese philosopher, epistemologist, and philologist from the late 1960s to the present day, exploring his major essays and novels. Pierre-Philippe Fraiture highlights Mudimbe’s trajectory through major debates on African nationalism, Panafricanism, neo-colonialism, negritude, pedagogy, Christianisation, decolonisation, anthropology, postcolonial representations, and a variety of other subjects, using these as contexts for close readings of many of Mudimbe’s texts, both influential and lesser-known. The book demonstrates that Mudimbe’s intellectual career has been informed by a series of decisive dialogues with some of the key exponents of Africanism (Herodotus, EW Blyden, Placide Tempels), continental and postcolonial thought (Jean-Paul Sartre, Frantz Fanon, Michel Foucault, and Claude Lévi-Strauss), and African thought and philosophy from Africa and the diaspora (L.S. Senghor, Patrice Nganang, and Achille Mbembe).<br>

  CHAPTER ONE  At death’s door: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjnd2">Thresholds of Meaning</a><br>
  Abstract: In recent years the concepts of rite of passage and, in particular, of liminality have figured prominently in medical and medical-related research, providing useful ways of analysing a range of experiences of illness and disability. With the expansion of the medical humanities and the development of ‘narrative medicine’, medical practitioners have looked to other disciplines – literary analysis, philosophy, history and anthropology – for models and metaphors by which to express the experiences of patients, carers and clinicians. The attraction of the notion of rite of passage is obvious, offering a versatile means of expressing a range of phenomena including:<br>

  Book Title: Heidegger and the Thinking of Place-Explorations in the Topology of Being<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Malpas Jeff<br>
  Abstract: The idea of place--topos--runs through Martin Heidegger's thinking almost from the very start. It can be seen not only in his attachment to the famous hut in Todtnauberg but in his constant deployment of topological terms and images and in the situated, "placed" character of his thought and of its major themes and motifs. Heidegger's work, argues Jeff Malpas, exemplifies the practice of "philosophical topology." In Heidegger and the Thinking of Place, Malpas examines the topological aspects of Heidegger's thought and offers a broader elaboration of the philosophical significance of place. Doing so, he provides a distinct and productive approach to Heidegger as well as a new reading of other key figures--notably Kant, Aristotle, Gadamer, and Davidson, but also Benjamin, Arendt, and Camus. Malpas, expanding arguments he made in his earlier book Heidegger's Topology (MIT Press, 2007), discusses such topics as the role of place in philosophical thinking, the topological character of the transcendental, the convergence of Heideggerian topology with Davidsonian triangulation, the necessity of mortality in the possibility of human life, the role of materiality in the working of art, the significance of nostalgia, and the nature of philosophy as beginning in wonder. Philosophy, Malpas argues, begins in wonder and begins in place and the experience of place. The place of wonder, of philosophy, of questioning, he writes, is the very topos of thinking.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjp35">Heidegger and the Thinking of Place</a><br>
  Abstract: With Heidegger, philosophy seems to have remained in greatness: although Heidegger’s treatment of the question concerning the ground of beings undergoes important shifts in the course of his philosophical career, still the question of ground remains always near the center of his thinking.¹ Heidegger saw the question of ground as the determining question of philosophy—and in this respect the question of ground is one with the question of being²—yet he also saw philosophy as persistently misunderstanding and covering over the true nature of this question or, at least, of what this question contains within it. In this respect,<br>

  Abstract: Adventurous philosophical thought was always at the center of the Pontigny tradition, especially when the philosopher-poet Jean Wahl assumed the direction of Pontigny-en-Amérique after 1942. Wahl invited his favorite American poets, Wallace Stevens and Marianne Moore, along with John Peale Bishop, to speak at Mount Holyoke during the summer of 1943. The topic was to be the relation of poetry and philosophy. Moore lectured on “Feeling and Precision,” carefully choosing her examples of understated eloquence from poetic responses to war. “An unselfish experiment like that of the Pontigny Committee,” she wrote in a letter, “leaves a certain memory of exaltation,<br>

  Book Title: Migrating Texts and Traditions-  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>
  Author(s): Sweet William<br>
  Abstract: There can be little dispute that culture influences philosophy: we see this in the way that classical Greek culture influenced Greek philosophy, that Christianity influenced mediaeval western philosophy, that French culture influenced a range of philosophies in France from Cartesianism to post-modernism, and so on. Yet many philosophical texts and traditions have also been introduced into very different cultures and philosophical traditions than their cultures of origin – through war and colonialization, but also through religion and art, and through commercial relations and globalization. And this raises questions such as: What is it to do French philosophy in Africa, or Analytic philosophy in India, or Buddhist philosophy in North America? This volume examines the phenomenon of the ‘migration’ of philosophical texts and traditions into other cultures, identifies places where it may have succeeded, but also where it has not, and discusses what is presupposed in introducing a text or a tradition into another intellectual culture.<br>

  Introduction: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkchb">Migrating Texts and Traditions</a><br>
  Author(s) Sweet William<br>
  Abstract: It is undeniable that philosophical texts and traditions from one culture are, and have been, found in very different cultures and intellectual milieus. Consider the presence of Buddhist philosophy in China, Korea and Japan—and more recently in North America and Europe. From its birthplace in India, Buddhism spread and developed throughout Asia (as Tibetan but also as East Asian, including Pure Land and Chan/Zen, in Japan and China, and as Seon in Korea), and also in North America—for example, Shambhala. Many philosophies originating in the West seem similarly to have travelled east and south; they have been introduced,<br>

  Chapter 1  The Migration of Aristotelian Philosophy to China in the 17th Century from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkchb">Migrating Texts and Traditions</a><br>
  Author(s) Shen Vincent<br>
  Abstract: Aristotle was the first among the Western philosophers to be systematically introduced into China by the Jesuits in the 17
                     thcentury. The person of Aristotle and Scholastic commentaries on Aristotle’s philosophy were introduced and translated, or better, rewritten, into Chinese. The attempt to systematically introduce Aristotle’s philosophy was one of the missionary projects of Matteo Ricci and his colleagues in China, supposed by them to be a country of philosophers or run by philosophers. We could call this, therefore, the migration of Aristotle’s philosophy from the Western world to another world of philosophers in the East.<br>

  Chapter 3  Putting Islam and ‘The West’ Together Again: from:

  Author(s) Armour Leslie<br>
  Abstract: The voices of reason are often drowned out when the talk turns to the prospects of a ‘clash of civilizations’. M. M. Sharif was one of the two most influential Muslim philosophers of the 20
                     thcentury. Only Mohammed Iqbal (1877–1938), perhaps, equalled him. Sharif was the creator of an original philosophical system, the editor of the most impressive collection of studies on the history of Muslim philosophy, and the founder of the Pakistan Philosophical Congress. Yet he is little heard of now and, indeed, no library in North America or England has a complete set of his works.<br>

  Chapter 4  British Idealism as a Migrating Tradition from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkchb">Migrating Texts and Traditions</a><br>
  Author(s) Sweet William<br>
  Abstract: It has long been recognized that the philosophy of late-19
                  th- and early-20th-century British Idealism had a significant influence in Britain, not only on the philosophical thought of the time, but also on religion, politics and social and public policy.¹ Its impact, however, was felt not only in Britain but throughout much of its empire and even beyond. Recent studies have noted the presence of the work of the British idealists in Canada, Australia and South Africa, and also in the United States, India, Japan and China.² Nevertheless, relatively little has been written concerning precisely how and how far the presence<br>

  Author(s) Duvenage Pieter<br>
  Abstract: The phenomenon of philosophy in the Afrikaans language is the result of social and cultural circumstances that have played themselves out for more than two centuries in South Africa. From the 19
                  thcentury, Afrikaans (and South African) philosophy has been influenced by British Idealism, continental thought (including phenomenology, existentialism, critical theory, hermeneutics, and post-structuralism), Anglo-American conceptual analysis, and philosophies informed by religious traditions, such as Reformational philosophy and Thomism. It is presently also no surprise that philosophers who work on postmodernism, postcolonialism, feminism, analytic philosophy and African philosophy do so by utilizing formulations of other contexts. Consequently, the following questions<br>

  Chapter 6  Heidegger, Japanese Aesthetics, and the Idea of a ‘Dialogue’ between East and West from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkchb">Migrating Texts and Traditions</a><br>
  Author(s) Kobayashi Chinatsu<br>
  Abstract: The story of ‘modern Japanese philosophy’ offers an interesting case study of ‘migration’. The expression covers, roughly, the philosophical output in Japan during the first half of the 20
                  thcentury, including the writings of the Kyoto School, founded around Kitaro Nishida.¹ This modern Japanese philosophy originated in the discovery by the Japanese of the Western philosophical tradition during the closing decades of the 19thcentury. There had been until then no knowledge of the latter and no recognizably independent Japanese tradition of philosophy. However, from the time of Kukai, Shinran and Dogen, there had been no lack of religious discourse<br>

  Chapter 7  Hermeneutics and the Migration of Philosophical Traditions in East Asia from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkchb">Migrating Texts and Traditions</a><br>
  Author(s) Huang Cristal<br>
  Abstract: Among the European philosophical traditions that have a presence in East Asia, continental philosophy and especially hermeneutics have a particularly strong following. Beginning in the mid-1980s, for example, a number of major Western texts—by Walter Benjamin, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Paul Ricoeur and Richard Rorty—became available in Chinese translation, and this interest shows no sign of abating.² In the present essay, I want to look at how those texts that focus on hermeneutics have been introduced, and arguably have migrated, into the East Asian milieu (specifically that of Taiwan) and ask how it is that the hermeneutical method has come<br>

  Abstract: Scholars in diaspora carry their texts with them—as many texts as possible—to preserve their cultural and intellectual tradition when they are threatened by political forces and military invasions. The Tibetan scholars who fled Tibet in 1959 managed to bring out a large number of classic texts central to the Mahayana Buddhist philosophy and religion of pre-invasion Tibet. Among these texts was an old Indian Buddhist work on ethics, Śāntideva’s

  Abstract: Many reflective persons today continue to investigate the deceptive nature of language. In the particular case of philosophy’s perennial struggles with religion, language continues to be at the centre of much critical attention. For without sustained and careful attention to the vagaries of language, taking the critical measure of the sense and significance of the dynamic relations between religious experience and its quite various reflective articulations cannot be satisfactory.²<br>

  Abstract: This chapter explores the development of the concept of autonomous reason within the Islamic tradition, with special emphasis on the philosophers of Al Andalus—those of the Iberian peninsula and the region of the Languedoc, following the Omayyad Muslim conquest from the 8
                  thcentury. The chapter draws attention to important parallels that may show instances of the influence of their thinking during the European Renaissance and the Enlightenment as seen in the philosophical works of Descartes, Rousseau and Kant. After pointing out a number of similarities and possible influences, I also note the fact that Western philosophy after the Renaissance<br>

  Chapter 14  Radhakrishnan and the Construction of Philosophical Dialogue across Cultural Traditions from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkchb">Migrating Texts and Traditions</a><br>
  Author(s) Leighton Denys P.<br>
  Abstract: Many humanities and social science scholars today are committed to, or at any rate, pay lip service to ideals of interdisciplinarity and methodological cross-fertilization. In light of this fact, it is remarkable that there should be so little dialogue between historians of philosophy (including those who study political and religious philosophy) and intellectual historians, particularly with respect to study of ‘non-Western’ thought systems or world views. A common tendency among intellectual historians today is to reduce history of philosophy to a minor province of philosophical hermeneutics. The increasingly ahistorical philosophical hermeneuticists, in turn, usually prioritize exposition and internal analysis of<br>

  Abstract: In

The editors have also included essays by nine dancer-scholars who examine qualitative and quantitative inquiry and delineate the most common approaches for investigating dance, raising concerns about philosophy and aesthetics, historical scholarship, movement analysis, sexual and gender identification, cultural diversity, and the resources available to students. The writers have included study questions, research exercises, and suggested readings to facilitate the book's use as a classroom text.<br>

  Abstract: Leading scholars in the fields of philosophy and the sciences of the mind have contributed to this newest volume in the prestigious Pittsburgh-Konstanz series. Among the problem areas discussed are folk psychology, meanings as conceptual structures, functional and qualitative properties of colors, the role of conscious mental states, representation and mental content, the impact of connectionism on the philosophy of the mind, and supervenience, emergence, and realization. Most of the essays are followed by commentaries that reflect ongoing debates in the philosophy of the mind and often develop a counterpoint to the claims of the essayists.<br>

  Author(s) Machamer Peter<br>
  Abstract: One of the chief characteristics of contemporary philosophy of mind consists in the orientation toward the sciences of the mind. This feature stands in marked contrast to traditional philosophy of mind whose primary allegiance was to philosophy of language. Linguistic analysis was supposed to clarify what could sensibly be meant by the ascription of mental states. The issue was what sort of talk about the mental has a clear meaning and what, by contrast, is to be considered meaningless. This type of philosophical approach to the mind has now gone out of fashion. It was replaced by a science-based approach<br>

  Author(s) van Gelder Tim<br>
  Abstract: After connectionism burst into prominence in cognitive science in mid-1980s, one of the most popular questions among philosophers of cognitive science was: what implications does it have for the philosophy of mind? (See, e.g., Horgan and Tienson 1991; Ramsey, Stich, and Rumelhart, 1991). Ten years later, it seems that the verdict is in. If we suppose that the term
                  connectionismrefers to some reasonably coherent research program standing as an alternative to mainstream computational cognitive science, then connectionism hasnointeresting implications for cognitive science. This is because there is, in fact,no suchthing. There are lots of connectionist<br>

  Author(s) Grünbaum Adolf<br>
  Abstract: In 1975, I was engaged in a systematic scrutiny of Karl Popper’s falsificationist conception of scientific rationality. The purported unfalsifiability of psychoanalytic theory by any potential empirical evidence was the avowed centerpiece of his case against the ‘inductivist’ tradition in the philosophy of science. Prompted by my strong hunch that Popper’s appraisal of psychoanalysis was simplistic, I began to study the very large Freudian corpus systematically from scratch in 1975.<br>

  Abstract: The horror film genre is part of the foundation of Tim Burton’s personality and body of work. His philosophy of life and film is partly shaped by the possibilities he has long seen in the realm of dark cinematic fantasy. As a child, Burton saw in horror films and writing an inventive escape from drudgery and an outlet for aggressive or antisocial tendencies. In particular, he was captivated by the work of Vincent Price and Roger Corman, who brought the stories and poems of Edgar Allan Poe to big-screen life in the 1960s.

  Abstract: Metaphysics can be described as the branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of being, existence, and reality. Epistemology, another fundamental branch of philosophy, is intimately tied to metaphysics because it deals with the nature of knowledge: to talk about what is, one must speak of knowing what is, just as one cannot know something is without also positing that it is. The central questions of metaphysics are, What is it? and How is it? and they necessarily involve, How do I know this? or Can I know that?

  Abstract: Although
                  Hadji Murad(1896–1904) is, as we have seen, a story in which violence seems indivisible from fiction, Tolstoy spent most of the years of its authorship developing, publicizing, and trying to live by the precepts of his religious philosophy. His most important work espousing nonviolence in these years wasThe Kingdom of God Is within You(1893). Nonviolence united Tolstoy’s dreams for a communal brotherhood of man with his increasingly strident opposition to the government and Russian Orthodox church. Was Tolstoy a hypocrite for preaching nonviolence while simultaneously writing sometimes lurid violent fiction? No, not in the ordinary<br>

In choosing this subject for its centennial occasion, the Committee for the Terry Lectures has highlighted an issue that is both ancient and modern, exquisitely complex and painfully simple. The one certainty that we share with our intellectual forebears in this matter is the need for well-considered dialogue. For both Cicero and David Hume (

  Abstract: Talk of the relations between “science” and “religion” first became audible in the early 1800s, about the time that students of nature began referring to their work as science rather than natural philosophy (or natural history). Because natural philosophy allowed its practitioners, in the words of Isaac Newton, to discourse about God “from the appearances of things,” one searches almost in vain for references to “natural philosophy and religion.” Some writers expressed concern about tension between faith and reason, but they never pitted religion against science.¹<br>

  Abstract: Cassirer thought of culture anthropologically as the entire complex of human modes of meaning and existence: it encompassed science, technology, language, and social life in addition to art, religion, and philosophy. This conception of culture and Cassirer's theory of symbolism anticipated much of later cultural theory. In this collection of essays, eminent Cassirer scholars examine the many different aspects of his thinking on this subject and demonstrate how pioneering and important it is to cultural studies.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vm6hh">Symbolic Forms and Cultural Studies</a><br>
  Author(s) DUPRÉ LOUIS<br>
  Abstract: Ernst Cassirer’s philosophy of culture steered philosophical thought in a new direction. In contrast to both the unmediated unity of being in traditional metaphysics and the epistemic unity of the transcendental subject in modern, critical philosophy, his theory of cultural symbols assumes the object of philosophical reflection to be irreducibly pluralist. His approach raises two fundamental questions. First, is the philosophy of symbolic forms a substitute for metaphysics or does it require a metaphysical foundation to remain consistent with its own principles? Second, how can it discuss contingent matters, such as the historical process of culture, without losing its philosophical<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vm6hh">Symbolic Forms and Cultural Studies</a><br>
  Author(s) HOLQUIST MICHAEL<br>
  Abstract: Whatever else one might say about him, Ernst Cassirer would seem indubitably to be a modern philosopher, not only in the contingency of his birth, but in the nature of his concerns. Like so many modernist artists, he is consumed by a passion to understand relations rather than things; thus it is not surprising that
                  The Philosophy of Symbolic Formsis a philosophy of culture. Not merely because its basic analytic tool is semiotic of a particular kind, but because of the urgency one senses on every page to connect regions that otherwise are in danger of falling into isolation<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vm6hh">Symbolic Forms and Cultural Studies</a><br>
  Author(s) LOFTS STEVE<br>
  Abstract: It is often forgotten that Cassirer’s “critique of culture” entails a “critique of the subject” of culture: for culture exists only insofar as an individual subject actively engages with other subjects in its continual construction and reconstruction. For the most part, however, Cassirer speaks about the subject of culture in the most general and abstract of terms: it is the anonymous force of the “energy of
                  Geist” that constitutes the cultural world. The task of the philosophy of symbolic forms, as a “critique of culture,” as a philosophy of Geist, is to establish the structure of the different forms of<br>

  Author(s) BISHOP PAUL<br>
  Abstract: At first glance, the differences between the philosophy of Ernst Cassirer and the psychology of C. G. Jung would seem to outweigh any affinities.¹ To begin with, the one was a philosopher who taught in university departments, the other a psychologist with no philosophical training and a practice to run. (One of the most important philosophical sources for Jung was the second edition of the
                  Allgemeines Handwörterbuch der philosophischen Wissenschaften[1832] by Wilhelm Traugott Krug [1770–1842], a distinctly popular, if famous, work.) As far as personal background and education are concerned, Cassirer was born of factory-owning, Jewish parents in<br>

  Author(s) FREUDENTHAL GIDEON<br>
  Abstract: The title of this essay is intended to express, first, the claim that Cassirer’s project is indeed philosophical and systematic (and not merely historical); second, that this philosophy has a core principle; and third, that this core is not elaborated nor applied to the cultural material which it was supposed to explain. Thus Cassirer’s oeuvre shows, on the one hand, the blueprint of a systematic historical epistemology and, on the other hand, the material which should have been interpreted and explained by this epistemology. The material is ordered so as to suggest a progressive epistemic development, but Cassirer nowhere applies<br>

  Author(s) FRIEDMAN MICHAEL<br>
  Abstract: The Davos disputation between Martin Heidegger and Ernst Cassirer in 1929 is of course well known to all students of Cassirer. What is perhaps not so well known is the way in which the Davos disputation can be seen as a watershed in the development of twentieth-century philosophy more generally and, in particular, in the evolving split between analytic and continental philosophical traditions. For it turns out that Rudolf Carnap (a leading representative of the Vienna Circle of logical empiricists) attended the Davos disputation, took a very serious interest in Heidegger and

  Abstract: Let’s try to imagine philology as the ground of literary and cultural studies. Philology, not philosophy, because philology’s horizon is not a history of ideas but an institutional and programmatic history. And not philology as Wilamowitz presented it to Nietz sche, or as post-Nietzscheans expelled it from humane studies, but Philology in a New Key—a new arrangement of that canonical discipline so neglected after the nineteenth century.¹ Those huddled, dryasdust positivists are yearning to be free.<br>

  Abstract: Just about a hundred years before Lyotard and the Paris VIII philosophy department tried to reform both the theory and practice of humanities education and knowledge research, a famous controversy broke out in Germany around the same issues. The publication of Nietzsche’s
                  The Birth of Tragedy(1872) provoked Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff to a sharp attack—at once witty, trenchant, and ad hominem.

  Abstract: From the later Unamuno’s perspective, science holds a position of primacy in European culture, a fact that permanently distances Spain from Europe. The “tragic feeling of life” results from the most difficult question ever to face philosophy: how to justify its pursuit of reason as a worthy facet of a life well lived. For Unamuno, reason alone can provide only intellectual, not emotive or spiritual, fulfillment: “el más trágico problema de la filosofía es el de conciliar las necesidades intelectuales con las necesidades afectivas y con las volitivas”

  Book Title: A Jesuit Garden in Beijing and Early Modern Chinese Culture-  Publisher: Purdue University Press<br>
  Author(s): Zou Hui<br>
  Abstract: In this volume, Hui Zou analyzes historical, architectural, visual, literary, and philosophical perspectives on the Western-styled garden that formed part of the great Yuanming Yuan complex in Beijing, constructed during the Qing dynasty. Designed and built in the late eighteenth century by Italian and French Jesuits, the garden described in this book was a wonderland of multistoried buildings, fountains, labyrinths, and geometrical hills. It even included an open-air theater. Through detailed examination of historical literature and representations, Zou analyzes the ways in which the Jesuits accommodated their design within the Chinese cultural context. He shows how an especially important element of their approach was the application of a linear perspective—the “line-method”—to create the jing, the Chinese concept of the bounded bright view of a garden scene. Hui Zou’s book demonstrates how Jesuit metaphysics fused with Chinese cosmology and broadens our understanding of cultural and religious encounters in early Chinese modernity. It presents an intriguing reflection on the interaction between Western metaphysics and the poetical tradition of Chinese culture. The volume will be of interest to scholars and students in a variety of fields, including literature, philosophy, architecture, landscape and urban studies, and East-West comparative cultural studies.<br>

First, it presents two of Nietzsche’s own explications of his philosophy, one taken from his early writings, the other from one of his later works. The interpretation of these presentations will show the continuity of Nietzsche’s self-conception and will adumbrate the specific themes that will later be discussed in separate chapters. Second, it depicts the life of Nietzsche as the philosopher who said that “every great philosophy so far has been … the personal confession of its author and a kind of involuntary and unconscious memoir” (BGE 6).

  Author(s) Tihanov Galin<br>
  Abstract: Gustav Gustavovich Shpet (1879-1937) has emerged as one of the most prominent Russian philosophers of the twentieth century. The principle promoter of Husserlian phenomenology, at the same time creatively modifying Husserl and at times departing from him, Shpet was also an early advocate of hermeneutics. He left behind seminal work spanning philosophy, aesthetics, psychology, literary and theater theory, and the history of Russian thought. Significantly, many of his concerns anticipate preoccupations that have dominated the discourses of cultural theory and the philosophy of language over the last few decades.<br>

  Abstract: Recollecting the heady atmosphere at the Moscow University before WWI when belonging to a particular camp of contemporary German philosophy was

This cryptic remark (Shpet's name is not mentioned again inSafe Conduct) caught my attention for several reasons. The first is quite trivial: when writing his autobiographical novel, Pasternak could not have known that his then-seven-year-old son Evgenii—whimsically compared in the book to the philosopher Hermann Cohen—would once upon a time marry Shpet's granddaughter Elena.

  Author(s) Scanlan James P.<br>
  Abstract: Gustav Shpet's historical essays on philosophy in Russia occupy a special place in the study of that subject. Neither a Marxist nor a defender of the prominent religious tradition in Russian thought, Shpet saw little philosophical merit in the earlier figures most esteemed by those dominant groups. He approached his country's philosophy with a fresh and highly critical eye, and if his essays dismayed both the social radicals and the religious thinkers, it was because he managed to provide a valuable new picture of Russian thought from a perspective that sought to avoid their established orthodoxies.<br>

  Author(s) Cassedy Steven<br>
  Abstract: Gustav Shpet was one of a number of Husserl's disciples who took some of phenomenology's central principles and applied them to language theory and aesthetics. Much of the value of Shpet's contribution to philosophy derives from his introduction of phenomenology into his own country. But even though he knowingly proposed certain significant modifications to Husserl's thought, an examination of some of his major writings on language and aesthetics leads one to suspect that Shpet, apparently without knowing it, gave his own slant to those parts that he thought he was merely interpreting and passing on.

  Abstract: Already in the early 1900s, we find references to Husserl in Russian philosophical literature. N.O. Losskii mentioned him in his 1906 work

Shpet's mentor in Kiev and later Moscow, G.I. Chelpanov, a keen observer of contemporary developments abroad in philosophy and psychology, had already presented in 1900 a relatively brief synopsis of Husserl's 1891 treatisePhilosophy of Arithmetic.

For all his inclination towards rigorous scientific categorization Shpet always ties theory to practice.

His philosophy is never autotelic; he unremittingly strives to explain the objective phenomena of the world. In hisOutline of the Development of Russian<br>

  Abstract: The works of Gustav Shpet and the Bakhtin Circle (most notably Mikhail Bakhtin and Valentin Voloshinov) represent two of the most important episodes in the Russian reception of the so-called linguistic turn in philosophy. Each recognized the paucity of systematized thought in Russian philosophy of the period and was dissatisfied with the intuitive, even mystical manner with which language was understood. While nineteenth-century Russian philology reached considerable heights, philosophical reflections on language had developed largely within the bounds of Orthodox theology and this continued to shape the spirit of secular debates on language in the twentieth century and to endow<br>

  Abstract: Representations of the Holocaust in literature raise some problems that do not emerge when dealing with other historical events—at least not so obviously. On the one hand, we are faced with problems of methods and the cultural consequences of historical representation; on the other hand, there are questions related to certain claims made by scholars of contemporary philosophy of history, asserting the relative character of historical representation. According to this relativist perspective—expressed most clearly in Hayden White's "metahistory"—any kind of historical narrative is legitimate, or more precisely, there is no external viewpoint from which any of these<br>

  Author(s): Maraldo John C.<br>
  Abstract: With
      Japanese Philosophy: A Sourcebook,readers of English can now access in a single volume the richness and diversity of Japanese philosophy as it has developed throughout history. Leading scholars in the field have translated selections from the writings of more than a hundred philosophical thinkers from all eras and schools of thought, many of them available in English for the first time.TheSourcebookeditors have set out to represent the entire Japanese philosophical tradition-not only the broad spectrum of academic philosophy dating from the introduction of Western philosophy in the latter part of the nineteenth century, but also the philosophical ideas of major Japanese traditions of Buddhism, Confucianism, and Shinto. The philosophical significance of each tradition is laid out in an extensive overview, and each selection is accompanied by a brief biographical sketch of its author and helpful information on placing the work in its proper context. The bulk of the supporting material, which comprises nearly a quarter of the volume, is given to original interpretive essays on topics not explicitly covered in other chapters: cultural identity, samurai thought, women philosophers, aesthetics, bioethics.An introductory chapter provides a historical overview of Japanese philosophy and a discussion of the Japanese debate over defining the idea of philosophy, both of which help explain the rationale behind the design of the Sourcebook. An exhaustive glossary of technical terminology, a chronology of authors, and a thematic index are appended. Specialists will find information related to original sources and sinographs for Japanese names and terms in a comprehensive bibliography and general index.Handsomely presented and clearly organized for ease of use,Japanese Philosophy: A Sourcebookwill be a cornerstone in Japanese studies for decades to come. It will be an essential reference for anyone interested in traditional or contemporary Japanese culture and the way it has shaped and been shaped by its great thinkers over the centuries.24 illus.<br>

  Abstract: The idea that people of different cultures actually think differently has been slow to find its way into the heart of western philosophy. Over the past century or so, anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists, and cognitive scientists have often examined this issue and compared results. But until recently, the majority of philosophers in the West have exempted themselves from the debate, often assuming that philosophy’s kind of thinking is universal and transcultural. Others have claimed to the contrary that philosophy is so distinctively western an enterprise that there is little point to look for it elsewhere. In either case, “nonwestern philosophy” is<br>

  Abstract: Yamazaki Ansai was both the most faithful and virtually unquestioning exponent of Zhu Xi’s neo-Confucian philosophy in Tokugawa Japan as well as a later pioneer of a syncretistic religious-philosophical system affirming the fundamental unity of neo-Confucianism and Shinto. Compared to the perfection of Zhu Xi’s work, other forms of neo-Confucianism seemed to him incomplete, shallow, or distorted. These criticisms, reiterated by his disciples, carried over to thinkers like Hayashi Razan* who drew on authors critical of Zhu Xi.<br>

  Author(s) Banzan Kumazawa<br>
  Abstract: A major Japanese advocate of the neo-Confucian philosophy of Wang Yangming, Kumazawa Banzan gravitated from the metaphysical toward more practical, sociopolitical, and economic applications of that intuitive, mind-centered system. Rather than the doctrinal innovations, often very spiritual in nature, advanced by his teacher, Nakae Tōju*, Banzan’s major works,
                  Questions and Answers on the Great Learning and Japanese Writings on Accumulating Righteousness, spell out his conviction that a true philosophy is one that can be applied to the real and pressing issues of the day. Banzan took his philosophical commitment to practical political concerns seriously and continued to speak out even<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wqg76">Japanese Philosophy</a><br>
  Author(s) Naokata Satō<br>
  Abstract: Sato Naokata was one of the most orthodox advocates of Zhu Xi’s neo-Confucian philosophy in the early eighteenth century. Born in southwestern Japan, he studied neo-Confucianism with Yamazaki Ansai* in Kyoto, at a time when the latter was still a fervent exponent of orthodox Zhu Xi learning. When Ansai later developed his synthesis of Shinto and neo-Confucianism, Naokata broke with him. Indeed, Naokata emerged thereafter as one of the harshest and most sarcastic critics of Shinto and its chauvinistic hyperbole about the superiority of Japan vis-à-vis all other countries. Instead of worshiping his native land, he emphasized his sense of<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wqg76">Japanese Philosophy</a><br>
  Author(s) Sorai Ogyū<br>
  Abstract: Ogyū Sorai formulated one of the most politically oriented, authoritarian statements of Confucian philosophy to emerge from Japan. While claiming to do little more than offer a systematic exposition of the meanings of philosophical terms in the Six Classics, texts that he purportedly took as an absolute standard for all sociopolitical discourse, he in fact set forth a philosophical vision that would be highly useful to a ruling elite eager to have its policies accepted by all as sacred. At every turn, we see Sorai extolling the “early kings” of ancient China as sages who formulated a ⌜Way⌝ that later<br>

  Abstract: Sontoku was not a Confucian as such.

  Abstract: Modern Academic Philosophy in Japan began with disputations about the meaning and scope of the very term
                  philosophy. The word and the discipline it designated entered Japan in the mid-nineteenth century as part of an enormous influx of knowledge and technology as the country opened its borders more widely to the West and the rest of the world, after more than two hundred years of relative isolation. The upheaval in social and political institutions led to the collapse of the government and the eventual rise of an imperial power with global reach. Japan’s intellectual traditions were likewise challenged by their<br>

  Author(s) Amane Nishi<br>
  Abstract: Nishi Amane is known for his pioneering work in introducing European philosophy and other disciplines into Japan. Born in the Tsuwano domain (presentday Tsuwano town in Shimane Prefecture), he was educated in Zhu Xi philosophy at a domain school for samurai youth, but later began to sympathize deeply with the thought of Ogyū Sorai,* a critic of the Zhu Xi School. Nishi learned Dutch and English in Edo (present-day Tokyo) and translated western texts for Tokugawa ⌜shogunate⌝ officials.

  Abstract: Nakae Chōmin (Nakae Tokusuke) was a journalist, an advocate of natural rights, free thinker, and politician. From 1862, he began to study “Western Learning” and the French language. As part of a government mission to Europe, he lived in France from 1871 to 1874, during which time he studied law, philosophy, history, and literature. After returning to Japan he opened his own school for French language studies, and undertook a translation of Rousseau’s

  Author(s) Tetsujirō Inoue<br>
  Abstract: Inoue Tetsujirō was one of the most important figures in the formation of philosophy as an academic discipline in Japan. His concern with the confusion surrounding philosophical concepts and categories in the Meiji period prompted him to compile several dictionaries of philosophy. He studied in Germany from 1884 to 1890 under Eduard von Hartmann, after which he assumed a post at Tokyo University, which he held until retirement in 1923. During those years he was active in philosophical discussions, served as president of the Philosophical Society, and exerted a powerful role as ideologue for the Meiji government.<br>

  Abstract: Inoue Enryō was probably the most influential and prolific Buddhist theorist of the Meiji period. He was expected to become a priest in the True ⌜Pure Land⌝ sect of Buddhism, but after studying philosophy in Tokyo, decided to go his own way. He traveled widely throughout Japan and its colonies, delivering thousands of lectures in village and town halls, and journeyed around the world three times.

  Abstract: Ōnishi Hajime, philosopher, Christian apologist and social critic, studied theology at Dōshisha Eigakkō (present-day Dōshisha University) from 1877 to 1884, and then philosophy at Tokyo Imperial University from 1885 to 1889. He subsequently lectured on philosophy, ethics, aesthetics, and logic at Tōkyō Senmon Gakkō (present-day Waseda University).

  Abstract: Because of the important place it is recognized to have in the intellectual history of Japan, the Kyoto School has been extracted from the rest of twentieth-century philosophy for special treatment. Nishida Kitarō* and the circle of thinkers he inspired at the University of Kyoto are often considered Japan’s first original philosophers in the modern sense of the term, and have become known as a bridge between East and West. While their originality and their faithfulness to disparate traditions remain matters of dispute, their impact on philosophical discussions within Japan and outside the country is unquestioned.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wqg76">Japanese Philosophy</a><br>
  Author(s) Kitarō Nishida<br>
  Abstract: Nishida Kitarō, generally considered Japan’s greatest academic philosopher, made it his lifelong task to wed the spiritual awareness cultivated through a decade of Zen practice with modern philosophy. From Zen he had come to appreciate the living unity of experience that precedes dichotomies of mind and body, subject and object; in western philosophy he recognized the importance of logical thinking, the critical examination of preconceptions, and a comprehensive vision of the world. Beginning with the experiment of his maiden work,

  Author(s) Hajime Tanabe<br>
  Abstract: Tanabe Hajime was first drawn to philosophy through his study of mathematics and the natural sciences. His early work on the philosophy of science brought him into contact with the neo-Kantians, which inspired him to rethink Kant’s transcendental logic in the light of Husserl’s phenomenology, Bergson’s vitalism, and the original philosophy of Nishida Kitaro*. After Nishida invited him to join the faculty at Kyoto University, he was able to fulfill his dream of studying in Europe. Although quickly disillusioned with Husserl, he was befriended by the young Heidegger.<br>

  Abstract: Mutai Risaku, a peripheral figure of the Kyoto School, was first attracted to psychology, but during his time under Nishida Kitarō* at Kyoto University he was persuaded to secure a solid basis in philosophy from Kant to the present day. In 1923 he took a post at Ōtani University, leaving three years later for studies in France and Germany, where he worked for a time directly under Husserl. He later taught at Taipei Imperial University before assuming a post at the Tokyo University of Education in 1932.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wqg76">Japanese Philosophy</a><br>
  Author(s) Masaaki Kōsaka<br>
  Abstract: Less a metaphysician than a historian of philosophy, Kōsaka Masaaki was concerned with the continuity between “nation and culture” in the historical world. This shows up in his 1937 work
                  The Historical World, where he focused on Hegel’s civil society and the role of the nation in the philosophy of history, as well as on Marx’s idea of class, all the while maintaining the neo-Kantian personalist standpoint he had elaborated previously. A disciple of Nishida Kitarō* (on whose thought he later published a splendid introductory volume), Kōsaka pursued this perspective not only in his reading of Nishida’s philosophy of the<br>

  Abstract: Nishitani Keiji was born 27 February 1900 in a small town on the Japan Sea. He was fourteen when his father died of tuberculosis, a disease from which Nishitani himself suffered as a young man. As a high-school student, Nishitani was attracted to Zen through the writings of D.T. Suzuki* and at the same time read widely in western sources out side the curriculum.

  Abstract: Kōyama Iwao’s broad interests in philosophy—ranging from history, society, and politics to logic, education, and ethics—reflect his education at Kyoto University, where he studied under such illustrious figures as Nishida Kitarō,* Tanabe Hajime*, Watsuji Tetsurō*, and Hatano Seiichi*. Unlike many in the Kyoto School tradition, Iwao wrote in a clear and elegant prose, making his writings accessible to those not familiar with the unusual jargon of his colleagues.

  Abstract: Takeuchi Yoshinori was born in 1913 in the northern city of Sendai, Japan. He studied philosophy under Tanabe Hajime*, concentrating on Hegel’s
                  Phenomenology of Mindand then broadening out to other major German philosophers of the nineteenth century. As a graduate student he also worked under Nishitani Keiji*, Tanabe’s successor to the chair at Kyoto University. Takeuchi’s philosophical interests were balanced by an interest in early Buddhism, particularly as he found it in the writings of Ui Hakuju and Watsuji Tetsurō*.

  Author(s) Kōichi Tsujimura<br>
  Abstract: Tsujimura Kōichi studied philosophy at Kyoto University under Tanabe Hajime,* and went on to assume his teacher’s chair from 1948 until retiring in 1982. More formative for his thinking, however, was the Zen he practiced with Hisamatsu Shin’ichi,* coupled with the thought of Martin Heidegger, whom he knew personally from travels in Germany. His translations and essays often elucidated Zen texts and Heidegger’s thought in the light of one another to introduce novel interpretations of both. For example, Tsujimura translated Heidegger’s term

  Abstract: In Japan the category “twentieth-century philosophy” is reserved by and large for philosophical thought as it is found in Europe and the United States, and for Japanese engagement with it. When writing of their own intellectual history, Japanese scholars tend to follow the same divisions as Japanese history in general. This means that philosophers of the past hundred years are located either in the imperial era in which they flourished (Meiji, Taishō, Shōwa, Heisei); in their relationship to Japanese “modernity” (the establishment of Japan as a modern nation dating from the

  Abstract: Ōmori Shōzō graduated from Tokyo Imperial University in 1944 with a degree in physics, but in order to grasp theoretical issues related to science, he gradually became interested in philosophy. After the war, in 1949, he received a degree in philosophy from Tokyo University. Initially he studied phenomenology, but he was unsatisfied with this and went to the United States to study Wittgenstein and Anglo-American analytical philosophy of language. In 1966, he became a professor of philosophy at Tokyo University. Throughout his philosophical career, Ōmori focused on questioning conventional views of science and metaphysics, which he considered so focused on<br>

  Author(s) Bin Kimura<br>
  Abstract: Perhaps no thinker in twentieth-century Japan better represents the interface between psychology and philosophy than Kimura Bin. While maintaining his psychiatric practice and publishing widely on abnormal psychology, particularly on schizophrenia and depersonalization, his wider philosophical interests are evident from his early works. In foray after foray into the mysteries of the self—its construction and its breakdown, its awareness and its scotosis—Kimura is not an armchair philosopher but a doctor engaged in the experiences of his patients. If there is one constant theme running through his reading of twentieth-century philosophers, it is the conviction that a true phenomenology<br>

  Author(s) Wataru Hiromatsu<br>
  Abstract: Hiromatsu Wataru obtained his doctorate in philosophy from Tokyo University and went on to teach philosophy there for many years. He is well known for his novel interpretation of Marx’s concept of reification. In particular, he believed that Georg Lukács’s treatment of this concept presupposed a duality between subject and object, which Hiromatsu believed was misleading. Hence in his own philosophical work, he constantly attempts to show how objects or phenomena are always already mediated. In the selection included below we see how he constantly shows how so-called objective phenomena are mediated by the subjects and thus appear to lead<br>

They had no clear agenda, either political or intellectual. Mainly, they wanted to explore what “modernity” means: its roots in Europe, its impact on Japan, and its meaning for the future.

  Abstract: The question of whether there is such a thing as samurai philosophy, and if so, what it might consist of, is one of the more complex issues in Japanese intellectual history. This is primarily due to developments that occurred during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and which are still inextricably linked to current discussions of the question. From the 1890s onward, a romanticized image of the samurai emerged, motivated by cultural and political currents at the time. The major lasting effect of this idealization was the idea that “warrior thought” represented an independent and relatively homogeneous intellectual tradition<br>

  Abstract: Ōnishi Yoshinori taught aesthetics at the University of Tokyo from 1922 until his retirement in 1949. As his voluminous writings reflect, he specialized in German aesthetics from the Romantics through Kant to twentieth-century phenomenology.

  Author(s) Lara María Pía<br>
  Abstract: Today democracy is almost universally acclaimed as the criterion of legitimacy for political systems. The consensus regarding its worth is the result of painful historical experiences in this century. The revival of political philosophy in academic circles reflects a need to rethink some basic issues concerning what democracy is and how it should be conceived. Political philosophers are discussing whether democracy is merely a form of government, or a political way of life, and how proceduralism relates to questions concerning the good, or if it is even capable of dealing with such substantial issues.

The works of Confucius and of John Dewey contain robust concepts of the public good. But in the controversial work of Richard Rorty, the idea of the public good undergoes a radical transformation.

With the discovery of America, it is said, modernity comes into being, and the Middle Ages end. A traditional view images the Middle Ages as a period during which human beings stood crucified between the small piece of land where they were born (and where they would, in all probability, die) and the heaven toward which both their thoughts and their soul were directed.

  Author(s) Gethmann-Siefert Annemarie<br>
  Abstract: If we treat the question of to what extent art can be an interpretation of our world, self-concept, and historical forms of life by referring to Hegel, it seems that we come to a dead end. The authoritative and original place for a connection between art and interpretation in the traditional philosophy of aesthetics is at best the aesthetics of reception. Its traditional version relies on the basic assumption that a piece of art is constituted each time in its reception, that is, in the multiple, historically varying interpretations of its meaning and sense.¹ Even a discussion of the impact<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wrd67">Interpretation</a><br>
  Author(s) Gjesdal Kristin<br>
  Abstract: Over the past twenty years, there has been an increasing interest in the relation between Donald Davidson’s theory of radical interpretation and Hans-Georg Gadamer’s philosophical hermeneutics. Whereas some of this interest has been geared toward the intellectual horizon and heritage of Davidson’s work,¹ philosophers such as Richard Rorty and John McDowell have taken Gadamer’s hermeneutics to suggest a possible avenue beyond what they perceive to be the limitations of Davidson’s theory.² This essay approaches the Davidson-Gadamer relation from a different point of view. My concern is not to ask about the proper location or possible limitations of Davidson’s philosophy, but<br>

  Abstract: Reflection on olfactory and gustatory perceptions and their epistemological status has not been playing a major role in the philosophical tradition. Most classical philosophers deal with the senses of smell and taste rather parenthetically and with a sense of flippancy—if at all.¹ Sometimes philosophical texts cite phenomena of smell and taste where exemplification in factually unrelated, particularly abstract contexts is needed²—as if the difficulties of abstraction might be evened out by choosing examples from an area of life that is surrounded by a sense of light-heartedness and concreteness.

It arose out of a paper delivered to a conference entitled “Romanticism, Environment, Crisis” organized by the Centre for Romantic Studies at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, in 2006, and its main aim is to consider the nature and extent of the relevance of Romantic thinking about nature, particularly that associated with the English Romantic poets, to our contemporary ecological “crisis.” In pursuing this theme, it takes issue with simplistic interpretations of the nature philosophy attributed to Romanticism by some environmentalists.

  Abstract: It could appear that the work of Luce Irigaray bears little relevance to environmental thought.¹ Irigaray is a feminist philosopher of sexual difference, after all, and the injustices that concern her are explicitly social and political. Most prominently, her work has sought to undermine the dominance of masculine culture by exposing the systematic exclusion of women from psychoanalytic theory and traditional Western philosophy; to discover positive forms of feminine subjectivity; and to imagine social and political relationships that advance beyond masculine monism and inaugurate a “culture of two subjects”—man and woman in their irreducible difference.² And yet, as we<br>

  Abstract: Gilles Deleuze (often in collaboration with Félix Guattari) sought to move analytic philosophy and theoretical psychoanalysis beyond “abstraction” and toward a “transcendental empiricism” already present in earlier philosophic work. This remarkable combination of traditionalism and innovation describes a state elusively beyond any linguistic epistemology—yet resident in any experiential event—and offers a method to capture individual experience of “pure immanence.”¹ The emphasis Deleuze placed on event and experience stimulated the energetic analysis of their interrelations by Alain Badiou, turning philosophy away from cognitive mapping through Kantian categorical imperatives and re/turning it to the world.

  Book Title: Essays from the Edge-Parerga and Paralipomena<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): JAY MARTIN<br>
  Abstract: Over his distinguished career as a European intellectual historian and cultural critic, Martin Jay has explored a variety of major themes: the Frankfurt School, the exile of German intellectuals in America during the Nazi era, Western Marxism, the denigration of vision in twentieth-century French thought, the discourse of experience in modern Europe and America, and lying in politics.
         Essays from the Edgeassembles Jay's writings from the intersections of this intellectual journey. Several essays focus on methodological debates in the humanities and social sciences: the limits of interdisciplinarity, the issue of national or universal philosophy, cultural relativism and visuality, and the implications of periodization in historical narrative. Others examine the concept of "scopic regime" and the metaphors of revolution and the gardening impulse. Among the theorists treated at length are Theodor Adorno, Hannah Arendt, Jacques Derrida, and Michel Foucault. The essays also include several of Jay'sSalmagundicolumns, dealing with subjects as varied as the new Museum of Modern Art in New York, the impact of Colin Wilson's The Outsider, and the demise of thePartisan Review.<br>

The 1850s were, after all, a grim period of political reentrenchment following the failures of the revolutions of 1848, and the time was ripe for the sour pessimism and disillusionment with reason expressed in his philosophy of the irrational will.

Hobson was no exception to that rule, but his interpretation of human nature was novel and wide-ranging. It did not merely refer to an abstract model, artificially—even cunningly—employed to explain or justify this or that social practice. Rather, it was grounded in concrete, commonsense, empirical observations; it encompassed a broad openness to different aspects of human behaviour; and it attempted to incorporate insights from new developments in philosophy, psychology, sociology, and physiology as well as relate to older<br>

  Abstract: Although among the categories informing the study of politics there are few as fundamental as those demarcating theory and practice, that distinction is highly problematic when applied to the analysis of ideologies. Many traditional as well as current approaches regard political thought as the area in which issues of moral philosophy pertaining to political entities are aired, with the objective of setting defining ethical and validating criteria that are then to be applied to political practice. A grounding of this view may be found in Kant, for whom individuals were subjected to clear and unequivocal moral duties and were

  Book Title: Birth of the Symbol-Ancient Readers at the Limits of Their Texts<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Struck Peter T.<br>
  Abstract: The book notes that Aristotle and his followers did not discuss the use of poetic symbolism. Rather, a different group of Greek thinkers--the allegorists--were the first to develop the notion. Struck extensively revisits the work of the great allegorists, which has been underappreciated. He links their interest in symbolism to the importance of divination and magic in ancient times, and he demonstrates how important symbolism became when they thought about religion and philosophy. "They see the whole of great poetic language as deeply figurative," he writes, "with the potential always, even in the most mundane details, to be freighted with hidden messages."<br>

  Book Title: Available Light-Anthropological Reflections on Philosophical Topics<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Geertz Clifford<br>
  Abstract: Geertz, who once considered a career in philosophy, begins by explaining how he got swept into the revolutionary movement of symbolic anthropology. At that point, his work began to encompass not only the ethnography of groups in Southeast Asia and North Africa, but also the study of how meaning is made in all cultures--or, to use his phrase, to explore the "frames of meaning" in which people everywhere live out their lives. His philosophical orientation helped him to establish the role of anthropology within broader intellectual circles and led him to address the work of such leading thinkers as Charles Taylor, Thomas Kuhn, William James, and Jerome Bruner. In this volume, Geertz comments on their work as he explores questions in political philosophy, psychology, and religion that have intrigued him throughout his career but that now hold particular relevance in light of postmodernist thinking and multiculturalism.

  Book Title: Essays on Giordano Bruno-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): GATTI HILARY<br>
  Abstract: The book is divided into sections that address three broad subjects: the relationship between Bruno and the new science, the history of his reception in English culture, and the principal characteristics of his natural philosophy. A final essay examines why this advocate of a "tranquil universal philosophy" ended up being burned at the stake as a heretic by the Roman Inquisition. While the essays take many different approaches, they are united by a number of assumptions: that, although well versed in magic, Bruno cannot be defined primarily as a Renaissance Magus; that his aim was to articulate a new philosophy of nature; and that his thought, while based on ancient and medieval sources, represented a radical rupture with the philosophical schools of the past, helping forge a path toward a new modernity.<br>

  Abstract: In one of his italian philosophical dialogues written and published in London in 1584,
                  De l’infinito,universo et mondi, Giordano Bruno described his life’s work as an attempt to define a “tranquil universal philosophy”: a philosophy that he imagined as a peaceful swim through the infinite ocean of universal being.¹ This was Bruno’s third philosophical dialogue written in Italian. In it, he criticizes the fifteenth-century Catholic cardinal, Nicholas Cusanus, who anticipated him in proposing an infinite universe. Cusanus, however, proposed a dualistic universe of Aristotelian origin and with clearly Christian and neo-Thomistic implications, divided between spheres of being of intense<br>

  Book Title: The Aesthetics of Mimesis-Ancient Texts and Modern Problems<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Halliwell Stephen<br>
  Abstract: Mimesis is one of the oldest, most fundamental concepts in Western aesthetics. This book offers a new, searching treatment of its long history at the center of theories of representational art: above all, in the highly influential writings of Plato and Aristotle, but also in later Greco-Roman philosophy and criticism, and subsequently in many areas of aesthetic controversy from the Renaissance to the twentieth century. Combining classical scholarship, philosophical analysis, and the history of ideas--and ranging across discussion of poetry, painting, and music--Stephen Halliwell shows with a wealth of detail how mimesis, at all stages of its evolution, has been a more complex, variable concept than its conventional translation of "imitation" can now convey.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rn67">The Aesthetics of Mimesis</a><br>
  Abstract: Plato and mimesis form a fateful conjunction in the history of aesthetics. Not only was Plato the first Greek thinker to explore the idea of mimetic art in a theoretically extensive and probing manner, engaging strategically with themes and issues that, as we saw in my introduction, had been voiced in various but unsystematic ways in earlier Greek poetry and thought. He also took two momentous steps toward turning mimesis into the backdrop for an entire philosophy of art. The first was to pose certain fundamental challenges to the status and value of artistic mimesis—challenges that have remained unsettling<br>

  Abstract: For Aristotle as for Plato, the deepest, most significant and most philosophically interesting of all mimetic artforms was tragic poetry.² That tragedy should attract such attention from both philosophers was a reflection not only of the genre’s cultural prestige in classical Athens, but also, and more fundamentally, of the scope of its ethical and psychological engagement with extremes of human experience and suffering. Plato, as I argued in chapter 3, counted tragedy as a kind of embryonic (though profoundly mistaken) philosophy: the vehicle of a set of attitudes and values capable of being translated into a worldview that, if taken<br>

  Abstract: In the domain of aesthetics, moving on from the writings of Plato and Aristotle to the rather patchily preserved evidence for Hellenistic attitudes to mimetic art is somewhat like descending from a mountain range into a large but indefinitely sprawling plain. It is appropriate to begin this journey, however, by observing that extensive areas of the plain are irrigated by waters that run down from the peaks above. One aspect of the impact of both Plato and Aristotle—an aspect given little attention by historians of philosophy but an immensely important one in the long run of the history of<br>

  Book Title: Freud, the Reluctant Philosopher-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Tauber Alfred I.<br>
  Abstract: Freud began university intending to study both medicine and philosophy. But he was ambivalent about philosophy, regarding it as metaphysical, too limited to the conscious mind, and ignorant of empirical knowledge. Yet his private correspondence and his writings on culture and history reveal that he never forsook his original philosophical ambitions. Indeed, while Freud remained firmly committed to positivist ideals, his thought was permeated with other aspects of German philosophy. Placed in dialogue with his intellectual contemporaries, Freud appears as a reluctant philosopher who failed to recognize his own metaphysical commitments, thereby crippling the defense of his theory and misrepresenting his true achievement. Recasting Freud as an inspired humanist and reconceiving psychoanalysis as a form of moral inquiry, Alfred Tauber argues that Freudianism still offers a rich approach to self-inquiry, one that reaffirms the enduring task of philosophy and many of the abiding ethical values of Western civilization.<br>

  Abstract: What are the philosophical antecedents of Freud’s attempt to establish a science of the mind? As already briefly mentioned, during his early university days Freud explicitly rejected philosophy, because of its “speculative” character. He struggled with balancing the intellectual appeal of philosophy with the “certainty” he hoped to find in positivist science. That move heralded the series of clinical studies that would eventually emerge in the therapeutic system of psychoanalysis, a psychiatry he would consistently call a “science.” Freud never abandoned his commitment to scientific knowledge and perhaps more importantly, scientific reason. As he wrote late in his life, “Our<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rrpr">Freud, the Reluctant Philosopher</a><br>
  Abstract: Freud’s disavowals about philosophy do not absolve him from complex philosophical debts: Indeed, Freud (and later commentators) have failed to explain how the origins of psychoanalytical theory began with a positivistic investment without recognizing a dual epistemological commitment. Simply, Freud engaged positivism because he believed it generally equated with empiricism, which he valued, and he rejected “philosophy,” and, more specifically, Kantianism, because of the associated “transcendental” qualities of its epistemology. But the relationship between Freud and Kant is not so simple.<br>

  Book Title: Contesting Spirit-Nietzsche, Affirmation, Religion<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROBERTS TYLER T.<br>
  Abstract: Nietzsche criticizes the ascetic hatred of the body and this-worldly life, yet engages in rigorous practices of self-denial--he sees philosophy as such a practice--and affirms the need of imposing suffering on oneself in order to enhance the spirit. He dismisses the "intoxication" of mysticism, yet links mysticism, power, and creativity, and describes his own self-transcending experiences. The tensions in his relation to religion are closely related to that between negation and affirmation in his thinking in general. In Roberts's view, Nietzsche's transfigurations of religion offer resources for a postmodern religious imagination. Though as a "master of suspicion," Nietzsche, with Freud and Marx, is an integral part of modern antireligion, he has the power to take us beyond the flat, modern distinction between the secular and the religious--a distinction that, at the end of modernity, begs to be reexamined.<br>

  Abstract: In 1886, at the height of his powers as writer and thinker, Friedrich Nietzsche wrote a series of prefaces for new editions of his early works.¹ As autobiography, they embellish the plain facts of his life; as philosophy, they say more about what Nietzsche was thinking in 1886 than about the early texts with which they are concerned. Still, they disclose a vibrant and paradoxical vision of Nietzsche as a thinker. Read together, the new prefaces narrate the trajectory of Nietzsche’s writing and thinking as a life that transpired between hopeless disillusion and the joy of love’s recovery. In the<br>

  Abstract: In the 1886 preface to his first book,
                  The Birth of Tragedy(originally published in 1872), Nietzsche offered a critical review of that book’s attempt to grapple with the question, What is the value of existence? By 1886 the significance of the question had changed for him, yet it continued to occupy his reflections on affirmation. The new preface recalls how he had tried to pose the problem of the value of existence by contrasting the “pessimism” of Greek tragedy and the “optimism” of Socratic philosophy.

Nonetheless, the May events had a profound effect on Foucault’s intellectual and political trajectory. Foucault himself acknowledged as much, observing that May was the unanticipated “political opening” that gave him the courage to investigate the mechanisms of power operating in Western societies and to “pursue [his] research in the direction of penal theory, prisons, and disciplines.”¹<br>

  Abstract: Adam Seligman, one of our most important social thinkers, continues the incisive critique of modernity he began in his previously acclaimed
         The Idea of Civil SocietyandThe Problem of Trust.In this provocative new work of social philosophy, Seligman evaluates modernity's wager, namely, the gambit to liberate the modern individual from external social and religious norms by supplanting them with the rational self as its own moral authority. Yet far from ensuring the freedom of the individual, Seligman argues, "the fundamentalist doctrine of enlightened reason has called into being its own nemesis" in the forms of ethnic, racial, and identity politics. Seligman counters that the modern human must recover a notion of authority that is essentially transcendent, but which extends tolerance to those of other--or no--faiths.<br>

  Book Title: Politics and the Imagination-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Geuss Raymond<br>
  Abstract: In politics, utopians do not have a monopoly on imagination. Even the most conservative defenses of the status quo, Raymond Geuss argues, require imaginative acts of some kind. In this collection of recent essays, including his most overtly political writing yet, Geuss explores the role of imagination in politics, particularly how imaginative constructs interact with political reality. He uses decisions about the war in Iraq to explore the peculiar ways in which politicians can be deluded and citizens can misunderstand their leaders. He also examines critically what he sees as one of the most serious delusions of western political thinking--the idea that a human society is always best conceived as a closed system obeying fixed rules. And, in essays on
      Don Quixote, museums, Celan's poetry, Heidegger's brother Fritz, Richard Rorty, and bourgeois philosophy, Geuss reflects on how cultural artifacts can lead us to embrace or reject conventional assumptions about the world. While paying particular attention to the relative political roles played by rule-following, utilitarian calculations of interest, and aspirations to lead a collective life of a certain kind, Geuss discusses a wide range of related issues, including the distance critics need from their political systems, the extent to which history can enlighten politics, and the possibility of utopian thinking in a world in which action retains its urgency.<br>

  Abstract: Philosophers are at a serious disadvantage when it comes to understanding politics, and it is a disadvantage that results from the very peculiarity of their special vocation and training. From almost the very beginning of its existence as a distinct activity, Western philosophy has been committed to certain principles of at least minimal self-awareness, clarity, coherence, and consistency of thought, speech, valuation, and action. Socrates, who notoriously took no part in city politics beyond what was strictly required of him by his obligations as a citizen, also started philosophy down the path of exhortation to

  Book Title: Circles Disturbed-The Interplay of Mathematics and Narrative<br>

  Author(s): MAZUR BARRY<br>
  Abstract: Circles Disturbedbrings together important thinkers in mathematics, history, and philosophy to explore the relationship between mathematics and narrative. The book's title recalls the last words of the great Greek mathematician Archimedes before he was slain by a Roman soldier--"Don't disturb my circles"--words that seem to refer to two radically different concerns: that of the practical person living in the concrete world of reality, and that of the theoretician lost in a world of abstraction. Stories and theorems are, in a sense, the natural languages of these two worlds--stories representing the way we act and interact, and theorems giving us pure thought, distilled from the hustle and bustle of reality. Yet, though the voices of stories and theorems seem totally different, they share profound connections and similarities.<br>

  Abstract: How is it to act rationally as a mathematician? For much of the Anglo-American philosophy of mathematics this question is answered in terms of what mathematicians most obviously produce—journal papers. From this perspective, the mathematician’s work is taken to be of interest solely insofar as in consists in deducing the consequences of various axioms and definitions. This view of the discipline, with its strong focus on aspects of mathematics that do not feature largely elsewhere—its use of deductive proof, its supposed capacity to be captured by some formal calculus, the abstractness of the objects it studies—isolates the<br>

  Book Title: Sung Dynasty Uses of the I Ching-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wyatt Don J.<br>
  Abstract: The
         I Ching, or Book of Changes, has been one of the two or three most influential books in the Chinese canon. It has been used by people on all levels of society, both as a method of divination and as a source of essential ideas about the nature of heaven, earth, and humankind. During the eleventh and twelfth centuries, Sung dynasty literati turned to it for guidance in their fundamental reworking of the classical traditions. This book explores how four leading thinkers--Su Shih, Shao Yung, Ch'eng I, and Chu Hsi--applied theI Chingto these projects. These four men used the Book of Changes in strikingly different ways. Yet each claimed to find in it a sure foundation for human values. Their work established not only new meanings for the text but also new models for governance and moral philosophy that would be debated throughout the next thousand years of Chinese intellectual history. By focusing on their uses of theI Ching, this study casts a unique light on the complex continuity-within-change and rich diversity of Sung culture.<br>

  Abstract: The aim of this book is to explore the affiliations between Modernist poetics and contemporaneous developments in philosophy. That there are such affiliations is beyond dispute. The names of many philosophers—Bergson, James, Bradley, and Nietzsche among others—appear frequently in studies of the Modernist movement. But literary historians have for the most part adopted an atomistic approach to the subject: they generally confine themselves to individual influences or affinities, examining, for instance, the impact of Bradley on T. S. Eliot or that of Santayana on Wallace Stevens. These studies are often quite valuable, but they focus too narrowly on<br>

  Abstract: At the turn of the century, many philosophers believed that they were forging a fundamentally new theory of knowledge. Announcing a major “inversion of Platonism” in Western philosophy, they claimed that reality lies in the immediate flux of sensory appearances and not in a rational order beyond it. Our conceptual systems, they argued, are not copies of eternal forms underlying the sensory flux; they are instrumental constructs that overlie an experiential stream irreducible to rational formulation. Despite the extraordinary progress of natural science in this era, philosophers (as well as certain scientists) denied that our knowledge reflects the essential structure<br>

  Abstract: The opposition between “surfaces” and “depths” is central to the works of T. S. Eliot. In his readings of turn-of-the-century philosophy, psychology, and ethnology, Eliot encountered this opposition in various forms. Bradley’s immediate experience dovetailed with Jung’s substratum of archetypal symbols and Frazer’s substratum of ritual behavior: all expressed the same distinction between the surface forms of everyday life and the hidden depths that ordinarily elude us. This distinction is evident in the early poetry, where Eliot places highly conventional personae in contexts that evoke a deeper reality of which they are unaware. It is also a feature of the<br>

  Abstract: Throughout this book I have explored the modern tendency to think in terms of “surfaces” and “depths,” focusing particularly on the opposition between conceptual abstraction and concrete sensation. These terms have been used to conduct an investigation that might be extended well beyond the limits of this study. They inform the works of many writers of the early twentieth century, and Chapters III and IV merely suggest the kind of work to be done with Yeats, Stevens, and Williams, as well as the novelists of the period. In many respects these terms are still central to the human sciences, philosophy,<br>

It is also said that modern philosophy began with Kant’s critique of traditional metaphysics and his critical amalgam of empirical and rationalistic factors in his epistemology as a “prolegomenon to any future metaphysics.” We have seen that, in any event, it was in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries that conceptual specification of aesthetics and of religion emerged, as an aspect of the new critical philosophy and the enlarged senses of history and culture engendered by the Enlightenment<br>

Its violence exposed the hidden dependency of every way of life—economic, religious, artistic, philosophical—on a political sphere whose practices and disorders accumulate meaning almost imperceptibly over generations. If violence is not to rule public life, each domain must become aware of this dependency and alter itself to accommodate “history.” Even philosophers must learn to

  The Twentieth Century: Quine and After: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvsm">Central Works of Philosophy, Volume 5</a><br>
  Author(s) Shand John<br>
  Abstract: It would be a distortion to attribute to philosophy in the latter half of the twentieth century any overall unity of philosophical outlook, and I shall, therefore, not try to impose one. Moreover, the closeness to the present of the works in this period makes it even more difficult than usual to discern a prevailing direction in recent philosophy or identify what value posterity will assign to any particular part of it. If one true observation about late-twentieth-century philosophy may be made, it is perhaps only the trite one of its diversity.¹<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvsm">Central Works of Philosophy, Volume 5</a><br>
  Author(s) Kemp Gary<br>
  Abstract: Western philosophy since Descartes has been marked by certain seminal books whose concern is the nature and scope of human knowledge. After Descartes's
                  Meditations,works by Locke, Berkeley, Hume and Kant are perhaps the most familiar and enduringly influential examples. Quine'sWord and Object(1960) not conspicuously announce itself as an intended successor to these, but is very much what it is. And after Wittgenstein'sPhilosophical Investigations,it is among the most likely of the philosophical fruits of the twentieth century to attain something like the prestige of those earlier works (setting aside century's great achievements in pure logic and<br>

  Abstract: Robert Nozick's
                  Anarchy, State, and Utopia(1974), along with John Rawls’sA Theroy of Justice(1971), radically changed the landscape in analytic political philosophy. For much of the preceding half-century, under the influence of logical heavy emphasis on empirical verifiability, much of moral philosophy was taken up with metaethics (e.g. the semantics of moral discourse), with little attention given to normative moral theories. Moreover, to the extent that normative theories were considered, utilitarianism was the centre of attention. This all changed with the publication of Rawls’s articulation and defence of liberal egalitarianism and Nozick’s libertarian challenge to the legitimacy of<br>

  Abstract: Truth Other Enigmasis a collection of some of Michael Dummett's writings on truth and other enigmas. The other enigmas include: meaning and understanding, time and causation, the past, realism, logic, proof, vagueness and philosophy itself. The writings span a considerable portion of Dummett's career - the years 1953 to 1975 - and reflect his diverse concerns in that period. So it would be a to look for and wrong to impose a single theme that unifies the essays.However, two issues stand out as central, recurring as they do in many of the essays.

  Abstract: Richard Rorty's
                  Philosophy and the Mirror of Naturemay be viewed as a sustained meditation on the philosophical significance and consequences of these by Nietzsche. It is an iconoclastic book. But it is one that any person seriosuly interested in what philosophy is, how it came to be what it is and what it might eventually become should want to read, and re-read, whether or not disposed to agree with its controversial conclusions. In many ways, it is unique text. Certainly, no other book in recent times has launched such a detailed and extensive attack on the presuppositions and preoccupations<br>

But it was primarily in the latter half of the twentieth century that possible worlds became a mainstay of philosophical theorizing.

  CHAPTER SEVEN  Historical Interpretation: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvvd9">The Writer Writing</a><br>
  Abstract: In the course of discussing the concept of historical interpretation in the opening chapter, I quoted R. G. Collingwood on the proper way to understand “what a man means.” This phrase was conventional in 1939, the publication date of Collingwood’s book. This nuance of his discourse helps to date him by placing him within a set of conventions about gender. Such conventions have changed so much in the ensuing fifty years that if an Oxford professor of philosophy were to use this phrase today in a similar context, it would seem pointed.<br>

  Abstract: Eliot first came to visit Pound in the triangular study of his Kensington apartment in the Autumn of 1914, and Pound immediately sent “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock” to Harriet Monroe, calling it “the best poem I have yet had or seen from an American” (L, 40). At the same time, Eliot wrote to Conrad Aiken that he found Pound’s verse “touchingly incompetent.”¹ This opinion would change. Eliot went up to Oxford, completed his dissertation on the philosophy of F. H. Bradley, married Vivienne Haigh-Wood, suffered, moved back to London, and began working at Lloyds Bank in 1917.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvx3v">Modernist Poetics of History</a><br>
  Abstract: For several years before he met Pound, Eliot was engaged in a rigorous philosophical examination of the nature of interpretation. Pound confronted many of the same issues in his attempts to include history in his poems, but Eliot was a trained philosopher, and he addressed these same issues more strenuously in his writings on Bradley. While he was a graduate student in the philosophy department at Harvard in 1913–1914, Eliot took Josiah Royce’s seminar in the Comparative Study of Various Types of Scientific Method. According to Harry Todd Costello, a participant in the seminar who was assigned the task<br>

  Abstract: “And of course the only real truth is the whole truth” (KE, 163). This sentence is one of the most telling that Eliot ever wrote. Not only does it epitomize his ideas about the nature of tenable criteria for truth, but it reveals how self-evident he considered those criteria to be; the “of course” is particularly telling. Furthermore, this sentence, and Eliot’s general dependence upon the idea of wholeness and the “systematic” nature of truth, reveal his strong reliance upon nineteenth-century traditions in both philosophy and poetry.<br>

  Abstract: Twentieth-century existential thinkers, critical of traditional, overly rationalistic approaches to ethics, sought to provide a better account of what it means to be human in the world. They articulated ethical views that respected the individual yet were fundamentally concerned with the Other and the ethical value of an authentic life.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zw0q">Existentialist Thinkers and Ethics</a><br>
  Author(s) GOLDBERG DAVID W.<br>
  Abstract: We live in an age of ethical relativism gone rampant, an age in which adjudication between moral positions has been undermined and thrown into doubt. One of the repercussions of postmodern thinking has been the dissolution of that conceptual certainty that modern philosophy and its philosophic predecessors reveled in: an envisioned certainty that enabled previous generations to condone or condemn moral positions outright and with a certitude that bordered on arrogance.¹ But as our world grows rapidly smaller, our contemporary view (especially within the United States) is one that expects divergence of moral positionings and finds it instanced in actions<br>

  8  Merleau-Ponty’s Embodied Ethics: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zw0q">Existentialist Thinkers and Ethics</a><br>
  Author(s) MACLAREN KYM<br>
  Abstract: Merleau-Ponty offers us an existentialist philosophy that understands our freedom and responsibility as inseparable from our embodiment. Though he does not explicitly and systematically articulate an ethics, his notion of embodiment nonetheless implies a certain existentialist ethics. For, according to Merleau-Ponty, to be embodied is to be inherently in relation to others, and thus, as I will argue, it is to be implicated in and moved by an imperative to strive for mutual recognition. This paper seeks to elucidate this embodied ethics of mutual recognition.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zxm6">Subaltern Appeal to Experience</a><br>
  Abstract: Over the last few decades, the term “experience” has persistently preoccupied certain strands in cultural, subaltern, and aesthetic inquiry concerned with issues of agency, identity formation or counterhegemonic resistance. This preoccupation with experience has also sparked a series of skirmishes since the 1970s between those who debunk experience as the stuff of an antiquated philosophy of consciousness and those who, on the contrary, seek its rehabilitation by resurrecting Dilthey or Dewey. Heated and protracted exchanges on experience take place to this day in such journals as the

  Abstract: In their bid to preserve agency or at least a means of resistance against strong structural determination, strands in cultural and subaltern theory, then, have wagered on the perceived counterhegemonic immediacy of experience. As to why such a venture should find immediate experience so seductive, poststructuralist critiques of presence in general and of immediate experience in particular tell us little that has not already been told by Adorno, if not by Hegel: “In schools of philosophy that make emphatic use of the concept of experience, in the tradition of Hume, the character of immediacy – immediacy in relation to the<br>

The circumstances of life, study, and work had led me to the humanities: a smattering of Protestant theology, followed by philosophy, followed in turn by French literature of the twentieth century but gradually also of the sixteenth; and, along these paths, the discovery of comparative literature. These were – and are – widely separate disciplines, guarded by specialists who would view any border trespassing with suspicion.

  Abstract: What is paradoxical about subjectivity, and how does this question relate to the thought of Erasmus? As a philosophical issue the problematic of subjectivity is very present in our time: undeniably the struggles of the postmodern self help to ignite inquiries into the early modern past of this rich and elusive concept, paradoxical or so regarded inasmuch as (according to philosophies, and often within the same philosophy) the self both is and is not its own origin. While Renaissance humanism promoted and privileged the perfecting of the human person as a cherished ideal, it did not often envisage that self<br>

  Book Title: Distant Relation-Time and Identity in Spanish American Fiction<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Thomson Eoin S.<br>
  Abstract: The Distant Relation breaks down the artificial division between philosophy and literature by weaving contemporary philosophic arguments through close readings of Carpentier, Rulfo, Paz, and Garcia Marquez. Thomson draws the reader into the largely uninhabited space between philosophy and literature, providing new critical strategies that allow text and reader to respond to the very distance they share. These strategies involve a reconceptualization of distance that recognizes the productive and affirmative nature of separation.<br>

  Abstract: I want to proffer a schema. I’m going to present, one at a time, four contemporary political philosophies – I call them neutralism, postmodernism, pluralism, and patriotism¹ – and then show how they relate to political ideologies, such as liberalism, conservatism, socialism, feminism, green ideology, nationalism, fascism, and so on. This will involve more than just advancing a particular typology, however, for in so doing I shall also be putting forth an argument: namely that, given a proper understanding of the relation between philosophy and ideology, postmodernism is superior to neutralism, pluralism to postmodernism, and patriotism to pluralism, making the patriot’s approach<br>

  Abstract: Charles Taylor fails to distinguish enough between art and ethics. Whereas Kant sharply separates the two domains and Hegel brings them close together, subordinating both to his concept of unified philosophical knowledge,¹ Taylor treads an ambiguous path between their positions. Like them, he recognizes that creativity is a unique capacity, that “aesthetic excellence doesn’t just amount to spiritual or moral depth.”² Yet Kant would not be able to accept Taylor’s conception of interpretation as an activity central not only to art criticism but also to ethics, and Hegel would balk at Taylor’s implication that philosophy cannot be said to encompass<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt8054j">Patriotic Elaborations</a><br>
  Abstract: Hubris or chutzpah? The successful philosopher, it seems, must have a bit of both. For despite the number of rival conceptions of philosophy on offer today, almost everyone recognizes that to philosophize, even when the results of doing so mean that one ends up rejecting philosophy, involves making claims of the greatest scope and generality. Whether these are understood to be universally or more locally relevant is, of course, one of the central issues at stake in the contemporary debates. But even those who emphasize philosophy’s limitations tend to do so with reference to

  Nihilism: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt806gf">Nietzsche and the Rhetoric of Nihilism</a><br>

  Abstract: The chance of Nietzsche’s philosophy amounting to an
                  Überwindung der Metaphysik, an overcoming of Platonism, or an overcoming of thebisherige Menschand the subjection to morals, religion, and ideology, depends on the distinction between reactive (or passive) and active nihilism—a distinction that is neither clear-cut nor univocal in the notes of the late Nietzsche. As you know, Nietzsche calls himself the first accomplished nihilist (“der erste vollkommene Nihilist Europas”), precisely because he has pushed nihilism to its extreme consequences and therefore “ihn hinter sich, unter sich, auβer sich hat”, has left it behind, below, and outside (Schlechta 1954,<br>

  Abstract: From the beginning of his reflections, Nietzsche is in search of “a new philosophy of language” (CM 1976, 1:340 [8, 52]), a philosophy which would wisely consent to lose its head and which could give, in a positive manner, an account of the bacchanalian revel, the festive inordinateness of the dithyramb, “this beautiful and savage folly of poetry” (CM 1976, V: 100-1). One is to understand the “nature” of language beginning with its derailment and its loss.

  Abstract: In the first section of this paper I will explain the necessity of posing the problem of nihilism differently from the way Nietzsche posed it. In the second section I elaborate on the idea that the philosophy of subjectivity—which is closely woven with the phenomenon of nihilism—is an attempt by Western thinking to compensate for the unhomeliness (Unheimlichkeit) of the world by means of a forced quest within oneself. In doing this I extend the old idea of philosophy as a spiritual midwife towards a general understanding of the subject as the centre of a will of exertions,<br>

  Abstract: In the immense secondary literature on Nietzsche relatively little attention seems to have been paid to the influence of kynic motives and ideas on both the form and substance of his philosophy. This is the case despite the fact that Nietzsche explicitly associated himself with Kynism¹ in a number of aphorisms,² while at the same time adopting the literary style,³ the manner of philosophizing, as well as important concepts and figures⁴ of this school of antiquity.

  Abstract: Moving away from Jacques Derrida's deconstructionism and Paul Ricoeur's hermeneutics, and building on his experiences as a politician, Vattimo asks if it is still possible to speak of moral imperatives, individual rights, and political freedom. Acknowledging the force of Nietzsche's "God is dead," Vattimo argues for a philosophy of pensiero debole or "weak thinking" that shows how moral values can exist without being guaranteed by an external authority. His secularising interpretation stresses anti-metaphysical elements and puts philosophy into a relationship with postmodern culture.<br>

  Abstract: Gianni Vattimo wants philosophy to continue. This obvious statement appears at first sight to be vacuous, almost nonsensical, when employed to begin writing about a philosopher. After all, does not every philosopher by the act of philosophizing engage de facto in the continuation of philosophy? The apparent emptiness of this statement quickly disappears, though, when, as in the case of Vattimo’s philosophical project, there is an announcement of the end of philosophy such that there is indeed a question not actually of whether philosophy is to continue but of the way in which it is able to continue.

  Abstract: We have many reasons to be grateful to Gianni Vattimo for his continuing contribution to philosophy and public life. Undoubtedly, his most decisive philosophical impulses have come from the German philosophical tradition, and mostly from the Holy Trinity of Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Gadamer, who was his teacher. Yet he was not German but a proud Italian and for some reason more able than others to carry this tradition further. The German philosophical tradition has to a large extent dominated philosophy since Leibniz and Kant, but its dominion ebbed considerably after Husserl, Heidegger, and Gadamer.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt81c69">Weakening Philosophy</a><br>
  Author(s) FRANKENBERRY NANCY K .<br>
  Abstract: Notwithstanding Lyotard’s characterization of postmodernity’s incredulity toward grand metanarratives, the most interesting and provocative philosophy in our time is that being painted with meta broad brushes. When distinguished philosophers fashion overarching narratives, they help us hold things together in a synoptic vision; by painting forests for us, they make those of us who read too many books able at least to see more than just the trees. Gianni Vattimo and Richard Rorty, metanarrators both, and two of the most original philosophers writing today, invite comparison of their overlapping but distinct narratives on religion and secularization, which I will undertake in<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt81c69">Weakening Philosophy</a><br>
  Author(s) Valgenti Robert T.<br>
  Abstract: In the history of Being presented by postmodernity, does Christianity represent a
                  chancefor rethinking Being and rewriting the meaning of the philosophical vocation? This seems to be one of the most meaningful demands put forth in the reflections of Gianni Vattimo, especially in the wake of his philosophical proposal that finds anouvertureunder debate in the metaphor of weak thought, in the sense that it radicalizes a form of reflection that is (seemingly) closer to deconstruction. The issue appears even more intriguing if it is limited to the relation between philosophy and religion. There is a well-known irreconcilability<br>

  Book Title: Philosophy of Merleau-Ponty-  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Matthews Eric<br>
  Abstract: In this clear and comprehensive account of Merleau-Ponty's thought Eric Matthews shows how Merleau-Ponty has contributed to current debates in philosophy, such as the nature of consciousness, the relation between biology and personality, the historical understanding of human thought and society, and many others. Surveying the whole range of Merleau-Ponty's thinking, Matthews examines his views about the nature of phenomenology and the primacy of perception; his account of human embodiment, being-in-the-world, and the understanding of human behaviour; his conception of the self and its relation to other selves; and his views on society, politics, and the arts. A final chapter considers his later thought, published posthumously. The ideas of Merleau-Ponty are of immensely important to the development of modern French philosophy. Matthews evaluates his distinctive contributions and relates his thought to that of his predecessors, contemporaries, and successors, both in France and elsewhere. This unrivalled introduction will be welcomed by analytic philosophers and cognitive scientists as well as all students taking courses in contemporary continental philosophy.<br>

  CHAPTER ONE  Merleau-Ponty in Context from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt81dhr">Philosophy of Merleau-Ponty</a><br>
  Abstract: Why should we still read Merleau-Ponty? He died, after all, in 1961, at a time when the social and cultural situation and the preoccupations of philosophers were very different from those of the end of the twentieth century and the beginning of a new millennium. Is he not simply a representative of a now outmoded “humanism”, a philosophy of the “subject” and of the phenomenology of consciousness? That he was a humanist in some sense of that rather vague word is undeniable; he was certainly concerned to affirm human values and believed that there are such values to affirm. But<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt81dhr">Philosophy of Merleau-Ponty</a><br>
  Abstract: Phenomenological philosophy, as Merleau-Ponty conceives it, “consists in re-learning to look at the world”.¹ We need to re-learn to look at the world because we are “held captive” (to use Wittgenstein's phrase) by a picture of the world derived from the impulses that give rise to science - an
                  objectivistpicture of the world (including even our own bodies) as existing entirely independent of ourselves and interacting with our experience in a merely causal fashion. There is nothing wrong with this picture in its own context; if we are to study the world scientifically, then we need to set aside<br>

  CHAPTER SEVEN  The Arts from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt81dhr">Philosophy of Merleau-Ponty</a><br>
  Abstract: Phenomenological philosophy, in Merleau-Ponty's conception, consists as we have seen in “re-learning to look at the world”, attempting to get behind the theoretical constructions that we erect on the basis of our immediate experience of the world in order to describe that experience itself. In so doing, he says, we do not simply reflect a pre-existing truth: philosophy is, “like art, the act of bringing truth into being”.¹ The analogy between phenomenology and art, especially the visual arts, runs through Merleau-Ponty's writings, sometimes as asides to a general philosophical discussion, and sometimes in the form of extended essays on particular<br>

  Book Title: The Sense of the Universe-Philosophical Explication of Theological Commitment in Modern Cosmology<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Nesteruk Alexei V.<br>
  Abstract: The Sense of the Universe deals with existential and phenomenological reflection upon modern cosmology with the aim to reveal hidden theological commitments in cosmology related to the mystery of human existence. The book proposes a new approach to the dialogue between science and theology based in a thorough philosophical analysis of acting forms of subjectivity involved in the study of the world and in religious experience. The uniqueness of this book is that it uses recent advances in phenomenological philosophy and philosophical theology in order to accentuate the existential meaning of cosmology as the discourse that ultimately explicates the human condition. The objective of the book is not to make a comparative analysis of the cosmological scientific narrative and that of the Bible, or the Fathers of the Church (in what concerns the structure of the universe), but to reveal the presence of a hidden theological dimension in cosmology originating in the God-given ability of humanity to discern and disclose the sense of creation. The book contributes to the synthesis of appropriation and incorporation of modern philosophical ideas in Christian theology, in particular its Eastern Orthodox form.<br>

  Abstract: It is a truism to say that sources of historical sense generation in a society are not confined to history.¹ The recognition that history’s own established procedures of making sense of the past cannot remain insulated from the influence of ideas and action moving the wider society is growing within the discipline of history itself. This has made the discipline pliable to modes of understanding the past developed in other disciplines such as arts, aesthetics, literary theory and criticism, ethnology, sociology, philosophy, linguistics, and so on.²<br>

  Abstract: Just as the role of subjectivity in language is attracting increasing attention from an array of disciplines ranging across linguistics, communication, anthropology, history, philosophy, and others, the thrust of this interest appears to be headed in the opposite direction from an agenda that would place rhetoric at center stage. Rhetoric in its conventional guise has been deemed a quintessentially public enterprise, oriented to the marketplace of propositions projected to appeal to others. In the market square of civil discourse, sellers of ideas invite prospective buyers to critically test the proffered wares for plausibility and persuasiveness. In contrast, subjectivity as popularly<br>

  Book Title: Melanesian Odysseys-Negotiating the Self, Narrative, and Modernity<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Josephides Lisette<br>
  Abstract: In a series of epic self-narratives ranging from traditional cultural embodiments to picaresque adventures, Christian epiphanies and a host of interactive strategies and techniques for living, Kewa Highlanders (PNG) attempt to shape and control their selves and their relentlessly changing world. This lively account transcends ethnographic particularity and offers a wide-reaching perspective on the nature of being human. Inverting the analytic logic of her previous work, which sought to uncover what social structures concealed, Josephides focuses instead on the cultural understandings that people make explicit in their actions and speech. Using approaches from philosophy and anthropology, she examines elicitation (how people create their selves and their worlds in the act of making explicit) and mimesis (how anthropologists produce ethnographies), to arrive at an unexpected conclusion: that knowledge of self and other alike derives from self-externalization rather than self-introspection.<br>

  Author(s) Oesterreich Peter L.<br>
  Abstract: The last decades of the twentieth century witnessed a “renaissance of rhetoric” (cf. Plett 1994), or “rhetorical turn” (Simons, ed. 1990), that has affected not only literary studies but also law, theology, aesthetics, philosophy, economics, politics, and even the natural sciences. The idea that cultures are rhetorically constituted is, of course, not new, and there have been various earlier attempts to address the subject—for example, Plato, Nietzsche, Burke, Heidegger, Gadamer, and others. But I think that there still is much to gain by rethinking this time-honored topic, and in this paper I will explore the possibility of a more<br>

  Abstract: The present essay grows out of this question: What is it that makes the chiasmus “practice of rhetoric, rhetoric of practice” at first so convincing but then, on second thought, so agonizingly difficult to understand? To answer, we need to reconsider the intersection of rhetoric and practice. Among the many authors dealing with this subject, Farrell (1999) has examined rhetoric in terms of practice, and practice in terms of rhetoric, and his questions are very close to those I pose below. However, we differ in our basic interests—philosophy for him, ethnography for me—and while Farrell examines the political<br>

  Author(s) Shelton Anthony<br>
  Abstract: In
                  The conflict of interpretations(1974), Paul Ricoeur makes a distinction between three types of knowledge based on their different epistemological ascriptions. These distinctions provide a useful starting point for discussion about the variants of anthropological discourse and their relationship with what I have termed elsewhere, ‘the three museologies’ (Shelton 1995b: 7). Briefly, Ricoeur distinguishes between what we might call a culture’s operative discourses, disciplinary regimes of knowledge, and critical philosophy. This latter practice subjects the first two narrative forms to analytical scrutiny or, to use a postmodernist idiom, fields a sustained ‘incredulity to meta-narratives’ (Lyotard 1984: xxiv).

Because we are biologically situated in a specific spatial (social and cultural) and temporal (historical) context, we can do nothing other than look from a specific standpoint (casu quo perspective) at what lies behind us.

  THE RECEPTION OF ARISTOTLE’S ETHICA NICOMACHEA IN THE HEIMELIJKHEID DER HEIMELIJKHEDEN (SECRET OF SECRETS) BY JACOB VAN MAERLANT from:

  Author(s) BORGHART Pieter<br>
  Abstract: The period of the High Middle Ages (twelfth-thirteenth century) is often regarded as a ‘renaissance’ of the ancient philosophy from a cultural historical point of view. This is especially true for Aristotelism, that was rediscovered from the twelfth century onwards through a real boom in Latin translations of original texts by Aristotle (translated both directly from Greek and indirectly from Arabic), spuria and Arabic commentaries. Although the largest part of the

  Book Title: Origins and Ends of the Mind-Philosophical Essays on Psychoanalysis<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): Brassier Ray<br>
  Abstract: Psychoanalysis claims that the individual human mind is structured by its childhood relationships with its parents. But the theory of attachment, evolutionary psychology and contemporary philosophy of mind have all recently re-introduced new dimensions of innateness into mental development and pathology. If attachment is an instinct, then what is the psychological status of the child's relation to the mother? If the mind is in part a product of evolution, then how far down do the inhibitory mechanisms of the mind go? If the mind of the child is shaped by their encounter with a set of prohibitions, how, in the light of contemporary 'cognitive science' and philosophy of mind, can the child be conceived as 'taking on' a rule? How is the construction of the mind related to the normative ends of cognitive experience? Today, it is Lacanian psychoanalysis which most vigorously defends psychoanalytic theory and practice from the encroachment of the biological and 'cognitive' sciences. But a paradigm shift nevertheless appears to be underway, in which the classical psychoanalytic theories about the Oedipus complex, primary and secondary repression, sexual difference and psychosexuality, the role of symbols,etc, are being dismantled and reintegrated into a new synthesis of biological and psychological theories. In this collection of theoretical essays by philosophers and psychoanalysts, encounters are brought about between Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalysis on the one hand, and attachment theory, evolutionary psychology and philosophy of mind on the other.<br>

  Author(s) Beeckman Tinneke<br>
  Abstract: In what way can Freudian psychoanalysis help contribute to a naturalist, yet non-reductionist anthropology? Such an anthropology would be one that takes into account the significance of the natural history of the human species for our understanding of the human being, but without reducing the specificity of the human to processes of natural or sexual selection. The question of reductionism is all the more relevant today given that naturalism has become a major paradigm in contemporary philosophy. Simply put, naturalism’s basic tenet is that human beings are genealogically related to each other and have common ancestors with other species. Nevertheless,<br>

  Abstract: Psychoanalysis has, from its origins, remained indifferent to or suspicious towards ontology. More precisely, the practice of psychoanalysis has not necessitated that clinical psychoanalysts intervene directly in ontological questioning, whether implicitly or explicitly. Even in the most volatile moments of its struggles to sustain itself as a singular practice, psychoanalysis has remained relatively unmoved in the face of the counter-claims, concepts and criticisms coming from philosophy — and,
                  a fortiori, from philosophical ontologies. Indeed, the reverse seems to have been the case: it is philosophers who have had to respond, with some urgency, to the challenges offered by psychoanalysis. However<br>

Since then, both in narrative and in the more abstract discourses of religion, philosophy, and, more recently, science and medicine, there has been a continuing dialogue, or an imagined dialogue, with those sited beyond, or just on the borders of language: with animals, infants, angels, the dead, the inanimate objects of nature, and the inanimate (or animate) constructions<br>

  Book Title: Scientific Understanding-Philosophical Perspectives<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Eigner Kai<br>
  Abstract: To most scientists, and to those interested in the sciences, understanding is the ultimate aim of scientific endeavor. In spite of this, understanding, and how it is achieved, has received little attention in recent philosophy of science.
      Scientific Understandingseeks to reverse this trend by providing original and in-depth accounts of the concept of understanding and its essential role in the scientific process. To this end, the chapters in this volume explore and develop three key topics: understanding and explanation, understanding and models, and understanding in scientific practice.Earlier philosophers, such as Carl Hempel, dismissed understanding as subjective and pragmatic. They believed that the essence of science was to be found in scientific theories and explanations. In Scientific Understanding, the contributors maintain that we must also consider the relation between explanations and the scientists who construct and use them. They focus on understanding as the cognitive state that is a goal of explanation and on the understanding of theories and models as a means to this end.The chapters in this book highlight the multifaceted nature of the process of scientific research. The contributors examine current uses of theory, models, simulations, and experiments to evaluate the degree to which these elements contribute to understanding. Their analyses pay due attention to the roles of intelligibility, tacit knowledge, and feelings of understanding. Furthermore, they investigate how understanding is obtained within diverse scientific disciplines and examine how the acquisition of understanding depends on specific contexts, the objects of study, and the stated aims of research.<br>

  Abstract: Since Thomas Kuhn’s characterization of science by means of a list of epistemic values that provide “

Kuhn’s list comprised such values as empirical accuracy, consistency, scope, simplicity, and fruitfulness (Kuhn 1977, 321–22), which, as he argued, can be seen as constitutive of science. An enterprise could have different criteria for judging theories, but then it would not be science (331).<br>

These three thinkers excavate the occult sites of Western philosophy, radically questioning their social integrity and viability and obstinately pointing to their flawed logic as ways of recognizing liberalism’s ethical obligation to unassimilable Otherness—Dussel in his reconsideration of modernity from its underside, Young in her all-out offensive against liberalism’s “innocent spaces” and “essentially contested concepts,” and Mbembe in his redefinition of sovereignty as necropolitics, the power to decide who lives and who dies.

  Book Title: Externalism-Putting Mind and World Back Together Again<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Rowlands Mark<br>
  Abstract: The externalist conception of the mind was one of the most significant developments in the philosophy of mind in the second half of the twentieth century. Despite its central importance, however, most recent work on externalism has been very technical, often making the basic ideas and principles difficult for students to grasp. As well, comparatively little work has been done to situate externalism in the history of philosophy, in either analytic and continental traditions. Mark Rowlands remedies both these problems, presenting a clear and accessible introduction to externalism that is grounded in wider developments in the history of philosophy. Rowlands discusses Sartre's radical reversal of idealism and the Husserlian views that prompted it; Wittgenstein's attack on the assimilation of meaning and understanding to an inner process; Putnam's and Burge's thought experiments and the externalism about content to which those experiments gave rise; the scope and limits of content externalism; and the extension of externalism to consciousness.<br>

  Abstract: As we saw in Chapter 3, what Kant referred to as his “Copernican revolution” in philosophy was motivated by the
                  matching problem.According to Kant, if our knowledge-acquiring faculties are capable of yielding knowledge of the world, as they certainly seem to be, then this must be because they must, in some way, match up to the world. There must be some sort offitormatchbetween the nature of our knowledge-acquiring faculties and the nature of the world. The question of how knowledge is possible, then, translates into a question about how this matching can occur. Kant’s answer<br>

  Abstract: The three chapters that make up this section address questions of identity from perspectives rooted in the disciplines of literary studies, anthropology, and classics, which themselves are simultaneously inflected by ideas drawn from such other domains as history, philosophy, political studies, and sociology. Each considers not so much the frequently discussed ways in which our identities are subject to alteration under conditions of war, but rather the processes whereby identities become mobilized in warʹs many different representational contexts, including commemorative rites and monuments, in order to produce, respectively, political resistance (Jennifer James), social solidarity (Serguei Oushakine), and civic virtue (James<br>

  Abstract: Although the Italians played a seminal role in the development of the Western civility tradition, it was during the reign of the French absolutist monarchs that civil etiquette became substantially associated with the preservation of privilege. The fact that egalitarian Protestantism was a minority movement in France allowed the French monarchs to adhere to an etiquette philosophy based on a social philosophy of distinction and superiority. In this chapter we would like to review the transition from etiquette to civility in France and discuss important aspects of French civil society prior to the twentieth century.

  Abstract: In Part I we tried to show how France, America, and England developed different civility preferences due to the manner in which each nation was affected by a variety of factors, including political philosophy and system of government, religion, intellectual history, geography, economy, familial norms, and the manner in which emotions were restrained and expressed. By the close of the nineteenth century each nation possessed its own civility and interaction ethos. The industrialization of the West did not have a substantial levelling effect over national identity or national ideology.<br>

  1  The Origin of Language from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3138/9781442695344">Herder's Political Thought</a><br>
  Abstract: Eighteenth-century philosophers were intensely interested in the question of language origination, for it raised a host of wider questions concerning the relationship between language and cognition, and the operations of the mind. Differences throughout Europe were equally evident in the disputes within the Berlin Academy. Heavily influenced by the French philosopher Étienne Bonnet de Condillac, the academy’s President Pierre Moreau de Maupertius delivered a lecture in 1756 that attempted to demonstrate how human beings naturally created and perfected language.¹ Johann Süßmilch, a skilled exponent of the Wolffian school of philosophy, responded in his

  Abstract: Herder’s expressivist theory of language marks a distinctive break from the designative view of language held by both rationalists and empiricists in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Put simply, according to the designative view, a word is a sign that ‘stands in for’ by serving as a substitute, or kind of proxy, for the object or idea it represents.¹ It is predicated on the long-held belief in the hierarchical dependence of language on the prior existence of thought, a position known in philosophy as ‘internalism.’ Herder rejects the very possibility of non-symbolic thought and instead develops a view of language<br>

  Abstract: Starting with the court of Frederick II and the poetics of the Sicilian school, a doctrine of love with its origins in philosophy and medical science was disseminated. The elevation of the imagination by the Sicilian school had its highest manifestation in Giacomo da Lentini, for whom the image of the beloved, painted in the lover’s heart, corresponded to the Aristotelian notion of the phantasm, the

  Abstract: In
                  Existence and Analogy(p. 64), E. L. Mascall suggests that it would be interesting to discuss the existentialism of St. Thomas Aquinas in relation to contemporary philosophies known by the same name. In the past, Catholic philosophy has been dominated and distorted by an essentialist, Cartesian interpretation of St. Thomas and many have come to regard him as a Christianized Aristotle and his philosophy as a completely idealist, rationalistic and closed system. The dominant place given to atheism and freedom in Sartre’s writings can only be fully understood as a reaction against this essentialist Thomism. In contrast to such<br>

  Abstract: Existentialism was first recognized as a valid and also a notorious school of philosophy during the Second World War, especially after the defeat of France. The fall of France was a matter of vital concern for every Frenchman and it would be difficult to overestimate the impact of France’s defeat in 1940 upon the French mind. To many, it was a blind force which had overcome them, for which they could discover no reason. To most, the defeat of France by its traditional enemy—Germany—was deeply humiliating. For almost every Frenchman, the sudden collapse of his country came as<br>

  Abstract: One of the most noteworthy characteristics of the writings of Marcel, Sartre, Camus and Simone de Beauvoir is that their philosophy is expressed not only in traditional discursive form but also in plays and novels. A question that we must ask is why philosophy is expressed in this way? It would be absurd for rational philosophers such as Spinoza and Leibniz to express philosophy in imaginative works because the subjective idea which the word embodies is reality for them and this reality is beyond any temporal process.<br>

  Abstract: The method of philosophy which the French non-Christian existentialists choose is phenomenology, which has been inherited from Husserl and Heidegger, and if the approach of Sartre and his followers to philosophy is to be understood their debt to these two German thinkers must be remembered. The Christian existentialists have also, in their own way, been interested in phenomenology. Marcel developed his own phenomenological method before Husserl’s works were known and he is regarded by some as a more authentic phenomenologist than Husserl or the non-Christian existentialists.¹ Gilson affirms that the phenomenological method has effected the most profound study of the<br>

Whether this is true or not, it is important to see that the main purpose of all existentialists is to restore realism to philosophy.

  Abstract: Seldom in the history of thought have men made such absolute declarations of an atheist position as those made by the French non-Christian existentialists. Nietzsche declared that “God is dead” and a whole philosophy has been built up contingent upon that. Sartre writes in

  Chapter Ten  CONCLUSION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3138/j.ctt1vxm95x">French Existentialism</a><br>
  Abstract: There is a common tendency to regard existentialism as a passing fad rather than as a valid philosophy. This has been largely due to the existentialist writers’ presentation of certain risqué themes as well as to the wide distribution of Sartre’s journalistic and artistic writings. However, this popularizing is due not to a desire for scandal only, but, more fundamentally, to the moral mission which Sartre has assigned himself, to bring as many men as possible to an awareness of themselves and of their freedom. Though there are elements in the philosophies of the non-Christian existentialists which encourage scandal and<br>

  Abstract: Is each of us the main character in a story we tell about ourselves, or is this narrative understanding of selfhood misguided and possibly harmful? Are selves and persons the same thing? And what does the possibility of sudden death mean for our ability to understand the narrative of ourselves?For the first time, this collection brings together figures in contemporary philosophy and Kierkegaard studies to explore pressing questions like these in the philosophy of personal identity and moral psychology. These essays will both advance important ongoing discussions of selfhood and expand the light that, 200 years after his birth, Kierkegaard is still able to shed on contemporary problems.<br>

  Author(s) STOKES PATRICK<br>
  Abstract: Questions of self-constitution and personal identity have been amongst the most heavily contested topics in Anglophone philosophy over the last half-century. Yet the pedigree of this discussion goes back considerably further. Such questions are clearly at work as early as the second-century theologians Athenagoras and Irenaeus, who worried about how identity could be preserved in bodily resurrection,¹ and this eschatological dimension to the question was still very much alive in early modern discussions of mind and identity. Even Locke’s treatment of personal identity in his

  Author(s) RUDD ANTHONY<br>
  Abstract: There has been a good deal of discussion in recent philosophy of narrative theories of personal identity and of ethics.¹ And there have been lively debates among Kierkegaard scholars about whether, and to what extent, Kierkegaard can be considered a narrative theorist, and the relevance of his thought to discussions of narrative in contemporary philosophy.² In some of these discussions, though, there has been a tendency to consider the notion of narrative apart from the broader philosophical context in which it was introduced by the chief founders of modern narrative theory – Alasdair MacIntyre, Charles Taylor and Paul Ricoeur.³ For them<br>

  Author(s) STOKES PATRICK<br>
  Abstract: Personal identity theory is a rather odd sort of hybrid: born of philosophy of mind and metaphysics, with some pneumatology and soteriology a bit further back in the family tree, and eccentric uncle philosophy of religion living in the shed out the back (where the others let him potter around doing his own thing, hoping he’ll eventually move out). When narrative theory married into this family, having been introduced in the 1980s via philosophy of history and through the dual tracks of MacIntyrean virtue ethics and Ricoeurian hermeneutics, it brought a much-needed infusion of ethics, value theory and philosophical psychology<br>

  Author(s) HELMS ELEANOR<br>
  Abstract: The controversy over the role of narrative in Kierkegaard’s philosophy concerns whether it is desirable for a self to be able to produce some kind of life-narrative. Anthony Rudd, extending the work of Marya Schechtman in
                  The Constitution of Selves, insists that while lives have unity beyond the explicit narratives we tell, we should be able to provide articulated narratives when asked (Rudd 2012: 180, 205; Schechtman 1996: 113–19). John Lippitt has argued, on the other hand, that an important feature of selfhood is the recognition that life resists narrative (2007: 45). In other words, Rudd claims it is<br>

  Abstract: In
                  Kierkegaard and the Quest for Unambiguous Life, I sought to read Kierkegaard in the particular context of modernist literature, politics, philosophy and religion that spanned the period from late romanticism through to existentialism. Inevitably, this is a categorisation that is difficult to define precisely, either historically or conceptually. Nevertheless, we can see many of the diverse movements and figures of the modernist breakthrough as sharing a concern to achieve a decisively unambiguous life, piercing through the superficial compromises of bourgeois society, looking reality in the face, and affirming the truth of iving personality.

  Abstract: French philosophy today is laying fresh claim to the human. This is not to be mistaken for an exercise in winding back the clock, nor is it a return to previous ideas of the human, much less a coordinated ‘human turn’. It is a series of fundamentally independent and yet strikingly simultaneous initiatives arising across the diverse landscape of French thought to transform and rework the figure of the human. Whereas the latter decades of the twentieth century adopted a decidedly critical and cautious approach to the question of ‘the human’, imprisoning it within the iron bars of scare quotes<br>

It is easy to think, on the one hand, that Meillassoux’s arguments are all spectacular, unheard-of and revolutionary, or to assume, on the other hand, that he is playing a game with his reader, and cannot possibly mean what he says in earnest.

  Abstract: Levinas’s philosophy could be described as a theory of subjectivity first, and a theory of ethics second. If this observation stands up, it does so not only with respect to conceptual focus, but also chronology: his early works barely mention ethics at all. His ideas sprang out of a vehement critique of philosophies of ontology, where ‘ontology’ came to be defined by Levinas somewhat idiosyncratically as the reduction of the other to the same via a conception of being.¹ His thinking is preoccupied with the question of how we understand ourselves in our place in the world, but also the<br>

  Abstract: Having provided an overview of the various ways we might read Levinas in relation to law, and the issues they raise, it is time to put forward the substantive argument of the book. This is the first of two concluding chapters making the argument that Levinas is best read as someone who offers us the possibility of thinking about ethics as perpetual critique of the law, rather than as a legal theorist. In other words, instead of using his work to think about how we inject ethics into law or unveil law’s ethical foundation, his philosophy provides resources to understand<br>

  Abstract: Despite his interest in a non-sovereign and anomial politics, Agamben makes scant reference to thinkers in the anarchist tradition.¹ However, particularly with the turn to questions of government and economy in his latest works, he delves increasingly into themes at the heart of anarchist philosophy: the renunciation of property and the practice of poverty as a means of living outside of determination by law and state; the negative and positive moments of transformation variously associated with revolt or revolution; the ‘idea of communism’ and the figure of ‘the Ungovernable’.

  Abstract: Agamben and Badiou are rarely discussed together, especially in the context of politics. Even though both authors reached the height of their international fame at the same time and represented the next wave in continental philosophy after the predominance of ‘post-structuralism’, the difference of their interests, influences and, not the least, styles often makes it difficult to see what common tendency these authors exhibit.

This chapter will consider the consequences of the loss of philosophy, discussed in the previous chapter, on Sontag’s performance of the public intellectual. Philosophy’s metamorphosis into an incomplete critical discourse that resists the ‘spectral and mortuary cosmos’ of total reproduction¹ both enhanced and questioned her public image. Progressively, she realised that the public intellectual is pinned to a scene of utterance that produces assenting crowds, and therefore is thrown into question. The second part of this chapter<br>

They helped her embrace the precariousness of a cultural expanse, symbolised by the city environment, where the philosopher is one with the archetype of the solitary artist lost in the crowd, where thinking and writing are experienced as a pressure coming from the outside: ‘I write what I can: that is, what’s given to me and what seems worth writing, by me’ (‘Singleness’ 259)<br>

What does it mean to think? Foucault has never dealt with any other problem (hence his debt to Heidegger). And the historical? It is formations which are stratified, made up of strata.

  Chapter 5  Critical Problematization in Foucault and Deleuze: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g052qn">Between Deleuze and Foucault</a><br>
  Author(s) Koopman Colin<br>
  Abstract: In a 1972 conversation concerning the role of philosophy in the work of social critique, Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze put forward a conception of critical theory that resonates widely throughout the varied terrains of their work. At the heart of the conception they constructed together in “Intellectuals and Power” is a radical revisioning of the work that philosophy should expect of itself insofar as philosophy can legitimately expect itself to engage present social, cultural, ethical and political problems. Foucault and Deleuze clearly expected such engagements of themselves. Much of their work is located, in different ways of course, at<br>

  Chapter 8  Speaking Out For Others: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g052qn">Between Deleuze and Foucault</a><br>
  Author(s) Sholtz Janae<br>
  Abstract: There are many obvious intersections between Deleuze and Foucault: the relation of desire and pleasure; the structures of
                  agencement and dispositif; and, the self-relation as the fold. These intersections are especially evident and determinable insofar as Deleuze wrote about Foucault and Foucault wrote about Deleuze. Yet, it is remarkable thatbothDeleuze and Foucault, each at the end of his life, wrote about philosophy itself. Of course, Deleuze’s last great book (written with Guattari), appearing in 1991, is calledWhat is Philosophy?¹ Yet, Foucault’s last two courses at the Collège de France from 1982 to 1984 aim to answer the<br>

  Abstract: This chapter sketches an account of the relationship between Deleuze and Foucault that seeks to delve beneath the superficial view that they were fellow travelers in philosophy as in politics. It is inspired by the view that the more closely one looks at their work the more one sees differences between them. Before turning to some of their differences, I note some of the essential facts about their relationship.¹<br>

  [Part I: Introduction] from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g09v6s">The Edinburgh Companion to Poststructuralism</a><br>
  Abstract: In Chapter 1, ‘Poststructuralism and Modern European Philosophy’, Lumsden emphasises the connection between poststructuralism and post-Kantian idealism, Hegel in particular. Key here is Heidegger’s reading of the history of philosophy and how it has, implicitly and explicitly, functioned as the interpretative frame through which poststructuralism itself approaches the history of philosophy. This, for Lumsden, explains why Hegel, at least in the case of Deleuze and Derrida, is the confluence and culmination of all the problematic strains that run through modern philosophy.<br>

  Chapter 1  Poststructuralism and Modern European Philosophy from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g09v6s">The Edinburgh Companion to Poststructuralism</a><br>
  Author(s) Lumsden Simon<br>
  Abstract: The relation of poststructuralism to modern philosophy is an enormous topic. The sheer number of poststructuralist figures and the even more diverse range of modern philosophers make it difficult to do justice to the complex and diverse nature of the relation. One thing that is central to poststructuralist thought, as it is in the other great strand of twentieth-century European thought, hermeneutics, is a mindfulness that the concepts and approaches it has developed cannot be understood in isolation from the philosophical tradition. Gadamer sees his thought on a continuum with the tradition; his own philosophical innovations have to be understood<br>

  Author(s) Besley A. C. (Tina)<br>
  Abstract: Western philosophy has had a continuous engagement with the problem of subjectivity and with the self as a locus of both consciousness and experience – a question that is deemed to be open to understanding, analysis and philosophical reflection – ever since the first moments of institutional philosophy in Ancient Greece. The notion of the self has been an object of inquiry, a problem and a locus for posing questions concerning knowledge, action and ethics since Antiquity. Plato and Aristotle in different ways inquired of the self in terms that we understand today as personhood and personal identity, viewing the<br>

  Abstract: In Chapter 11, ‘Derrida’s Language: Play,
                  Différanceand (Con)text’, Anderson defends the Derridean project against some of its most well-known and influential critics. Interrogating the notion that Derrida’s work implies the radicalisation of language as a ‘play of differences’, Anderson shows how this can be used to justify various types of readings (she notes the important influence of Richard Rorty in this context) that have reduced his work to an ‘anything goes’ philosophy. Further, other critics such as Searle and Habermas have, Anderson argues, unfairly labelled Derrida’s work as perpetuating indeterminacy and nihilism. Against these images and misreadings of Derrida,<br>

  Abstract: Like a great many of the authors discussed in this book, Irigaray would probably contest her labelling as a ‘poststructuralist’¹ and her work is so varied and draws on such a wide range of sources and methodological traditions that any categorisation risks excluding or eliding important aspects of her thinking. What I think is important, however, and the value that this opportunity provides is to look again at her work and to do so alongside those other authors whose work contributes to the great Western canon of philosophy, the interrogation of which Irigaray has dedicated a great deal of her<br>

  Kant and the Analytic Tradition from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g09xfc">The Edinburgh Companion to Twentieth-Century Philosophies</a><br>
  Author(s) Hanna Robert<br>
  Abstract: The influence of the eighteenth-century Critical Philosophy of Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) on the analytic tradition is both originative and protean.¹ Analytic philosophy historically emerged from an extended theoretical struggle with Kant’s Critical metaphysical doctrine of
                  transcendental idealism. But even more than that, the very idea of analysis can be made theoretically intelligible only in relation to Kant’s basic Critical philosophical aims, methods, and theses. Quite ironically, however, precisely to the extent that the analytic tradition finally pulled itself free from its Kantian roots and became an independent philosophical enterprise closely associated with the methods, epistemology, and metaphysics of the<br>

  Author(s) Armour Leslie<br>
  Abstract: The metaphysical and moral idealism that dominated philosophy in Britain and North America in the last decades of the nineteenth-century reached its zenith in the early years of the twentieth-century. It then faced serious challenges, but it also received support from unexpected sources – first from physicists like Sir James Jeans and Sir Arthur Eddington and then from Kurt Gödel, thought by many to be the most original logician and mathematician of the century. Idealism’s proponents continued to struggle, but at the end of the century the movement was showing signs of returning to its roots in reflection on the<br>

  Author(s) Jolley Kelly Dean<br>
  Abstract: Ludwig Wittgenstein revered the work of Gottlob Frege and kept tabs on the location of obscure works of Frege in the Cambridge library. J. L. Austin translated Frege’s
                  Foundations of Arithmeticinto English and made it a part of the philosophy curriculum at Oxford. I mention these facts because the tradition of Ordinary Language Philosophy (OLP) began with Frege. Frege’s three essays in hisLogical Investigations, along with his ‘On Concept and Object,’ were the first essays of OLP. Beginning the story of OLP with Frege helps to bring certain features in the tradition rightly to the front: in particular,<br>

  Author(s) Burge Tyler<br>
  Abstract: The last half of the twentieth century in philosophy of language has seen, I hazard to say, some of the most intense and intellectually powerful discussions in any academic field during the period.¹ Yet the achievements in these areas have not been widely appreciated by the general intellectual public. This is partly because they are abstract and difficult. But it is also partly a reflection of the lamentably weak lines of communication between philosophy and the rest of culture, especially in America. In my view, this situation developed during the professionalization of philosophy in the positivist period. Indeed, positivism’s harsh<br>

  Abstract: I want to outline some of the main developments in the philosophy of mind in the last half of the twentieth century. Behaviorism dominated psychology during approximately the same period that logical positivism dominated philosophy. The principles of behaviorism are less easily stated than those of logical positivism. It is perhaps better seen as a method that eschewed use of mentalistic vocabulary in favor of terms that made reference to dispositions to behavior. Both movements aimed at banishing nonscientific speculation, and forcing theory to hew as closely as possible to methods of confirmation. Both methodological doctrines came to be seen<br>

  Author(s) Avigad Jeremy<br>
  Abstract: The philosophy of mathematics plays an important role in analytic philosophy, both as a subject of inquiry in its own right, and as an important landmark in the broader philosophical landscape. Mathematical knowledge has long been regarded as a paradigm of human knowledge with truths that are both necessary and certain, so giving an account of mathematical knowledge is an important part of
                  epistemology. Mathematical objects like numbers and sets are archetypical examples of abstracta, since we treat such objects in our discourse as though they are independent of time and space; finding a place for such objects in a<br>

  Author(s) Jones-Imhotep Edward<br>
  Abstract: Philosophy of science, in the past 100 years, has been propelled forward by the rapid expansion of the natural sciences, and by the coincidental rise of analytic philosophy. Many of the core issues galvanized in the philosophy of science from the 1930s through the 1960s continue to be debated – for example, the nature of causation, the realism/anti-realism controversy in science, and the intricacies of what constitutes scientific explanation.¹ Perhaps less appreciated as a trend in the philosophy of science, however, is the inclusion into the discipline of explanations and theories that have a social or sociological aspect.

  Abstract: Political philosophy plays virtually no role in the early history of analytic philosophy. The most prominent political philosopher after Mill, Thomas Hill Green, had too much of Kant and Rousseau to suit the tastes of the early analytic philosophers. G. E. Moore and C. D. Broad concerned themselves with ethics, not political philosophy. Bertrand Russell went on to write political works, but they had virtually no philosophical stature or influence. But what really blocked the development of an analytic political philosophy was the rise of logical positivism and ordinary language philosophy.

  Author(s) Christopherson Erik S.<br>
  Abstract: Analytical philosophers in the twentieth century have produced a rich literature that includes the philosophy of religious language and practice, analyses of divine attributes, arguments for and against the existence of God, and arguments over the significance of religious diversity, religious experience, and religious values. Theists, atheists, agnostics, and adherents to both Christian and nonChristian religions have engaged in a fruitful exchange on these topics with all the hallmarks of analytical philosophy: an emphasis on conceptual clarity, the use of analyses with examples and counter-examples, concentrated arguments about whether concepts of what exists (God, the soul, the afterlife) may be<br>

  Abstract: To begin with, whereas the term ‘analytic’ is meant to describe a style or method of inquiry, ‘Continental’ refers to a large, rather vaguely defined landmass in Europe; contrasting the two seems to involve a category mistake.

  Author(s) Baugh Bruce<br>
  Abstract: Hegel’s philosophy was renewed and transformed by twentieth-century Continental philosophy. Instead of being a conservative Idealist, Hegel emerged as a revolutionary in thought and politics, a Romantic theorist of the strivings for unity of an alienated and divided self, a thinker who anticipated Freud by attempting to subject the unconscious to rational analysis, and a ‘dramatist’ of the struggle or

  Author(s) Lawlor Leonard<br>
  Abstract: The term ‘phenomenology’ enters philosophical discourse for the first time in 1764, when J. H. Lambert uses it in his
                  Neues Organon. In a 1770 letter to Lambert, Kant defines the term as a ‘negative science,’ presupposed by metaphysics, in which the principles of sensibility would be determined. The term remains obscure until Hegel’s 1807Phenomenology of Spirit. As in Kant, in Hegel too, phenomenology is presupposed by metaphysics but also subordinated to metaphysics; phenomenology is a part of the philosophy of spirit, which itself is a part (along with the philosophy of nature and the logic) of the encyclopedia<br>

  Author(s) Grondin Jean<br>
  Abstract: Hermeneutics serves to characterize a broad current in contemporary Continental philosophy that deals with the issues of interpretation and stresses the historical and linguistic nature of our world-experience. In contemporary thought, it is mostly associated with the thinking of Hans-Georg Gadamer (1900–2002) and Paul Ricoeur (1913–2005), who situate themselves in the hermeneutic tradition of thinkers such as Wilhelm Dilthey (1833–1911) and Martin Heidegger (1889–1976). All these authors unfolded a distinct
                  philosophicalunderstanding of hermeneutics that drew on the more ancient tradition of hermeneutics, which was traditionally understood as an art of interpretation (ars hermeneutica, Auslegungslehre) that<br>

  Author(s) McBride William L.<br>
  Abstract: The word ‘existentialism’ became widely used to identify a major movement of twentieth-century thought during the mid-1940s, immediately following the end of World War II. It had, it is true, already been employed by some philosophers: Gabriel Marcel, a committed Christian thinker, had made use of the language of existentialism in the 1920s; the Italian Nicola Abbagnano had elaborated a version of it in his
                  La struttura dell’esistenza(1939); and in the form ofExistenzphilosophie, for which ‘existential philosophy’ was regarded by many as the most suitable English translation, it had been appropriated by both Martin Heidegger and Karl Jaspers.<br>

  Author(s) Schrag Calvin O.<br>
  Abstract: Discourse about difference, as it plays itself out in the philosophical arena, has been on the table for some time. It is not a philosophical topic of recent date. Questions about the role of discourse about difference extend all the way back to the beginnings of Western philosophy, and there is a substantial literature that testifies of difference as a topic that elicited attention in the Eastern philosophy and religion of more distant times. It would appear to be an issue that resides at the very core of philosophical reflection both past and present.<br>

  Abstract: Philosophies of difference, where difference holds its ground without being subordinated to identity, are exceedingly rare. It is not by chance that the fortunes of philosophical heterologies are better served inside process philosophies. Although to be a process philosopher is not a guarantee that one will also be a philosopher of pure difference, movement and the reflection on movement that constitute the raison d’être of the philosophies of process offer a rich soil for the nurture of difference. But a process philosophy, in order to support a purely heterological thought, has to be capable of doing without subjects steering the<br>

  Abstract: Life by itself does not constitute a ‘twentieth-century philosophy.’ But it amounted to a constant theme throughout the twentieth century since European philosophers in particular continuously appropriate and transform the concept of life. So, after the nineteenth-century philosophies of vitalism and
                  Lebensphilosophie, two major philosophical movements centering on the concept of life – Bergsonism and Husserlian phenomenology – dominated European philosophy up to the end of the 1920s. However, in 1927, Heidegger published hisBeing and Time.

  Abstract: Political philosophy as usually conceived has two branches. On the one hand, it addresses the concerns of already established political life: the moral justification of political authority, the limits of power in maintaining that authority, the rights and duties of citizens with respect to that power, and other such topics. On the other hand, it also addresses the ontology of political life: the basic concepts of human plurality, living in common in ordered societies, freedom, sovereignty, and the like. Continental political philosophers tend to deal with these topics somewhat differently from their Anglo-American (or analytic) counterparts. By and large, Continental<br>

  Author(s) Angelova Emilia<br>
  Abstract: Continental feminist philosophy is a movement of thought unified by the theme of the difference of woman and the difference of the feminine. But it is by no means monolithic in method or content. It begins with Simone de Beauvoir’s existentialist feminism in the 1940s. For de Beauvoir, the free transcendence of the ‘independent woman’ wrests her from linear history and orients her to something more than equal rights for man and woman, something more than egalitarian ideals. With May 1968 a new phase of French feminist theory began, bringing along with it aesthetic experiences, influences from deconstruction, psychoanalysis and<br>

  Author(s) Westphal Merold<br>
  Abstract: Much of Continental philosophy of religion is reflection on faith (as response to revelation) and reason (as philosophical reflection). Having made the linguistic turn, it intersects with analytic discussion of the problem of religious language, at least if the question is understood as concerning the nature and limits of our God-talk rather than its warrant. Since philosophy often takes the form of phenomenology, the question can be put this way: does reason, so conceived, prescribe the limits within which our Godtalk must stay (as in Kant’s

  Abstract: Whitehead described Western philosophy as a footnote to Plato’s. As recent philosophical tradition has shown, some footnotes have established texts of their own. Aesthetics is one such footnote. Whereas Plato banished aesthetics to the realm of
                  doxa, Continental philosophy stands witness since the late nineteenth century to a renaissance of aesthetic thought. Now, not only has the discipline achieved a philosophical autonomy but aesthetics has come to haunt those philosophies that marginalize the apparent and the subjective. If earlier forms of aesthetics feted order, recent forms of twentieth-century Continental philosophy are attracted to the sublime and its disruptive power. The<br>

Despite the vigorous affirmation by the German Romantics of the value of Sanskrit poetry and literature, and the celebration by philologists like Max Mueller of the cultural and linguistic proximity of Sanskritic civilization to Europe, the European philosophical tradition, with perhaps the exception of Schopenhauer, has rejected the idea of an Indian ‘philosophy.’ Classical Indian ‘philosophy’ was not regarded as at par, in terms of rigor and rationality, with the products of European civilization. Indian thinking was devalued as being thoroughly religious in character or<br>

  Chinese Philosophy from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g09xfc">The Edinburgh Companion to Twentieth-Century Philosophies</a><br>
  Author(s) Ames Roger T.<br>
  Abstract: Mainstream philosophy in the twentieth century has been Anglo-European philosophy. This observation is as true in Tokyo, Seoul, Beijing, Delhi, Nairobi, as it is in Boston London, Paris, and Frankfurt. That is, the indigenous philosophies of East Asia, South Asia, Africa, and indeed America too have been marginalized within their own cultural sites by the dominance of what has been called the Anglo-European analytic and Continental traditions of philosophy. It is within this historical framework that we must distinguish clearly between ‘philosophy in China’ on the one hand, and ‘Chinese philosophy’ on the other.<br>

  Author(s) Janz Bruce B.<br>
  Abstract: African philosophy’s development in the twentieth century is both relatively recent, traceable to some seminal texts, and ancient, drawing on cultural forms that stretch back in time and space. This seeming contradiction can be understood if we realize that philosophy itself is ambiguous. It designates on one hand a set of reflective practices rooted in culture and reason, which rigorously and critically explicate a life-world, and on the other a discipline in the university, with a set of codes, standards, recognized practitioners, and customs. More than almost any other site of philosophy, African philosophy has struggled with the similarities and<br>

  Author(s) Guter Eran<br>
  Abstract: Aesthetics is one of the most intellectually stimulating and enriching fields of philosophical inquiry. This statement may sound a bit strange to anyone who is easily impressed by the longevity of ancient metaphysical problems or by the cutting-edge verve of recent empirically informed debates in the theory of consciousness, or by the applicative promise and popular demand of business ethics, and so tends to dismiss aesthetics as peripheral to philosophy. Yet, as Frank Sibley, one of the important early analytic aestheticians of the twentieth century, has observed, aestheticians encounter ranges of concepts wider than and inevitably inclusive of those studied<br>

  Book Title: The Edinburgh Critical History of Nineteenth-Century Philosophy-  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>

  Abstract: Written by a team of leading international scholars this crucial period of philosophy is examined from the novel perspective of themes and lines of thought which cut across authors, disciplines, and national boundaries. This fresh approach will open up new ways for specialists and students to conceptualise the history of 19th-century thought within philosophy, politics, religious studies and literature.<br>

  Author(s) Stone Alison<br>
  Abstract: Nineteenth-century philosophy can be broadly characterised by several themes: the conflict between metaphysics and religious faith on the one hand and the empirical sciences on the other; a new focus on history, progress and evolution; new ideas of individuality, society and revolution; and ever-increasing concerns about nihilism.¹ This volume provides a re-examination of nineteenth-century philosophy in terms of these and other themes distinctive of the period.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b1vg">The Edinburgh Critical History of Nineteenth-Century Philosophy</a><br>
  Author(s) Nassar Dalia T.<br>
  Abstract: One of the most obscure, yet significant, concepts in early nineteenth-century philosophy is that of the Absolute. As a word, the Absolute came into philosophical discourse with Schelling to mean the ontological ground of and point of identity between subject and object. In this sense Hegel adopted the term in his early works, while in his later writings he came to identify the Absolute with the process and final conclusion of reason. Although it is these figures who employed the words ‘the Absolute’ (
                  das Absolute), the idea of the Absolute as the ontological ground in which subject and object are<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b1vg">The Edinburgh Critical History of Nineteenth-Century Philosophy</a><br>
  Author(s) Huneman Philippe<br>
  Abstract: In the nineteenth century the natural sciences underwent a radical transformation. The paradigms of many of the disciplines that we know today, such as geology, chemistry, thermodynamics, cell biology or evolutionary biology, were established in this period. Prior to this period, knowledge of nature was a part of philosophy, as the examples of Leibniz or Descartes show. Moreover, the Kantian critique of metaphysics from the
                  Critique of Pure Reasononwards had a profound impact on philosophers, especially in Germany. Kant dismissed the traditional objects of philosophical inquiry such as God, the world and the soul, which for Kant were to<br>

  Abstract: In contemporary philosophy the phenomenological movement has offered a compelling challenge to the mind–body dualism that was instituted by Descartes amongst others in the seventeenth century. This challenge, perhaps most notably in the work of the French phenomenologist Maurice Merleau-Ponty, does not consist in the reduction of one of the opposed terms to the other in the manner of a thoroughgoing or ‘eliminative’ materialism but rather rests on a broader critique of both terms. The self, it is argued, is not originally an isolated thinking subject, certain of its own thoughts and separable from the body, whilst the body is<br>

  Author(s) Outhwaite William<br>
  Abstract: This chapter will examine social philosophy in the nineteenth century in terms of three interrelated processes: the consolidation of a conception of society or the social; the reformulation of issues of poverty and inequality in the form of ‘the social question’ and related attempts at social regulation; and the emergence of the social sciences ‘between literature and science’ (see Lepenies [1985] 1988). Although the term ‘rise’ may seem to suggest an inevitable or desirable process, we shall see that the status of the social sciences and the relation between the social and the political were no less contentious at the<br>

  Author(s) Bowie Andrew<br>
  Abstract: Reflections on the relationships between one period of philosophy and another raise important methodological issues which first emerge in their modern form in the wake of Kant, Herder and other thinkers in the second half of the eighteenth century. This is the period in which the ramifications of the idea that philosophy is bound up with the historical circumstances of its production begin to be apparent. In the light of these ramifications, the apparently obvious aim of identifying anticipations or echoes of twentieth-century forms of philosophy in the nineteenth century is by no means as straightforward as it might at<br>

Evanescence is found in the ‘in-between’. The evanescent moment is defined as the event of ‘the philosophical realisation of the art of politics’ (Rancière 1995: 19). As these three trajectories of art, politics and philosophy coalesce to transform themselves as in-between discourse, they emancipate the evanescent moment from being an ideational or mythic impossible utopia, opening out the possibility of a realizable utopia.

  Abstract: Philosophies of Differenceengages the philosophies of Nietzsche, Heidegger, Derrida and Deleuze in order to mark a distinction between philosophical thinking (which perhaps in the work of these thinkers is pushed in some sense to its limit) and a new, more general mode of thinking which will be called non-philosophy. Laruelle’s text itself bridges the diff erence both methodologically and thematically between these two kinds of thought; it is at once philosophicalandnon-philosophical. Keeping in mind that non-philosophy is not meant to be a negation but rather a generalisation of philosophy, we should understand this ‘at once’ as in<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b3gr">François Laruelle’s Philosophies of Difference</a><br>
  Abstract: In the history of modern philosophy, after the systems of Kant and Hegel – systems respectively of the immanent critique and the apotheosis of Reason – the non-rationalist image of philosophy as anti-system or immanently creative Difference is born with Nietzsche. As the first of the three models of Difference analysed by Laruelle, Nietzschean Difference may be considered in an important sense as the base or standard model for the analysis overall.¹ Nietzschean Difference represents, from this point of view, the more general philosophical platform upon which the other, more specialised models of Difference will be constructed. Historically, it is with Nietzsche<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b3gr">François Laruelle’s Philosophies of Difference</a><br>
  Abstract: If for Laruelle Nietzsche establishes the standard model of philosophy as Difference, Heidegger marks the full taking-stock of Difference in relation to the Western tradition as such and draws out the consequences of its immanent critique as the culmination of metaphysics. Whereas Laruelle characterises the Nietzschean model of Difference as one of ‘Idealism’, he designates the Heideggerean model as that of ‘Finitude’. Laruelle’s reading of Heidegger follows the late Heidegger in treating the thought of the ontological difference of Being and beings as still determined and thus relatively constrained by the history of metaphysics. Thus for the late Heidegger, as<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b3gr">François Laruelle’s Philosophies of Difference</a><br>
  Abstract: We noted early in our opening chapter that in
                  Philosophies of DifferenceLaruelle aims to mount a ‘critique that would no longer be a complement, a rectification, a deconstruction, a supplement’, the object of this critique being philosophy’s need ‘to think through unifying duality, through the synthesis of contraries, through the One as All or as unity of contraries, through dialectic and difference’.¹ We are now in a position to understand this aim more precisely with respect to the triad of models of Difference represented by Nietzsche-Deleuze, Heidegger and Derrida respectively, as well as the (partially anachronistic) history they compose.<br>

  Abstract: The discussions provide a jargon-free account of a wide range of historical and contemporary schools of thought about poetic language, and an organised, coherent critique of those schools (including analytical philosophy, cognitive poetics, structuralism and post-structuralism). Via close readings of whole poems from 1600 to the present readers are taken through a wide range of modernist, experimental and innovative poetries. Paired chapters within a chronological structure allow lecturers and students to approach the material in a variety of ways (by individual chapters, paired historical periods) that are appropriate to different courses.<br>

Indeed, one might well have thought that, though of course there were some Christian philosophers then, they were doomed to the same fate as the dodo. But, in a stunning reversal, today Christian philosophy is among the most vibrant areas of philosophy. While the story of that change is still being written, there are a few key factors.

Both were born in Singapore, of Chinese descent, and both became very influential in the dynamic intellectual scene that emerged at the turn of the twentieth century.

That only leaves the present. But as long as the present has duration, any duration at all, it can be divided into the bits of it that have been, and so are not, and the bits of it that are to be, and so are not yet, so that the very duration of its existence consigns it to non-existence.

  Abstract: One of the things that narrative theory can learn from philosophy is a proper sense of the importance of the future. I have suggested several times already that narrative theory shows a preoccupation with memory, retrospect and the archiving of past events, and has an undeveloped potential to address questions about the present and future. The significance of the notions of ‘anticipation’ and ‘prolepsis’ is that, in different ways, they refer to this relation between the present and actual or possible futures. With philosophy as its teacher, narrative theory can turn its attention to narrative not only in its function<br>

Perhaps knowledge of time is in some way the domain of philosophy, so that wherever it is that the novel goes with time, by being beyond the limits of philosophy, it cannot be an adventure in knowledge as such. There are two intimately related questions about knowledge involved in this. The first is the oldest question of all, the question of the relationship between philosophy and literature,<br>

Likewise, the conceptual apparatus used by Buddhism to effect change should not be clung to after their task is fulfilled.

These techniques are dubbed ‘skilful means’ and are the conceptual toolkit of Buddhist philosophy<br>

  Abstract: In a recent TV drama one of the characters falls in love with another. ‘It’s only chemicals,’ his friend assures him, but when the friend finds himself in the same position he is unable to take the same view of his own situation. It would be a caricature to represent the dominant paradigm in contemporary Anglo-American philosophy of mind as holding of all our psychological states, ‘It’s only chemicals.’ Yet this paradigm – functionalism – does hold that each of them is, in fact, a physiological state, but one individuated in terms of its function in mediating between sensory inputs<br>

  Abstract: For much of the last century philosophy of mind has been dominated by the attempt to give an account of mental states that does not have recourse to the Cartesian picture of them as essentially private, in the sense of being only providentially connected with the behaviour through which they are expressed. The states that have seemed particularly recalcitrant to such attempts are our experiences in perception and bodily sensation; for these paradigmatically have a subjective character – a something it is like to have them, as Thomas Nagel puts it¹ – that apparently eludes explanation in terms of the<br>

  Abstract: Within much contemporary analytic philosophy of mind desires are conceived of primarily as the inner states which provide us, together with beliefs, with reasons for forming intentions and consequently acting. When linked with beliefs, such desires then cause us to act in appropriate ways. Desires therefore have a role both in providing premises for practical reasoning and a causal, functional role in terms of the agent’s behaviour. Weaving these two roles together has been one of the challenges of contemporary materialism. Within standard accounts of practical reasoning the agent derives an intention or proceeds to action on the basis of<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r254m">The Idea of Continental Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: In the last chapter I proposed that the thinking about the breakdowns in communication within the contemporary philosophical culture that appeals to the idea of a division between the traditions of analytic and Continental philosophy is part of and does not stand apart from the rotten scene it intends to capture. The plausibility of this proposal would be massively increased if I could demonstrate the independent plausibility of a further proposal: namely, that the very idea of a distinctive Continental tradition in philosophy is confused and distorting. It is a basic aim of this book to substantiate that. In doing<br>

  3  The Usual Suspects from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r254m">The Idea of Continental Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: The engagement with texts outside the mainstream of analytic philosophy that has characterised my own work in philosophy has always involved an effort indirectly to intervene in the regular programming of analytic expectations about such texts. By rendering myself capable of reading these texts I have sought to encourage others to feel less well prepared for what they might encounter. My thought is that without such a disruption they will remain prepared only for the (for them, for everyone) depressing prospect of reading the Other.¹<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r254m">The Idea of Continental Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: The trajectory of this book is entering its most crucial phase. I have promised to look at the major reasons and arguments (perhaps I should say more neutrally that I will look at ‘major texts’) presented by analytic philosophers who have affirmed or embraced the idea of what Gilbert Ryle called the ‘wide gulf’ between Anglo-Saxon ‘philosophical analysis’ and philosophy on ‘the Continent’.¹ It is now time to do so. The texts I will look at are all from the same period: the late 1950s.² As we shall see, the idea of the gulf was already well established by then,<br>

  Abstract: If what the postwar gulf-seekers in the analytic movement would have liked to have expelled from the midst of philosophy in the Englishspeaking world really had been fully expelled (
                  qua actuality as it were) the story of Continental philosophy would perhaps already be a piece of analytical philosophy’s mythological folklore (‘There used to be some people who read that kind of stuff, but not any more, not round here anyway’). Of course, the fundamental argument of the last chapter is that what answers to the idea of Continental philosophy (the risk of ‘sophistry and illusion’) is not something that can<br>

  Abstract: John McCumber claims that there has been no success in construing the ‘split’ between analytic and Continental philosophy ‘in philosophical terms’.¹ In this book I have attempted to succeed where others have failed. However, I have not tried to do so by showing ‘how, after all, the analytic/Continental distinction [can] be drawn’² but, rather, by showing why, after all, it cannot. Yet so pervasive is the 
                  de facto distinction, so serious the breakdown in communication, that we find it hard to resist the idea that there must be something to the distinction. This is where it gets hard to keep<br>

  Book Title: Phenomenology or Deconstruction?-The Question of Ontology in Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Paul Ricoeur and Jean-Luc Nancy<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Watkin Christopher<br>
  Abstract: Phenomenology or Deconstruction? challenges traditional understandings of the relationship between phenomenology and deconstruction through new readings of the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Paul Ricœur and Jean-Luc Nancy. A constant dialogue with Jacques Derrida's engagement with phenomenological themes provides the impetus to establishing a new understanding of 'being' and 'presence' that exposes significant blindspots inherent in traditional readings of both phenomenology and deconstruction.In reproducing neither a stock phenomenological reaction to deconstruction nor the routine deconstructive reading of phenomenology, Christopher Watkin provides a fresh assessment of the possibilities for the future of phenomenology, along with a new reading of the deconstructive legacy. Through detailed studies of the philosophy of Merleau-Ponty, Ricœur and Nancy, he shows how a phenomenological tradition much wider and richer than Husserlian or Heideggerean thought alone can take account of Derrida's critique of ontology and yet still hold a commitment to the ontological. This new reading of being and presence fundamentally re-draws our understanding of the relation of deconstruction and phenomenology, and provides the first sustained discussion of the possibilities and problems for any future 'deconstructive phenomenology'.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r2bgp">Deleuze and Philosophy</a><br>
  Author(s) Baugh Bruce<br>
  Abstract: ‘Essences’ have had a hard time of it in philosophy over the last forty years; on both sides of the analytic–continental divide, ‘essentialism’ is a dirty word. Yet what if we have no adequate idea of what an essence is? It is one of Deleuze’s great virtues that he forces us to think about these questions in new ways, particularly with the theory put forward in his Spinoza books of ‘particular essences’.¹ Since essences are traditionally construed in a more or less Platonic way, as universals or classes which group together individuals in virtue of a set of common<br>

  Author(s) Lamble Sarah<br>
  Abstract: This essay stages a confrontation between the state of precariousness at the level of being and thought in Deleuze’s vitalist ontology of the continuum and that of Badiou’s ontology of the multiple, which lacks the virtual One-All. It wishes to show how a philosophy based on the continuity between being and thought (Deleuze) and a philosophy settling for the disjunction between thought and being (Badiou) situate precariousness according to different co-ordinates.<br>

  Abstract: In this essay I will explore the eco-philosophical aspects of the ethics of becoming, with reference to the project of nomadic subjectivity and sustainability. The urge that prompts this investigation is not only abstract, but also very practical. Nomadic philosophy mobilises one’s affectivity and enacts the desire for in-depth transformations in the status of the kind of subjects we have become. Such in-depth changes, however, are at best demanding and at worst painful processes. My political generation, that of the baby-boomers, has had to come to terms with this harsh reality, which put a check on the intense and often<br>

  Author(s) Lamble Sarah<br>
  Abstract: What does it mean today to speak of intensities in the domain of political philosophy? The intensive, says Deleuze, is the untimely¹. To be untimely, for Deleuze, is the essential task of philosophy, its paradoxical intensity – and on this point, I am in total agreement with him. But still the question must be raised – what is it to be untimely today, in our postmodern situation? That is the point.<br>

  Abstract: It has been said that knowledge, or the problem of knowledge, is the scandal of philosophy. The scandal is philosophy’s apparent inability to show how, when and why we can be sure that we know something or, indeed, that we know anything. Philosopher Michael Williams writes: ‘Is it possible to obtain knowledge 
                  at all? This problem is pressing because there are powerful arguments, some very ancient, for the conclusion that it is not . . .

And indeed, there can be no doubt as to the significance of Lefort’s work for contemporary political philosophy and, in particular, for democracy theory.

                  system – and there is hardly a contradiction here between a post-foundational stance and systematic philosophy. For Badiou, true philosophy is always systematic, yet it is not systematic in the sense of being centered around a keystone: ‘if by “system” you mean, first, that philosophy is conceived as an argumentative discipline with a requirement of coherence, and second, that philosophy never takes the form of a singular body of knowledge but, to use my own vocabulary, exists conditionally with respect to a complex set of truths,<br>

Whether it is accused of anaesthetising an otherwise potentially revolutionary subject or generating war and political conflict, religion is often derided in secular political theory as the basis of unthinking faith, trust in traditional hierarchy, or mystical fanaticism. Against this irrationalism, the dominant forms of contemporary political theory attempt to make sense of the world by diagnosing social and political malignancies and advocating alternative paths to a better world free from the dangerous competition of political viewpoints or the fruitless pursuit of any number of religious<br>

  Book Title: The Unexpected-Narrative Temporality and the Philosophy of Surprise<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Currie Mark<br>
  Abstract: This new study asks how stories affect the way we think about time and, in particular, how they condition thinking about the future. Focusing on surprise and the unforeseeable, the book argues that stories are mechanisms that reconcile what is taking place with what will have been. This relation between the present and the future perfect offers a grammatical formula quite different from our default notions of narrative as recollection or recapitulation. It promises new understandings of the reading process within the strange logic of a future that is already complete. It also points beyond that to some of the key temporal concepts of our epoch: prediction and unpredictability, uncertainty, the event, the untimely and the messianic. The argument is worked out in new readings of Sarah Waters’ Fingersmith, Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go and Julian Barnes’ The Sense of an Ending.Key Features: An original discussion of the relation of time and narrativeAn important intervention in narratologyA striking general argument about the workings of the mindProvides an overview of the question of surprise in philosophy and literature<br>

  Book Title: Deleuze's Literary Clinic-Criticism and the Politics of Symptoms<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Tynan Aidan<br>
  Abstract: The first study of Deleuze's critical and clinical projectAidan Tynan addresses Deleuze's assertion that 'literature is an enterprise of health' and shows how a concern of health and illness was a characteristic of his philosophy as a whole, from his earliest works to his groundbreaking collaborations with Guattari, to his final, enigmatic statements on 'life'.He explains why alcoholism, anorexia, manic depression and schizophrenia are key concepts in Deleuze's literary theory, and shows how, with the turn to schizoanalysis, literature takes on a crucial political and ethical role in helping us to diagnose our present pathologies and articulate the possibilities of a health to come.Key FeaturesThe first book length study of Deleuze's critical and clinical project and the conceptualisations of health and illness he developed over the course of his careerUses the idea of the literary clinic to unify Deleuze's literary theory with the political critique he developed with Guattari, and argues in this way for a distinctively Deleuzian critical practiceDraws on Deleuze conceptualisations of health and illness to reassess his relationship to key thinkers such as Spinoza, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud and Melanie Klein and literary figures such as Melville F.

  2  The Paradox of the Body and the Genesis of Form and Content from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt3fgstk">Deleuze's Literary Clinic</a><br>
  Abstract: The literary clinic suggests a profound linkage between biophilosophy and literature. In the biophilosophical tradition of hylomorphism which includes Aristotle and Kant equally, life is isolated from the material it animates, since, as Toscano explains, life ‘cannot organize itself, it can only organize matter’ (Toscano 2006: 36). From the hylomorphic point of view, a self-organising life would be unintelligible, since the forms which organise matter would be indistinguishable from matter itself. Life is thus properly speaking ‘immaterial’ and immortal, the pure formal movement of the concept, while matter is mere lifeless receptivity. Deleuze is critical of this position,¹ and it<br>

  Abstract: In a note devoted to the critical and the clinical in

The identity of the critical and the clinical expresses a more general turn in Deleuze’s philosophy towards a pragmatic, diagrammatic or cartographic theory of language which attempts to articulate a relationship between literature and the socio-political critique of power. Pragmatics does not replace but rather subsumes what Deleuze calls the ‘generative’, which we have discussed in terms of the psychosexual genesis of material bodies and immaterial signs, and the ‘transformational’, which we have discussed<br>

  Book Title: Psychoanalysis is an Antiphilosophy-  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Clemens Justin<br>
  Abstract: Psychoanalysis was the most important intellectual development of the twentieth century, which left no practice from psychiatry to philosophy to politics untouched. Yet it was also in many ways an untouchable project, caught between science and poetry, medicine and hermeneutics. This unsettled, unsettling status has recently induced the philosopher Alain Badiou to characterise psychoanalysis as an ‘antiphilosophy’, that is, as a practice that issues the strongest possible challenges to thought. Justin Clemens takes up the challenge of this denomination here, by re-examining a series of crucial psychoanalytic themes: addiction, fanaticism, love, slavery and torture. Drawing from the work of Freud, Lacan, Badiou, Agamben and others, 'Psychoanalysis is an Antiphilosophy' offers a radical reconstruction of the operations and import of key psychoanalytic concepts and a renewed sense of the indispensable powers of psychoanalysis for today.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt3fgt0f">Psychoanalysis is an Antiphilosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: Because it is an antiphilosophy, psychoanalysis has, from its beginnings, remained indifferent or suspicious towards that most philosophical of themes: ontology. One can see this indifference operating at a number of levels. The practice of psychoanalysis has not necessitated that clinical psychoanalysts intervene directly in ontological questioning, whether implicitly or explicitly. Even in the most volatile moments of its struggles to sustain itself as a singular practice, psychoanalysis has remained relatively unmoved in the face of the counter-claims, concepts and criticisms coming from philosophy – and, a fortiori, from philosophical ontologies. Indeed, the reverse is more the case: it is<br>

  Abstract: In the preceding chapters, I tried to show how psychoanalysis emerged as an antiphilosophy and, in this emergence, came to establish certain routines as its own: the diagnosis of slavery as the consequence of the encounter between the body and language, a concomitant intrication of sexual protest, the ambivalence of love as at once mediating, obscuring and transforming this relation between slavery and sex, and, finally, the development of an ethics of poetic invention. This chapter, by contrast, turns its attentions to a different kind of thinker: one who begins as a self-nominated ‘philosopher’, but who, in covertly drawing from<br>

  Abstract: The tenuous relationships between the disciplines of philosophy and literary theory have recently been strengthened by a development which, at least in this country and over the last fifty years, is somewhat unusual. Literary theorists never dispensed with a certain amount of philosophical readings and references, but this does not mean that there always was an active engagement between the two institutionalized academic fields.

  Abstract: If art moves, understanding moves. Schleiermacher and Dilthey showed how within hermeneutics, understanding upholds itself by a constant, irresolvable and inconclusive movement between part and whole. The philosophy of Hans-Georg Gadamer uniquely transfers insights relating to the movement of understanding to the question of aesthetic attentiveness. In his thought, aesthetic contemplation no longer attends to changeless forms but participates in the movement of a work’s constitutive elements. Aesthetic contemplation is no longer passive but an active participant (
                  theoros) in the bringing forth what a work can disclose. Where Dilthey laments the inconclusiveness of understanding, Gadamer celebrates it. The ceaseless movement<br>

  Book Title: Staging Philosophy-Intersections of Theater, Performance, and Philosophy<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Saltz David Z.<br>
  Abstract: The fifteen original essays in
      Staging Philosophymake useful connections between the discipline of philosophy and the fields of theater and performance and use these insights to develop new theories about theater. Each of the contributors-leading scholars in the fields of performance and philosophy-breaks new ground, presents new arguments, and offers new theories that will pave the way for future scholarship.Staging Philosophyraises issues of critical importance by providing case studies of various philosophical movements and schools of thought, including aesthetics, analytic philosophy, phenomenology, deconstruction, critical realism, and cognitive science. The essays, which are organized into three sections-history and method, presence, and reception-take up fundamental issues such as spectatorship, empathy, ethics, theater as literature, and the essence of live performance. While some essays challenge assertions made by critics and historians of theater and performance, others analyze the assumptions of manifestos that prescribe how practitioners should go about creating texts and performances. The first book to bridge the disciplines of theater and philosophy,Staging Philosophywill provoke, stimulate, engage, and ultimately bring theater to the foreground of intellectual inquiry while it inspires further philosophical investigation into theater and performance.David Krasneris Associate Professor of Theater Studies, African American Studies, and English at Yale University.

  Abstract: Philosophy, a discipline concerned with truth, being, and the foundations of knowledge, was predestined to abhor the theater, which is premised on lying, appearance, and the construction of false worlds. Philosophical attacks on the theater, as they accompany the history of philosophy from Plato onward, are thus not only frequent but also unsurprising. At the same time, self-declared defenders of the theater, including many playwrights, have fought back by creating mock philosophers who are exposed as fools and charlatans on the stage, a tradition that begins with Aristophanes’ unflattering portrayal of Socrates in

  Abstract: Research questions of interest to neuroscientists share a natural overlap with those pursued by scholars studying philosophy, art, music, history, or literature. The common ground is a shared desire to understand the workings of the human mind. What initially attracts someone to study neuroscience, regardless of what aspects of nervous system function an individual career may become focused on (e.g., basic functions of the synapse), is the allure of contributing knowledge that deepens our understanding of our minds.

  Book Title: Traces of the Past-Classics between History and Archaeology<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Bassi Karen<br>
  Abstract: What are we doing when we walk into an archaeological museum or onto an archaeological site? What do the objects and features we encounter in these unique places mean and, more specifically, how do they convey to us something about the beliefs and activities of formerly living humans? In short, how do visible remains and ruins in the present give meaning to the human past? Karen Bassi addresses these questions through detailed close readings of canonical works spanning the archaic to the classical periods of ancient Greek culture, showing how the past is constituted in descriptions of what narrators and characters see in their present context. She introduces the term protoarchaeological to refer to narratives that navigate the gap between linguistic representation and empirical observation-between words and things-in accessing and giving meaning to the past. Such narratives invite readers to view the past as a receding visual field and, in the process, to cross the disciplinary boundaries that divide literature, history, and archaeology.Aimed at classicists, literary scholars, ancient historians, cultural historians, and archaeological theorists, the book combines three areas of research: time as a feature of narrative structure in literary theory; the concept of "the past itself" in the philosophy of history; and the ontological status of material objects in archaeological theory. Each of five central chapters explores how specific protoarchaeological narratives-from the fate of Zeus' stone in Hesiod's Theogony to the contest between words and objects in Aristophanes' Frogs-both expose and attempt to bridge this gap. Throughout, the book serves as a response to Herodotus' task in writing the Histories, namely, to ensure that "the past deeds of men do not fade with time."<br>

Sarah Rivett demonstrates that, instead, empiricism and natural philosophy combined with Puritanism to transform the scope of religious activity in colonial New England from the 1630s to the Great Awakening of the 1740s.In an unprecedented move, Puritan ministers from Thomas Shepard and John Eliot to Cotton Mather and Jonathan Edwards studied the human soul using the same systematic methods that philosophers applied to the study of nature. In particular, they considered the testimonies of tortured adolescent girls at the center of the Salem witch trials, Native American converts, and dying women as a source of material insight into the divine. Conversions and deathbed speeches were thus scrutinized for evidence of grace in a way that bridged the material and the spiritual, the visible and the invisible, the worldly and the divine.In this way, the "science of the soul" was as much a part of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century natural philosophy as it was part of post-Reformation theology. Rivett's account restores the unity of religion and science in the early modern world and highlights the role and importance of both to transatlantic circuits of knowledge formation.<br>

  Abstract: The dangers of misapplied science, fully realized in the Salem witchcraft trials and the events’ larger context in Royal Society debates, put tremendous pressure on the science of the soul. By the late-seventeenth century, Harvard-trained ministers and Royal Society natural philosophers continued to advance their practices, though with renewed caution, aware both of mechanical philosophy’s limitations and the parameters surrounding empirical inquiry—especially interdictions against studying preternatural phenomena. Yet neither New England ministers nor London natural philosophers abandoned efforts to apply empirical methods to advance knowledge of God. Rather, such theologians as Samuel Clarke recuperated the goal of knowing the<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5149/9781469630366_buchbinder">Understanding Health Inequalities and Justice</a><br>
  Author(s) Kelleher J. Paul<br>
  Abstract: If one wishes to evaluate inequalities in health from the perspective of justice, it is natural to turn to philosophical conceptions of egalitarianism. Such views aim to explain why inequalities (or at least certain inequalities) are morally problematic, and why social and political institutions that engender inequalities are unjust and need repair. There is, however, a vigorous debate within political philosophy as to how egalitarianism should be conceived. In recent years, a broad division has emerged between so-called luck egalitarians, on the one hand, and “relational” egalitarians, on the other. The main aim of this chapter is to explain this<br>

  Book Title: “The Useless Mouths” and Other Literary Writings-  Publisher: University of Illinois Press<br>
  Author(s): Le Bon de Beauvoir Sylvie<br>
  Abstract: "The Useless Mouths" and Other Literary Writings brings to English-language readers literary writings--several previously unknown--by Simone de Beauvoir. Culled from sources including various American university collections, the works span decades of Beauvoir's career. Ranging from dramatic works and literary theory to radio broadcasts, they collectively reveal fresh insights into Beauvoir's writing process, personal life, and the honing of her philosophy. The volume begins with a new translation of the 1945 play The Useless Mouths, written in Paris during the Nazi occupation. Other pieces were discovered after Beauvoir's death in 1986, such as the 1965 short novel "Misunderstanding in Moscow," involving an elderly French couple who confront their fears of aging. Two additional previously unknown texts include the fragmentary "Notes for a Novel," which contains the seed of what she later would call "the problem of the Other," and a lecture on postwar French theater titled Existentialist Theater. The collection notably includes the eagerly awaited translation of Beauvoir's contribution to a 1965 debate among Jean-Paul Sartre and other French writers and intellectuals, "What Can Literature Do?" Prefaces to well-known works such as Bluebeard and Other Fairy Tales, La Bâtarde, and James Joyce in Paris: His Final Years are also available in English for the first time, alongside essays and other short articles. A landmark contribution to Beauvoir studies and French literary studies, the volume includes informative and engaging introductory essays by prominent and rising scholars. Contributors are Meryl Altman, Elizabeth Fallaize, Alison S. Fell, Sarah Gendron, Dennis A. Gilbert, Laura Hengehold, Eleanore Holveck, Terry Keefe, J. Debbie Mann, Frederick M. Morrison, Catherine Naji, Justine Sarrot, Liz Stanley, Ursula Tidd, and Veronique Zaytzeff<br>

These volumes of Simone de Beauvoir’s writings, concerning literature as well as philosophy and feminism, stretch from 1926 to 1979, that is to say throughout almost her entire life. Some of them have been published before, and are known, but remain dispersed throughout time and space, in diverse editions, diverse newspapers or reviews.

  Abstract: Of all of the women whose work I have investigated here, Simone de Beauvoir (1908–86) is by far the best known and, with the possible exception of Simone Weil, the only one whose work has already more or less passed into the pantheon of philosophy. Indeed, there is enough contemporary debate about her work and commentary on it that it does not seem necessary to reinvent the wheel; we can count Simone de Beauvoir as a philosopher, and as one whose work has been recognized.¹<br>

  Abstract: Can anthropology be philosophy? Can it not just contribute to but do, and even aid in reinventing philosophy, in the sense of constructive, speculative metaphysics? And what, in that event, would philosophy be, since most of its best instances begin, end with, and never abandon Western categories? Such questions might be lamely disciplinary were it not for the symmetrically unimaginative, joint response they still receive. For the philosophers, things are often quite simple: anthropology is a source of empirical specifications or exemplifications of matters conceived more universally by themselves, but only rarely does it accede to such a broad level<br>

Yet this is clear in Bergson’s own testimonies: “When I first saw the cinematograph I realized it could offer something new to philosophy. Indeed we could almost say that cinema is a model of consciousness itself. Going to the cinema turns out to be a philosophical experience.”²<br>

  Abstract: Jean Epstein (Warsaw 1897 to Paris 1953) was a cinephile, poet, writer, filmmaker, and philosopher of the cinema. Not only was he among the few in the silent era to consider cinema as an object for thought—a daring position in those days—but he espoused the more radical view that it altered experience, thinking and philosophy, generating an original, nonhuman mode of thinking about the universe: an antiphilosophy. It is fair to say the questions of whether and how radically cinema might change our thought were first posed in earnest and depth by Epstein.<br>

  Abstract: André Bazin was influenced by many philosophical figures. This range of influences was no gratuitous eclecticism. Rather, it stemmed from Bazin’s need to develop a critical discourse that would address the impure ontology of the cinema. Because the medium involves nature and culture, it perforce requires insights into art, religion, science, and technology. Without a doubt, the history of philosophy helped Bazin bring together all these dimensions, even if he seldom identified his sources. As a critic he did not seek a perfect fit between his overall film theory and a single philosopher. Bazin never mentioned the names of Saint<br>

  Abstract: Since Socrates shared his thoughts about death with his friends before his execution in the

Despite its seeming innovations, the thesis about death that Martin Heidegger advanced in 1927 in his opus magnum Being and Time is in many regards still part and parcel of the tradition inaugurated by Greek philosophy. According to this tradition, death is something that the philosopher welcomes—as Hannah Arendt says, the philosopher is somehow in love with death—since death is, precisely, what allows the soul to separate from the<br>

  Abstract: To grasp the paradox of instant and flux in moving images could be compared to the vain attempt in philosophy to locate the instant within the flow of consciousness. Identifying the paradoxical instant is therefore a problem where the phenomenology of time meets with classical attempts to specify the ontology of cinema. Attempts at identifying this paradoxical instant have resulted in describing both film in analogy with human perception and film in analogy with machine perception beyond and independent of the subject. In this chapter I will depart from the point of intersection between phenomenology and cinema, which illuminates the<br>

If there had been a sufficient number of art historians at that time to constitute a discipline, this intellectual division of labor might have been understood as a grievous insult. The subsequent formation of the discipline shows that many art historians have indeed treated this as exemplary advice, and thus an extensive arm of art history has concerned<br>

  Book Title: Philosophy Beside Itself-On Deconstruction and Modernism<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Marshall Donald<br>
  Abstract: The writings of French philosopher Jacques Derrida have been the single most powerful influence on critical theory and practice in the United States over the past decade. But with few exceptions American philosophers have taken little or no interest in Derrida’s work, and the task of reception, translation, and commentary has been left to literary critics. As a result, Derrida has appeared as a figure already defined by essentially literary critical activities and interests. Stephen Melville’s aim in Philosophy Beside Itself is to insist upon and clarify the distinctions between philosophy and criticism. He argues that until we grasp Derrida’s philosophical project as such, we remain fundamentally unable to see his significance for criticism. In terms derived from Stanley Cavell’s writings on modernism, Melville develops a case for Derrida as a modernist philosopher, working at once within and against that tradition and discipline. Melville first places Derrida in a Hegelian context, the structure of which he explores by examining the work of Heidegger, Lacan, and Bataille. With this foundation, he is able to reappraise the project of deconstructive criticism as developed in Paul de Man’s Blindness and Insight and further articulated by other Yale critics. Central to this critique is the ambivalent relationship between deconstructive criticism and Lacanian psychoanalysis. Criticism—radical self-criticism—is a central means through which the difficult facts of human community come to recognition, and Melville argues for criticism as an activity intimately bound to the ways in which we do and do not belong in time and in community. Derrida’s achievement has been to find a new and necessary way to assert that the task of philosophy is criticism; the task of literary criticism is to assume the burden of that achievement. Stephen Melville is an assistant professor of English at Syracuse University, and Donald Marshall is a professor of English at the University of Iowa.<br>

  Abstract: The burden of the argument to this point has been that philosophy, in response to needs generated within its “own” history, has come to be at necessary odds with its self, its history, and the proprietary self-presence implicit in such notions of self and history. In these straits, philosophy has turned increasingly to criticism for an understanding of its activity, and so has risked also its possible disappearance into literature. Literary criticism and theory thus find themselves in an odd position: a discipline that has a long-established habit of looking elsewhere—primarily to science or philosophy—for models of its<br>

Using a unique blend of literary analysis, linguistic anthropology, and phenomenological philosophy, Vincent Barletta explores the narratives as testimonials of past human experiences and discovers in them evidence of community resistance.<br>

  Abstract: This chapter will map out in some detail the activity-centered approach to traditional
                  aljamiado-morisconarratives from Castile and Aragon. This approach, based on the analysis of manuscript texts and what is known about the cultural world of Castilian and Aragonese crypto-Muslims, seeks to address the ways in which members of these communities used handwritten narrative texts in their efforts to make sense of their complex and precarious existence in Spain. In order to present the details of this approach, both from a theoretical and methodological perspective, I will be drawing connections between phenomenological philosophy, ethnographic research on oral narrative, and<br>

  6  Defining the Self in Indian Literary and Filmic Texts from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.cttttp11">Narratives of Agency</a><br>
  Author(s) Mishra Vijay<br>
  Abstract: No comparable civilization has argued over definitions of selfhood as much as the Indian. Throughout its long and august history almost every branch of knowledge (including philosophy, literature, religion, and linguistics) has grappled with this extremely elusive concept. There is, however, one point on which all the commentators agree: the self is other than what our faculties persuade us it is. In other words, the construction of the self through social processes (which would require a social other to begin with) is overtaken by a principle in which the “real” or the “true” self comes into being only when it<br>

  Abstract: In Out of Time, Todd McGowan takes as his starting point the emergence of a temporal aesthetic in cinema that arose in response to the digital era. Linking developments in cinema to current debates within philosophy, McGowan claims that films that change the viewer’s relation to time constitute a new cinematic mode: atemporal cinema.<br>

  Book Title: The Brain Is the Screen-Deleuze and the Philosophy of Cinema<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Flaxman Gregory<br>
  Abstract: In the nearly twenty years since their publication, Gilles Deleuze’s books about cinema have proven as daunting as they are enticing—a new aesthetics of film, one equally at home with Henri Bergson and Wim Wenders, Friedrich Nietzsche and Orson Welles, that also takes its place in the philosopher’s immense and difficult oeuvre. With this collection, the first to focus solely and extensively on Deleuze’s cinematic work, the nature and reach of that work finally become clear. Composed of a substantial introduction, twelve original essays produced for this volume, and a new English translation of a personal, intriguing, and little-known interview with Deleuze on his cinema books, The Brain Is the Screen is a sustained engagement with Deleuze’s cinematic philosophy that leads to a new view of the larger confrontation of philosophy with cinematic images.

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.cttttq6p">The Brain Is the Screen</a><br>
  Author(s) Flaxman Gregory<br>
  Abstract: In
                  The Movement-Image, the first of his two volumes on cinema and philosophy, Gilles Deleuze launches toward a moment of remarkable visibility: ″The essence of a thing never appears at the outset, but in the middle, in the course of its development, when its strength is assured.″¹ Beyond the context of cinematographic evolution, Deleuze″s claim seems to encompass its own writing, reflecting (or pre-flecting) an intuition about the fate of his books. ″When a thing is considered in terms of its beginning,″ Deleuze once wrote with Félix Guattari, ″a thing is always poorly judged.″² But what does it mean to<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.cttttq6p">The Brain Is the Screen</a><br>
  Author(s) Shafto Sally<br>
  Abstract: It is difficult to accurately define the fate Deleuze wished to reserve for what he called the ″image of thought″ if we do not grasp from the outset the profound kinship between image and thought. It is therefore out of the question to deal, on the one hand, with the process of the image and, on the other, with that of thought. There is no dualism that would permit one to posit them each on opposite sides. As we know, Deleuze never begins by positing terms that would be exterior to one another. Doing philosophy is to be conceived starting<br>

  Author(s) Flaxman Gregory<br>
  Abstract: Ever since Plato′s
                  Republic, philosophy seems to have been the labor of ″master builders″: Descartes demolishes all prosaic assumptions about the world to lay the groundwork for his first principles, Kant fashions the exquisite proportions of his firstCritiquesas a propaedeutic to metaphysics, and even Hegel′s professed dislike of philosophical preludes grounds hisPhenomenology of Spirit.² We have come to expect our philosophers to build by design, pausing at the outset to reflect on the construction, and so it is all the more astonishing how Gilles Deleuze opens his cinema books. Never mind the brief, almost capricious preface that<br>

  Author(s) McMahon Melissa<br>
  Abstract: Perhaps we will teach, in two hundred years, that twentieth-century philosophy ended with two hieroglyphics:
                     The Movement-ImageandThe Time-Image. A misunderstanding surrounds these books: they rightly fascinate film lovers, even though they are expressly books of philosophy. As for philosophers, they find little interest in them, or else read them while leaving cinema aside, even though Deleuze considered that he could not have written them except through contact with cinema. What could have determined, in Deleuze′s work, such an encounter between philosophy and cinema?<br>

  Author(s) Hervey Sándor<br>
  Abstract: The purpose of this essay is not to attempt a general reconstruction of Deleuze′s philosophy of cinema, but only to shed light on the traces of a certain—possibly unintentional, sedimentary, and in any event undeveloped—way of thinking about the history of cinema in his work. One has to agree with the opinion of virtually all serious commentators on Deleuze that the purpose behind the two volumes this philosopher wrote on cinema is not purely film-theoretic, nor is it directed at the history of cinema. Rather, Deleuze turns to the cinema as a means of expression for certain philosophical<br>

  Author(s) Lambert Gregg<br>
  Abstract: One of the most important consequences of the direction taken by Gilles Deleuze in his two cinema books is not only to have raised the often neglected status of the cinematographic image as fundamental to any modern philosophy of time, but also to have situated the study of the image as crucial for discerning the link between the subject and thought that has evolved in the modern period around the problem of ideology. As a result of Deleuze′s inquiry into the cinematographic ″movement-image″ as basis for understanding the nature of this link, we are again compelled to consider the relationship<br>

  Author(s) Dailey Patricia<br>
  Abstract: The two volumes that constitute Deleuze′s inquiry into the cinematic image,
                  The Movement-ImageandThe Time-Image, are like two facets of an inquiry that, together, form one remarkable book of philosophy—a book situated in the very middle [au milieu] of Deleuze′s philosophy. This milieu, in which the essence of a thing appears, is likewise the milieu of acinema-thinkingthat rescinds any phenomenological privilege from natural perception in order to lay itself open to the ″materialist programme″³ of a Bergsonian world. In this world, the identity of the real and of the image (i.e., that which appears) results in<br>

  Author(s) Conley Tom<br>
  Abstract: Modern French philosophy would do well to stake a claim to its origins in the
                  Essaisof Montaigne. Descartes and Spinoza count among the first readers and inheritors of his style of thinking, and Gilles Deleuze among the most recent and powerful avatars. Indeed, something uncanny ties the event of Deleuze′s death at the beginning of November 1995 to the demise that Montaigne imagined for himself in the beginnings of his self-portraiture. Distorting the lexicon of the Pléiade poets who were forever dying ″a thousand deaths″ in their many distortions of Petrarch, Montaigne expires and returns to life to assure<br>

  Abstract: Lévi-Strauss invites us to criticize the notion of the rights of man, which he affirms are too strongly anchored in a philosophy of subjectivity. He says we should replace it with the principle of a system of the rights of man as a living being, a right of the human species among other species: this is “wild” and pessimist thinking. Its austere analysis makes it irredeemable for the movements of “deep ecology.”¹ It would certainly be a misunderstanding and a caricature of this position from an ethnographer to use it to claim, for example, an extension of the rights of<br>

  Abstract: So-called literary narrative is, at least in modern times and in urban, industrial societies, one of the grand categories of narrative communication, so central indeed, as we have already noted, that it has come to obfuscate the study and relevance of narrativeness in other semiotic systems, for example, film, television, advertising, photography, and drama, and appears as a model or a key antagonist for historiography, philosophy, and scientific Discourses. We must therefore try to determine the specific weight and implication of the concept “literary” in phrases like “literary narrative” and “literary work of art”; in other words, we have to<br>

The textual consequences of these new features are publicly posted on millions of Internet pages. Though Web pages implement the same hypertextual architecture as Storyspace fiction, they differ significantly from the latter in their linking philosophy and graphic appearance.

  Abstract: It is often said that Jacques Derrida’s early critiques of Husserl and Saussure provide the most carefully argued introductions to his “deconstructive” approach to the tradition of Western philosophy. Indeed, it has been said that one virtue of his early texts of the late 1960s is that in them Derrida still
                  argued. Many writers on Derrida have found that his texts generally measure up to the highest standards of scholarly rigor. Thus in the preface to the English translation ofLa voix et le phénomène, Newton Garver writes that “Derrida’s critique of Husserl is a first-class piece of analytical work<br>

  Abstract: Striking Beautyexplains the relationship between Asian martial arts and the Chinese philosophical traditions of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism, in addition to Sunzi'sArt of War. It connects martial arts practice to the Western concepts of mind-body dualism and materialism, sports aesthetics, and the ethics of violence. The work ameliorates Western philosophy's hostility toward the body, emphasizing the pleasure of watching and engaging in martial arts, along with their beauty and the ethical problem of their violence.<br>

                  cannothave much to say to these arts, not for accidental reasons of language and geography, but because this philosophy tends to be struck mute before anything as corporeal as the martial arts. Philosophy began in the West as a movement of nature rationalism, conceiving nature as a rational order, a cosmos with a principle that is both intelligible and intelligent. The early Greek philosophers, figures like Xenophanes, Heraclitus, and Parmenides, invented the idea of knowledge as the Truth of<br>

  Author(s): AMAD PAULA<br>
  Abstract: Tucked away in a garden on the edge of Paris is a multimedia archive like no other: Albert Kahn's
      Archives de la Planète(1908-1931). Kahn's vast photo-cinematographic experiment preserved world memory through the privileged lens of everyday life, andCounter-Archivesituates this project in its biographic, intellectual, and cinematic contexts. Tracing the archive's key influences, such as the philosopher Henri Bergson, the geographer Jean Brunhes, and the biologist Jean Comandon, Paula Amad maps an alternative landscape of French cultural modernity in which vitalist philosophy cross-pollinated with early film theory, documentary film with the avant-garde, cinematic models of temporality with the early Annales school of history, and film's appropriation of the planet with human geography and colonial ideology. At the heart of the book is an insightful meditation upon the transformed concept of the archive in the age of cinema and an innovative argument about film's counter-archival challenge to history. The first comprehensive study of Kahn's films,Counter-Archivealso offers a vital historical perspective on debates involving archives, media, and memory.<br>

  Abstract: It would be nearly impossible to describe the concerns Habermas articulates and addresses in his theory without referring to the three intellectual traditions named above. All his innovations—indeed, the motivational bases for his project as a whole—are so strongly shaped by the philosophy of history, philosophical anthropology, and Marxism that even the attenuated presence of these traditions in his later writings cannot conceal how much, in changed form, they have always determined his work.

  Author(s) LAFONT CRISTINA<br>
  Abstract: In the foreword to the second edition of
                  On the Logic of the Social Sciences, Habermas writes that the incorporation of hermeneutics into his project during the 1960s played a key role in transforming critical theory from an enterprise based on the philosophy of the subject into one founded on communication. This undertaking culminated in his main work,The Theory of Communicative Action(1981). Although Habermas indicates that his encounter with analytic philosophy (see chapters 6 and 30 in this volume) is also of central importance, in examining his turn toward the philosophy of language it is necessary to take<br>

  Abstract: Systematic philosophical engagement with speech acts began when John Langshaw Austin corrected his original conception of performative utterances. Previously, Austin had maintained that philosophy of language had overvalued the declarative aspect of linguistic utterances and underestimated the acts one can perform/convey in making them. Whereas he initially held that constative utterances (which can be true or false) may be distinguished from performative utterances (which meet with success or failure but are neither true nor false), he found himself forced to admit, in the final installment of his William James Lectures, that some performative utterances claim to be true or false<br>

  Abstract: Habermas’s endorsement of what he calls “postmetaphysical thinking” can easily be misleading. It is not intended as a rejection of the sort of inquiry pursued, for example, in the more recent revival of “analytic metaphysics” associated primarily with David Lewis and the “Australian metaphysicians.” Rather, at least in the first instance, it is directed against both the tradition of metaphysical thought that reached a culmination in the philosophy of Hegel and German idealism and in the various—and, ultimately, for Habermas, still “metaphysical”—attempts to escape that tradition in the writings of Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Derrida.

  Abstract: Habermas has the avowed intention of (re)formulating Kant’s moral philosophy in terms of discourse theory (
                  Justification, 3). This implies shifting focus away from the philosophy of consciousness, which concentrates on the individual subject, and toward an intersubjective theory.

  Author(s) KHURANA THOMAS<br>
  Abstract: Habermas’s exchange with Jacques Derrida is situated within the debate about modernity and postmodernity (see chapters 33 and 37). When he was awarded the Adorno Prize in 1980, Habermas defended the “unfinished project of modernity” in his acceptance speech; the opponents of modernity he identified included—in addition to old conservatives and neoconservatives of the recognizable variety—a group of “Young Conservatives,” among whom he numbered Michel Foucault and Derrida (“Modernity,” 53).
                  The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity(1985) devotes two chapters to Derrida, in which Habermas details, at greater length, what prompted this judgment. In his estimation, Derrida’s philosophy represents<br>

He has appropriated, reconstructed, and integrated many of the primary themes of these thinkers into his own comprehensive philosophic perspective: a radical critique of Cartesianism and the philosophy of consciousness; a focus on the primacy of social practices and action in understanding everyday life (the lifeworld); a thoroughgoing fallibilism that encompasses both knowledge of the world and moral reasoning; a development of an intersubjective dialogical understanding of action and rationality; and a<br>

  Abstract: Engagement with Jewish philosophy and exchanges with Jewish philosophers have played an important role in Habermas’s thought from his earliest writings. As early as 1961, Habermas published the essay “Der deutsche Idealismus der jüdischen Philosophie” (The German idealism of Jewish philosophy); two studies on Hannah Arendt followed, joined by essays on Walter Benjamin and Gershom Scholem. The existential motivation for these writings, one may surmise, was the responsibility that Habermas assumed for the war crimes Germany had perpetrated in his youth. In philosophical terms, Habermas’s interest in Jewish intellectual traditions came from his study of German idealism; a further essay<br>

  Abstract: When, in the mid-1950s, new interest for Schelling’s philosophy arose—especially its middle and late phases—Jürgen Habermas stood at the forefront; he was the youngest (and the first) scholar to base his interpretation on “contradictoriness” (
                  Zwiespältigkeit). A year later, Karl Jaspers followed his lead and publishedGrösse und Verhängnis(Greatness and disaster); this book held that Schelling had anticipated the central ambivalence of Heideggerian philosophy—more specifically, “the transition from greatness to [empty] gesture, from truth to absurdity, from clear communication to magic” (Jaspers 1955, 7; cf.Profiles, 45–52). Around the same time, Georg Lukács declared that the<br>

  Abstract: The public sphere is the most influential of Jürgen Habermas’s signature concepts. Unlike “communicative action,” “discourse ethics,” and “the colonization of the lifeworld,” which are discussed principally by specialists, this concept has become a major focus of work in fields ranging from history, law, politics, and sociology to literature, philosophy, gender studies, and media studies.

  Author(s) REHG WILLIAM<br>
  Abstract: Over his long and productive career, Jürgen Habermas has pursued an overriding interest in critical social-political theory. For Habermas, as for other Frankfurt School critical theorists, social-political critique requires interdisciplinary social analysis and thus depends on engagement with the social and cultural sciences. In the 1960s, Habermas approached such engagement as a problem for methodological and epistemological reflection, that is, a matter of critique of knowledge (
                  Erkenntniskritik): critical social theory had to establish itself as a respectable, distinct form of knowledge, in large measure through a methodological critique of the then-dominant positivist philosophy of science and historicist hermeneutics. Conversely, critique<br>

  Author(s) BRUNKHORST HAUKE<br>
  Abstract: In 1981, the Hegel Conference in Stuttgart addressed the “Hamlet debate” of German philosophy: “Kant or Hegel?” The highpoint of the event occurred when the avant-garde of American pragmatism took the stage. Richard Rorty (1983), whose groundbreaking critique of philosophical idealism
                  Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature(1979) had just been translated into German, made a brief introduction. Willard V. O.

  Author(s) STRECKER DAVID<br>
  Abstract: Key to the social philosophy of Jürgen Habermas is his deeply held conviction that social evolution represents a history of progress in principle while at the same time—and as a matter of actual fact—being the cause of grave social ills. His project is shaped, then, by an awareness of suffering and crisis—matters that do not even occur to neoconservative and neoliberal modernizers, entranced as they are by technical and economic development. Simultaneously, he maintains critical distance from parties who, when faced with the catastrophes that modernity has produced, take flight for archaic utopias. In fleshing out this<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/brun16642">The Habermas Handbook</a><br>
  Author(s) MÖLLERS CHRISTOPH<br>
  Abstract: Habermas’s legal theory must be understood as part of a much larger project that combines theoretical and practical philosophy in an uncommonly thorough way for the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Habermas (in
                  Truth) has lamented the fact that, in a landscape increasingly distinguished by the division of academic labor, the two perspectives have grown more and more separate (for an expressly different view, see Rawls 2005, 372ff.). At the same time, his writings have proved that this need not be the case. Habermas was interested in matters of political theory from the first, even if he came to address them<br>

  Author(s) BOHMAN JAMES<br>
  Abstract: From 1999 onward, Habermas has significantly shifted the focus of his political philosophy from questions of democracy and legitimacy within the nation-state to the burgeoning international political domain. In his first such move to international politics, in the mid-1990s, Habermas embraced the “Kantian project” of “Perpetual Peace” and interpreted it as requiring cosmopolitan democracy. In his second phase, in the late 1990s, Habermas began to see difficulties with any attempt to transfer democratic ideals directly to the international system and argued for a more limited conception of a fair negotiating system that cannot in principle attain full democratic legitimacy.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/brun16642">The Habermas Handbook</a><br>
  Author(s) REHG WILLIAM<br>
  Abstract: Habermas’s concept of “cognitive interests” lies at the center of his
                  Knowledge and Human Interests(1972 [1968]). That work represents the culmination of his early efforts to ground critical social theory in a critique of knowledge (Erkenntniskritik), an approach he abandoned when he made the linguistic-pragmatic turn in the 1970s (see chapter 29 in this volume). With input from Karl-Otto Apel (1971), Habermas developed the idea of cognitive interests in hopes of reconstituting the philosophy of reflection, which had reached its apex in German idealism. Specifically, Habermas wanted to revive the critical, emancipatory aims of reflection in a way that<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/brun16642">The Habermas Handbook</a><br>
  Author(s) BRUMLIK MICHA<br>
  Abstract: Conservative thinking in its various adumbrations has interested Jürgen Habermas since the very beginning of his sociological and philosophical efforts. In 1963, he authored the article “Kritische und konservative Aufgaben der Soziologie” (Critical and conservative tasks of sociology). Referring to Scottish moral philosophy—especially the works of David Hume—as a conservative element of sociology in its early stages, Habermas declared that conservatism “esteems tradition as the peaceful basis of ongoing development precisely because it does not question the naturalness [
                     Naturwüchsigkeit] of progress.”<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/brun16642">The Habermas Handbook</a><br>
  Author(s) FORST RAINER<br>
  Abstract: The term “discourse ethics” refers to a conception of morality in the Kantian tradition, which J ü rgen Habermas developed in conjunction with Karl-Otto Apel (1980, 1988). Its most important feature is its replacement of the reflective evaluation of moral maxims—in accordance with the prescriptions of the Categorical Imperative—with the argumentative redemption of the validity claims of moral norms in practical discourse. The transcendental self-reflection of practical reason à la Kant yields to the pragmatic reconstruction of the normative implications of communicative rationality (
                  Naturalism, 24–76). This theory of morality offers numerous points of contact with Habermas’s philosophy<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/brun16642">The Habermas Handbook</a><br>
  Author(s) LOHMANN GEORG<br>
  Abstract: For Habermas, “postmetaphysical thinking” (
                  nachmetaphysisches Denken) refers to the only ways of pursuing philosophy still possible in today’s world. He employs the term in two senses: first, in a critical/negative capacity that is meant to counter the “return to metaphysics” he diagnoses; and second, as a positive designation for the philosophical thinking that can only occur after—and according to (nach)—metaphysics, i.e., thinking that does not abandon the claim to comprehensive rationality. In historical terms, postmetaphysical thinking belongs to the tradition of the Young Hegelians (Discourse, 53ff.;Postmetaphysical, 124). As a critical counterconcept opposed to metaphysics (which extends,<br>

  Author(s) FISCHBACH FRANCK<br>
  Abstract: Before any discussion of the relation between utopia and Marxism, it is necessary to consider Marx’s own relation to utopia. Let us start by recalling that the philosophical, notably Hegelian, tradition inherited by Marx is very hostile to utopianism. Marx knew by heart the preface to the
                  Elements of the Philosophy of Right, in which Hegel virulently opposed those who, in matters of political philosophy, build castles in the air, which is to say, think or imagine the political and social world as it should be, and thus dispense with knowing it as it is.¹ Marx had incontestably inherited this<br>

  Abstract: The short monograph

  Abstract: The ability to transmit symbolic signs through gestures and, later, vocal sounds eventually evolved into fully grammatical language. But as the language-ready brain was millions of years in the making, so it took perhaps as long as 200,000 years for oral cultures in separate locations, e.g., Mesopotamia, the Nile and Indus valleys, northern China, and Mesoamerica, to have the institutions in place to support the production and storage of written records. It then took millennia more before writing expanded from administrative recordkeeping to historiography, philosophy, natural science, and what we now generally mean by “literature.” All the while, writing remained<br>

In this collection, Amy Allen, Geoffrey Bennington, Lynne Huffer, Colin Koopman, Pierre Macherey, Michael Naas, and Judith Revel, among others, trace this exchange in debates over the possibilities of genealogy and deconstruction, immanent and transcendent approaches to philosophy, and the practical and theoretical role of the archive.<br>

  Author(s) HADDAD SAMIR<br>
  Abstract: There was no debate. There never was a moment when Derrida and Foucault were sitting opposite each other, on display for an audience, arguing back and forth, controlled by a mediator or provoked by a journalist. There can be no images, no transcript. Of course, the history of philosophy is full of debates whose reality and vitality does not depend on an empirical encounter of the sort Foucault had with Chomsky: writers and readers frequently proceed by staging two authors as figures to stake out opposing positions.

  Author(s) KOOPMAN COLIN<br>
  Abstract: The latter decades of the twentieth century were witness to a resounding critique of the traditional tasks of philosophy. During these years, many of the canonical aspirations of philosophy fell into a certain kind of disrepute on a number of fronts. In America the most influential spokesperson for the assault on the standard assumptions of modern philosophy was Richard Rorty. In Germany the scandal was associated with Jürgen Habermas and the Frankfurt School. But perhaps the North Atlantic milieu in which philosophy came under the severest critical attack was France, where a range of thinkers came to be presented as<br>

  Abstract: A body of thought is too often reduced to a “silhouette” that one thinks is a summary. In thus personifying the work of philosophy, we take away its thickness. But this complexity does not exist in isolation, any more than it can be frozen in time in the form of an unchanging position. Bodies of thought enrich and transform each other through the play of interactions and reactions, strategies and exchanges, and conflicts and ruptures. One body of thought thus implicates others. This relation is not constructed simply by borrowing from, or subscribing to, other thoughts, any more than the<br>

  Abstract: Political traditions and philosophical conceptions differ on the extent to which they allow the force of the example, and judgment, to play a role within their framework. Only the most extreme embed the ambition to filter out any and all possible role that judgment and exemplarity might play—game theoretical approaches to political choice are of this kind, for instance—but by and large all conceptions of normativity do attribute to judgment a role at least in discerning the correct and appropriate application of independently established principles of a more general nature.

  Book Title: Broken Tablets-Levinas, Derrida, and the Literary Afterlife of Religion<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): HAMMERSCHLAG SARAH<br>
  Abstract: Over a span of thirty years, twentieth-century French philosophers Emmanuel Levinas and Jacques Derrida held a conversation across texts. Sharing a Jewish heritage and a background in phenomenology, both came to situate their work at the margins of philosophy, articulating this placement through religion and literature. Chronicling the interactions between these thinkers, Sarah Hammerschlag argues that the stakes in their respective positions were more than philosophical. They were also political. Levinas's investments were born out in his writings on Judaism and ultimately in an evolving conviction that the young state of Israel held the best possibility for achieving such an ideal. For Derrida, the Jewish question was literary. The stakes of Jewish survival could only be approached through reflections on modern literature's religious legacy, a line of thinking that provided him the means to reconceive democracy. Hammerschlag's reexamination of Derrida and Levinas's textual exchange not only produces a new account of this friendship but also has significant ramifications for debates within Continental philosophy, the study of religion, and political theology.<br>

  Abstract: In 1975, eleven years after Derrida published “Violence and Metaphysics,” Levinas declared poststructuralism the “ruin of the world.” This new “philosophical literature,” Levinas wrote “prefers to play with verbal signs rather than to take seriously the system registered in their said” (
                  EN76, 61). However, along with communicating a disgruntled impression that disorder had become the name of the game in politics as well as philosophy, Levinas saw an opportunity in this disorder for a truth perhaps older than the world. “In this rupture, and in this awakening, and in this expiation, and in this exaltation, the divine comedy of<br>

  Abstract: In 1968 Jacques Derrida accepted an invitation from Johns Hopkins University to teach a seminar on the topic “Literature and Truth.” The project of the seminar was to consider how literature has been conceived, constructed, and maintained from Plato on as imitation and thus construed as secondary in order to protect the status of philosophy and, more broadly, science as the province of truth. Derrida developed the argument to show that the representative arts had been subsequently burdened with the task of effacing their position as copy by cultivating the value of originality, thus reproducing the very logic that established<br>

  Book Title: The Specter of Democracy-What Marx and Marxists Haven't Understood and Why<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Howard Dick<br>
  Abstract: Howard uses a critical rereading of Marx as a theorist of democracy to offer his audience a new way to think about this political ideal. He argues that it is democracy, rather than Marxism, that is radical and revolutionary, and that Marx could have seen this but did not. In Part I, Howard explores the attraction Marxism held for intellectuals, particularly French intellectuals, and he demonstrates how the critique of totalitarianism from a Marxist viewpoint allowed these intellectuals to see the radical nature of democracy. Part II examines two hundred years of democratic political life -- comparing America's experience as a democracy to that of France. Part III offers a rethinking of Marx's contribution to democratic politics. Howard concludes that Marx was attempting a "philosophy by other means," and that paradoxically, just because he was such an astute philosopher, Marx was unable to see the radical political implications of his own analyses. The philosophically justified "revolution" turns out to be the basis of an anti-politics whose end was foreshadowed by the fall of European communism in 1989.<br>

  CHAPTER 13  Philosophy by Other Means? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/howa12484">The Specter of Democracy</a><br>
  Abstract: Paradoxically, after 1989 Marx’s political philosophy can be read not only as philosophical but also as political. If Marxism is not (in Sartre’s famous phrase) the “unsurpassable horizon of our times,” it remains a rigorous confrontation with modernity and a challenging attempt to understand its novelty.¹ This is because, despite Marx’s intention to provide a theory 
                  of the revolutionary proletariat that would serve for the praxis of that world historical agent, he was and continued to be a philosopher; despite his critique(s) of idealism, Marx remained under its spell. Indeed, this philosophical intention ultimately vitiates his attempt to surpass philosophy<br>

  Abstract: In this book I have argued that the dominant approach to cosmopolitanism in contemporary political philosophy is undermined by what could be described as a lack of realism. That approach proceeds as though, by developing the best moral arguments and normative visions, it will be able to persuade people—presumably those in a position to change things—to bring about a better world. This practical presupposition is seldom defended explicitly; rather, it is taken to be self-evident—simply what one does when one does political philosophy. Occasionally, it is true, cosmopolitan theorists ask whether the ends or schemes they develop<br>

  Book Title: Situating Existentialism-Key Texts in Context<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): BERNASCONI ROBERT<br>
  Abstract: Emphasizing the multidisciplinary and global nature of existential arguments, the chosen texts relate to philosophy, religion, literature, theater, and culture and reflect European, Russian, Latin American, African, and American strains of thought. Readings are grouped into three thematic categories: national contexts, existentialism and religion, and transcultural migrations that explore the reception of existentialism. The volume explains how literary giants such as Dostoevsky and Tolstoy were incorporated into the existentialist fold and how inclusion into the canon recast the work of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, and it describes the roles played by Jaspers and Heidegger in Germany and the Paris School of existentialism in France. Essays address not only frequently assigned works but also underappreciated discoveries, underscoring their vital relevance to contemporary critical debate. Designed to speak to a new generation's concerns, the collection deploys a diverse range of voices to interrogate the fundamental questions of the human condition.<br>

  Abstract: Martin Heidegger was appointed to the chair in philosophy at Freiburg University in 1928 and delivered “What Is Metaphysics?” (his inaugural address) before the assembled faculty, in the main auditorium on Wednesday, July 24, 1929.¹ At once dense and abstract, the lecture was and will surely remain one of the truly classic statements in the canon of European existentialism.

                  I and Thou (Ich und Du), his concept of dialogue or the I–Thou relation has exercised a seminal influence extending far beyond Jewish philosophical circles. Written with a nigh-musical cadence, evocative inflections, and aphoristic formulations, this relatively thin volume has with some justification been characterized as a philosophical poem. Indeed, Buber explicitly rejected the traditional form of philosophical discourse. He regarded the function of philosophical thinking to be that of<br>

  Book Title: Reimagining the Sacred-Richard Kearney Debates God with James Wood, Catherine Keller, Charles Taylor, Julia Kristeva, Gianni Vattimo, Simon Critchley, Jean-Luc Marion, John Caputo, David Tracey, Jens Zimmermann, and Merold Westphal<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Zimmermann Jens<br>
  Abstract: Richard Kearney explores these questions with a host of philosophers known for their inclusive, forward-thinking work on the intersection of secularism, politics, and religion. An interreligious dialogue that refuses to paper over religious difference, these conversations locate the sacred within secular society and affirm a positive role for religion in human reflection and action. Drawing on his own philosophical formulations, literary analysis, and personal interreligious experiences, Kearney develops through these engagements a basic gesture of hospitality for approaching the question of God. His work facilitates a fresh encounter with our best-known voices in continental philosophy and their views on issues of importance to all spiritually minded individuals and skeptics: how to reconcile God's goodness with human evil, how to believe in both God and natural science, how to talk about God without indulging in fundamentalist rhetoric, and how to balance God's sovereignty with God's love.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/kear16102">Reimagining the Sacred</a><br>
  Author(s) Taylor Charles<br>
  Abstract: The Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor, one of the finest intellectual commentators on Western culture and religion, has written widely on political philosophy, theories of social science, and the history of philosophy. He is best known for his narrative account of modernity’s cultural origins and potential futures in
                  Sources of the Self: The Making of Modern Identity(1989), and, most recently,A Secular Age(2007). Especially in the last book, Taylor has shown that modernity’s rejection of religion is itself based on an assumed logic of history, or what he calls a “subtraction narrative”—the story that human progress in any<br>

  Author(s) Critchley Simon<br>
  Abstract: Simon Critchley is a British philosopher and public intellectual who is now Hans Jonas Professor of Philosophy at The New School for Social Research in New York. Critchley’s interdisciplinary research interests range from continental philosophy, literature, and psychoanalysis to ethics and political theory. After his first major book,
                     The Ethics of Deconstruction, on Levinas and Derrida, Critchley published an essay collection on literature, death, and ethics, entitledVery Little . . . Almost Nothing, in which he first articulated what he called “atheist transcendence,” a theme that returns in his most recent work,The Faith of the Faithless.<br>

  9  Anatheism and Radical Hermeneutics from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/kear16102">Reimagining the Sacred</a><br>
  Author(s) Caputo John<br>
  Abstract: John Caputo is an American philosopher of religion with particular expertise in phenomenology, hermeneutics, and deconstruction. He is widely known for developing Derrida’s deconstruction into “radical hermeneutics,” a philosophy that subverts any essentialist claims and resists arresting the play of interpretation.¹ This radical hermeneutics is closely aligned with Caputo’s interest in theopoetics, a term that is variously defined by practitioners but that entails the notion that both God and life are best described poetically rather than rationalistically. Theopoetics, at least in Caputo’s radical hermeneutics, and also in Kearney’s anatheism, has connotations of

  Book Title: Religion and the Specter of the West-Sikhism, India, Postcoloniality, and the Politics of Translation<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mandair Arvind-Pal S.<br>
  Abstract: Mandair rethinks the intersection of religion and the secular in discourses such as history of religions, postcolonial theory, and recent continental philosophy. Though seemingly unconnected, these discourses are shown to be linked to a philosophy of "generalized translation" that emerged as a key conceptual matrix in the colonial encounter between India and the West. In this riveting study, Mandair demonstrates how this philosophy of translation continues to influence the repetitions of religion and identity politics in the lives of South Asians, and the way the academy, state, and media have analyzed such phenomena.<br>

  Book Title: The Highway of Despair-Critical Theory After Hegel<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Marasco Robyn<br>
  Abstract: The Highway of Despairfollows Theodor Adorno, Georges Bataille, and Frantz Fanon as they each read, resist, and reconfigure a strand of thought in Hegel'sPhenomenology of Spirit. Confronting the twentieth-century collapse of a certain revolutionary dialectic, these thinkers struggle to revalue critical philosophy and recast Left Hegelianism within the contexts of genocidal racism, world war, and colonial domination. Each thinker also re-centers the role of passion in critique. Arguing against more recent trends in critical theory that promise an escape from despair, Marasco shows how passion frustrates the resolutions of reason and faith. Embracing the extremism of what Marx, in the spirit of Hegel, called the "ruthless critique of everything existing," she affirms the contemporary purchase of radical critical theory, resulting in a passionate approach to political thought.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/mara16866">The Highway of Despair</a><br>
  Abstract: This is a book about Hegel and some twentieth-century thinkers who read Hegel for the purposes of radical political thought and social criticism. Though the term “Left Hegelian” is typically reserved for a relatively small group of nineteenth-century Prussian theorists, it might also designate the varied and enduring attempts to bring Hegel’s philosophy to bear on radical politics. In this broader sense, then, what follows are close encounters with some twentieth-century Left Hegelians: Theodor W. Adorno, Georges Bataille, and Frantz Fanon, in particular. Each is reckoning with the collapse of revolutionary projects and clarifying the tasks of critique in the<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/mara16866">The Highway of Despair</a><br>
  Abstract: Hegel did not describe his work as critique.¹ In the
                  Phenomenology of Spirit, he portrays his efforts not in terms of critical philosophy, which would have aligned him squarely with Kant, but as an attempt to unite the desire for knowledge with actual knowing.² What Hegel had in mind in this union of philosophy and science was not quite critique in the Kantian sense, but rather theconsummationof the love of knowledge (philosophy) with the historical and phenomenological experience of knowing (science).³ Hegel aimed to “complete” philosophy, not only by giving it a definitive reality in human history, but<br>

  Abstract: No single thinker has done more to shape the idea of critical theory in the postwar period than Jürgen Habermas. As I see things, Habermas turns away from a potential project opened up by the thinkers considered in this study—not just Adorno, to whom his connection is obvious, but also Bataille, of whom he is substantially more critical, and Fanon, about whom he says nothing. In recent years, Habermas has turned his attention to questions pertaining to philosophy and religion, the relationship between reason and faith, and the connection between postmetaphysical thinking and theological endeavors. These inquiries are exciting,<br>

  Abstract: In my discussion of Mahāyāna Buddhism, I pointed out that the Buddhist doctrine of emptiness, in its very abstractness, shares that feature with many of the world’s great religions and with forms of the Absolute participating in a form of “secular spirituality.” That God exists “only philosophically,” attributed to Spinoza, expresses a larger truth of the world in the religious and secular traditions, wherein philosophers posit an abstract entity or Absolute or Being that exist outside the phenomenal world of becoming. However, while the God of Spinoza’s skeptical philosophy is based on the science and mathematics of his time, such<br>

  Book Title: A Hedonist Manifesto-The Power to Exist<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): McClellan Joseph<br>
  Abstract: Onfray attacks Platonic idealism and its manifestation in Judaic, Christian, and Islamic belief. He warns of the lure of attachment to the purportedly eternal, immutable truths of idealism, which detracts from the immediacy of the world and our bodily existence. Insisting that philosophy is a practice that operates in a real, material space, Onfray enlists Epicurus and Democritus to undermine idealist and theological metaphysics; Nietzsche, Bentham, and Mill to dismantle idealist ethics; and Palante and Bourdieu to collapse crypto-fascist neoliberalism. In their place, he constructs a positive, hedonistic ethics that enlarges on the work of the New Atheists to promote a joyful approach to our lives in this, our only, world.<br>

  Abstract: Classical historiography of philosophy is constructed by wishful thinking. Strangely, the apostles of pure reason and transcendental deduction all agree in the mythology that they create and that they perpetuate with a vengeance by teaching, compiling, lecturing, writing, and publishing fables. Through repetition, these become gospel truths. Scholarly looting, unmarked citation, conceptual regurgitation of other’s work—these are the happy practices of those who edit encyclopedias, conceive lexicons, and otherwise write the history of philosophy and the textbooks in which it is inscribed.<br>

  Abstract: Other powerful lineages populate the history of philosophy. There are other binaries to describe the issues and people at work in the tradition. Of course, there is Idealism and Materialism; the ascetic Ideal and the hedonist Ideal; and transcendence and immanence. But equally, there is denigration of the “I” and writing about the self. On the one hand, the philosophers I have listed did not seem to value autobiographical confession or little details derived from personal experiences. On the other hand, their lives fed their thought and they acknowledged drawing lessons from life. Some are messengers who efface themselves, trying<br>

  Abstract: The idealist tradition manifests in an ad hoc way. Plato practiced a schizophrenic pedagogy: he had an oral esoteric discourse intended for elites, while offering an exoteric teaching to a greater number of people. This is an aristocratic practice of philosophy. The Academy professes that Plato is for everyone, that nothing prohibits us from taking a course on Plato. What we call his complete corpus comes from that one accessible, exoteric transmission.<br>

  Abstract: “It is characteristic of philosophical writing that it must continually confront the question of 
                  Darstellung.” This—the opening sentence of the “Epistemo-Critical Prologue” to The Origin of German Tragic Drama—is arguably the most important and philosophically freighted sentence in the entire Benjaminian oeuvre. In quoting it in English translation I have left the original Darstellung, because the way this particular word—with a long history in German philosophy and aesthetics—is translated at once raises and potentially begs many questions: is it better translated as “representation” or as “presentation”? The published translation has “representation,” which does indeed correspond to<br>

  Book Title: Encountering Religion-Responsibility and Criticism After Secularism<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROBERTS TYLER<br>
  Abstract: To respond to religion is to ask what religious behaviors and representations mean to us in our individual worlds, and scholars must confront questions of possibility and becoming that arise from testing their beliefs, imperatives, and practices. Roberts refers to the work of Hent de Vries, Eric Santner, and Stanley Cavell, each of whom exemplifies encounter and response in their writings as they traverse philosophy and religion to expose secular thinking to religious thought and practice. This approach highlights the resources religious discourse can offer to a fundamental reorientation of critical thought. In humanistic criticism after secularism, the lines separating the creative, the pious, and the critical themselves become the subject of question and experimentation.<br>

  Abstract: To develop my ideas about the humanistic study of religion, I have drawn from a range of disciplines and methods, from the historical work of Orsi and Hollywood, the anthropology of Jackson and Mahmood, and the political theory of Coles. I turn now to philosophy, the discipline with which I most often identify my own research and scholarship. I am tempted to write “philosophy of religion” and so name a familiar location on the map of the academic study of religion. But I resist the temptation because this map is inadequate, in part because “philosophy of religion” traditionally has been<br>

  Book Title: The Death of Philosophy-Reference and Self-reference in Contemporary Thought<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): LYNCH RICHARD A.<br>
  Abstract: Thomas-Fogiel begins with postphilosophical claims such as scientism, which she reveals to be self-refuting, for they subsume philosophy into the branches of the natural sciences. She discovers similar issues in Rorty's skepticism and strands of continental thought. Revisiting the work of late-nineteenth and early-twentieth-century philosophers, when the split between analytical and continental philosophy began, Thomas-Fogiel finds both traditions followed the same path-the road of reference-which ultimately led to self-contradiction. This phenomenon, whether valorized or condemned, has been understood as the death of philosophy. Tracing this pattern from Quine to Rorty, from Heidegger to Levinas and Habermas, Thomas-Fogiel reveals the self-contradiction at the core of their claims while also carving an alternative path through self-reference. Trained under the French philosopher Bernard Bourgeois, she remakes philosophy in exciting new ways for the twenty-first century.<br>

  Abstract: My analysis of the discourse pronouncing the death of philosophy shall begin with its most resounding assertions and end with its resigned, and even surreptitious, acceptances. Indeed, this theme, so common today, is inflected according to different variations whose nuances we must grasp so that their commonalities are more clearly illustrated at the end of our examination. This is why I will start my inquiry with the most radical antiphilosophers, those we can call, with Vincent Descombes, the “post-contemporary philosophers,”¹ and I will show how their ideas, beneath their manifest differences (since they go from the most radical skepticism to<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/thom14778">The Death of Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: Jürgen Habermas’s philosophy seems, across its different periods, to display the most salient trait of contemporary philosophy. This contemporary philosophy is characterized by what we can call its “antispeculative” habitus, a habitus that is entirely structured around a critique of classical metaphysics, generally characterized as a symbol of the hubris of a human thought that desires to subjugate the entirety of what there is under its almighty power. All the trends that I have already discussed could be united under this banner, as could just as easily Derridian deconstruction. Habermas has illustrated this vast genre, the veritable backbone of contemporary<br>

  Abstract: Doctrines that variously express one of the three characteristics that I have delineated—(1) philosophy’s scientificity, (2) examination of the nature of pragmatic contradiction, and (3) the problem of the status of the philosopher’s discourse as a problem of self-reference—are legion throughout the history of philosophy. On this point, the first required trait (namely, the affirmation of philosophy as a science in the face of a devastating skepticism) is superbly embodied by the dispute between Plato and the Sophists. Similarly, many of Aristotle’s arguments could be taken up against contemporary skepticism. And again, the theme of philosophy as a<br>

The first is probably the most important in that it determines the mode of reasoning that advances philosophy to the rank of a knowledge that aspires to truth by taking self-referentiality as a law, model, and guide<br>

  Abstract: At first sight, Marxism and memory appear as two foreign continents. Since Marx, many scholars belonging to his intellectual tradition have elaborated philosophies of history or investigated historical temporalities—E. P. Thompson’s studies on time and work discipline in early industrial capitalism are the most known—but have never conceptualized collective remembrance. Opened one century ago by Henri Bergson and Maurice Halbwachs, the scholarly debate on memory deeply shaped sociology, historiography, and philosophy without receiving any significant Marxist contribution. The rare assessments made by Marxist scholars on this topic simply reproduce a classical, positivistic dichotomy between history and memory: memory<br>

  Book Title: After Christianity-  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): D’Isanto Luca<br>
  Abstract: When Vattimo was asked by a former teacher if he still believed in God, his reply was, "Well, I believe that I believe." This paradoxical declaration of faith serves as the foundation for a brilliant exposition on Christianity in the new millennium -- an age characterized by a deep uncertainty of opinion -- and a personal account of how Vattimo himself recovered his faith through Nietzsche and Heidegger. He first argues that secularization is in fact the fulfillment of the central Christian message, and prepares us for a new mode of Christianity. He then explains that Nietzsche's thesis concerns only the "moral god" and leaves room for the emergence of "new gods." Third, Vattimo claims that the postmodern condition of fragmentation, anti-Eurocentrism, and postcolonialism can be usefully understood in light of Joachim of Fiore's thesis concerning the "Spiritual Age" of history. Finally, Vattimo argues for the idea of "weak thought." Because philosophy in the postmetaphysical age can only acknowledge that "all is interpretation," that the "real" is always relative and not the hard and fast "truth" we once thought it to be, contemporary thought must recognize itself and its claims as "weak" as opposed to "strong" foundationalist claims of the metaphysical past. Vattimo concludes that these factors make it possible for religion and God to become a serious topic for philosophy again, and that philosophy should now formally engage religion.<br>

Large bodies of work exist expounding its various connotations and meanings, ranging from questions of accountability and guilt to the need to respond to alterity. And yet there is something rather elusive about the political connotations of contemporary invocations of responsibility within the context of the turn to ethics in the humanities and social sciences, an elusiveness that at first glance seems largely due to hyperindividualized, abstract, and unhistorical thematizations of responsibility.

Many claim that it sounded the death knell for history, art, ideology, science, possibly all of Western philosophy, and certainly for the concept of reality itself. Responding to essential questions regarding whether the humanities can remain politically and academically relevant amid this twenty-first-century uncertainty,
         Why the Humanities Matteroffers a guided tour of the modern condition, calling upon thinkers in a variety of disciplines to affirm essential concepts such as truth, goodness, and beauty.<br>

  ONE  SELF, IDENTITY, AND IDEAS from:

  Abstract: I begin at the beginning: what constitutes the self? Of course, I’m not the fi rst to ask this, nor will I be the last. However, I begin with this seemingly limitless domain of inquiry—approached from so many disciplinary angles, such as history, philosophy, political science, sociology, economics, linguistics, biology, physics, chemistry—because when all is said and done, all of the chapters that make up this book wind back to the many cultural webs we spin out of our selves in the transformation of (our) nature.<br>

  Book Title: The Deed of Reading-Literature * Writing * Language * Philosophy<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): STEWART GARRETT<br>
  Abstract: To take the measure of literary writing,
         The Deed of Readingconvenes diverse philosophic commentary on the linguistics of literature, with stress on the complementary work of Stanley Cavell and Giorgio Agamben. Sympathetic to recent ventures in form-attentive analysis but resisting an emphasis on so-called surface reading, Stewart explores not some new formalism but the internal pressures of language in formation, registering the verbal infrastructure of literary prose as well as verse. In this mode of "contextual" reading, the context is language itself. Literary phrasing, tapping the speech act's own generative pulse, emerges as a latent philosophy of language in its own right, whereby human subjects, finding no secure place to situate themselves within language, settle for its taking place in, through, and between them.<br>

  Abstract: First Giorgio Agamben, now Stanley Cavell: on the “ends” of literary writing as performed language—or say, in Agamben’s genitive swivels, on “the idea of language” and “the thought of voice.” In the redoubtable line of Ludwig Wittgenstein and J. L. Austin, Cavell participates in an ordinary language philosophy bent on excavating, from within the prosaic cadences of everyday speech, their evidence of philosophical pressure points. In adapting this approach to a literary prosaics of formative reading, my effort is to extend his method in general (while following his example in certain specific cases) to the eccentric phonic and syntactic<br>

  6  TALKING ROOM from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7591/j.ctt1h4mhkq">The Deed of Reading</a><br>
  Abstract: Literature’s script makes room for its own kind of back talk: that’s one way of evoking the vocal undertow of certain inscribed turns in the prose as well as poetry we’ve surveyed. In general, as I began by regretting, there is no disciplinary tautology (far from it) in thinking of “literature writing language,” let alone its “writing language philosophy.” For language is often forgotten in cultural estimates of what is too causally termed literary
                  writingand its effects. Whenever in evidence, any attention to the disclosure, rather than sheer service, of language within a work of words tends to educe<br>

  Abstract: After the words are laid out, if no longer in cold type but in laser jet or backlight, how does reading revive them as immanent speech act? And what—this book has gone on to ask—is implied there, there in the deed of reading, for a philosophy of the subject as
                  homo loquens? Where, in fact, isthere, exactly? And how often does the phonetic aftermath of a given word seem to generate its own virtual alternative as part of the serial coming-to-be not just of a verbalized world elsewhere but of a newly channeled linguistic gesture?

  Prologue. from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7591/j.ctt1xx5gp">Inconceivable Effects</a><br>
  Abstract: A book including the word “ethics” on its cover invokes, for better or for worse, a certain professional affiliation with the field of philosophy and, more specifically, the philosophical branch of ethics. This book, however, is neither written 
                  by a philosopher, nor is it, strictly speaking, written for philosophers. As a matter of fact, philosophers, especially those who professionally concern themselves with questions of ethics, will likely perceive this book to be a great disappointment. The book will disappoint professional philosophers because it conceives ethics in an extremely flexible sense as it arises out of the reading of individual texts<br>

  Abstract: As he tried to widen the scope and refine the method of his 
                  Kulturwissenschaft, Warburg wrestled with giants whose historiographies had shaped the fields he hoped to map. To begin with, there was J.J. Winckelmann (1717–56), whose neo-Stoic, decidedly aesthetic interpretations of Greek culture and its imitators found “edle Einfalt und stille Größe” not only in the Laocoön statue and Plato’s philosophy, but also in Raphael’s painting.¹ Partly to shake free of Winckelmann’s constricting influence on German art history, Warburg turned to Jacob Burckhardt, whose enormously influential account of Italian Renaissance culture had been increasingly eclipsed increasingly eclipsed in<br>

  Book Title: The Emergency of Being-On Heidegger’s “Contributions to Philosophy”<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): POLT RICHARD<br>
  Abstract: Polt's original reading neither reduces this challenging text to familiar concepts nor refutes it, but engages it in a confrontation-an encounter that respects a way of thinking by struggling with it. He describes this most private work of Heidegger's philosophy as "a dissonant symphony that imperfectly weaves together its moments into a vast fugue, under the leitmotif of appropriation. This fugue is seeded with possibilities that are waiting for us, its listeners, to develop them. Some are dead ends-viruses that can lead only to a monolithic, monotonous misunderstanding of history. Others are embryonic insights that promise to deepen our thought, and perhaps our lives, if we find the right way to make them our own."<br>

  Author(s): Savage Robert<br>
  Abstract: What role do metaphors play in philosophical language? Are they impediments to clear thinking and clear expression, rhetorical flourishes that may well help to make philosophy more accessible to a lay audience, but that ought ideally to be eradicated in the interests of terminological exactness? Or can the images used by philosophers tell us more about the hopes and cares, attitudes and indifferences that regulate an epoch than their carefully elaborated systems of thought?<br>

  Abstract: Let us try for a moment to imagine that modern philosophy had proceeded according to the methodological program set out for it by Descartes, and had arrived at that definitive conclusion that Descartes himself believed to be eminently attainable. This ‘end state’ of philosophy, which historical experience permits us to entertain only as a hypothesis, would be defined according to the criteria set out in the four rules of the Cartesian “Discours de la méthode,” in particular by the clarity and distinctness that the first rule requires of all matters apprehended in judgments.

  Abstract: If we attempt now to elaborate and set out a 
                  typology of metaphor histories with the help of paradigms, this does not imply that the thematic goal and ideal of the metaphorology we have in mind would consist in such a typology. In carrying out this task, we should recall that metaphorology—as a subbranch of conceptual history, and like the latter itself considered as a whole—must always be an auxiliary discipline to philosophy as it seeks to understand itself from its history and to bring that history to living presence. Our typology of metaphor histories must accordingly endeavor<br>

  INTRODUCTION: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7591/j.ctt7v967">Artifice and Design</a><br>
  Abstract: There are many books about art, many about technology, but few about art 
                     and technology—about their affinity and the relationship of both together to human experience.¹ It is this relationship that is my topic here. I develop philosophical concepts of art, artifact, knowledge, technology, and tool, which I use to explore parallel questions about artistry in technology and technics in art. The result is a work of interdisciplinary philosophical research, with concepts and arguments drawn from evolutionary biology, cognitive psychology, science studies, aesthetics, and the history, philosophy, and anthropology of art and technology.<br>

  Abstract: The theory of tools and technical action is poorly developed in Western philosophy. There has been little advance over the ideas of Aristotle, which contain serious errors. Another source of misunderstanding is the “well-known fact” that lots of species use tools, especially chimpanzees. This chapter is partly a critique of prevailing ideas about tools and artifacts. I want to show the need for a new take on the basic concepts of technological civilization, including 
                  artifact, artifice, technique, and tool. One topic I will not be discussing is “modern” or advanced, scientific technology. I leave that to chapter 4. This chapter<br>

  Book Title: Meaning, Truth, and Reference in Historical Representation-  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Ankersmit Frank<br>
  Abstract: In this book, the noted intellectual historian Frank Ankersmit provides a systematic account of the problems of reference, truth, and meaning in historical writing. He works from the conviction that the historicist account of historical writing, associated primarily with Leopold von Ranke and Wilhelm von Humboldt, is essentially correct but that its original idealist and romanticist idiom needs to be translated into more modern terms. Rehabilitating historicism for the contemporary philosophy of history, he argues, "reveals the basic truths about the nature of the past itself, how we relate to it, and how we make sense of the past in historical writing."<br>

  Abstract: As far as I know, the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga (1872–1945) has until now been the only theorist of historical writing to take seriously the notion of historical experience.¹ This is not surprising, since there seems to be near-unanimous agreement that the experience of the past is of no use for a proper explanation of historical writing and of how it came into being. Or, to be more precise, all that the existing philosophy of history has on offer is a theory 
                  denying that there could be such a thing as an experience of the past at all. A<br>

  Abstract: Throughout this book my compass has been the claim put forward in chapter 3 that representation/aesthetics is prior to interpretation/hermeneutics and that it is better to investigate the writing of history from the perspective of representation than from that of interpretation. Interpretation is something one does with texts that already exist, and the phrase “interpreting 
                  the past ” can therefore never be more than a deconstructivist metaphor. So when the linguistic (or, rather, rhetorical) turn in contemporary philosophy of history put a premium on interpretation at the expense of representation, the result was what one might call an “etherealization” of<br>

But after the rise of historicism in the school of Ranke and Droysen, a retrospective redemption seemed possible.

  Author(s) Swisher Michael<br>
  Abstract: Herder’s importance for the development of thinking in the field of aesthetics and poetics has always been recognized, but it has been difficult to define the nature and extent of his contributions. They came during a crucial time of evolution leading into what is generally termed as European Romanticism. It seems to be necessary to define more precisely where exactly to locate Herder in this momentous shift of worldviews. In the second half of the eighteenth century, aesthetics established itself as a discipline of philosophy. In contrast to earlier rule-based poetics, the question of the nature of art now came<br>

  Author(s) Gaier Ulrich<br>
  Abstract: Contrary to the widespread prejudices that the eighteenth century, being a period of rational enlightenment, was an “extremely barren epoch for research in mythology”¹ and that the call for New Mythology toward the end of the century signaled an anti-rational criticism of enlightenment,² myth plays a central role as early as in the works of Christian Wolff (1679–1754) and Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten (1714–1762), protagonists of German Enlightenment philosophy. They represent, to a certain extent, the two traditions of the mythical mode of thinking,³ which can be linked, respectively, to Plato (427–347 B.C.) and Aristotle (384–322 B.C.).<br>

  Abstract: Herder’s views on political topics such as liberty and tyranny, sovereignty, the constitutions of states, statecraft, and international relations were largely theoretical, the product of wide-ranging studies in history, theology, philosophy, and the emerging discipline of comparative anthropology. Due to his vocation as a theologian and Protestant clergyman, Herder was virtually precluded from holding political office or commenting frankly on public affairs, except as mediated by the established church. Thus he stands in contrast to Goethe, whose training as a lawyer and long years of service managing the affairs of the Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach gave him practical insight into the<br>

  Book Title: Aesthetic Vision and German Romanticism-Writing Images<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Prager Brad<br>
  Abstract: The work of the groundbreaking writers and artists of German Romanticism -- including the writers Tieck, Brentano, and Eichendorff and the artists Caspar David Friedrich and Philipp Otto Runge -- followed from the philosophical arguments of the German Idealists, who placed emphasis on exploring the subjective space of the imagination. The Romantic perspective was a form of engagement with Idealist discourses, especially Kant's Critique of Pure Reason and Fichte's Science of Knowledge. Through an aggressive, speculative reading of Kant, the Romantics abandoned the binary distinction between the palpable outer world and the ungraspable space of the mind's eye and were therefore compelled to develop new terms for understanding the distinction between "internal" and "external." In this light, Brad Prager urges a reassessment of some of Romanticism's major oppositional tropes, contending that binaries such as "self and other," "symbol and allegory," and "light and dark," should be understood as alternatives to Lessing's distinction between interior and exterior worlds. Prager thus crosses the boundaries between philosophy, literature, and art history to explore German Romantic writing about visual experience, examining the interplay of text and image in the formulation of Romantic epistemology.

  Abstract: These words, written by Novalis, declare that philosophy begins in an act of self-destruction, or more precisely formulated: all properly philosophical acts aim to destroy the self. This demand is not as mysterious as it might seem. A self, by definition, is differentiated and limited, and thus represents one of the most palpable impediments to that which romantic philosophy seeks, namely, the absolute,
                  das Unbedingte, that which is without condition and without limit. A truly philosophical act must efface the horizon of limitations and differences that constitutes selfhood:Selbsttödtung, self-annihilation. The proper name for this act is not suicide,<br>

  Book Title: Rethinking Hanslick-Music, Formalism, and Expression<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Marx Wolfgang<br>
  Abstract: Rethinking Hanslick: Music, Formalism, and Expression' is the first extensive English-language study devoted to Eduard Hanslick--a seminal figure in nineteenth-century musical life. Bringing together eminent scholars from several disciplines, this volume examines Hanslick's contribution to the aesthetics and philosophy of music and looks anew at his literary interests. The essays embrace ways of thinking about Hanslick's writings that go beyond the polarities that have long marked discussion of his work such as form/expression, absolute/program music, objectivity/subjectivity, and formalist/hermeneutic criticism. This approach takes into consideration both Hanslick's important 'On the Musically Beautiful' and his critical and autobiographical writings, demonstrating Hanslick's rich insights into the context in which a musical work is composed, performed, and received. 'Rethinking Hanslick' serves as an invaluable companion to Hanslick's prodigious scholarship and criticism, deepening our understanding of the major themes and ideas of one of the most influential music critics of the nineteenth century.

Throughout, there is a strong emphasis on both the philosophy of engagement and with its enactment in specific contexts; the essays deal with an interest in the meaning, value and contested nature of the recent past and in the theory and practice of archaeological engagements with that past.

  Book Title: Narratives of Identity in Alban Berg's "Lulu"-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): dos Santos Silvio J.<br>
  Abstract: Exploring the crossroads between autobiographical narrative and musical composition, this book examines Berg's transformation of Frank Wedekind's Erdgeist (1895) and Die Büchse der Pandora/ (1904) -- the plays used in the formation of the libretto for Lulu -- according to notions of gender identity, social customs, and the aesthetics of modernity in Vienna of the 1920s and 1930s. While Berg modernized several aspects of the plays by Wedekind and incorporated serial techniques of composition from Arnold Schoenberg, he never let go of the idealistic Wagnerian perspectives of his youth. In fact, he went as far as reconfiguring aspects of Richard Wagner's life as an ideal identity to be played out in the compositional process. In the process of composing the opera, Berg also reflected on the most important cultural figures in fin-de-siècle Vienna that affected his worldview, including Karl Kraus, Emil Lucka, Otto Weininger, and others. Adopting an approach that combines a systematic analysis of Berg's numerous sketches for Lulu, correspondence, and the finished work with interpretive models drawn from cultural studies and philosophy, this book elucidates the ways in which Berg grappled with his self-image as an "incorrigible romantic" (unverbesserliche Romantiker) at the end of his life, explaining aspects of his musical language that have been considered strange or anomalous in the scholarship.

  Book Title: Modern German Thought from Kant to Habermas-An Annotated German-Language Reader<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Large Duncan<br>
  Abstract: German-language thinkers such as Kant, Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud are central to modernity. Yet their reception in the English-speaking world has largely depended on translations, a situation that has often hampered full engagement with the rhetorical and philosophical complexity of the German history of ideas. The present volume, the first of its kind, is a response to this situation. After an introduction charting the remarkable flowering of German-language thought since the eighteenth century, it offers extracts -- in the original German -- from sixteen major philosophical texts, with extensive introductions and annotations in English. All extracts are carefully chosen to introduce the individual thinkers while allowing the reader to pursue broader themes such as the fate of reason or the history of modern selfhood. The book offers students and scholars of German a complement to linguistic, historical, and literary study by giving them access to the wealth of German-language philosophy. It represents a new way into the work of a succession of thinkers who have defined modern philosophy and thus remain of crucial relevance today. The philosophers: Immanuel Kant, G. W. F. Hegel, Ludwig Feuerbach, Karl Marx, Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, Martin Heidegger, Walter Benjamin, Georg Lukács, Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno, Jürgen Habermas.

  Abstract: In the recent evolution of philosophy in France we can trace the passage from the generation known after 1945 as that of the “three H’s” to the generation known since 1960 as that of the three “masters of suspicion”: the three H’s being Hegel, Husserl and Heidegger, and the three masters of suspicion Marx, Nietzsche and Freud.¹<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt6wp91n">Modern German Thought from Kant to Habermas</a><br>
  Abstract: The title “father of modern philosophy” (
                  modernin the sense of “not ancient”) is usually ascribed to the Frenchman René Descartes (1596–1650). By introducing mathematical methods into philosophy, Descartes founded the rationalist tradition in epistemology (the theory of knowledge and its objects), which holds that all knowledge of reality is ultimately derived from the exercise of human reason according to foundational principles independent of the senses. The rationalist position, which in Germany was taken up by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716), Christian Wolff (1679–1754), and Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten (1714–62), gave philosophical underpinnings to the European intellectual movement<br>

  Abstract: Born in Stuttgart in 1770, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel studied theology and philosophy at the Tübinger Stift, the theological seminary attached to the University of Tübingen. Here, he formed friendships with two students who would also become major figures in German cultural history, the poet Friedrich Hölderlin and the philosopher F. W. J. Schelling. He graduated in 1793. Not wanting to become a vicar, he started working as a private tutor, first in Bern (where he became acquainted with the work of the economists James Steuart and Adam Smith, whose ideas would remain crucial to his thinking) and after that<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt6wp91n">Modern German Thought from Kant to Habermas</a><br>
  Abstract: Ludwig Feuerbach was born in Landshut, Bavaria, in 1804. His father was a politically liberal jurist of international renown; one of Ludwig’s brothers, Karl Wilhelm, would make a name for himself in mathematics; and one of his nephews, Anselm, was to become a famous painter. In 1823, Feuerbach started studying theology in Heidelberg, where, through the teaching of Karl Daub, he became an enthusiastic adherent of Hegelianism. After two semesters, he moved to Berlin to study with Hegel himself, switching from theology to philosophy in the process. He completed his studies at the University of Erlangen in 1828 with a<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt6wp91n">Modern German Thought from Kant to Habermas</a><br>
  Abstract: The year 1788 stands out in the history of German philosophy for being the year in which Kant’s
                  Kritik der praktischen Vernunftwas published, in Riga, and Arthur Schopenhauer was born, down the Baltic coast in Danzig (now Gdańsk, Poland), on 22 February. This contingent conjunction of the two philosophers’ lives was a happy coincidence, since Schopenhauer would in due course become one of Kant’s most devoted followers (as well as one of his most stringent critics). Their lives were markedly different, though, and can perhaps be taken as symptomatic of the larger differences between the Enlightenment and the Romantic<br>

  Abstract: Karl Marx was born in the historic Rhineland city of Trier in 1818, into a middle-class Jewish family. From 1835 until 1841 he studied a rather eclectic variety of subjects, including law and philosophy, at Bonn and Berlin before obtaining his doctorate from the University of Jena with a comparative study of the Greek philosophers Democritus and Epicurus. During these years, he was heavily influenced by the Young Hegelians, a group of left-wing intellectuals who used what they considered the progressive elements in Hegel’s philosophy to move beyond that philosophy with its seemingly conservative implications into various forms of political<br>

  Abstract: Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche was born in the village of Röcken, Saxony, on 15 October 1844. His father and both grandfathers were Protestant clergymen, so the family naturally expected him to follow in this tradition when, after attending primary school in Naumburg, in 1858 he took up a place at the prestigious boarding school of Schulpforta nearby. Here, he excelled at the classics, which he went on to study at the universities of Bonn (1864) and Leipzig (1865–69), by which stage he had abandoned his religious faith.

  Abstract: Heidegger polarizes opinion. To some, he is the most important philosopher of the twentieth century; to others, he is little more than a mystifying word-spinner. The perplexingly difficult nature of his work derives to a significant extent from his exploitation of the resources of the German language, so — even more than with most other philosophers — there is a clear advantage in reading him in the original rather than in translation. In the immediate postwar period, the vogue for Existentialism favored Jean-Paul Sartre (whose early philosophy was largely based, as Hubert L.

The exploratory nature of Plato’s writings, as well as their apparent inconsistencies, are well documented.¹ His contradictory attitude, for instance, to poetry’s relationship to the polity has not only dogged disciplinary discourse in terms of a centuries-long quarrel between philosophy and literature, but has also given rise to a provocative paradigm that connects order within the self to the construction of a utopian state. Individual selfhood is symbolically politicised in this process, while the construction<br>

  Book Title: Tragedy and the Tragic in German Literature, Art, and Thought-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Quinn Thomas P.<br>
  Abstract: The many catastrophes of German history have often been described as tragic. Consequently, German literature, music, philosophy, painting, and even architecture are rich in tragic connotations. Yet exactly what "tragedy" and "the tragic" may mean requires clarification. The poet creates a certain artful shape and trajectory for raw experience by "putting it into words"; but does putting such experience into words (or paintings or music or any other form) betray suffering by turning it into mere art? Or is it art that first turns mere suffering into tragic experience by revealing and clarifying its deepest dimension? What are we talking about, exactly, when we talk about tragic experience and tragic art, especially in an age in which, according to Hannah Arendt, evil has become banal? Does banality muffle or even annul the tragic? Does tragedy take suffering and transform it into beauty, as Schiller thought? Is it in the interest of truth for suffering to be "beautiful"? Is it possible that poetry, music, and art are important because they in fact create the meaning of suffering? Or is suffering only suffering and not accessible to meaning, tragic or otherwise? This book comprises essays that seek to clarify the meaning of tragedy and the tragic in its many German contexts, art forms, and disciplines, from literature and philosophy to music, painting, and history.

  Abstract: My characterization of the ethical potentialities of exemplary rhetoric admittedly flies in the face of a commonplace critical presumption about the teleology of morals and the authoritarian nature of didactic literature. A composite sketch of the teleological account might take the following form: morality took an unfortunate turn in the Middle Ages when it assimilated itself to Church-dominated dogmatism, until moral rationalism found its feet again in the autonomous ethics of Enlightenment reason and Reformist spirituality. The assumption is that modern philosophy forever made ethics personal and appealingly complex again; and so in the vicissitudes of history, medieval morality stands<br>

  Abstract: In its ethical capacity exemplary rhetoric has been maligned at least since the time of Kant’s fatal pronouncement, “worse service cannot be rendered morality than that an attempt be made to derive it from examples.”¹ The eighteenth-century rationalist could not accept that moral philosophy might legitimately be based upon the rhetoric of example, or rather, as it was known, reasoning from cases 
                  a posteriori.² When it came to the metaphysical grounding of morals Kant famously rejected cases and everything circumstantial for that matter, preferring “categorical imperatives” over all things “hypothetical.” Such a tectonic shift away from rhetoric towards pure a<br>

  Book Title: A Companion to Friedrich Nietzsche-Life and Works<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Bishop Paul<br>
  Abstract: Nietzsche looms over modern literature and thought; according to Gottfried Benn, "everything my generation discussed, thought through innerly; one could say: suffered; or one could even say: took to the point of exhaustion - all of it had already been said . . . by Nietzsche; all the rest was just exegesis." Nietzsche's influence on intellectual life today is arguably as great; witness the various societies, journals, and websites and the steady stream of papers, collections, and monographs. This ‘Companion’ offers new essays from the best Nietzsche scholars, emphasizing the interrelatedness of his life and thought, eschewing a superficial biographical method but taking seriously his claim that great philosophy is “the self-confession of its author and a kind of unintended and unremarked ‘memoir’.” Each essay examines a major work by Nietzsche; together, they offer an advanced introduction for students of German Studies, philosophy, and comparative literature as well as for the lay reader. Re-establishing the links between Nietzsche's philosophical texts and their biographical background, the volume alerts Nietzsche scholars and intellectual historians to the internal development of his thought and the aesthetic construction of his identity as a philosopher.

  Book Title: Friendship and Love, Ethics and Politics-Studies in Mediaeval and Early Modern History<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Österberg Eva<br>
  Abstract: Today, friendship, love and sexuality are mostly viewed as private, personal and informal relations. In the mediaeval and early modern period, just like in ancient times, this was different. The classical philosophy of friendship (Aristotle) included both friendship and love in the concept of philia. It was also linked to an argument about the virtues needed to become an excellent member of the city state. Thus, close relations were not only thought to be a matter of pleasant gatherings in privacy, but just as much a matter of ethics and politics. What, then, happened to the classical ideas of close relations when they were transmitted to philosophers, clerical and monastic thinkers, state officials or other people in the medieval and early modern period? To what extent did friendship transcend the distinctions between private and public that then existed? How were close relations shaped in practice? Did dialogues with close friends help to contribute to the process of subject-formation in the Renaissance and Enlightenment? To what degree did institutions of power or individual thinkers find it necessary to caution against friendship or love and sexuality?<br>

  Book Title: Hybrid Renaissance-Culture, Language, Architecture<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burke Peter<br>
  Abstract: Hybrid Renaissance presents the Renaissance in Italy, elsewhere in Europe and in the world beyond Europe as an example of cultural hybridization. It is impossible to give a clear definition of either of the two key concepts used in this book, “hybridization" and “Renaissance". Roughly speaking, hybridity refers to something new that emerges from the combination of diverse older elements. The term “hybridization" is preferable to “hybridity" because it refers to a process rather than to a state, and also because it encourages the writer and the readers alike to think in terms of more or less rather than of presence versus absence. The book begins with a discussion of the concept of cultural hybridity and a cluster of other concepts related to it. Then comes a geography of hybridity, focusing on three locales: courts, major cities (whether ports or capitals) and frontiers. There follow six chapters about the hybrid Renaissance in different fields: architecture, painting and sculpture, languages, literatures, music, philosophy and law and finally religion. The essay concludes with a brief account of attempts to resist hybridization or to purify cultures or domains from what was already hybridized<br>

  Abstract: The problem of the compatibility or incompatibility of ancient Greek philosophy with Christianity, acute in the fourth century, resurfaced in the thirteenth, the time of the rediscovery of Aristotle in Western Europe. Thomas Aquinas might be said to have translated Christianity into the language of Aristotle in his famous

They were described as “Averroists” (Averroistae) in other words followers of the twelfth-century Muslim polymath and commentator on Aristotle Ibn Rushd, known in the medieval West as Averroes. Aquinas criticized the Averroists<br>

  Book Title: Given World and Time-Temporalities in Context<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Miller Tyrus<br>
  Abstract: The interconnections of time with historical thought and knowledge have come powerfully to the fore since the 1970s. An international group of scholars, from a range of fields including literary theory, history of ideas, cultural anthropology, philosophy, intellectual history and theology, philology, and musicology, address the matter of time and temporalities. The volume’s essays, divided into four main topical groups question critically the key problem of context, connecting it to the problem of time. Contexts, the essays suggest, are not timeless. Time and its contexts are only partly “given” to us: to the primordial donations of time and world correspond our epistemic, moral, and practical modes of receiving what has been granted. The notion of context may have radically different parameters in different historical, cultural, and disciplinary situations. Topics include the deep antiquity, and the timeless time of eternity, as well as formal philosophies of history and the forms of histories implicit in individual and community experience. The medium specific use of time and history are examined with regard to song, image, film, oral narration, and legal discourse.<br>

Issue: et.2001.112.issue-1<br>
Date: 10 2001<br>
Author(s): Young, Jeffrey T.<br>
Abstract: Young’s new book on Adam Smith provides a careful textual analysis of Smith’s two major works:
      The Theory of Moral SentimentsandThe Wealth of Nations. Young argues, with good textual evidence, that Smith did not divide economics from moral theory and that, indeed, Smith thought of economics as a moral science. Young traces Smith’s economic and moral philosophy to Aristotle and Hume, and he points out, correctly, that “self‐interest itself had a significant moral dimension in Smith” (p. 173). Thus Smith’s alleged focus on self‐interest inThe Wealth of Nationshas normative dimensions not always recognized by all Smith scholars. Young uses Smith’s notions of the impartial spectator and benevolence as well as his theory of justice to link the two texts. This is a controversial conclusion since neither the impartial spectator nor benevolence is evident as an important concept inThe Wealth of Nations. Young also argues that Smith divides the economic sphere from the political sphere (see his matrix on p. 158), a questionable conclusion in light of Smith’s focus on political economy inThe Wealth of Nations. Young’s book also suffers from his apparently not having read Amartya Sen’s or my works on Smith, both of which make many of the same arguments Young develops. Still, Young has added further to the growing literature that reads Smith as a serious moral philosopher whose theory of self‐interest is far from libertarian and who neither divided economics from ethics nor politics from either.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: The necessity of both solidarity and proceduralism thus holds for both distributive and criminal justice. In the end, Ricoeur remains committed to notions that ground the just polity in community and mutual sharing without thinking that these notions require us to dispense with the formalism of procedures of justice. While the latter are not sufficient on their own to create or sustain a just society, while, indeed, formal procedures always presuppose some conception of the good, procedural conceptions allow us to recognize each other as subjects of rights. Although it is not always clear that Ricoeur succeeds in reconciling Rawls and Walzer or Habermas and Gadamer, he does provide a fresh perspective on current debates within his own interesting account of the structure of moral action.<br>

Author(s): Duranti Alessandro<br>
Abstract: Ahearn, always a perceptive writer, brings out a fear that many linguistic anthropologists have but rarely expressthe fear of being assimilated to sociocultural anthropology and thus losing their identity through the forfeiting of their specificity. This is the flip side of William Labovs original wish that sociolinguistics might disappear once linguistics agreed to see language as a social phenomenon (that this has not happened is both an indictment of linguistics narrowmindedness and a validation of Labovs and other sociolinguists efforts to develop sociolinguistics into a vibrant independent field). The question then arises why we should worry about being assimilated. Shouldnt we, on the contrary, welcome such a possibility, to be seen as a validation of our work or as the mainstreaming of our concerns? The problem is not in the future, which cannot be predicted, but in the past. Everything we know from our earlier experiences warns us that an anthropology without a distinct group of language specialists is likely to be an anthropology with a nave understanding of communication. We have seen it happen already. When anthropology departments decide not to have a linguistic subfield, thinking that they dont need one, their students tend to take language for granted, identifying it with a vague notion of discourse. It is for this reason that we need to sharpen our historical, theoretical, and methodological understanding of what it means to study language as culture. We owe it first to our students.<br>

Abstract: While sharing the aim of relating philosophy and theology, I do not think the project is best accomplished by thinking ontotheologically (at least, not in its Heideggerian sense). What is needed is to insist on a sharper distinction between ontotheological philosophy and religious theology so that we can better understand how they might relate. And here again, I agree with Robbins for different reasons: Ricoeur, Lévinas, and Marion are key sources in this project, for their work maintains the distinction that it calls into question.<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur gets the relation of critique and reason right, in Bourgeois’s eyes, as a philosopher who sees imagination tied to thinking at the boundary (not limit) of reason. In a chapter examining Derrida’s views on “sign, time, and trace” (chap. 7), Bourgeois elaborates Derrida’s view that Edmund Husserl’s distinction between meaningful expression and sign depends on a stable borderline between primary and secondary memory (or retention and recollection) in his theory of “the living present” (or duration), which, Derrida asserts, is phenomenologically unavailable. In light of this analysis, Bourgeois draws an interesting contrast between Derrida’s insistence on a discrete closure of meaning and Ricoeur’s theory of language and imagination based in a view of the living present of meaning and experience that refuses such discrete closure. Once more, however, Bourgeois overreaches when he attempts to identify these accurately drawn contrasts with the limit/boundary distinction. In Bourgeois’s reading of Ricoeur, imagination does not produce reason from below (as in Heidegger); rather, “reason itself limits knowledge to experience from above, putting the imagination in a central position both in knowledge and thinking” (p. 131). A productive imagination of living metaphor takes place at the boundary of reason, allowing the living present in meaning and action to escape deconstruction’s critique while still incorporating a positive relation to alterity. Nevertheless, Bourgeois may be drawing the wrong conclusion about these contrasts, for it seems possible to read both Ricoeur and Derrida as seeking to work at the boundary (not limit) of reason and to think somehow the presentation of the Idea in the Kantian sense. Whereas Ricoeur’s theory of metaphor and narrative allows him to present the semantic content of the Ideas of Reason positively, these remain for Derrida (as for Kant) unrepresentable, or “the impossible.” This problem has been Derrida’s enduring concern since his 1962
   Introduction to Husserl’s “The Origin of Geometry.”The real difference between the thought of Ricoeur and Derrida is the distinctive way each thinker supplements phenomenology to take into account the creativity of meaning at the boundary of reason. For Derrida, it is thedifféranceof deconstruction; for Ricoeur, the graft of hermeneutics.<br>

Abstract: Hence, our choice of philosophies should not be limited to the two main philosophies identified by Budd but rather could take up ideas from process thinking, which is a quieter but nevertheless relevant philosophy to which LIS should attend. By valuing the processes and articulating this with better abstractions more congruent with our action, we not only further our own project; we also sustain a vital engagement with the projects of individuals. We more clearly articulate the library in the life of the user, to use the words of Wiegand [
      2].<br>

Abstract: For the notion of strategic essentialism, see Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, “Subaltern Studies: Deconstructing Historiography,” in her
            The Spivak Reader, 214–21. Serene Jones has drawn attention to the fact that the poststructuralist theoretical assumptions about the always oppressive nature of binarisms do not necessarily hold up under the pressures of concrete political struggles and that, in order to strengthen the bond of solidarity for a coalition of diverse social and cultural identities, what is called for is some kind of grand narrative that clearly defines the powers to be resisted and dismantled. I think this applies to a coalition of different religious identities as well.

Abstract: Nevertheless, empiricism does not have the last word—it perhaps never has the last word, not even in what might be called “positivist empiricism,” and certainly not in practical theology, as this discipline is characterized by the interaction between empiricism and normativeness. We both share this conviction—the fifth characteristic. Therefore human rights—no matter how contested they are, which is neither surprising nor extraordinary—offer an important perspective, as the normative criteria they embody always require critical and constructive reflection. In the last part of the article I have even presented them as regulative principles of truth and justice, as a result of which they offer a kind of worldview‐related and morality‐related infrastructure for the social institutions that determine human actions in societal and personal life—the sixth characteristic. After all, for both Browning and me the ultimate issue is—the seventh characteristic—the vitality of the Christian tradition in terms of relevance and identity in the context of a multicivilization society.<br>

Abstract: Whatever normative conclusions may be drawn in the end, theological ethicists ignore the unique situation of children and childhood at their own peril. Neglecting such marginalized groups as women and minorities weakened the voice of theological ethics in the past, both by silently playing into larger social wrongs and by failing to learn and grow from those silenced. Childhood in the United States and the world presents theological ethics today with a new and different but just as acute social challenge. Methodologically, since children cannot speak up as fully as can adults for themselves, theological ethicists should engage as deeply as possible with children’s actual social experiences, including through the sophisticated observational work of the human sciences, in order more creatively to understand and respond. Substantively, childhood demands at the very least renewed attention to the asymmetrical tensions of human moral responsibility, the senses in which others demand of those around them creative self‐transformation. This childist gesture of responsiveness and self‐critique has already begun to animate the human sciences. How much more, then, should it be welcomed and deepened further by Christian ethicists, who in one way or another trace a transformed world to the possibilities incarnated in an infant’s birth.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: In a first reading of the book, I was critical of this emphasis on moral motivations, since it seemed to be overburdened by a psychological approach. But, on a second reading, I had to refrain from my critique. Ricoeur makes the point that he has no intention to “take the place of a resolution for the perplexities raised by the very concept of a struggle, still less of a resolution of the conflicts” (218). In other words, Ricoeur is proposing a well‐needed complement to the institutional design trend that has invaded contemporary political philosophy. Contrary to many, he stands before the most perplexing issue of recognition with eyes wide open: indeed, demands of recognition may never end and take the form of an “unhappy consciousness” (218). One can try to resolve this potential inflation of claims by sorting out political and substantive issues. But a solution that takes only this path could create vast areas of frustration that canny elites have learned to fuel, or come to neglect recognition claims on the grounds that they hide a Pandora's box waiting to be opened. I suspect that this neglect mechanism is one of the reasons why so many legitimate recognition claims still languish in limbo as we speak. The course taken by Ricoeur may be difficult to square with the mainstream approach in contemporary political philosophy—political liberalism, to name it—but it nonetheless deserves careful attention.<br>

Abstract: Three general features of this method can be noted in advance. First, this method must be immanent or internal to its subject matter. Dialectical theorists reject outright the idea that the thinker can occupy some privileged Archimedean point outside the subject of investigation. … A second feature of dialectical method is its dialogical character. Theorizing is an activity taking place not simply within the mind but between minds. Thinking is dialogical because it always takes the form of an exchange or a conversation between ourselves, our contemporaries, and our predecessors. … Third, the dialogical element is related to the historical dimension of theory.

Abstract: In this article, we have argued that the application of library practice requires a suspension of truth. We support this by introducing a new theory of truth that is rooted in historicism. One of the overarching missions of library practice is to acquire, manage, preserve, and make accessible human knowledge. While there are pragmatic and sociopolitical considerations that often constrict fulfillment of this mission, the public purpose of librarianship in a free and open society nonetheless dictates that materials be made accessible regardless of what the society at the current time or the majority of people within a culturally defined place consider as true.<br>

Abstract: Theorizing for theory’s sake certainly has its place, and not every book needs to be focused on practical issues. Nonetheless, even the most gymnastic theoretician needs some grounding connection to relevant cases. Reynolds is profoundly uninterested in this level of analysis. While he flies through the theoretical air with great speed in
   The Broken Whole, it is unclear whether the book can make any sort of stable or decisive landing.<br>

Abstract: I conclude, then, that the task of theological ethics and, more broadly, the humanities and, if I can be bold, more broadly still the university itself is to examine carefully and critically and from multiple perspectives—including the religions—what it means to be and to live as responsible human beings within the vulnerabilities and complexities of forms of life. When we within our several disciplines respond to this task with all the vitality and resources at our disposal, then, I believe, knowledge will indeed grow from more to more, and life will be increased without the illusions of power or servitude to the tyranny of idols.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur,  Paul<br>
Abstract: In providing clarification of previous works,
   Reflections on the Justis exceptionally helpful. Of particular interest in this volume is the paradoxical nature of authority—What is authority? How is it legitimated? Is it claimed or granted?—the existence of vulnerability and passivity within autonomy and initiative, and the relationship between moral ideals and historical manifestation, questions that exist more on the margins ofOneself as Another. Those interested in Ricoeur’s religious thought will find little of direct interest here. Those who see a deep connection between his moral philosophy and his philosophy of religion will find some confirmation, but there are other places where the connections are more explicitly manifest.Reflections on the Justis best approached as a companion volume to earlier philosophical works, certainlyThe Justbut perhaps more importantlyOneself as Another. As such, it holds an important place in Ricoeur’s oeuvre.<br>

Abstract: These criticisms and oversights notwithstanding, there are many redeeming aspects to the book. Insofar as hermeneutics and exegesis are essential for any understanding of religious texts and traditions, Thistleton's work is a good way to be introduced to a complex history, the thorny debates, and the diverse approaches that have come to constitute its history and development. And the copious references that are made throughout and at the end of each chapter will enable readers to probe more deeply into a thinker, subject, or historical period of interest to them.<br>

Abstract: It is true, of course, that we have a much harder time postulating an author for
            Adaptation—that is, working out what an “ideal” Kaufman would have wanted the overall effect of his film to be—than postulating an author for the average Hollywood movie. Still, it is surely not the case thatAdaptation“undermines the concept of the author as a unifying origin and legitimation,” as Karen Diehl claims (Karen Diehl, “Once upon an Adaptation: Traces of the Authorial on Film,” inBooks in Motion: Adaptation, Intertextuality, Authorship, ed. Mireia Aragay [Amsterdam, 2005], p. 100). It may be harder to know what Kaufman is up to than what James Cameron (say) is up to, but Kaufman is clearly up tosomething, and the film bears if anything a more powerful stamp of an original vision than that average movie we find easier to read. In fact,Adaptationhas only solidified Kaufman's reputation as a filmmaker with an idiosyncratic and internally consistent way of seeing the world. (Although cinema is a collaborative enterprise, it is reasonable to imagine Spike Jonze and company collectively seeking to realize Kaufman's design.) Far from putting inherited notions of authorship into question, then, it has comfortably positioned Kaufman as the “unifying origin” of his various works.<br>

Abstract: In sum, this is one of the most important books on selves or the practical side of personhood in the last decade. It is also well written; the particular arguments are virtually always clear, and it is not too hard to keep track of their role within in the larger argument of the book. Some portions rise to an almost literary style and provide a rich survey of key ideas in twentieth-century French philosophy, while others engage quite originally with scholarship in moral psychology and theories of self-knowledge that will be more familiar to analytic readers. This work also complements the more detailed ethical theory on Larmore’s other books. Despite its relative inattention to volitional aspects of practical identity, and some questionable moves in the critique of authenticity, then, this work is still highly recommended.<br>

Abstract: Pablo Wright observes that while I leave behind Geertz’s concept of a cultural system with respect to morality, I retain the Geertzian concern with symbols and meaning. I would not dispute Wright’s statement that meaning is the master concept on a methodological level prior to the substantive issue of evil but would stress that in addition to idiom, code, practice, and symbol, experience must figure into a comprehensive account. Wright’s evocative references to “moral installation in the world” (one might consider terms like investment, suffusion, and tonality, as well as installation) and morality as a “practiced ontology in the micropolitics of social life” deserve further elaboration. Wright endorses a pluralized notion of moralities, but I reiterate that even more important is an adjectival sense of moral rather than the nominal morality. Like Parkin, Wright poses the question of how to reintroduce the ethnographically salient notions of cosmological and radical evil once evil is first construed as a human and intersubjective phenomenon. The answer is to ask how these dimensions come into play in the experiential immediacy of social life, for example, how a cosmological battle between angels and devils is experienced concretely on the human scale. Finally, he suggests that concepts of power from Otto and the shadow from Jung may be alternatives to the notion of evil, though I rejoin that they are just as much in need of critique with respect to Christian overtones. They may be valuable for the study of morality but are not suitable replacements for evil in the sense for which I have argued.<br>

Author(s): Fisher Cass<br>
Abstract: Despite these caveats,
   Contemplative Nationis highly recommended for scholars of Jewish studies, religious studies, philosophy, and theology. The book is an excellent example of how to apply hermeneutical theories to the study of Judaism, how to bridge the gap between continental philosophy and analytic philosophy, and how to expand the scope of Jewish studies by appreciating the nature of theological discourse. While Judaica scholars could use the book in university-level courses, and rabbis could apply its approach to synagogue life, the claim that “Israel” is a “contemplative nation” will hardly resonate with most Jews today. It is very doubtful that the book could “guide the way for [the] future” of the Jewish people’s survival (226), precisely because Jews today are overwhelmingly secular, and the culture in which Jews live, both in Israel and in the Diaspora, is anti-intellectual and antitheological. Furthermore, if Fisher is so keen on Philo, he should have also reminded his readers of the fate of Philo’s enterprise: it was no coincidence that Philo became one of the Church Fathers and that his exegetical/hermeneutical project was not adopted by the tradition that became normative Judaism. When “Israel” denotes a nation of divine contemplators, “carnal Israel” (namely “Israel” as a historical, cultural, and ethnic entity) is marginalized, denigrated, and persecuted. It is true that Jewish religious life is theological, but being Jewish cannot be reduced to contemplating God.<br>

Abstract: Critchley uses the term in a discussion of Levinas and politics. Noting that government tends to become tyrannical when left to itself, Critchley commends the way Levinas’s ethical ideas can cultivate forms of “dissensual emancipatory praxis” that “work against the consensual idyll of the state, not in order to do away with the state or consensus, but to bring about its endless betterment” (“Five Problems in Levinas’s View of Politics,” 183).<br>

Author(s): Peperzak Adriaan T.<br>
Abstract: Peperzak in this book also offers continental thinkers an appealing alternative to the theological turn of phenomenology as practiced by Jean-Luc Marion and others. While Peperzak takes seriously the idea that “God cannot be investigated or explained … because God is not given as a describable phenomenon,” this realization does not turn his phenomenology away from the investigation of rational thinking because for Peperzak reason itself has to be rethought in terms of the intersubjective encounters between nonthematizable—human and divine—sayers (121). Consequently, much more than some of the thinkers of the theological turn, Peperzak’s work maintains a broadly humanist sensibility and a conviction that theological thinking and philosophy can be integrated quite well, provided the latter does not close itself off in autarky. In his humanism, Peperzak echoes the best elements in the philosophical style both of his teacher Paul Ricoeur and the philosophical tradition of his own Catholic faith, although he implicitly critiques the former for insisting too vehemently on the autonomy of philosophy (128) and calls out the latter for separating “natural reason” from faith (182–86). For his own part, Peperzak hopes to maintain an open space between faith and reason: “I do not see any valid argument against the integration of philosophical insights into a faith-inspired theology … neither would I protest if an integrated reflection of the Christian community about its faith would call itself
   philosophia” (160). For the many who share similar sentiments today,Thinking about Thinkingwill make a valuable guide to the conversation of philosophy.<br>

Author(s): Mooij J. J. A.<br>
Abstract: Closely related to the philosophical problem of consciousness of time was the question of the meaning of time and duration in psychology and in literature. Although Mooij mentions William James's notion of “specious present” in passing, he fails to explicate James's perception of time, which attempted to provide an empiricist account of our temporal concepts through the influence of John Locke (p. 197). Apart from this caveat, the book's strength lies in its perceptiveness and breadth of interpretation of the history of the concept of time. Mooij's accuracy in comprehending and in transmitting the essence of such difficult and complicated philosophies is remarkable.<br>

They are indispensable readings for students of political philosophy in their examination of transcendence, philosophy, and politics. By seeing Voegelin as a postmodern thinker and by showing his exchange with Strauss, both of these books provide us with a broader context to understand Voegelin's political philosophy. As part of the University of Missouri Press' new series, bothFaith and PhilosophyandEric Voegelin's Dialogues with the Postmodernsprovide intellectually provocative and serious-minded secondary works on Eric Voegelin and his ultimate place in political philosophy.<br>

Abstract: Abstract: Vico's theory of metaphor is best understood as a monster in the tradition of classical rhetorical invention. It is the mutant offspring of metaphor characterized as "necessary" (an "ear" of com, for example) and metaphor characterized in terms of analogy. From the perspective of his method. Vico marries these apparently incompatible forms inherited from Aristotle and thereby identifies a third type of linguistic metaphor. I argue that the metaphor identifies a stipulatory definition taken out of context. In order to situate this claim, I outline Vico's genetic analysis and elaborate in general terms what metaphor and definition share. Most importantly. Vico insists that beings, actions, and events are linguistically identifiedin some particular diseursive context. Indeed, in many cases that context alone determines whether the expression can be called a definition or a metaphor. Like Cicero's ideal jurist, Vico's hero employs motivated words and realizes possibilities available to common sense. Henee Vico's theory of metaphor is both "constructivist"—language has the power to makes things—and "humartist"—it must do so in a form appropriate to history and culture. Vico's theory is consequently important to us because it challenges the proper/figurative distinction championed in the philosophy of language and adds a pragmatic dimension to contemporary views of metaphor at work in literary theory.<br>

Abstract: The numerous changes and improvements which have been wrought in teacher education courses in the last two decades have not, apparently, satisfied the critics. Ironically, the reverse seems to have occurred, as recent events on both sides of the Atlantic testify. This essay argues that the developments of the last two decades in educational research and teacher education, which have yielded a wealth of new ideas and procedures, have also yielded a confusing proliferation of educational ideologies. In short, it suggests that the ascendancy of a diffuse, unselfcritical, and often combative discourse within educational studies has effectively eclipsed the more important question which must first be tackled if educational studies are to have a coherent, robust focus. This question, which is pursued in the second section of the paper, asks: is the educational enterprise, properly conceived, a distinctive, autonomous or sui generis enterprise with purposes of its own which are universal, or is it essentially a subservient enterprise, a vehicle for one or other currently prevailing ideology (cultural, technological, political, religious, etc.)? In exploring this question the essay puts to work some enduring insights from contemporary European philosophy, arguing that education as a 'practical hermeneutic discipline' holds a singular promise. Some important consequences of this promise for educational studies and teacher education are then considered.<br>

Author(s): Schwaller De Lubicz William<br>
Abstract: This paper follows two purposes: the first to unpack some of the artistic cargo of symbols as distinct from the more conventional aspects of them (e. g., their ability to refer to other things or events, and their ability to communicate ideas), and the second to show, by means of contrasts, the actual workings of Interpretation Theory as it could be applied to the analysis of art-making and art-viewing. For the first purpose, the author draws material from philosophy, dramatic writings, linguistic theory, and statements of artists in an analytic search for the often intractable character of the artistic image. For the second purpose, the author demonstrates, through the use of logic and the poetic metaphor, how a particular form of hermeneutic inquiry can be applied to assist an understanding of the assumptions upon which research is often built.<br>

With the help of Utpaladeva's distinction between "seeing" and "noticing," a further interpretation is attempted.

Abstract: The title of this essay comes from contemporary hermeneutics, a branch of philosophy devoted to interpretation. It refers to the domain between a human artifact and a beholder. Brought to architecture, this worldly concept implicitly questions the conventional role of the individual amidst historical works. It also offers a common ground on which products of architectural interpretation (performances or fictions) may begin to engage our normally independent territories of history and design. This essay examines the concept of the world in front of the work and speculates on its implications for architectural education. The illustrations portray interpretive projects by the author's students.<br>

Abstract: Anyone who wishes to understand the debate between Hegel and Schleiermacher is forced to confront not only the staggering complexity of their thought but also the disparate nature of the key texts which are available and the fact that many philosophers and theologians approach Hegel and Schleiermacher with misleading preconceptions. This article attempts to illuminate the conflict between the two thinkers by exploring the biographical and historical context in which it arose. The author argues that, while neither thinker depended upon the other in forming his own position, each man kept the other's position constantly in view as a foil for his own. After a consideration of some early indications of conflict, the debate between Hegel and Schleiermacher is traced through a series of events which begins with Hegel's call to Berlin. While Schleiermacher was apparently quite willing to have Hegel come to Berlin, differences in political philosophy soon led to conflict, with the student movement providing a concrete focus for their disagreement. Schleiermacher's role in excluding Hegel from the Berlin Academy of Sciences is shown to have heightened the tensions. The article concludes with an exploration of Hegel's critique of Schleiermacher's dogmatics. It is argued that the intellectual core of the conflict between the two men centers upon the problem of immediate knowledge.<br>

Abstract: In recent years personal construct theory has become increasingly used to underpin research into teachers' thinking, and a number of researchers have opted to give methodological prominence to the repertory grid. This paper points to the limitations of the theory in respect of research outside the domain of psychotherapy and to some of the problems associated with repertory grid studies. It is argued that repertory grids are inherently positivistic and are thus in philosophical tension with the theory on which they are based, a tension that is not removed by researching in a 'conversation paradigm'. The importance of events in personal construct theory is discussed, and it is suggested that an emphasis on events requires the researcher to adopt an approach that is informed by phenomenology and the philosophy of history. Finally, a return is made to the level of research practice,i and a methodological approach is outlined which is-to a greater extent than the repertory grid-consistent with the main thrust of personal construct theory. Stress is given to the importance of the quality of the relationships between constructs, since these have implications for connections between construing and action-an issue which is of crucial importance is the study of teachers' thinking.<br>

Abstract: Against the background of disputes about modernity and post-modernity in philosophy, this paper probes the differences among Gadamer, Habermas, and Rorty. Focusing on the themes of praxis, phronesis, and practical discourse, it is argued that what initially appear to be hard and fast cleavages and irreconcilable differences turn out to be differences of emphasis. The common ground that emerges is adumbrated as "non-foundational pragmatic humanism". Although there are important differences among these three thinkers each of their voices contributes to a coherent conversation in developing "moral-political vision".<br>

Abstract: Taylor, it has to be noted, would presumably quarrel
with this "either/or" formulation, either interpret the
classics or interpret the world. His Hegel book obvi-
ously falls within the genre of commentary on the tradi-
tion. Furthermore, in the preface to its condensation as
Hegel and Modern Society, he emphasizes the relevance
of Hegel's political philosophy to our time (1979, pp. xi-

Abstract: Paul Helm's discussion of my book is a clear illustration of some of my central claims about Anglo-American philosophy of religion: he instantiates its undue preoccupation with beliefs, and its erasure of gender. In my reply I show how Helm conflates my objection to such preoccupation with the absurd claim that beliefs are unnecessary, and how he conflates philosophy of religion -- even rationality itself -- with its Anglo-American variants. He refuses to engage with the masculinism implicit both in his selectivity and in the boundaries he seeks to maintain around the discipline; boundaries which, I argue, need to be opened up for philosophy of religion to flourish.<br>

Abstract: This essay takes up the claim made recently by Simon Critchley in The Companion to Continental Philosophy that a "feature common to many philosophers in the Continental tradition" is the "utopian demand that things be otherwise." The general question I pursue has to do with whether or not such a claim includes movements within Continental philosophy that do not self-identify with the utopian (like critical theory). The particular question has to do with whether or not the movement of phenomenology is utopian or does it, because of its other commitments, view the utopian as the antithesis to its orientation, which makes that claim that phenomenology is utopian seem strange. My thesis is that phenomenology can be seen as a utopian tradition but that some account must be given that demonstrates this connection to the utopian. In particular, I argue that Maurice Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology provides an understanding of the utopian, which I call a non-conventional view, that is vastly different from the one assumed by most when they see or hear the word "utopian," which I lable conventional. I show that such a non-conventional understanding can be developed in a way that neither requires us to view the utopian solely as opposed to finitude and contingency, nor a form of thought and action from which we necessarily need to dissociate ourselves. It is this non-conventional view of the utopian that in the end enables us to understand how Continental philosophy in general and phenomenology in particular are important bearers of the utopian demand that things be otherwise.<br>

Abstract: Academia's mathematical metaphysics are briefly explored en route to an elaboration of the qualitatively rigorous requirements underpinning the calibration and unambiguous interpretation of quantitative instrumentation in any science. Of particular interest are Gadamer's emphases on number as the paradigm of the noetic, on the role of play in interpretation, and on Hegel's sense of method as the activity of the thing itself that thought experiences. These point toward and overlap with (1) Latour's study of the metrological social networks through which technological phenomena are brought into language as modes of being that can be understood, and (2) the way that Rasch's models for measurement comprise a potential beginning for metaphysically astute, qualitatively and quantitatively integrated, mathematical methods in the social sciences. The paper closes with observations on the general problem that is philosophy, the need to remain open to multiplicities of meaning even as clear understandings are sought and obtained.<br>

Abstract: Aleksej Losev's definition of myth centres on the concept of detachment. In modern times detachment has most often figured in the context of philosophical aesthetics, where it is a cognitive category akin to Kant's "disinterestedness" or the Russian formalists' "estrangement." However Losev's usage also makes reference to the ontological sense of detachment as contemplative ascent (cf. Meister Eckhardt's "Abgeschiedenheit"). Thus, Losev's concept of myth combines both senses of detachment, binding perceptual attitude and being together in a double movement of resignation from the world and union with meaning; this movement literally makes sense out of reality. It therefore bears comparison to the treatment of distanciation in contemporary hermeneutics, where detachment is a key condition of understanding. By investigating Losev's connections to other Russian thinkers, the author makes a case for a distinct Russian tradition of hermeneutic philosophy (V. Ivanov, G. Shpet, A. Bakshy, A. Losev).<br>

Abstract: In his philosophy of nothingness, Kitarō Nishida illuminates the matrix of transformation of the world "from the Created to the Creating" (tsukuru mono kara tsukurareta mono e) through shintai, or the body. In this matrix, shintai enters into the stage of an action-sensation continuum and emerges as the immaculate iconic tool of nothingness to create new figures as extended self. This idea of shintai has resonance with the development of postwar art in Japan. The "Space of Transparency" put forth by Ufan Lee, the leader of Monoha, is the principal example. This essay investigates Nishida's notion of shintai and its influence on Lee's theory of art.<br>

Abstract: Two philosophical traditions with much in common, (classical) pragmatism and (Heidegger's) hermeneutic philosophy, are here compared with respect to their approach to the philosophy of science. Both emphasize action as a mode of interpreting experience. Both have developed important categories -- inquiry, meaning, theory, praxis, coping, historicity, life-world -- and each has offered an alternative to the more traditional philosophies of science stemming from Descartes, Hume, and Comte. Pragmatism's "abduction" works with the dual perspectives of theory (as explanation) and praxis (as culture). The hermeneutical circle depends in addition on the lifeworld as background source of ontological meaning and resource for strategies of inquiry. Thus a hermeneutical philosophy of research involves three components: lifeworld (as ontological and strategic), theory (as explanatory), and praxis (as constitutive of culture).<br>

Abstract: This reflection on Errington's thought-provoking paper, by an intellectual historian and a student of Chinese philosophy, does not dispute her interpretive position on classical Malay literature in general and on hikayat in particular. Rather, it attempts to challenge three salient points of her argument: that the distinction between "oral" and "written" is a hazy one in the paratactic style of the hikayat; that the "images" in this type of literature are flat, repetitive and without content; and that the Malay art of story-telling is diametrically opposed to the rhetorical style of history characteristic of the post-Renaissance West. It is hoped that such a discussion will bring about fruitful encounters between scholars in different fields and disciplines in Asian studies.<br>

Abstract: Dopo un periodo, negli anni Sessanta e Settanta, in cui la fortuna di Lovejoy sembrò
declinare, lo studioso è tornato d'attualità negli anni Ottanta, con la ripresa della di-
scussione teorica intorno alia storia intellettuale. Nel 1987 il «Journal of the History of
Ideas» dedicò un numero per celebrare il mezzo secolo della Great Chain of Being, con
articoli di D.J. Wilson, G. Gordon-Bournique, E.P. Mahoney, F. Oakley e Melvin Ri-
chter (cfr. Lovejoy, «The Great Chain of Being» and the History of Ideas, in «Journal of
the History of Ideas», 48, 2, 1987). Contributi importanti sono inoltre venuti da Donald
R. Kelley, Tattuale editor del «Journal». Tra questi citiamo D.R. Kelley, Horizons of In-
tellectual History: Retrospect, Circumspect, Prospect, in «Journal of the History of Ideas»,
48, 1, 1987, pp. 143-169; e, sempre di Kelley, What is happening to the History of Ideas?,
in «Journal of the History of Ideas», 51, 1990, pp. 3-25. Proprio quest'ultimo articolo
rappresenta a tutt'oggi uno dei piú equilibrad tentativi di bilancio della history of ideas,
e al tempo stesso una meditazione sui futuro della disciplina da parte di uno degli «ere-
di» di Lovejoy. Significativamente Kelley propone di utilizzare Tespressione intellectual
history, e non piú history of ideas, proprio a voler allontanare i «fantasmi» di idealismo
impliciti nella scelta di fare della storia della filosofia il referente privilegiato della di-
sciplina (un'attitudine che era certamente di Lovejoy). Intellectual history è secondo Kel-
ley «doing a kind, or several kinds, of historical interpretation, in which philosophy and
literature figure not as controlling methods but as human creations suggesting the con-
ditions of historical understanding» [What is happening, cit., p. 18). L'approccio inter-
disciplinare, che era stato uno dei punti centrali del programma lovejoyano, rimane an-
cor oggi secondo Kelley valido, anche se ciò non deve significare Tadozione di strumenti
critici «alla moda» propri di altre discipline. A questo proposito si pone per Kelley il
problema dell'atteggiamento da tenere nei confronti di studiosi come Hayden White,
Dominick LaCapra, David Harlan, teorici del linguistic turn, un modo di fare storia che
si awale delle indicazioni provenienti dall'ermeneutica di Gadamer e Ricoeur, da Hei-
degger e dai suoi discepoli francesi Foucault e Derrida, e che rifiuta ogni reale possibi-
lità di giungere a una determinazione delle intenzioni dell'autore, cioè di un «significa-
to», della verità di un'opera, e del contesto entro cui Topera è stata composta. Per Kel-
ley non era possibile evitare le implicazioni che il linguistic turn poneva, tanto piú che
esso si rivelava utile soprattutto nel rivelare risorse, strutture, memorie culturali conser-
vate nel linguaggio (topoi, tropi, metafore, analogie), non soltanto dell'alta cultura ma
anche delle forme di espressione irriflessa, o popolare (anche questo secondo un'indica-
zione di Lovejoy). Se è però vero che il significato di un testo non è univoco, è altret-
tanto vero secondo Kelley che la ricerca delle intenzioni dell'autore è premessa indi-
spensabile di qualsiasi lavoro di storia intellettuale. Quanto alia questione dell'attenzio-
ne al «contesto», che i sostenitori del linguistic turn denigrano, Kelley prende atto che
non è certamente possibile giungere alia ricostruzione dell'intera rete di relazioni entro
cui un'opera si colloca. Ciò non significa pero che il testo o l'autore studiato non pos-
sano essere collocati in un «contesto», e che quindi, attraverso lo studio del linguaggio
di un'epoca, non si riesca a ricostruire le condizioni di possibilità per la nascita di
un'opera.<br>

Author(s): Jenson Michael<br>
Abstract: A recurrent misconception about the concept of utopia fails to realize fully that its essential endeavor constitutes a speculative act involving the distribution of power and resources. Consequently, utopian desire is closely linked to structures of power and can be manipulated by interests in positions of influence within these structures. It is these connections to the machinations of power that bring utopian visions their potential for social/political influence. However, these same types of links also provide avenues for these conceptions to be cynically influenced in ways that can usurp individual autonomy. The role of power and utopia can be analyzed in the formative process of a specific social structure as well as in their contribution to the conception of a common heritage or history. The "historical perspective" often serves as the foundation for the production of propaganda seeking to capture the imagination of a populace either to instigate positive social change or to legitimize an oppressive regime. Through the lens of Collingwood's philosophy of history, this article investigates the connection that the "historical consciousness" has to the attributes of power and utopia as well as the role that this relationship plays in the formation of a collective mentality. In short, it studies the essential characteristics of the bond between individuals that allows a community or collective to perpetuate itself. It also explores how the attributes of power and utopia can use latent historical perceptions to strengthen the process of ideological integration that underlies any social action or formal structure of authority.<br>

Abstract: In this paper I try to show what kind of theory Giddens' theory of structuration is. I do so by first listing what Giddens accepts and what he rejects in his assessments of functionalism, hermeneutics, structuralism, and the writings of Marx. For what I think are good reasons, most of this part is given over to the use Giddens makes of Gadamer's hermeneutic philosophy. Next I set out my understanding of Giddens' view of theory as primarily concerned "with reworking conceptions of human being and human doing, social reproduction and social transformation" (Giddens 1984:xx). I seek to show the crucial implications of this for the way that theory enters directly into and helps to consitute social life. Taken together, these two steps lead to the conclusion that Giddens' theory is neither an attempt at an over-arching "Grand Theory," nor an imposition of new orthodoxy in place of the old. Instead I suggest that his avowed eclecticism is closely akin to the hermeneutic goal contained in Gadamer's concept of the "fusion of horizons." This notion recognizes the never-to-be-completed, but basic, human activity of creatively questioning what has been handed down from the past. It is questioned so that it may be applied — incomplete as it is — to the changed situation of the present with its different interests and problems. That those who can and do question it are themselves the products of past tradition, calls for a kind of social theory that is in some ways different from that modeled on the explanatory "laws" of natural science. I contend that Giddens' theory of structuration is such a theory. (For an introductory overview of the theory itself, see Dickie-Clark, 1984).<br>

Abstract: By studying Durkheim through a Schopenhauerian lens, the one-sidedly cognitivist and functionalist reception of his social theory can be balanced. Durkheim explicitly rejected such monistic interpretations. His dialectical approach was always aimed at an essentially dualistic perception of man and society, wherein the lower pole, the individual, is central. In Durkheim's symbol theory, this position leads to two kinds of symbols: those that are bound to the human body, here called "this and that" symbols, and those people can choose freely, here called "this for that" symbols. This twofold symbol theory can already be found in medieval philosophy (e.g. Dante Alighieri) as well as in the work of Paul Ricoeur. For Durkheim the human person is the symbol par excellence. By implication the rituals in which the person is (re)constructed, that is the rites of passage, should be central. The interpretation here opens up new perspectives for a more psychological interpretation of Durkheim's sociology.<br>

Abstract: The ultramodern condition represents the "third wave" in postmodernist-inspired philosophy and cultural practice. Two of ultramodernism's critical theoretical components are the human/social forces, flows, and assemblages that sustain transgression; and the human/social intensities, fluctuations, and thresholds that make transcendence possible as both will and way. In the ultramodern age, then, transcendence is about overcoming and transforming the conditions (i.e., forces, flows, and assemblages) that co-produce harm-generating (i.e., transgressive) tendencies. This manuscript problematizes transgression by way of ultramodern theory. This critical investigation represents "the phenomenology of the shadow," or the ultramodern philosophy of harm. To contextualize this phenomenology and philosophy, the intellectual history of ultramodern thought is recounted. This includes a review of the shadow construct by way of its prominent socio-cultural, psychoanalytic, and political-economic currents; and a chronicling of the reification process (regarding risk, captivity, and harm) since the modernist era (i.e., the industrial revolution). The article concludes with some very speculative observations concerning "the phenomenology of the stranger," or the ultramodern philosophy of transcendence as both will and way.<br>

Abstract: This essay suggests Friedrich Nietzsche has a contribution to make to the theoretical enterprise of social science. Contemporary theorizing, reflecting an increased attention to language, has been focusing on the dialogical mode of production and, of course, on hermeneutics. This has led to a renewal of interest in Friedrich Nietzsche. In this essay, two alternative models of the hermeneutic circle are examined: one arising out of the work of the school of Konstanz; the other associated primarily with the work of Juergen Habermas. The former presents a circular image of the "conversational" situation; the latter portrays a time schedule of the process based on the psychoanalytic process of therapy. Nietzsche's contributions are suggested to be significant, in the first model, in regard to the mode of production and, in the second, the stage of the quasi-naturalistic turn. Nietzsche's way to truth is through constant and relentless criticizing. In contrast to the rationalistic practices of Western philosophy, Nietzsche exercised an art of interpreting based on the use of metaphor and aphorism. This practice seems to reflect Nietzsche's concern to communicate truth in a world he saw as inherently ambiguous and dynamic, thus, rendering propositional truth impossible. Nietzsche radically challenges the rational foundations on which we stand. Thus he presents us with a mode of knowledge production that reclaims traditions lost to science. In addition, Nietzsche shows, by word and example, that his existential approach offers a way to see life as a text and source for quasi-naturalistic forays toward understanding. In this way Nietzsche shows that the traditional concept of knowledge is a pseudo-concept by revealing the intimate and inseparable connection between life and knowledge. Knowledge is rooted in life; it is a manifestation of concrete psychological and political realities. Consequently, it makes sense not to ignore life as a source for explanation when examining resources for re-establishing communication when the hermeneutic circle breaks down in a moment of misunderstanding.<br>

Abstract: This paper presents an historical outlook on the macro-micro distinction in modern sociology. It links the genesis of social interactionism and microsociology to the rise of Romantic philosophy and attempts to elaborate methodological principles dividing macro- and microscopic perspectives in sociology. Six ideal-typical distinctions are considered: natural vs. social universality, emergent properties vs. emergent processes, morphological structuralism vs. genetical interactionism, choice among socially structured alternatives vs. structuring appearance into reality, structural vs. emergent directionality, operational vs. hermeneutical analysis. The complementarity of the languages of macro- and microsociological theories is advocated as a foundation for the further elaboration of conceptual links between the two levels of analysis.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur has initiated a new direction in the field of hermeneutics by applying the phenomenological method to the interpretation of texts. By this he has effected a transition from description to hermeneutic phenomenology. In order to explicate his position the paper deals with this transformation: In developing hermeneutics Ricoeur tends to eliminate Husserl's transcendental idealism, to retain some central phenomenological motifs, and to add new elements. These elements were eclectically picked up by him from analytic and linguistic philosophy and from the current linguistic and structural theories. Since the deepest and most genuine roots of Ricoeur's thought lie in the phenomenology of Husserl, the paper concentrates on the explication of his phenomenological presuppositions and attempts to show how they were reformulated within the new science of interpretation. Thus, the first part of the paper is mainly an exposition of the transition from phenomenology to hermeneutics. The second part points to some difficulties inherent in such a move. The paper ends with a discussion of the problem of "the hermeneutic circle", which is an immanent part of hermeneutics.<br>

Abstract: To claim that Hayden White has yet to be read seriously as a philosopher of history might seem false on the face of it. But do tropes and the rest provide any epistemic rationale for differing representations of historical events found in histories? As an explanation of White's influence on philosophy of history, such a proffered emphasis only generates a puzzle with regard to taking White seriously, and not an answer to the question of why his efforts should be worthy of any philosophical attention at all. For what makes his emphasis on narrative structure and its associated tropes of philosophical relevance? What, it may well be asked, did (or could) any theory that draws its categories from a stock provided by literary criticism contribute to explicating problems with regard to the warranting of claims about knowledge, explanation, or causation that represent those concerns that philosophy typically brings to this field? Robert Doran's anthologizing of previously uncollected pieces, ranging as they do over a literal half-century of White's published work, offers an opportunity to identify explicitly those philosophical themes and arguments that regularly and prominently feature there. Moreover, White's essays in this volume demonstrate a credible knowledge of and interest in mainstream analytic philosophers of his era and also reveal White as deeply influenced by or well acquainted with other important philosophers of history. White thus invites a reading of his work as philosophy, and this volume presents the opportunity for accepting it as such.<br>

Abstract: Nietzsche's impact on educational thought has always been surprisingly neglected, possibly because it is hard to divorce his educational views from his philosophical endeavour, as a whole which has given rise to considerable scholarly polemics during the last few decades. Recently several articles propagating various interpretations of Nietzsche's educational teaching have been published Their main weakness lies in the fact that Nietzsche's central educational theses are discussed quite apart from his "psychological" philosophy, while it is the philosophy that serves as the necessary background for understanding those theses. The present paper, mainly analyzing nietzsche's essay "Schopenhauer as Educator", will attempt to provide a better insight into Nietzsche's early psychological and pedagogic thought. It will also demonsrate those basic criteria implicit in his method of psychologization, which at the very outset had served Nietzsche as an educational means of testing the integrity of certain examplary personalities. Nietzsche's Educational Thought is established in the service of authenticity — a central and influential Existentialist concept, the main ideas of which are explicated in the paper. Another Nietzschean concept, much negleted yet significant, that of the "Higher-Self", is elaborated and compared to Freud's parallel notion of the "Super-Ego".<br>

Abstract: This article summarizes the claims of Owen Flanagan that psychology can make important criticisms of and viable contributions to both religious and philosophical ethics. Flanagan insists that both fields of ethics should pass the test of what he calls the Principle of Minimal Psychological Realism (PMPR). However, in order for Flanagan to escape naïve naturalism, his PMPR test should be used within a hermeneutic philosophy such as that of Paul Ricoeur. Ricoeur's concepts of "diagnosis" and "distanciation" can help the moral theologian find a limited but important role for PMPR.<br>

Abstract: The main end of this article is to offer a critical analysis of autonomy conceived as a basic idea in modern educational philosophy. After the tragic experience and dramatic consequences of totalitarianism, is not possible to defend a kantian concept of autonomy as a unique source of moral responsibility and ethical action. After holocaust, we need to defend, on the contrary, the principle of previous value of heteronomy, conceived as the practice of otherness, in its levinasian perspective. So, the authors explore the thesis of the prior value of heteronomy on autonomy, as a source and foundation of moral responsibility in educational relationship, and to reflect the general educational implications of the jewish philosophical tradition of otherness in philosophical educational discourse.<br>

Abstract: In order to manage our daily lives, we make many decisions based on empirical evidence derived from instrumental action. At the other extreme, we are often attracted by a so-called postmodern solution that invites us to make arbitrary choices. In the education system, the pressing dilemma should not be a choice between standards of competence or unthinking relativism, but how to take action towards intercultural tolerance. Establishing a small teacher training course for a group of British Muslims has shown that communicative action informed by understanding can be disabled by the instrumentality of positivist frameworks, such as those used by government inspectors. In philosophy, Ricoeur offers a provisional dialectic of hope that can be used to show why neither positivist methods, rational analytic philosophy, postmodernity nor any one belief system for interpreting the world should be allowed to exert hegemonic control. The ethicopractical philosophy of Ricoeur also offers a reconstructive view of reality that helps us to rehabilitate belief in human nature and encourages us to seek solutions to conflicts of interpretation in understanding others. It is applied, in this instance, to project work with Muslim women in the UK, in which an ontology of action shows the power of working collaboratively towards an understanding of oneself as another.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur's book Oneself as Another, represents a major achievement in the development of a philosophy of selfhood. By dialectically linking the self to otherness, others, and the Other, Ricoeur makes a substantial move beyond Modern philosophical theories of identity and selfhood. However, contrary to Ricoeur's own intentions, his unique formulation of selfhood defined in terms of the power-to-do, or conatus, ultimately inscribes the other within the circle of the self-same, and thereby fails to let the other be other.<br>

Abstract: The article of M. Lilla marks the political position of Derrida in the context of French philosophy since Sartre. Presenting him as an engaged opponent of existentialism and structuralism Lilla shows that Derrida's vehement philosophical fight is directed fundamentally against what he calls the logocentrism of all western philosophy. Derrida's only remedy against this disease: deconstruction of the language. In applying this recipe himself, Derrida ends at a somewhat mysterious one and only notion, the concept of justice, which according to him is not destructible and should not be destructed. The provocative explanation Lilla gives for the surprising fact, that Derrida's most fervent adherents live in the United States is the unlimited self-confidence and good nature of the Americans.<br>

Abstract: Rav H̱isday Crescas (1340-1410/11), Rabbi of Aragonese Jewry in Christian Spain and a major figure in medieval Jewish philosophy, is unique in positing an all-embracing thesis of Love. This thesis permeates his theories of cosmogony, metaphysics and theology and generates far-reaching didactic implications. This article examines Crescas' rather bold description of Love as a positive Divine attribute, an anthropopathism meant to convey ontological meaning about the Divine Nature via an analogous construct. Themes such as Infinite Goodness, Joy and Kindness enable Rav H̱isday to structure a new conception of the Creator and Providence. After postulating Divine Love as the Cosmic Force sustaining creation, Crescas explains the purpose of Torah and mitzvot in terms of evoking love for God thus drawing the soul to link up to the Divine Overflow of Love. Even spiritual existence after death is explicated in terms of the soul's love for its Divine Source. To understand Crescas' unique theory of Love, we compare it with the views of his predecessors and analyze his use of philosophic sources such as the 5th century BCE pre-Socratic scientist-mystic Empedocles. We examine educational aspects of Crescas' teachings on love and view them in context of the mass conversions to Christianity resulting from the 1391 riots. Finally, Crescas' ideas are read as pedagogical messages relevant to both Jews and conversos in the twenty traumatic years after 1391 when he served as chief rabbi and political leader in Saragossa.<br>

Journal Title: Discourse Studies<br>
Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24049943<br>
Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Bell Allan<br>
Abstract: This article questions the aptness of 'discourse analysis' as a label for our field, and prefers the less reductionist concept of 'Discourse Interpretation'. It does this through drawing on ideas from the field of philosophical hermeneutics – the theory and practice of interpreting texts. It operationalizes and adapts the construct of the Interpretive Arc from the philosophy of Paul Ricoeur in order to address issues that are central to discourse work, including that of how we warrant the validity of our textual interpretations. The Interpretive Arc consists of six interlinked phases, which the article presents and exemplifies through discussion of a single text – the story of Babel. Phase I of the arc defines readers as being in a state of Estrangement before the text because of the distancing created by its written or technological form. Phase 2 is that of Pre-view, the state of opinion or knowledge that readers bring to a text. At phase 3, a first reading forms readers' Proto-understanding, their initial 'guess' at what the text means. Then processes of Analysis (phase 4) test and evidence the validity of alternative readings, limiting the interpretations which can plausibly be taken from a text. Three byways of interpretive analysis are challenged and discarded: the dominance of author intention, structuralist analysis and limitless polysemy. Analysis then leads into 5, the phase of informed Understanding of the matter or injunction of the text, of what is disclosed or unfolded before the text. The Interpretive Arc is completed in phase 6, Ownership. Here, through processes of critique of their own and the text's ideologies and of fresh listening, readers are led to a new self formed by the matter of the text. There is a dialectic amongst Analysis, Understanding and Ownership, with each informing and modifying the other. The approach emphasizes interpretation as the heart of discourse work. The 3000-year-old narrative of Babel is a subject as well as an object here. It contributes to the matter of the article and its interpretation is interwoven with the theoretical substance. The story is shown to be an integrated narrative abounding in sophisticated linguistic techniques which show a delight in language. The traditional Christian and Western interpretation of Babel – as an affront to God which results in the curse of multilingualism – is challenged. A re-constructed interpretation informed by intertextual evidence reads the fault of Babel to be the people's refusal to spread through the earth. Babel can be interpreted as a manifesto against the monolingual and monocultural impetus of empires ancient and contemporary. The multilingual outcome is a positive affirmation of sociocultural and linguistic diversity.<br>

Abstract: I offer some comments from the perspective of someone familiar with the work of Paul Ricoeur on Allan Bell's proposal that discourse studies take a hermeneutic turn drawing on Ricoeur's idea of an arc of interpretation. I suggest that such a hermeneutic turn would need to be more radical than Bell proposes in that he limits it largely to questions of method, without really addressing how it might affect our understanding of either the object of discourse studies or the goal of such studies. This does raise the question, however, whether discourse studies should be considered a subdiscipline of hermeneutical philosophy.<br>

Abstract: In this article, Levinas' ethical metaphysics is analyzed and his contribution to present-day philosophy is described. In his philosophy, ethics is not something that originates in the autonomous will, as Kant would have premised. It is, rather, the result of the traumatic rupturing of the I by the Other, a heteronomous event. The I's passivity in being opened by the Other is highlighted by Levinas in the words "substitution," "obsession," and "being elected." The I, in the critical Others' eyes, is guilty. The infinity in the Other's demand, regarding the I, is divine. It would be a fatal misunderstanding of Levinas to think that, with the insertion of the word "God," he becomes a theologian. In this article the relation between ethics and politics is discussed and their relation to God is pointed to. In this way, Levinas' discourse on God is demonstrated as being fitting for our time, after the crisis of humanism during the Holocaust. In the course of the article, the question of whether there "is" a God in the eyes of Levinas, and if man "needs" Him is answered. In other words, the logical status of the word "God" in Levinas' philosophy is defined.<br>

Abstract: The article deals with the problem of revelation in Levinas' writings. The first part of the article analizes Levinas' ideas on the Same and the Other, more particularly the topics of the face and of discourse, as these come to the fore in the first section of Totality and Infinity. Investigating the non-totalising relationship between the Same and the Other presents us with the suitable framework for understanding the relation between the finite and the Infinite. Leaving out any ontotheological speech, Levinas shows how Metaphysics is enacted in the ethical relation. The second part cootinues with a description of Levinas' position on revelation in the Jewish tradition. The active Interpretation of Biblical texts "beyond the verse" represents an opportunity of hearing the divine word today and to enter into a more primordial Order than the Order of the Same. In the course of the article, we point to affinities and striking similarities between E. Levinas' and F. Rosenzweig's view on revelation. We also demonstrate how Levinas Orients his Jewish writings to his philosophy of the Other and vice versa. In writing on revelation, Levinas' main concern seems to be the description of the possibility of a fracture in the immanent order of totality and in the self-sufficiency of reason which is its correlative. This fraction is produced by the command "thou shalt not kill", calling the Same to open itself to the Other.<br>

Abstract: Genocide is a political catastrophe. Yet it has not received much academic attention. A few social scientists have studied it. Philosophers have largely ignored it. There is a large literature on the Holocaust, but there is little agreement as to how this should be related to other genocides. Some have argued that the Holocaust represented a crisis of Western culture, but that Western culture has not responded adequately for the lack of the appropriate self-understanding. This crisis has been attributed to the predominance of scientistic models of rationality in our culture. Social-scientific approaches to genocide have been criticised because of their commitment to logical empiricism, which is held to be epistemologically and ethically inadequate. Ethical approaches based on liberal humanism have been criticised by post-Nietzschean philosophers for their attachment to allegedly outworn metaphysical assumptions. However, the deconstruction of social science and liberal ethics leads in the direction of relativism and nihilism, which are either useless or dangerous in the face of evils such as genocide. The arguments against conventional social science and ethics are examined, and a counter-critique made of post-modern philosophy in order to clear the ground for constructive thinking about genocide.<br>

Abstract: Attached for a long time to the illusion of its national "singularity", French philosophy has remained, for a good part of this century, closed to any foreign influence (with the exception of German phenomenology and existentialism). This situation started to change, however, in the early 1980's. From that moment on, the tendency to translate foreign philosophy has strongly increased among French publishers, allowing France to take a more active part in the international philosophical conversation. The French-American dialogue, in particular, is currently experiencing an expanding phase – but this recent trend must continue to be encouraged from both sides of the Atlantic.<br>

Abstract: Is it possible to connect with the God-who-may-be without paying attention to the tapping on the wall from the other side? Kearney remains within the orbit and the idiom of so-called postmodern philosophy while he expresses phenomenologically the relationship with God as ultimate other. If we are to remain within the confines of postmodern philosophy to articulate such presence, access to what Rilke calls "heart-work" as opposed to "work of sight" might best be glimpsed through excavation of "decisiveness" in the musings of the later Heidegger.<br>

Abstract: Paul Klee's art found broad impact upon philosophers of varying commitments, including Hans-Georg Gadamer. Moreover, Klee himself was not only one of the most important artists of aesthetic modernism but one of its leading theoreticians, and much in his work, as in Gadamer's, originated in post-Kantian literary theory's explications of symbol and allegory. Indeed at one point in Truth and Method, Gadamer associates his project for a general "theory of hermeneutic experience" not only with Goethe's metaphysical account of the symbolic but equally with a "rehabilitation" of allegory. In this paper, I examine this position and Gadamer's own use of it in his analysis of Klee's work, contrasting it with that of Walter Benjamin's account of allegory, equally indebted to Goethe and this archive. Finally, I contrast the resulting interpretations of Klee, discussing the implications that evolve for understanding both Gadamer and Benjamin—but equally for understanding Klee's work and, provisionally, the work of art, thus construed, for philosophy.<br>

Abstract: Environmentally we seem to be both the victims and the perpetrators of a type of bait and switch: lured into the discussion by one set of intuitions, our interests become redescribed in terms that are intellectually more respectable. Our deepest concerns with the environment are converted into foreign discourses, as we strain to make the languages of science, economics, and interest group politics express our intuitions. The circumscription of environmental philosophy within environmental ethics is one manifestation of this process of bait and switch. 'Corrosive Effects' critiques this process through a case study of acid mine drainage-water pollution resulting from mining activities. An analysis of acid mine drainage reveals the metaphysical and theological roots of many of our environmental problems.<br>

Abstract: The article comprises three parts. Part I contains an overview of the areas in the analysis of modern French philosophy that have been of the greatest relevance to Russian researchers over the last years. We conclude that numerous aspects of the French philosophical thought of the twentieth century are well represented in the research of Russian authors, who also point out the emerging trends in its development. Part II deals with the development of analytic philosophy in Russia within the framework of such areas as "critique of bourgeois philosophy", a purely ideological stand only nominally related to philosophy, logic, and the history of philosophy and theoretical research. Part III contains a periodization of the history of phenomenology in Russia, pointing out the most important achievements of the contemporary Russian scholars of phenomenology as well as their understanding of the essence, the problems, and the aims of phenomenological philosophy. We also indicate the tendencies within the development of the discipline in the Russian Federation.<br>

Abstract: Ernst Troeltsch distinguished between naive, apologetic and evolutionistic absoluteness.
From the original spontaneity of 'naive absoluteness' and its artificial (partly super-
naturalistic, partly rationalistic) defence as 'apologetic absoluteness' (in the Middle Ages and
in the Enlightenment, respectively) there came forth in Hegel the idea of 'evolutionistic
absoluteness' — an ingenious but untenable attempt to reconcile the solid apologetic
conception of absoluteness of that day with the dynamics of history by presenting it as the
outcome and terminus of historical progression. See Troeltsch, Die Absolutheit des Christen-
tums, 87ff. Cf. J. Klapwijk, Tussen historisme en relativisme, 222-29. At present the belief in

Abstract: Interestingly enough it appears that the structural features of reconciliation show a re-
versed version of the structural features of evil. Resolving the evil I do toward the other re-
quires that I am able to say what I have done wrong (the reverse of silence and the
tinspeakable), that I recognize my guilt (which is incompatible with splitting) and that I ask for
forgiveness (which is very shameful, but may résolve shame when penitence is accepted and
forgiveness is given); see Glas (in press); Muφhyand Hampton (1988); Volf (1996).<br>

Abstract: Desmond is certainly not blind to the risks of such an endeavor: God and the Betioeen
mentions on the one hand a loss of faith in case of the forlorn mystic who in his 'ardor for the
divine other' is confronted with his own 'lack and nothing' (GB 266), and on the other a
possible usurpation of divine sovereignty (GB 268).<br>

Abstract: Because they escape precise modal qualification, Troost suggests that insight into disposi-
tions can only be gained in an idea-ruled (idee-matig) understanding, in an idea-regulated 'on
the way' in the transcendental direction of time. For reformational philosophy this raises an
old and prima facie purely theoretical problem: Do the modalities 'continue' right into the
heart? One could paraphrase Troost's view for example such that for him the heart should
primarily be sought 'below' or 'behind' the act structure, and that the dispositions — relative
to this vertical axis — constitute a horizontal layer in which the lower substructures are
interwoven with the act structure. In that case the integration of the lower structures in the act
structure would take place via the dispositions rather than through a direct relationship with
the heart. This notion — for which hints can be found in Dooyeweerd — would in any case
lead to an appreciably more nuanced picture of the 'binding' and 'releasing' of substructures.
If I understand Troost correctly, he would allow this interpretation for the substructures,
though not for the modalities. His caution concerning the 'continuing' of the modalities 'into
the' heart is epistemological: the cosmological concentration of the modal functions in the
heart is a transcendental idea; at best we see dots (the idea-regulated 'on the way' in the
transcendental direction of time), but we should not turn them into lines.<br>

Abstract: Broad definitions are often used in Christian apologetics. One example: 'Everyone has a
worldview. Whether or not we realize it, we all have certain presuppositions and biases that
affect the way we view all of life and reality. A worldview is like a set of lenses which taint our
vision or alter the way we perceive the world around us.' (http://christianworldview.net/,

Abstract: By inquiring into the translatability of Judaism and philosophy, we reawaken an ancient problem that asks after philosophy’s relation with religion:
         What has Athens to do with Jerusalem?Translation is a rejuvenated means of wrestling with this irksome question, which seeks to understand how multiple approaches to meaning and being can exist concurrently or whether any interaction forfeits multiplicity for the primacy of one form over all others. The specific issue that linguistic versions of the problem address is whether or not the languages that Judaism and philosophy speak are separate and distinct and if those distinctions are established on deeper, non-linguistic ground. For this reason, translation not only raises the problem of articulacy and context in interlingual translations, it also alludes to an ontological or metaphysical separation that speaks of different, non-shared worlds. Whether or not a translation theory addresses, repairs or upholds the opposition between religion and philosophy is in question, and translation becomes a vehicle for discussing what Jerusalem has to offer Athens and what Athens has for Jerusalem. In this essay, I examine the translation problem as an attempt to repair or re-gloss the relation between Judaism and philosophy by way of Michael Fagenblat’s recovery of Emmanuel Levinas’ thought in his work,A Covenant of Creatures: Levinas’s Philosophy of Judaism(2010).<br>

Abstract: The philosophy of Paul Ricoeur is offered as an argument for civic education to overcome intense preoccupation with economic activity, because of the need to properly relate politics to economics via ethics. Persons too concerned with economics will ignore their obligations to engage with one another politically. They become disabled from viewing one another as resources for both political and even for economic activity. Furthermore, they tend to regard one another's varying viewpoints as challenges to vibrant economic activity, so that diversity of viewpoints or diversity of experience is regarded as divisive, not as rich variations that come from commonalties and can contribute to a cohesive community. The problem is morphological: suspicions about diversity make conflict resolution difficult and they also make civic education difficult because suspicions about diversities endanger the equitable allocation of resources needed for widespread civic engagement.<br>

Abstract: This paper is the second part of a general study on the relationship between Nishida and Chinese philosophy. In the first, I explored the extent to which Nishida's philosophy was influenced, directly and indirectly, explicitly and implicitly, historically and conceptually, by materials coming from the intellectual horizon of Chinese thought. I concentrate here on Nishida's own position toward what he understood by "Chinese philosophy." Is this philosophy, so suggestive for Nishida, promoted to a central place in his work or not, and if so, in what sense might we take this idea of "centrality" as specifically Chinese? In setting forth several archetypes of Chinese thought present in Nishida's philosophy, the focus of this article falls on the methodological, logical and metaphysical contrasts we can identify between the Japanese philosopher and Chinese philosophy as his underground intellectual sources. 本稿は、筆者による西田幾多郎と中国哲学との関係を考察した研究論文の続編にあたる。前編の “Nishida Kitarō and Chinese Philosophy”は、西田哲学がどれだけの直接的もしくは間接的、明示的もしくは暗示的、歴史的もしくは概念的な影響を中国思想の知的土壊を基盤とする史料や人物から受けたかを考究したものである。続編である本稿では、西田が理解するところの中国哲学に対する西田自身の姿勢に焦点を絞る。この中国哲学なるものが西田の著作のなかで中心的な位置を占めているのかどうか、そうであるとするならば、この「中心」なる慨念を我々はどう理解すれば良いのか。本稿では、西田哲学に現れる中国思想の複数の原型を提示するとともに、西田という日本の哲学者と彼の知的背景としての中国哲学との間に認識できる、方法論的、論理的、形而上学的な対照に光を当てるものである。<br>

Abstract: Recent debates in International Relations have seen some of the characteristic dichotomies of the discipline under severe and sophisticated challenge. The proposition, for example, that the study of International Relations, is somehow "independent" of mainstream debates on theory and practice in the social sciences is now widely rejected. The disciplines change in attitude on this issue owes much, in the 1980s, to the influences of an as yet small group of scholars who have infused the "third debate" in International Relations with an appreciation for previously "alien" approaches to knowledge and society, drawn from interdisciplinary sources, which repudiate (meta) theoretical dualism in all its forms. Utilizing the sponge term "postpositivism" Yosef Lapid has concentrated on an important aspect of the "third debate," one which has seen positivist based perspectives repudiated in favor of critical perspectives derived, primarily, from debates on the philosophy of science. This paper takes a broader view of the "third debate" in focusing on some of the broader patterns of dissent in social theory that are now evident in its literature. It argues that for all the differences associated with the new critical social theory approaches, theirs is critique with common purpose. Its purpose: to help us understand more about contemporary global life by opening up for questioning dimensions of inquiry which have been previously closed off and supressed; by listening closely to voices previously unheard; by examining "realities" excluded from consideration under a traditional (realist) regime of unity and singularity. Its purpose, reiterated: the search for "thinking space" within an International Relations discipline produced by and articulated through Western modernist discourse.<br>

Abstract: Heidegger's characterization of Dasein as Being-in-the-world suggests a natural relation to environmental philosophy. Among environmentalists, however, closer inspection must raise alarm, both since Heidegger's approach is in some senses inescapably anthropocentric and since Dasein discovers its environment through its usability, serviceability, and accessibility. Yet Heidegger does not simply adopt a traditionally modern, instrumental view. The conditions under which the environment appears imply neither that the environment consists only of tools, nor that what is true of the parts is also true of the whole, nor that an orientation to use—where appropriate—precludes any other orientation. Heidegger's anthropocentric commitments thus do not rule out the possibility of a non-instrumental perspective on the natural world.<br>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to analyse some questions proposed by the debate on the issue of modernity and post-modernity in the context of the philosophy of Leonardo Coimbra, from the reflection on these issues made by Jürgen Habermas in the work
         The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity. Thus, the critique to modern reason, the reflection on the metaphysics, the issues about the relationship between reason and faith, the religious phenomenon, the process of secularization, are our starting point for the questioning and the philosophical understanding that postmodernity makes of these problems The inauguration of this new rationality allows a new questioning about the reason and the world, manifesting the sublime character of its nature, allowing a new reflection, a critique of self-sufficient and self-reflexive reason and recovering another discursive and cooperative form of reason.<br>

Abstract: This article begins by presenting experimental evidence that remains unexplained by standard and utility-extended economic models: experimental subjects tend to honor their promises even on occasions when an assessment of consequences asks them to defect; subjects voluntarily contribute to collective goods, and this contribution is highly conditional on others contributing as well; subjects evaluate and value the intentions behind actions as well as the consequences of actions. Arguments are sought for in moral philosophy that would more plainly explain the collected experimental evidence and that would help economists revise their explanatory frames. The hypothesis advanced is that the observed behavior may be interpreted as resulting from the moral strength of indignation and justice norms.<br>

Abstract: Cogito, as the first principle of Descartes' metaphysical system, initiated the modern philosophy of consciousness, becoming both the source and subject of modern Western philosophical discourse. The philosophies of Maine de Biran, Kant, Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, and others developed by answering the following questions? Is consciousness substantial or not? Does consciousness require the guarantee of a transcendental subject? Is Cogito epistemological or ontological? Am I a being-for-myself or a being-for-others? Outlining the developmental history of the idea of Cogito from Descartes to Sartre is important for totally comprehending the evolution and development of Western philosophy.<br>

Abstract: « Le temps présent est devenu éphémère, irréversible et insaisissable »,
dit A. Y. Gourevitch. Il est aussi homogène et orienté. L'historien sovié-
tique ajoute : « Pour la première fois, l'homme a constaté que le temps dont
il ne décelait le cours qu'à travers les événements, ne s'arrête pas, même en
l'absence d'événement. » A. Y. Gourevitch réintroduit ici une acception
métaphysique du temps, s'il entend bien par événements des phénomènes,
alors que dans le reste de sa contribution, il paraît convaincu de la maté-
rialité du temps. La preuve expérimentale de l'existence du temps hors des
phénomènes n'a pas été fournie et ne peut l'être. Les temps dans lesquels
nous vivons, sont celui de notre existence même, celui de notre société, celui
des mouvements des astres, etc. L'homme ne « constate » donc pas que le
temps ne s'arrête pas même en l'absence d'événement, ces événements lui
sont cachés par l'usage d'un temps quantitatif qui se réfère à l'un d'entre
eux exprimé par les horloges, devenu la référence unique, apparemment
« dématérialisé » par son omnipotence et occultant l'existence des autres
temps.<br>

Abstract: Dans Les Chemins du paradis, Gorz est plus précis. En fait, il n'y a pas deux niveaux (macro-
social hétéronome et individuel autonome), mais trois (les deux précédents plus un niveau micro-
social autonome). Résumons ces trois niveaux: « 1) le travail macrosocial hétéronome, organisé
à l'échelle de la société tout entière et qui assure le fonctionnement ainsi que la couverture des
besoins de base [de l'ensemble des membres de la société] ; 2) les activités microsociales, coopéra-
tives, communautaires ou associatives, auto-organisées à l'échelle locale et qui auront un caractère
facultatif et volontaire, sauf dans les cas où elles se substituent au travail macrosocial pour couvrir
des besoins de base ; 3) les activités autonomes correspondant aux projets et désir personnels des
individus, familles ou petits groupes. » (Gorz [1988], p. 125-126.)<br>

Abstract: Before World War II the intellectual climate of American sociology was congenial to the growth of a sociology of knowledge akin to Mannheim's. Yet in the postwar period American sociologists committed themselves to ahistorical theory, positivist methodology, and team research; their "scientistic" sociology did not permit the historicism, relativism, and holism necessary to Mannheimian analysis. Currently, however, convergent trends in a number of disciplines--not only sociology but also philosophy, anthropology, literary criticism, and the histories of ideas, science, and art--favor a revival of the Mannheimian program. Analysts of culture now seek to integrate the sociological goals of "explanation" and "understanding"--the formulation of quasi-laws of behavior, based on identification of the social structural elements of culture production, and the interpretation of the subjective meaning of culture, based on recovery of actors' intentions. Their research program requires investigation of the peculiar sociohistorical circumstances that condition actors' perceptions, necessitating attention to the cognitive content of culture. This article surveys both the theoretical justifications for such a research program and recent exemplifications of it, focusing on anlyses of what Mannheim termed "objective culture"--such symbolic vehicles for conceptions as religion, the arts, science, and political thought that acquire independent existence, becoming subject to diverse interpretations.<br>

Abstract: While the Dialectic of Enlightenment (1944; 1947) is often judged to be too limited a cultural critique, it is still widely accepted as pioneering cultural criticism, a mix of critical discourse analysis, hermeneutics, and semiotics. This article contests this reputation by turning to a source that Horkheimer and Adorno are at pains to occlude: Ernst Cassirer's Philosophy of Symbolic Forms (1923-29). Drawing on the tradition of eighteenth-century German Christology revived by the Young Hegelians in general and F.W.J. Schelling in particular, Cassirer evolves a critical strategy broader than that in the Dialectic, yet clearly implied by it. Most particularly, Cassirer's Schelling analysis discriminates philosophy, art, and religion as forms of knowledge and forms of epistemological critique, where Horkheimer and Adorno recast the art of the Bildungsbürger to occlude Cassirer's innovation, a new materialist semiotics that offers cultural critique in the broader terms that the Dialectic's critics would favor.<br>

Abstract: One of the most fundamental premises of feminist philosophy is the assumption of an invidious asymmetry between the genders that has to be overcome. Parallel to this negative account of asymmetry we also find a positive account, developed in particular within the context of so-called feminist philosophies of difference. I explore both notions of gender asymmetry. The goal is a clarification of the notion of asymmetry as it can presently be found in feminist philosophy. Drawing upon phenomenology (Merleau-Ponty, Levinas) as well as feminist difference theory (Irigaray), I argue that a gender asymmetry does exist that cannot-as in the first assumption-be transformed into symmetry.<br>

Abstract: An account of character is developed on the basis of Ricoeur's philosophy of the will. Particular attention is paid to the role of the bodily involuntary in the process of character-formation. This augments the interpretation of the moral meaning of sanctification developed by Hauerwas. When interpreted in light of corporeality, sanctification entails not only a perceptual transformation but also an affective change in the agent's value orientation, the competent retraining of the agent's emotions, and the gracious triggering of an adoptive disposition toward the agent's incarnate situation. Finally, the rootedness of character in embodiment, with the attendant problem of automatism, indicates the limits of the usefulness of an "ethics of character" for moral theology.<br>

Its methodology or discipline is interpreted as a combination of moral philosophy and religious thought- supplemented by socio-scientific and historical studies-which takes the form of three interrelated endeavors: descriptive ethics, meta-ethics, and normative ethics.<br>

Abstract: The field of library and information science (LIS) has built its practice and research perspective on a logico-analytic philosophy, which has generated useful, tangible technologies. Lately there is interest in nonempirical philosophies, such as hermeneutics and critical theory, to fulfill better LIS' service-oriented mission of providing "information" to user populations. One dimension of critical theory, Jürgen Habermas' theory of communicative action, can expand LIS' conception of information and supplement logico-empirical research methods and research practices. This article examines how LIS, particularly research into librarian-patron interaction and information system design, favors an empiricist view of language and, as a consequence, may be limiting its effectiveness. It proposes how the field might expand to include communicative action in fulfilling its mission and research agenda.<br>

Author(s): Fink-Jensen Kirsten<br>
Abstract: In this paper Kirsten Fink-Jensen suggests how a phenomenological-hermeneutic perspective can contribute to the knowledge of learning and teaching processes in music education in school The philosophical frame is Danish philosophy of life, represented by Knud Ejler Løgstrup, and Merleau-Ponty's philosophy of body, both pointing to the wholeness of mind and body in all kinds of actions. Within this framework interpretation is an epistemological, practical-hermeneutic activity based on different analytical methods. Phenomenologically, experiences of music are constituted in an intertwinement of personal, cultural, and local meaning. The challenge facing the teacher is then to understand what becomes meaningful to persons in a given situation. 'Bodily dialogue' is a metaphor of a hermeneutic process of understanding that highlights the importance of bodily aspects in the teacher's answer to a child's musical attuned articulations. This focus can facilitate children's learning processes and change and qualify the teacher's didactic reflections on the impact and progression of music lessons.<br>

Abstract: Arguing that the times of scientistic criticism of psychoanalysis are past and that psychoanalysis is now open to new intellectual and scientific horizons, the article aims at showing how the recent developments of neurobiology, cognitive psychology, as well as new theories of therapeutic change in psychoanalysis support a reformulation of the psychoanalytic unconscious. The author defends that the obvious terminological confusion between the neurobiological and cognitive non-conscious on the one hand and the dynamic unconscious, on the other, require clear definitions of differences and of commonalities. Furthermore, the author also develops the idea that the dimensions of awareness and of selfascription (avowal/disavowal) help to determine what is the core of the dynamic unconscious, even though the cognitive non-conscious and the psychoanalytic unconscious overlap to a great extent. The article shows, finally, how a new interdisciplinary consensus offers now a chance for us to recognize the shortcomings of a rationalistic philosophy of mind. /// Argumentando que os tempos de uma crítica da psicanálise a partir do cientismo já passaram e que a psicanálise está agora aberta a novos horizontes intelectuais e científicos, o artigo pretende mostrar até que ponto os desenvolvimentos mais recentes da neurobiologia, da psicologia cognitiva bem como das novas teorias da mudança terapêutica em psicanálise suportam uma reformulação do inconsciente psicanalítico. O autor defende que a óbvia confusão terminológica entre o não-consciente neurobiológico e cognitivo por um lado e o inconsciente dinâmico por outro requerem definições claras das diferenças e dos aspectos comuns. Além disso, o autor desenvolve também a ideia de que as dimensões de conhecimento e de auto-atribuição (reconhecimento/nãoreconhecimento) ajudam a determinar aquilo que constitui o cerne do inconsciente dinâmico, mesmo que o não-consciente cognitivo e o inconsciente psicanalítico se sobreponham em grande medida. O artigo mostra ainda, finalmente, até que ponto um novo consenso interdisciplinar nos oferece agora uma oportunidade para reconhecer as limitações do racionalismo emfilosofia da mente.<br>

Abstract: The view of language is greatly changed from early modern philosophy to later modern philosophy and to postmodern philosophy. The linguistic question in early modern philosophy, which is characterized by rationalism and empiricism, is discussed in this paper. Linguistic phenomena are not at the center of philosophical reflections in early modern philosophy. The subject of consciousness is at the center of the philosophy, which makes language serve purely as an instrument for representing thoughts. Locke, Leibniz and Descartes consider language from a representationalist point of view. To them, language itself is idealized and represents thought as if it were thought representing itself. Like the structural linguist Saussure, the founders of phenomenology and analytical philosophy give much attention to the logical or static structure of language, and stick up for the representationalism of early modern philosophy. However, their successors refuse to accept this attitude, meaning the final collapse of representationalism. /// 从早期现代哲学到后期现代哲学再到后现代哲学，在语言观上产生了重大的 变化。早期现代哲学以唯理论和经验论为典型形式。语言现象没有成为该时期哲学 反思的中心问题; 意识主体处于哲学的中心，这使得语言仅仅充当着表象思想的工 具。洛克、莱布尼茨和笛卡尔都从表象论的角度看待语言，在他们那里，语言本身 被观念化了，它们表象思想，就像思想在表象它自身。正像结构语言学家索绪尔一 样，现象学和分析哲学的创始人关注的都是语言的逻辑结构或静态结构，他们延续 了早期现代哲学的表象论，但他们的后继者拒绝接受这种态度，而这意味着最终突 破表象论。<br>

Abstract: In his 1987 bestseller The Closing of the American Mind, when Allan Bloom cites German ideas-or the "German connection"-as the utlimate source of a radical deterioration in American higher education, his attention focuses on Nietzsche's relativism, which he sees as nihilism. Tracing the terms "relativism" and "nihilism" in European philosophy and criticism, this article locates Bloom along a spectrum of positions ranging from absolutism to radical relativism. Examining links between Bloom's rejection of relativism, his praise of the Great Books tradition, and his hostility toward feminist scholarship, the writer shows how Bloom's advocacy of the literary canon represents a defense of white male privilege in the name of the "true" and the "natural."<br>

Abstract: While concepts of a postinternational politics properly highlight the constant variance of entities in play in international relations, the approach lacks an ontology that shows how such an unstable variety of types of players can coexist in a common field in the first place. This article draws upon Deleuze's philosophy to set out an ontology in which the continual reformulation of entities in play in "postinternational" society can be grasped.This entails a strategic shift from speaking about the "borders" between sovereign states to referring instead to the "margins" between a plethora of entities that are ever open to modifications of identity. The concept of the margin possesses a much wider reach than borders, and focuses continual attention on the meetings and interactions between a range of indeterminate entities whose interactions may determine both themselves and the types of entity that are in play.<br>

Abstract: The history of literary studies is especially important today as Germanistik takes account of its institutionalization in the university and redefines its disciplinary boundaries. By analyzing the two best-known reform universities, Berlin in 1809/10 and Constance in 1966/67, I show their strikingly similar commitments to notions of scholarship/research, learning, and pedagogy. That these common concerns are based on the influence of hermeneutics is not surprising; the philosophy of Bildung and Wissenschaft central to educational theory for Humboldt in Berlin, as well as for Jauß's and Iser's Rezeptionsästhetik in Constance, is metacritical and encourages reflection on understanding and interpretation.<br>

Abstract: On essaie dans ces pages d'appliquer à la philosophie de Kant et de Dilthey certains concepts en vue d'une perspective critique de l'histoire. La distinction diltheyenne entre explication et compréhension est mise en rapport avec celle qu'opère Kant entre jugement déterminant et jugement réfléchissant. Puisque la majeure partie de la complexité historique ne peut trouver son explication dans des lois générales, on propose une compréhension réfléchissante du récit historique. Mettre en relation le jugement réfléchissant et la compréhension revient à souligner la dimension normative de l'interprétation historique. La perspective anthropologique de Kant fait également place aux jugements préréflexifs, préliminaires sur l'histoire, tandis que l'approche diltheyenne par les Geisteswissenschaften ramène à une conscience reflexive ou autoréférée qui replace l'individu en son temps et en son lieu. D'autres aspects peuvent encore conduire à notre rapport critique à l'histoire : le modèle kantien d'une orientation réfléchissante de la communauté humaine, les limites qu'ilpose à l'interprétation authentique, la conception heideggerienne de l'authenticité historique, l'analyse diltheyenne des systèmes d'influence réciproque comme cadre de l'idée d'une imputation causale singulière chez Paul Ricœur. This essay is an attempt at applying certain concepts to the philosophy of Kant and Dilthey, so as to develop a critical perspective on history. Dilthey's explanation-understanding distinction is related to Kant's distinction between determinant and reflective judgment. Since much of the complexity of history cannot be determinantly explained by general laws, a reflective understanding of the meaning of historical narrative is suggested. To relate judgment and understanding is to highlight the evaluative dimension of historical interpretation. Kant's anthropological perpective also makes room for pre-reflective, preliminary judgments about history, whereas Dilthey's human science approach points back to a reflexive or self-referring awareness that locates the individual in his time and place. Some other aspects may also lead us to a critical approach to history : Kant's reflective orientational model of the human community, the limits he places on authentic interpretation, Heidegger's views on authentic historicity, and Dilthey's analysis of systems of reciprocal influence seen as a framework for Ricœur's conception of singular causal imputation.<br>

Abstract: Cet article (1) présente une réflexion théorique sur la notion de genre, de ses définitions et ses usages en sciences sociales. S'opposant à l'approche dominante qui conçoit le genre comme identité ou attribut socialement construits des personnes, conception qu'elle considère comme essentialisante ou substantialisante, l'auteur argumente en faveur d'une approche relationnelle du genre conçu comme modalité des relations sociales. Elle se fonde pour cela sur des travaux d'anthropologie comparative et historique qui contraignent à reconsidérer le dualisme du moi et du corps constitutif de l'idéologie individualiste de la personne, et critique I'hypostase du Moi comme homoncule constitué à partir d'une absolutisation de la première personne. Analysant le système sexué des trois personnes grammaticales, elle soutient que, n'étant pas référentiel, « le je de l'interlocution n'a ni sexe, ni genre ». Les apports croisés de l'anthropologie et de la philosophie analytique la conduisent à revoir la notion de personne pour mieux penser la capacité proprement humaine de se reconnaître comme d'un sexe sans être jamais assigné à celui-ci. This article presents a theoretical work on the idea of gender, its definitions and uses in social science. The author objects to the mainstream approach that sees gender as an identity or an attribute that some people socially construct. She sees that idea as essentializing or substantializing. She argues in favor of a relational approach of gender conceived as mode of social interactions. Her approach is based on comparative and historical works of anthropologists that lead to consider the dualism of the ego and the body which make the individualistic ideology of a persona, and she criticizes the hypostasis of the ego as homunculus made up from absolutizing the id. Analyzing the gender system of the three grammatical persons, she asserts that, as it is not a reference, the other person's "I" does not have a sex nor a gender. The contributions from both anthropology and analytic philosophy lead her to reconsider the notion of persona so as to better grasp the capacity—specifically human—to see ourselves belonging to a sex group without having ever been assigned to it. Este artículo presenta una reflexión teórica respecto a la noción de género, de sus definiciones y sus usos en ciencias sociales. Oponiéndose al enfoque dominante que concibe el género como identidad o atributo socialmente construidos de las personas, concepción que considera como esencializante y sustancializante, la autora argumenta a favor de un enfoque relacional del género concebido como modalidad de las relaciones sociales. Para ella, se basa en los trabajos de antropología comparativa e histórica que obligan a reconsiderar el dualismo del yo y del cuerpo constitutivo de la ideología individualista de la persona, y critica la hipóstasis del Yo como homúnculo constituido a partir de una absolutización de la primera persona. Al analizar el sistema sexuado de las tres personas gramaticales, sostiene que al no ser referencial, "el yo de la interlocución no tiene ni sexo, ni género". Los aportes convergentes de la antropología y de la filosofía analítica lo llevan a reconsiderar la noción de persona para pensar mejor la capacidad propiamente humana de reconocerse como de un sexo sin nunca ser asignado a él. Dieser Artikel bietet theoretische Uberlegungen über den Begriff Gender, seine Definitionen und seinen Gebrauch in den Sozialwissenschaften. Die Autorin setzt sich gegen die meist verbreitete Auffassung des Genders als sozial aufgebaute Identität oder Attribut des Einzelnen, denn sie betrachtet sie als eine essentialisierende bzw. substantialisierende Definition. Dagegen argumentiert sie für eine beziehungsmäßige Herangehensweise an das Gender, die es als eine Modalität der sozialen Beziehungen erfasst. Sie bezieht sich dabei auf vergleichenden und historischen Anthropologiearbeiten, die uns dazu zwingen, das Dualismus des Ichs und des Körpers zu überdenken, der einen Bestandteil der individualistischen Ideologie des Menschen darstellt, und kritisiert dazu die Hypostase des Ichs als Einzelnen, der auf Grund einer Absolutisierung der ersten Person geschaffen wird. Indem sie das geschlechtliche System der drei grammatikalischen Personen analysiert, behauptet die Autorin, dass auf Grund seiner Unbezüglichkeit „das Ich in der Interlokution weder Geschlecht noch Gender hat". Die Beiträge der Anthropologie und der analytischen Philosophie führen zu einer Überdenkung des Begriffs Mensch, um die rein menschliche Fähigkeit besser zu erfassen, die darin besteht, dass man sich einem Geschlecht anschließt, ohne dass es einem je zugewiesen wird.<br>

Abstract: By deliberately placing ethics under the category of communication, Kierkegaard intended to show that it is like no other science. He distinguished between direct communication and indirect communication. Direct communication concerns objectivity and knowledge; indirect communication, on the other hand, has to do with subjectivity ("becoming-subject"). In this paper, the author presents Kierkegaard's philosophy of communication and ethics with special emphasis on his irony and pseudonymous authorship. He also examines the possibility of a discourse in business ethics, focusing on the educational perspective. He discusses Kierkegaard's aspects of communication—the communicator, the receiver, and the object—with particular reference to applied ethics. He argues that the Kierkegaardian notion of indirect communication can contribute to renewing business ethics teaching—which in his view is more art than science—in two important ways: (1) when the ethics teacher changes his position in the teacher/learner relationship; and (2) when the relationship between communicator/receiver is strengthened at the expense of the object.<br>

Author(s): Jameson Fredric<br>
Abstract: This review essay attempts to understand the book under review against the background of Jameson's previous writings. Failing to do so would invite misunderstanding since there are few contemporary theorists whose writing forms so much of a unity. Jameson's book can be divided into three parts. The first and most important part deals with dialectics, the second with politics, and the third with philosophy of history. In the first part Jameson argues that dialectics best captures our relationship to the sociocultural and historical world we are living in. The second part makes clear that Jameson is not prepared to water down his own Marxist politics in order to spare the liberal sensibilities of his political opponents. In the third part Jameson develops his own philosophy of history, mainly in a dialogue with Ricoeur. Dialectics is his main weapon in his discussion with Ricoeur, and it becomes clear that the Spinozism of dialectics allows for a better understanding of history and of historical writing than does Ricoeur's phenomenological approach. The book is an impressive testimony to the powers of dialectical thought and to its indispensability for a proper grasp of historical writing.<br>

Abstract: Singing songs in service (kirtan seva) constitutes the primary expression of devotion in the Pushti Marg (Path of Grace) tradition of India. This liturgical practice is singular amongst South Asian, Hindu traditions in its extensive use of rag set to classical poetry. I consider the meaning of this sung liturgy using the ideas of hermeneutic philosophy that concern understanding. I suggest that performing song in service is similar to the act of understanding a work, one in which a self is disclosed in the mode of play. Critically, such continual self-unveilings over a lifetime of service to Krishna afford the practitioner the possibility of the lived liberation promised by founder, Vallabhacharya.<br>

Abstract: Kant's progressive philosophy of history is an integral aspect of his critical system, yet it is often ignored or even treated as an embarrassment by contemporary scholars. In this article, I defend Kant and argue for the continuing relevance of his regulative assumption of historical progress. I suggest, furthermore, that the first-person stance of practical belief exemplified in Kant's conception of hope offers new resources for thinking about the relationship between the ideal and the real in political theory.<br>

Abstract: A theory of the embodiment of action is proposed. Reflections on relations between human intentions, the human body and the notion of agency lead us to argue that phenomenological analysis is not sufficient for such a theory. Our consideration, that the most fundamental level of embodied agency is that of life itself, brings us to the philosophy of biology and the theory of the organism: briefly, certain parts of the natural environment are intrinsic to the constitution of organisms and, in their more sophisticated configuration, as agents. Action is embodied in the sense that certain physiological processes are internal in relation to it and play a constitutive role in its performance. The way in which environment, context and consciousness affect and constitute the nature of agency at personal and sub-personal levels is elaborated. We see that human agents perceive and act upon their world through a complex shifting between those levels. A summary of the ways in which the social sciences can be enriched by this more comprehensive view of human agency provides the basis of justification for claiming Actor-Network Theory (ANT), originally developed by sociologists studying science and technology, as a promising framework for the continuation of this reasoning.<br>

Abstract: In the twentieth century the phenomenon of the subjective body was integrated into ontology in philosophy, moving from Phenomenology to Existentialism. The rediscovery of the body and affect as a way of thinking also led contemporary cognitive science to the topic of the relationship between emotion and cognition, to the necessity of expanding the model of the mind and of experiencing emotions and physical sensation. The extension of the explanatory possibilities of a scholarly metalanguage into the area of the emotions and physical sensation is also important for the analysis of the acoustic aspect of lyric verse. In the acoustic flow of verse, the sounds of language have, apart from a phonemic function, their own sensuous (emotional) effect of the articulating body. In literary studies so far the acoustic flow has been interpreted only at the segmental level as a sequence of phonemes or sounds (for example in constructs of acoustic succession, phonetic instrumentation, or phonetic composition). At the suprasegmental level the acoustic flow must be conceived of as a sequence of syllables, a sequence of articulated phonations, the semantic movement of the phonemic flow. A syllable has no semantic value, but does have an experiential form, which influences motivation, behaviour, and experience. In addition to sonic and tonal modulation at the suprasegmental level, qualitative modulation, modulation of timbre, and the sequences of tones and of noise are also employed. In modelling the semantic movement of syllables in a phonemic flow the methodological approaches of experimental psychosemantics have been used. Connotational objectivization took place in three dimensions that were polarized on the basis of domestic and alien, light and darkness, activity and passivity, and research was conducted with a sample of 2,800 respondents. The analysis of the acoustic side of lyric verse would be incomplete if in addition to accentual rhythm and melody we did not also consider qualitative modulation, the semantic movement of the phonic flow. At the segmental level of verse, phonemes are semantically completed by the lexical meanings of words. This semantic process is parallel to the semantic process of the phonemic flow, but apart from the metrical correspondence between them there is no causal connection, only similar semantic content. In addition to the semantic movement of the phonational flow and the semantic saturation of phonemes, the dynamic of the acoustic process of verse completes the phonic line of the verse, which in itself links occurrences of sonic and tonal modulation.<br>

Abstract: The central point is that Schutz's idealization of reciprocity, the matching of subjective intentions in the public world of interactive behaviour, necessarily involves agents in an ironic process. This is largely because, since they are taking so much for granted, they cannot be aware of what is latent in the intentional perspectives of their social partners. In bringing out the pattern of the irony of inter subjective dialectic, the argument makes plain the importance of pretence as a vital concept in philosophy, sociology and hermeneutics. The article closes with a criticism of naive optimism among purveyors of dialectic, recommending a proper concern with the irreconcilables of tragedy.<br>

Abstract: Beginning with the paradoxical fact of the plurality of philosophical systems, the irrationality of this situation is examined, first, from the point of view of two solutions — the Hegelian solution and that which dissolves the paradox by denying that systems are exclusive of one another — judged to be inadequate; and then from the viewpoint of the contrast between the claims of genuine philosophy and its actual historical practice. The idea of system is examined from the perspective of Spinoza's Ethics and, finally, M. Gueroult's idéalisme intégral serves as a guide in exploring the result of subordinating the historical features of philosophical activity to its systematic features. Partant du fait paradoxal de la pluralité des systèmes philosophiques, l'auteur examine l'irrationalité de cette situation d'abord du point de vue de deux solutions — celle de Hegel et celle qui résoud le paradoxe en niant que les systèmes s'excluent mutuellement — solutions qui sont jugées inadéquates; puis du point de vue du contraste entre la véritable philosophie et sa pratique historique effective. L'idée de système est examinée dans la perspective de l'éthique de Spinoza et, enfin, l'idéalisme intégral de M. Gueroult sert de guide pour explorer les conséquences d'une subordination des aspects historiques de l'activité philosophique à ses aspects systématiques. Angesichts der paradoxen Situation der Pluralität von philosophischen Systemen wird die Irrationalität dieser Situation untersucht: zunächst vom Gesichtspunkt zweier Lösungen — nämlich der Lösung Hegels und derjenigen die darin besteht, die Unvereinbarkeit der Systeme zu leugnen —, die beide als inadäquat verworfen werden; dann von einem Standpunkt aus, der zwischen den Ansprüchen echter Philosophie und deren tatsächlicher historischer Praxis unterscheidet. Der Begriff des Systems wird aus der Perspektive von Spinozas Ethik untersucht und schliesslich wird M. Gueroults integraler Idealismus als Führer verwendet, um das Ergebnis einer Unterwerfung der historischen Züge philosophischer Tätigkeit unter ihre systematischen Züge zu durchleuchten.<br>

Abstract: The thesis of this essay is that historical interpretation of the New Testament is necessary to provide information for setting the parameters of valid readings of the New Testament. Such an interpretation serves the purpose of alienation between reader and text and enables the interpreter to ask critical questions about the communicability and relevance of these texts. The nature of the New Testament necessitates historical interpretation. Current historico-critical interpretation of the New Testament is discussed and evaluated with a view to possibilities and limitations in the light of current developments in literary science, history of philosophy and historiography.<br>

Abstract: Since 1990, two eminent French-speaking sinologists, François Jullien and Jean François Billeter, have been engaged in a debate on the principles of comparative philosophy and sinology. The debate has been developed in several books and articles and attracted the attention of a relatively broad public as well as of a wide range of French intellectuals. The arguments with regard to an older discussion on the difference between philology and philosophy are evaluated here, and conclusions are drawn concerning the present status of comparative philosophy in academia.<br>

Abstract: The renewal of a dialog between landscape design and garden history demands a renewal of the questions and methods of garden history. This essay studies how garden reception and garden creation interact. It considers three main issues: first, it explores the domain of cultural expectations framing the engagement with a garden shared by users and creators at a given time—the poetical texture of gardens; second, the role of garden creation in exploiting, expanding or subverting this shared frame of expectations; and third, it proposes an approach—garden pragmatic—to study the broader interactions between garden creation and reception on the one hand, and social and cultural change on the other. The question of intersubjectivity—how do we share our sense and experiences of the world with others, and how do we transform them—is at the root of all the little stories—the fragments of a poetic of gardens—that propose new directions for garden history. Many of these stories have been presented during the last 15 years at symposia at Dumbarton Oaks where the author is presently the director of Garden and Landscape Studies. The general philosophy however had never been presented until the Fall 2004 when he published his "Essais de Poétique des Jardins." They were never made explicit at Dumbarton Oaks where each story only played its part in the theme of the symposium. Yet the whole course of ideas presented here results from these many exchanges with other scholars. This is why many footnotes make explicit references to their works. So, following the lead offered by this text or choosing a personal route, each reader may access many different voices that make garden history at present into a lively resource for pondering about the role of landscape creation in a multicultural world. These fragments of history are written to stimulate the designer's imagination, not to outline the course landscape design should follow.<br>

Abstract: What is the future of the poetic figures in a technological and scientific world where a more restricted view appears to be emerging as to what is adequate and relevant about metaphors? What part should the radical trope play in a script where the figures that are heralded are usually those that are perceived as having practical importance, i. e., those that fill in the gaps of existing knowledge? It will be the intent of this paper to show that the current preoccupation of much of philosophy and psychology with structural explanation and cognitive theory has certainly contributed to establishing a coordinated and unified theory of metaphors, but left unto itself such a concern is severely limited and does not adequately explain the full potential of metaphorical expressions.<br>

Abstract: Animal experience is central to the fiction of J.M. Coetzee and Franz Kafka. In light of new approaches to animal awareness in science and philosophy, this essay investigates how Coetzee's deliberations on the animal, initially by way of Kafka, extend the range of narrative authority and reappraise human empathy.<br>

Abstract: This essay reads the poetry of Theodor Roethke and Seamus Heaney in the light of Giorgio Agamben's philosophy of plant and animal life and his notion of "bare life." It argues that both poets offer very different descriptions of the nature of the relationship between human and non-human life.<br>

Author(s): Williams Ron G.<br>
Abstract: The claim of this essay is that those who study ritual should make fuller use than has been made so far of the literature in philosophy of art. The relevance of aesthetic theory to several questions currently being addressed in ritual studies will be shown, and a model based on what we call "ritual spaces" will serve as the basis for interpreting certain types of ritual. We apply our theory to the ancient Zoroastrian high liturgy, the Yasna. Implications of this interpretive model will also be explored; they include discussions on the following issues: the role of ritual language, the relationship of the various dimensions of ritual, and the basic functions of liturgical performance. The essay begins with analysis and concludes with synthesis.<br>

Abstract: Mallarmé constructs a "crisis of verse" that mimes the circumstances of loss and the moment of lamentation to produce his celebrated poetic purity. Indeed, he constructs this purity out of the materials of ritual and philosophical defilement: not only does his poetic theory valorize death and danger, but his poetic practice largely relies on contact with the foreign, on semantic contagion, and on ambiguity. The significance of this defilement spreads in multiple directions: it is instrumental in producing newness and in mediating Mallarmé's professional rivalry with Wagner, it bears witness to the domestic crisis of the Third Republic, and it functions as a form of resistance to cultural assimilation. Moreover, because defilement is at once material and symbolic and because that "symbolism" is an obstinately obscure mode of referentiality, Mallarmé's cultivation of defilement is a recuperation of the scapegoats that "pure" philosophy necessarily exiles: the material and the hyperessential.<br>

Abstract: Most students of Javanese culture and society have used a few crucial native terms and concepts to analyze aspects of traditional etiquette, statecraft, and mysticism. A unitary approach to priyayi ethics, aesthetics, and power is developed here by synthesizing themes common to earlier treatments. Several points of disagreement with Geertz's (1960, 1973) descriptions are discussed in conclusion as a way of drawing out lexicographic aspects of the methodology of interpretive anthropology.

Abstract: The aim of the article is to present some aspects of Paul Ricœur’s thought, especially his reflection on the servile will. Firstly I present Ricœur’s philosophy of will (in the context of phenomenology of the voluntary and involuntary) and the concept of fallibility. Then I demonstrate the main aspects of Ricœurian rethinking and enlarging of Husserl’s phenomenology what leads to hermeneutic formula: the symbol gives rise to thought. Eventually, I argue that Ricœur’s hermeneutic phenomenology creates a specified anthropological view and understanding of the human condition. This understanding will later become a part of the ‘hermeneutics of the self.’<br>

Abstract: For both Levinas and Derrida, the practice of philosophy, understood as commentary by the former and deconstruction by the latter, was founded on borrowing terms from other languages and finding their equivalents in French. This argument is developed through a discussion of two texts, Levinas's early Talmudic reading, “The Temptation of Temptation,” and Derrida's deconstruction of
         The Merchant of Venicein “What Is a ‘Relevant’ Translation?” This essay shows how translated terms are interwoven into these texts. It also shows that translation is essential to Levinas's and Derrida's creative conceptualization, and to the performativity of their philosophies, meaning that Levinas and Derrida open their language to other languages in order to create concepts. It finally argues that in both Derrida and Levinas the question of the limits of translation, namely, of the moment in which translation becomes conversion, is left open.<br>

Abstract: The combinatory and ludic polyculturalism, the parodic transmutation of meanings and values, the open, multilingual hybridization [which] are the devices responsible for the constant feeding and refeeding of this “baroquizing” almagest: the carnivalized transencyclopedia of the new barbarians, where everything can coexist with everything. They are the machinery that crushes the material of tradition, like the teeth of a tropical sugarmill, transforming stalks and husks into bagasse and juicy syrup.

Abstract: The world is a large and various place. Those wishing to chart new planetary cartographies are finding many languages to study beyond the French–German–English triad that long dominated Western comparative studies, and they are developing new methods appropriate to the expanded scope of our field. The tough linguistic and political analyses that Emily Apter rightly wishes comparatists to pursue will best be carried forward by widening our cultural and linguistic horizons, and by employing the full variety of critical and theoretical approaches that can be included in our cartographic toolboxes today.<br>

Abstract: Even in her familial tone, and perhaps because of it, Jabbeh Wesley never forgets that the healing and meaning-making function of grief and mourning, as painful as grief and mourning are, is not to be avoided. Rather, as DuBose argues, based on the painful experience of his wife's miscarriage, as “‘child’ and ‘parent’ disappeared, our bodies and our society
      dys-appeared, and our connections and hopes re-appeared” (374). Jabbeh Wesley attaches the reappearance of the hopes for the healing and reconstruction of her Liberian world to people's ability and willingness to truly experience the painful process of grief and, perhaps informed by that cathartic experience, allow compassion and empathy to guide their relationship to others.<br>

Abstract: Some time ago, Paul Ricoeur pointed out that “the symbol gives rise to thought.”
      
               These diasporic religious communities enable us to find a new beginning for thought that has the possibility of avoiding the exclusivity and elitism that has too often accompanied the objective meaning of thought as a science of the rational. Not only these diasporic religions, but also the very conundrum of the continent of Africa as a whole, to echo Skinner at the beginning of our paper, may serve in the same manner as one of the most important ways that thought might be renewed—and the relationship of thought to action and performance.38<br>

Abstract: Is SPEP the city of God? This would be going too far. Not even the theological turn in French Phenomenology would make this claim. Dick Howard already threw in a troubling question: “diversification that perhaps gives more breadth than depth?” he asked. And there are plenty more troubling questions. SPEP is now a big operation. It has committees and subcommittees, multiple simultaneous sessions, blind review. All these developments are signs, perhaps inevitable ones, of its success, but all have familiar downsides: bureaucratization, diversification for its own sake, what Habermas would call
   Unübersichtlichkeit. This is what happens when outsiders become insiders, the antis become their own sort of establishment. You can't blame some of us for feeling nostalgic for our long-lost innocence, even though we all know—you don't have to be a philosopher of history to know this—that we can't go there. History has rendered a judgment, but Dick Howard said, “Historywilljudge.” That's one problem with history: It's always rendering judgments, but they are never final. You'd have to be at the end of history for that, and despite the claim of some philosophers, we aren't there yet. The slaughter bench of history looks very different today from the early 1960s, but it's still in some ways a slaughter bench. So how will the SPEP of the early twenty-first century look to the philosopher-historians of 2061—or is it 2062?<br>

Abstract: In short, it is exposure to the experientially inspired and theoretically casual atmosphere of those early SPEP meetings—where neglected topics and unorthodox modes of thinking and speaking were encouraged in an undisciplined way—to which I owe the most. Of course, SPEP grew up. It has experienced its share of embarrassing upheavals, as the heavy presence of its own versions of the social and political prejudices in the larger culture became too obvious to ignore. But it is now a major event—the four-day anchor for a week-long convention that takes over hotels, runs multiple concurrent sessions, fosters satellite groups, and often follows established lines of discussion. Some even call it the alternative APA. Yet I am sure that as long as lifeworld experience continues to trump whatever it is currently fashionable to say about it, grown-up SPEP will retain enough of its original vitality and intellectual generosity so that another generation of aging academics will have cause to repeat our present thank-yous in another fifty years.<br>

Abstract: Our plight, then, is not simply that we are all in the same boat, let alone on the same ocean. Yet we are still bound by the responsbility of inhabiting the same planet. What would it mean, then, to share the earth with all its inhabitants, not just in terms of occupying the same planet but also in terms of caring and looking after each other in the anachronistic sense of the word
   dutyas plight? Can we risk pledging to solemnly avow our own investments in the very things we so self-rightousely protest against, not in order to stop protesting in the name of justice but, rather, in the hopes of turning the killing machine back against itself and taking another step toward “hunting down” and abolishing death penalities wherever they may be hiding, even in our own disowned fears and desires?<br>

Abstract: No doubt the rise of religion has not only posed a particular dilemma for critical theory but also provided a curious place to end this reflection. Having started my career doing philosophy of religion it is somewhat surprising to meet religion again as I turn to what surely must be at least a later phase of my career. I am reminded of Antonio's line from the Italian film
            C'eravamo Tanto Amati, translated asWe All Loved Each Other So Much: “We thought we could change the world, but the world changed us.” “Philosophers only interpret the world, the point is to change it,” so said Marx. But in a curious way those who would change the world are changed by it.<br>

Abstract: In 1986, however, SPEP's present mission statement could not have been conceived. Many important issues and questions remained unrecognized or simply ignored. But the opening before the organization was now a “postmodern” one, and a hallmark of what is called postmodern thought is its requirement that it transform in the force of its own lack of founded stability. I believe that 1986 began a series of developments that is turning SPEP toward ways of thought and life that cannot be labeled postmodern. I doubt that this turning constitutes a midlife crisis for SPEP in its fiftieth year. But it does highlight for me the fact that I have been giving a historical narrative that has to do with continuities in the dissolution of continuities, that I have not been—if I may put it this way—postmodern in an orthodox manner, although I have refused to give an unambiguous meaning to the term that has played a major role in organizing this essay. I do not know whether this discussion is postmodern, post-postmodern, or modern, and I do not care. I do care, however, about the openings that SPEP has provided for collegiality, conflict, unresolved differences, transformations, and sites for presentations, discussion, and critique. In my experience, in its own organizational development and travail, it has occasioned changes in the lives of many philosophers (mine among them). I expect that its indeterminate opening now—its continuing transformations in the interaction of many differences—will continue to surprise, irritate, and change those of us who participate in its opportunities. I close with a sense of beginning and an acknowledgment of the strangeness of the continuity that a series of beginnings provides: continuity without substance, continuity coming to pass.<br>

Abstract: I want to conclude with one more argument from my own work. I have very often argued that philosophers of technology, regarding the expectations of society and their own traditions and habits, may come “too late” to technologies. They too often undertake their reflections
            afterthe technologies are in place. Rather, I argue, they should reposition themselves at what I call the “R&D” position where technologies are taking developmental shape, in think tanks, in incubator facilities, in research centers. Only then can truly “new” and emerging technologies be fully philosophically engaged.<br>

Abstract: We at SPEP have never been modern and have made a good living off the critique of modernism and of its binary oppositions. But I think that the business as usual of Continental philosophy will have to be expanded to include a critique of the opposition of the human and the nonhuman, of
            physisandtechne, and of “Continental philosophy” and “science.” For the truth is that we have been a party to the science wars. That is why I think that the work of Catherine Malabou is exactly the sort of work that SPEP and Continental philosophy generally will have to do in the future.
                  We have yet to admit how deeply inscribed the human is in the nonhuman and the technical. We have yet to appreciate that being-in-the-world is not only historicized, gendered, and incarnate but also both a neural and a galactic event, of both microscopic and macroscopic proportions. Can it be of no interest to “philosophy,” can there be nothing to “wonder” about, that our bodies are literally made of stardust? We have yet to realize how deeply interwoven is the imagination of speculative physics with the wonder of the philosophers. If the best we can do is to protect our turf by saying that science does not think, the sciences will steal our thunder, that is, our wonder, right out from under us. Science does think, and science wonders, because wonder is the piety of thought. That is a matter to which SPEP, and Continental philosophers generally, whether they have taken a theological turn or are running in the opposite direction, should give more thought.36

Abstract: The articles collected here represent the richness and diversity of philosophical work presented at SPEP and thus serve to vindicate Steinbock's vision, expressed in his Co-director's Address, of SPEP as an organization that is grounded in a fundamental openness to experience that leads it to continually push against its own limits and thus to reimagine itself.<br>

Abstract: For, if phenomenology renounces its search for the absolute and for foundations, then it must give up seeing itself as a single and self-contained discourse. The minimal phenomenologist renounces monolinguism and is no longer the master of only one discourse. Instead, he or she must practice a mixed discourse. To do this is to practice diglossia, to become a code-switcher. In its ordinary sense, the practice of code-switching refers to the passage from one language or dialect to another one in the course of a single conversation, for instance, when the conversation moves from an informal to a formal setting or when it moves from one topic to another. But in the phenomenological context, this would involve the ability to shift from a phenomenological discourse to its “others,” whether they might be Freudian energetics, Deleuzian aspects, Badiouan events, and so on. This practice of translation or code-switching has perhaps always been the role of the phenomenologist, if it is accepted that phenomenological reflection does not begin from itself but is nourished by a life that precedes it and gives rise to it.<br>

Abstract: Second, how do we account for the fact that the processes of public memory are both created by individual choices and nurtured in collective contexts? Many scholars have productively addressed this question by unpacking specific examples in which individuals or groups vie to control public memories. The critical framework I recommend offers a more systematic approach to this issue. To view representations of the past through the nested lenses of rhetoric, public memory, and the agential spiral is to focus on how human beings—individually and in groups—forge connections with people of other times through the medium of public agency. The agential spiral, derived from my reading of Ricoeur's “threefold mimesis,” aims to pinpoint three moments in the construction of narratives in which human action is represented and reinterpreted within a temporal structure. As a critical framework, the agential spiral helps us to view the creation of public memories at three key moments and to see the process as a coiling whole. Using this tool, we can better understand why certain memories persist in certain societies and how those memories powerfully connect people across time as well as space.<br>

Abstract: Moreover, for Shaw and Ricoeur, imaginative works of art have the power to project alternative and potentially redemptive ways of living together harmoniously, which in turn can substantially change hearts, alter beliefs, and reorient behavior in an empathetic direction that promotes vigilant concern for the other. Be they biblical narratives, plays for the stage, fictions for the page, or other forms of literary texts broadly construed, stories can portray freedom and fault reconciled in compassionate beings committed to advancing the common good. In this way, poetic making can and has instilled in us not only faith and hope but magnanimity as well. Thus, the answer to the provocative question Shaw poses at the beginning of his last major treatise,
      Everybody's Political What's What?—“Is Human Nature Incurably Depraved?”
               —is a resounding no: not just for him but for Ricoeur, too. Where there is faith, there is hope; and where there is hope, there is life. Life expectant.55<br>

Abstract: To provide a context for the essays published here, this introduction to the special issue on metonymy highlights a number of aspects of the cognitive-linguistic discussion of metonymy of the past twenty-five years. It briefly sketches the development of metonymy studies in poetics, linguistics, and philosophy, emphasizing that the cognitive-linguistic approach to metonymy of the past decades represents a return to the semantic views of metonymy advocated in structuralist semantics. This development was triggered by the extensive study of metaphor, but metonymy has now emancipated itself as an autonomous field of study that displays complex and unresolved relations with metaphor. This introduction also attends to the new insights added by cognitive linguistics to such a semantic approach to metonymy, suggesting that metonymy has indeed gone cognitive linguistic.<br>

Abstract: What is left unsaid in this article about the relationship between utopia and rhetoric could certainly fill the pages of many books. The range is especially rich when we turn to contemporary rhetorical theorists who specifically address society as a value to be combined with a remembered or imagined better place, as in Nedra Reynolds's
      Geographies of Writingor bell hooks'sBelonging: A Culture of Place.
               Just as constitutive rhetoric (that is, cumulative discourse that contributes to building the structure of human society) has been important in the works of theorists often cited by utopists as crucial to their work, so the utopian impulse continues to be inherent in the way rhetoricians see their subject. To persuade verbally or visually, we must have our own idea of what is socially better, and we must also be able to imagine what our audience believes to be better. The function of utopia, then, may be less philosophical and ideological at its root than it is linguistic in a pragmatic sense. As Kenneth Burke has written of human beings, we are “the symbol-making, symbol-using, symbol-misusing animal … rotten with perfection.”38

Abstract: Milan Kundera has described this kind of comedy as echoing a joyous, life-affirming laughter—“the serious laughter of angels expressing their joy of being.”
      
               But that is not to suggest that there is anything divinely pious in this position: if Joyce is an angel, then he is one, like Stephen Dedalus, who will not blindly or uncritically serve.168
            
               In commenting upon an earlier version of this article, Patrick Parrinder spoke of “the difficult relationship between Utopia and comedy.” This relationship is problematized by the fact that Utopia rarely seems able to laugh at itself or therefore to offer the liberating possibilities of comedy. Joyce's later writing, however, appears to advance the rare chance of a pluralist, ambiguous, and dynamic vision of Utopia: a Utopia that might be sustained into futurity—a Utopia that still has room for dreamers and for democrats. But is it still possible that we can call this realm of radical openness, this flux of possibilities, this resolutely material site, Utopian? And do we really need to? This kind of Utopia is not a category or a frame but a direction, a progress, a confluence of streams of consciousness and of unconsciousness, flowing into the river of life: not just a symbolic river but a real one too, the Liffey, the great Anna Livia Plurabelle herself. Or as Joyce put it, more succinctly (and more joyously), it is simply “Lff!”169

Abstract: Flush with the juices of adolescence, American philosophy declared independence from its European parentage in the work of Ralph Waldo Emerson and his generation. In 1837, Emerson addressed the Harvard Phi Beta Kappa Society on the occasion of its inaugural meeting for the year, which he called a "holiday." Emerson began: I greet you on the recommencement of our literary year. Our anniversary is one of hope, and, perhaps, not enough of labor. We do not meet for games of strength or skill, for the recitation of histories, tragedies, and odes, like the ancient Greeks; for parliaments of love and poesy, like the Troubadours; nor for the advancement of science, like our contemporaries in the British and European capitals. Thus far, our holiday has been simply a friendly sign of the survival of the love of letters amongst a people too busy to give letters any more. Perhaps the time is already come when it ought to be, and will be something else; when the sluggard intellect of this continent will look from under its iron lids and fill the postponed expectations of the world with something better than the expectations of mechanical skill. Our day of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close. The millions that around us are rushing into life, cannot always be fed on the sere remains of foreign harvests. Events, actions arise, that must be sung, that will sing themselves.<br>

Abstract: Examining Agamben's reception of Hannah Arendt, and especially
         The Human Condition, in his theorization of biopolitics, this essay argues thatHomo Sacer I, by identifying Arendt with a quasi-Straussian “political philosophy,” fails to acknowledge the complexity of her conception of history. Far from simply affirming the normative force of classical political categories, Arendt regards these as emerging from a living power of distinction that thinking, by showing the historical process that brings about the effacement of these distinctions, seeks to bring into view. Nevertheless, Arendt's conception of history is not without contradiction: while arguing that metaphysics went astray by subordinating praxis to poiesis, her very account of history suggests that this subordination is inevitable, since only a “poetic,” indeed violent, act of making a distinction can distinguish praxis from poiesis. Precisely this problem lies at the center of Agamben's early engagement with Arendt inThe Man without Content.<br>
