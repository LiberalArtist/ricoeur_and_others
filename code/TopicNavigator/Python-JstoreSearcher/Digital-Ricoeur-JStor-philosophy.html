  Author(s) Leitão Henrique<br>
  Abstract: The Jesuit Nicolò Partenio Giannettasio (1648–1715) was one of the most intriguing and influential authors of seventeenth-century Naples.¹ Born in 1648, in Parthenope (i.e., Naples), as he used to call his home city, he entered the Jesuit order at the age of sixteen, having lost his family during the plague of 1656. Like other members of the Society of Jesus, Giannettasio was a highly educated man with a wide range of interests: he studied Scholastic philosophy at Palermo, taught mathematics at the Collegio Massimo in Naples for more than ten years, traveled in Egypt,² and designed the Santa Maria<br>

  Abstract: The disruption of their household that the Plunkett family experienced in the years after 1916, and lasting well into the 1920s, inevitably led to some disordering of papers relating to Joseph’s politico-military activities and writings. The distribution of books and papers after his father’s death in 1948 added a further hazard to orderly preservation. It is therefore gratifying that G. N. Plunkett’s archive in the NLI should disclose a small amount of material generated by his eldest son. Mss. 12,009–10 contain two notebooks, the first labeled Philosophy and dating from 1908 to 1909, the second containing literary matter from<br>

  Book Title: Mimetic Theory and World Religions-  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Schenk Richard<br>
  Abstract: Those who anticipated the demise of religion and the advent of a peaceful, secularized global village have seen the last two decades confound their predictions. René Girard's mimetic theory is a key to understanding the new challenges posed by our world of resurgent violence and pluralistic cultures and traditions. Girard sought to explain how the Judeo-Christian narrative exposes a founding murder at the origin of human civilization and demystifies the bloody sacrifices of archaic religions. Meanwhile, his book
      Sacrifice, a reading of conflict and sacrificial resolution in the Vedic Brahmanas, suggests that mimetic theory's insights also resonate with several non-Western religious and spiritual traditions. This volume collects engagements with Girard by scholars of Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism and situates them within contemporary theology, philosophy, and religious studies.<br>

  Author(s) Alison James<br>
  Abstract: After thirty years, as feminist theories in the philosophy of religion, theology, and religious studies approach middle age, on what basis can we reflect on Girard and that feminist critique? Surely, we would most productively move forward were we to home in on aspects of feminist theorizing about religion that have maintained the most saliency. Moreover, feminist theorists of religion would most productively engage Girard in dialogue were they to share with him a sense of urgency about the world that he has conveyed in his most recent works, especially in

  Book Title: Intellectual Sacrifice and Other Mimetic Paradoxes-  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Bubbio Paolo Diego<br>
  Abstract: Intellectual Sacrifice and Other Mimetic Paradoxesis an account of Paolo Diego Bubbio's twenty-year intellectual journey through the twists and turns of Girard's mimetic theory. The author analyzes philosophy and religion as "enemy sisters" engaged in an endless competitive struggle and identifies the intellectual space where this rivalry can either be perpetuated or come to a paradoxical resolution. He goes on to explore topics ranging from arguments for the existence of God to mimetic theory's post-Kantian legacy, political implications, and capacity for identifying epochal phenomena, such as the crisis of the self, in popular culture. Bubbio concludes by advocating for an encounter between mimetic theory and contemporary philosophical hermeneutics-an encounter in which each approach benefits and is enriched by the resources of the other. The volume features a previously unpublished letter by René Girard on the relationship between philosophy and religion.<br>

  Author(s) Ell Theodore<br>
  Abstract: Research work in the humanities in general, and in philosophy in particular, is today looked at with a certain degree of suspicion, for various, and sometimes even opposed, reasons. On one hand, work on subtle epistemological questions and/or historical analysis of the thought of past philosophers is regarded as a navel-gazing activity, otiose at best, wasteful at worst. On the other hand, when philosophy and intellectual analysis come to focus on popular culture phenomena, such as comics, movies, and TV programs, they are regarded as trivializing ideas and as committing themselves to marginal and eventually unimportant work.

  Abstract: This chapter argues that moving beyond realism—to post-realism—requires moving beyond the gender-blindness of conventional accounts.¹ My argument weaves together areas of inquiry that are usually treated in isolation. Intellectual developments associated with the rise of systematic inquiry in ancient Greece—marked by the shift from rhetoric to philosophy and its foundational dichotomies of reason over affect, mind over body—comprise one area of inquiry. Another is the study of historical-political developments—the shift to centralized authority and its dichotomies of public over private, civilized over “other”—within which Western science and political theory “emerged.” A third area of<br>

  Book Title: For René Girard-Essays in Friendship and in Truth<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Williams James G.<br>
  Abstract: In his explorations of the relations between the sacred and violence, René Girard has hit upon the origin of culture-the way culture began, the way it continues to organize itself. The way communities of human beings structure themselves in a manner that is different from that of other species on the planet.Like Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, Émile Durkheim, Martin Buber, or others who have changed the way we think in the humanities or in the human sciences, Girard has put forth a set of ideas that have altered our perceptions of the world in which we function. We will never be able to think the same way again about mimetic desire, about the scapegoat mechanism, and about the role of Jewish and Christian scripture in explaining sacrifice, violence, and the crises from which our culture has been born.The contributions fall into roughly four areas of interpretive work: religion and religious study; literary study; the philosophy of social science; and psychological studies.The essays presented here are offered as "essays" in the older French sense of attempts (essayer) or trials of ideas, as indeed Girard has tried out ideas with us. With a conscious echo of Montaigne, then, this hommage volume is titled

  Abstract: There are several goals in this chapter. One goal is to cover some of the main findings by linking them back to some basic ideas from phenomenology. Another goal is to connect some of what has been uncovered in the previous chapters to the work of others. In the latter part of the chapter some consideration is given to applications in mental health. For example, it is noted that bracketing from phenomenological philosophy finds applications in mental health work, particularly in the study of empathy.

  Book Title: The Red Sea-In Search of Lost Space<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Wick Alexis<br>
  Abstract: The Red Sea has, from time immemorial, been one of the world's most navigated spaces, in the pursuit of trade, pilgrimage and conquest. Yet this multidimensional history remains largely unrevealed by its successive protagonists. Intrigued by the absence of a holistic portrayal of this body of water and inspired by Fernand Braudel's famous work on the Mediterranean, this book brings alive a dynamic Red Sea world across time, revealing the particular features of a unique historical actor. In capturing this heretofore lost space, it also presents a critical, conceptual history of the sea, leading the reader into the heart of Eurocentrism. The Sea, it is shown, is a vital element of the modern philosophy of history.Alexis Wick is not satisfied with this inclusion of the Red Sea into history and attendant critique of Eurocentrism. Contrapuntally, he explores how the world and the sea were imagined differently before imperial European hegemony. Searching for the lost space of Ottoman visions of the sea,
      The Red Seamakes a deeper argument about the discipline of history and the historian's craft.<br>

  Book Title: Alef, Mem, Tau-Kabbalistic Musings on Time, Truth, and Death<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Wolfson Elliot R.<br>
  Abstract: This highly original, provocative, and poetic work explores the nexus of time, truth, and death in the symbolic world of medieval kabbalah. Demonstrating that the historical and theoretical relationship between kabbalah and western philosophy is far more intimate and extensive than any previous scholar has ever suggested, Elliot R. Wolfson draws an extraordinary range of thinkers such as Frederic Jameson, Martin Heidegger, Franz Rosenzweig, William Blake, Julia Kristeva, Friedrich Schelling, and a host of kabbalistic figures into deep conversation with one another.
      Alef, Mem, Taualso discusses Islamic mysticism and Buddhist thought in relation to the Jewish esoteric tradition as it opens the possibility of a temporal triumph of temporality and the conquering of time through time. The framework for Wolfson's examination is the rabbinic teaching that the wordemet,"truth," comprises the first, middle, and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet,alef, mem,andtau,which serve, in turn, as semiotic signposts for the three tenses of time-past, present, and future. By heeding the letters ofemetwe discern the truth of time manifestly concealed in the time of truth, the beginning that cannot begin if it is to be the beginning, the middle that re/marks the place of origin and destiny, and the end that is the figuration of the impossible disclosing the impossibility of figuration, the finitude of death that facilitates the possibility of rebirth. The time of death does not mark the death of time, but time immortal, the moment of truth that bestows on the truth of the moment an endless beginning of a beginningless end, the truth of death encountered incessantly in retracing steps of time yet to be taken-between, before, beyond.<br>

  Book Title: Carnal Thoughts-Embodiment and Moving Image Culture<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Sobchack Vivian<br>
  Abstract: In these innovative essays, Vivian Sobchack considers the key role our bodies play in making sense of today's image-saturated culture. Emphasizing our corporeal rather than our intellectual engagements with film and other media,
      Carnal Thoughtsshows how our experience always emerges through our senses and how our bodies are not just visible objects but also sense-making, visual subjects. Sobchack draws on both phenomenological philosophy and a broad range of popular sources to explore bodily experience in contemporary, moving-image culture. She examines how, through the conflation of cinema and surgery, we've all "had our eyes done"; why we are "moved" by the movies; and the different ways in which we inhabit photographic, cinematic, and electronic space.Carnal Thoughtsprovides a lively and engaging challenge to the mind/body split by demonstrating that the process of "making sense" requires an irreducible collaboration between our thoughts and our senses.<br>

  Book Title: Gadamer’s Repercussions-Reconsidering Philosophical Hermeneutics<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Krajewski Bruce<br>
  Abstract: Certainly one of the key German philosophers of the twentieth century, Hans-Georg Gadamer also influenced the study of literature, art, music, sacred and legal texts, and medicine. Indeed, while much attention has been focused on Gadamer's writings about ancient Greek and modern German philosophy, the relevance of his work for other disciplines is only now beginning to be properly considered and understood. In an effort to address this slant, this volume brings together many prominent scholars to assess, re-evaluate, and question Hans-Georg Gadamer's works, as well as his place in intellectual history. The book includes a recent essay by Gadamer on "the task of hermeneutics," as well as essays by distinguished contributors including Jürgen Habermas, Richard Rorty, Gerald Bruns, Georgia Warnke, and many others. The contributors situate Gadamer's views in surprising ways and show that his writings speak to a range of contemporary debates—from constitutional questions to issues of modern art. A controversial final section attempts to uncover and clarify Gadamer's history in relation to National Socialism. More an investigation and questioning than a celebration of this venerable and profoundly influential philosopher, this collection will become a catalyst for any future rethinking of philosophical hermeneutics, as well as a significant starting place for rereading and reviewing Hans-Georg Gadamer.<br>

In addition to Nietzsche, Zuckert examines four other thinkers—Heidegger, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Leo Strauss, and Jacques Derrida—who share the conviction that Plato must be confronted<br>

  Abstract: With
      Late Godard and the Possibilities of Cinema, Daniel Morgan makes a significant contribution to scholarship on Jean-Luc Godard, especially his films and videos since the late 1980s, some of the most notoriously difficult works in contemporary cinema. Through detailed analyses of extended sequences, technical innovations, and formal experiments, Morgan provides an original interpretation of a series of several internally related films-Soigne ta droite(Keep Your Right Up, 1987),Nouvelle vague(New Wave, 1990), andAllemagne 90 neuf zéro(Germany 90 Nine Zero, 1991)-and the monumental late video work,Histoire(s) du cinéma(1988-1998). Taking up a range of topics, including the role of nature and natural beauty, the relation between history and cinema, and the interactions between film and video, the book provides a distinctive account of the cinematic and intellectual ambitions of Godard's late work. At the same time,Late Godard and the Possibilities of Cinemaprovides a new direction for the fields of film and philosophy by drawing on the idealist and romantic tradition of philosophical aesthetics, which rarely finds an articulation within film studies. In using the tradition of aesthetics to illuminate Godard's late films and videos, Morgan shows that these works transform the basic terms and categories of aesthetics in and for the cinema.<br>

No single treatment can do justice to this multifarious period of human history.

Each of these thinkers—with the exception of Locke—was also a prominent scientist, and this double identity is no accident. To<br>

                  thlesson of hisCourse in Positive Philosophy(1830-1842), introduced the new science as a type of physics, ‘social physics’, patterned on the model of Newtonian physics. For Comte’s contemporary Alexis de Tocqueville, on the other hand, the ‘new science’ belonged to the humanities, in particular to political philosophy, theology, classical studies, rhetoric and history, inspired by<br>

  Book Title: In Defense of Doctrine-Evangelicalism, Theology, and Scripture<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Putman Rhyne R.<br>
  Abstract: Questions surrounding the relationship of Scripture and doctrine are legion within the Protestant tradition. How can doctrine develop over time and maintain fidelity to the sacred text, especially for communities who cling to the Reformation principle of sola scriptura? Does not an appeal to contemporary, constructive theology belie commonly held Protestant and Evangelical convictions about the sufficiency of Scripture? Does admission and acceptance of doctrinal development result in a kind of reality-denying theological relativism? And in what way can a growing, postcanonical tradition maintain a sense of continuity with the faith of the New Testament? This study is an apologetic for the ongoing, constructive theological task in Protestant and Evangelical traditions. It suggests that doctrinal development can be explained as a hermeneutical phenomenon and that insights from hermeneutical philosophy and the philosophy of language can aid theologians in constructing explanatory theses for particular theological problems associated with the facts of doctrinal development, namely, questions related to textual authority, reality depiction, and theological identity.

  Book Title: To Make the Hands Impure: Art, Ethical Adventure, the Difficult and the Holy-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): NEWTON ADAM ZACHARY<br>
  Abstract: How can cradling, handling, or rubbing a text be said, ethically, to have made something happen? What, as readers or interpreters, may come off in our hands in as we maculate or mark the books we read? For Adam Zachary Newton, reading is anembodied practice wherein "ethics" becomes a matter of tact in the doubled sense of touch and regard. With the image of the book lying in the hands of its readers as insistent refrain, To Make the Hands Impure cuts a provocative cross-disciplinary swath through classical Jewish texts, modern Jewish philosophy, film and performance, literature, translation, and the material text. Newton explores the ethics of reading through a range of texts, from the Talmud and Midrash to Conrad's Nostromo and Pascal's Le Memorial, from works by Henry Darger and Martin Scorsese to the National September 11 Memorial and a synagogue in Havana, Cuba. In separate chapters, he conducts masterly treatments of Emmanuel Levinas, Mikhail Bakhtin, and Stanley Cavell by emphasizing their performances as readers a trebled orientation to Talmud, novel, and theater/film. To Make the Hands Impure stages the encounter of literary experience and scriptural traditions he difficult and the holy through an ambitious, singular, and innovative approach marked in equal measure by erudition and imaginative daring.<br>

  Book Title: Ostension-Word Learning and the Embodied Mind<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Engelland Chad<br>
  Abstract: Ostension is bodily movement that manifests our engagement with things, whether we wish it to or not. Gestures, glances, facial expressions: all betray our interest in something. Ostension enables our first word learning, providing infants with a prelinguistic way to grasp the meaning of words. Ostension is philosophically puzzling; it cuts across domains seemingly unbridgeable -- public--private, inner--outer, mind--body. In this book, Chad Engelland offers a philosophical investigation of ostension and its role in word learning by infants. Engelland discusses ostension (distinguishing it from ostensive definition) in contemporary philosophy, examining accounts by Quine, Davidson, and Gadamer, and he explores relevant empirical findings in psychology, evolutionary anthropology, and neuroscience. He offers original studies of four representative historical thinkers whose work enriches the understanding of ostension: Wittgenstein, Merleau-Ponty, Augustine, and Aristotle. And, building on these philosophical and empirical foundations, Engelland offers a meticulous analysis of the philosophical issues raised by ostension. He examines the phenomenological problem of whether embodied intentions are manifest or inferred; the problem of what concept of mind allows ostensive cues to be intersubjectively available; the epistemological problem of how ostensive cues, notoriously ambiguous, can be correctly understood; and the metaphysical problem of the ultimate status of the key terms in his argument: animate movement, language, and mind. Finally, he argues for the centrality of manifestation in philosophy. Taking ostension seriously, he proposes, has far-reaching implications for thinking about language and the practice of philosophy.<br>

Quine acknowledges that the menu of philosophy has become exotic, and only connoisseurs will appreciate its offerings today. But Quine takes umbrage at the suggestion that this specialization should be taken as a shortcoming. It rather constitutes philosophy’s maturation into a scientific discipline.

  Book Title: Aspects of Alterity: Levinas, Marcel, and the Contemporary Debate-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): TREANOR BRIAN<br>
  Abstract: Every other is truly other, but no other is wholly other.This is the claim that Aspects of Alterity defends. Taking up the question of otherness that so fascinates contemporary continental philosophy, this book asks what it means for something or someone to be other than the self. Levinas and those influenced by him point out that the philosophical tradition of the West has generally favored the self at the expense of the other. Such a self-centered perspective never encounters the other qua other, however. In response, postmodern thought insists on the absolute otherness of the other, epitomized by the deconstructive claim every other is wholly other.But absolute otherness generates problems and aporias of its own. This has led some thinkers to reevaluate the notion of relative otherness in light of the postmodern critique, arguing for a chiastic account that does justice to both the alterity and the similitude of the other. These latter two positions-absolute otherness and a rehabilitated account of relative otherness-are the main contenders in the contemporary debate.The philosophies of Emmanuel Levinas and Gabriel Marcel provide the point of embarkation for coming to understand the two positions on this question. Levinas and Marcel were contemporaries whose philosophies exhibit remarkably similar concern for the other but nevertheless remain fundamentally incompatible. Thus, these two thinkers provide a striking illustration of both the proximity of and the unbridgeable gap between two accounts of otherness.Aspects of Alterity delves into this debate, first in order understand the issues at stake in these two positions and second to determine which description better accounts for the experience of encountering the other.After a thorough assessment and critique of otherness in Levinas's and Marcel's work, including a discussion of the relationship of ethical alterity to theological assumptions, Aspects of Alterity traces the transmission and development of these ~<br>

  Abstract: In “Education and Prayer,” Emmanuel Levinas complains that our prayer has too often become a purely isolated and individuated experience and that we have lost the social and collective dimension of prayer.¹ Prayer, he suggests, always has a liturgical and communal function. Prayer requires openness and truth and hence has ethical significance and import. Jean-Luc Marion is profoundly influenced by Levinas’s philosophy. His own account of prayer bears traces of Levinas’s thought and orients itself along Levinasian suggestions regarding relation to the other. Yet Marion’s account of prayer lacks precisely the communal, social, and ethical dimension for which Levinas calls.<br>

  Book Title: Gazing Through a Prism Darkly: Reflections on Merold Westphal's Hermeneutical Epistemology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): PUTT B. KEITH<br>
  Abstract: Merold Westphal has been in the foremost ranks of philosophers who proclaim a new postsecular philosophy. By articulating an epistemology sensitive to the realities of cognitive finitude and moral weakness, he defends a wisdom that begins in both humility and commitment, one that always confesses that human beings can encounter meaning and truth only as human beings, never as gods.The present volume focuses on this wisdom of humility that characterizes Westphal's thought and explores how that wisdom, expressed through the redemptive dynamic of doubt, can contribute to developing a postsecular apologetic for faith.This book can function both as an accessible introduction to Westphal for those who have not read him extensively and also as an informed critical appreciation and extension of his work for those who are more experienced readers.<br>

  Book Title: Questioning the Human: Toward a Theological Anthropology for the Twenty-First Century-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Van Stichel Ellen<br>
  Abstract: Theological anthropology is being put to the test: in the face of contemporary developments in the spheres of culture, politics, and science, traditional perspectives on the human person are no longer adequate. Yet can theological anthropology move beyond its previously established categories and renew itself in relation to contemporary insights? The present collection of essays sets out to answer this question. Uniting Roman Catholic theologians from across the globe, it tackles from a theological perspective challenges related to the classical natural law tradition (part 1), to the modern conception of the subject (part 2), and to the postmodern awareness of diversity in a globalizing context (part 3). Its contributors share a fundamental methodological choice of a critical-constructive dialogue with contemporary culture, science, and philosophy. This collection integrates a wider range of approaches than one usually finds in theological volumes, bringing together experts in systematic theology and in theological ethics. Authors come from different American contexts, including Black and Latino, and from a European context that include both French and German. Moreover, the interdisciplinary insights upon which the different contributions draw stem from both the natural sciences (such as neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and ethology) and the humanities (such as cultural studies, philosophy, and hermeneutics). This volume will be essential reading for anyone seeking a state-of-the-art account of theological anthropology, of the uncertainties it is facing, and of the responses it is in the process of formulating. The shared Roman Catholic background of the authors of this collection makes this volume a helpful complement to recent publications that predominantly represent views from other theological traditions.<br>

  Book Title: Structures of Appearing: Allegory and the Work of Literature-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Machosky Brenda<br>
  Abstract: Taking a phenomenological approach to allegory, Structures of Appearing seeks to revise the history of aesthetics, identifying it as an ideology that has long subjugated art to philosophical criteria of judgment. Rather than being a mere signifying device, allegory is the structure by which something appears that cannot otherwise appear. It thus supports the appearance and necessary experience of philosophical ideas that are otherwise impossible to present or represent. Allegory is as central to philosophy as it is to literature. Following suggestions by Walter Benjamin, Machosky argues that allegory itself must appear allegorically and thus cannot be forced into a logos-centric metaphysical system. She builds on the work of Maurice Blanchot and Emmanuel Levinas to argue that the allegorical image is not a likeness to anything, not a subjective reflection, but an absolute otherness that becomes accessible by virtue of its unique structure. Allegory thus makes possible not merely the textual work of literature but the work that literature is. Machosky develops this insight in readings of Prudentius, Dante, Spenser, Hegel, Goethe, and Kafka.<br>

  Book Title: Language, Eros, Being: Kabbalistic Hermeneutics and Poetic Imagination-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): WOLFSON ELLIOT R.<br>
  Abstract: This long-awaited, magisterial study-an unparalleled blend of philosophy, poetry, and philology-draws on theories of sexuality, phenomenology, comparative religion, philological writings on Kabbalah, Russian formalism, Wittgenstein, Rosenzweig, William Blake, and the very physics of the time-space continuum to establish what will surely be a highwater mark in work on Kabbalah. Not only a study of texts, Language, Eros, Being is perhaps the fullest confrontation of the body in Jewish studies, if not in religious studies as a whole.Elliot R. Wolfson explores the complex gender symbolism that permeates Kabbalistic literature. Focusing on the nexus of asceticism and eroticism, he seeks to define the role of symbolic and poetically charged language in the erotically configured visionary imagination of the medieval Kabbalists. He demonstrates that the traditional Kabbalistic view of gender was a monolithic and androcentric one, in which the feminine was conceived as being derived from the masculine. He does not shrink from the negative implications of this doctrine, but seeks to make an honest acknowledgment of it as the first step toward the redemption of an ancient wisdom.Comparisons with other mystical traditions-including those in Christianity, Buddhism, and Islam-are a remarkable feature throughout the book. They will make it important well beyond Jewish studies, indeed, a must for historians of comparative religion, in particular of comparative mysticism.Praise for Elliot R.

  Book Title: Rethinking God as Gift: Marion, Derrida, and the Limits of Phenomenology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Horner Robyn<br>
  Abstract: Rethinking God as Gift is situated at the intersection of philosophy, critical theory and theology. The first sustained study of the work of Jean-Luc Marion in English, it offers a unique perspective on contemporary questions and their theological relevance. Taking its point of departure from the problem of the gift as articulated by Jacques Derrida, who argues that the conditions of possibility of the gift are also its conditions of impossibility, Horner pursues a series of questions concerning the nature of thought, the viability of phenomenology, and, most urgently, the possibility of grace. For Marion, phenomenology, as the thought of the given, offers a path for philosophy to proceed without being implicated in metaphysics. His retrieval of several important insights of Edmund Husserl, along with his reading of Martin Heidegger and Emmanuel Lvinas, enables him to work out a phenomenology where even impossiblephenomena such as revelation and the gift might be examined. In this important confrontation between Marion and Derrida issues vital to the negotiation of postmodern concerns in philosophy and theology emerge with vigour. The careful elucidation of those issues in an interdisciplinary context, and the snapshot it provides of the state of contemporary debate, make Rethinking God as Gift an important contribution to theological and philosophical discussion.<br>

  Book Title: Crossover Queries: Dwelling with Negatives, Embodying Philosophy's Others-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): WYSCHOGROD EDITH<br>
  Abstract: Exploring the risks, ambiguities, and unstable conceptual worlds of contemporary thought, Crossover Queries brings together the wide-ranging writings, across twenty years, of one of our most important philosophers.Ranging from twentieth-century European philosophy-the thought of Heidegger, Foucault, Derrida, Levinas, Janicaud, and others-to novels and artworks, music and dance, from traditional Jewish thought to Jain andBuddhist metaphysics, Wyschogrod's work opens radically new vistas while remaining mindful that the philosopher stands within and is responsible to a philosophical legacy conditioned by the negative.Rather than point to a Hegelian dialectic of overcoming negation or to a postmetaphysical exhaustion, Wyschogrod treats negative moments as opening novel spaces for thought. She probes both the desire for God and an ethics grounded in the interests of the other person, seeing these as moments both of crossing over and of negation. Alert to the catastrophes that have marked our times, she exposes the underlying logical structures of nihilatory forces that have been exerted to exterminate whole peoples. Analyzing the negationsof biological research and cultural images of mechanized and robotic bodies, she shows how they contest the body as lived in ordinary experience.Crossover Queries brings together important essays on a remarkable range of topics by one of our most insightful cultural critics. Commenting on philosophical and theological issues that have shaped the recent past as well as scientific and technological questions that will preoccupy us in the near future, Wyschogrod consistently alerts us to the urgency of problems whose importance few recognize.

  Abstract: Two objections arise repeatedly in connection with Emmanuel Levinas’s philosophy of language. First, it is argued, in the spirit of Jürgen Habermas and K. O. Apel, for whom ethics is grounded in discursive reason, that for Levinas ethics is an unmediated relation to the other and, as such, transcends linguistic and conceptual structure. Ethics is not a matter of moral argument but of solicitation by the other, who by virtue of sheer otherness resists violence. Levinas’s access routes to the other are nonlinguistic: they include the human face, an idea of the infinite that exceeds any description of it, and<br>

  Book Title: Interstices of the Sublime: Theology and Psychoanalytic Theory-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Interstices of the Sublime represents a powerful theological engagement with psychoanalytic theory in Freud, Lacan, Kristeva and Zizek, as well as major expressions of contemporary Continental philosophy, including Deleuze, Derrida, Marion, and Badiou. Through creative and constructive psycho-theological readings of topics such as sublimation, schizophrenia, God, and creation ex nihilo, this book contributes to a new form of radical theological thinking that is deeply involved in the world. Here the idea of the Kantian sublime is read into Freud and Lacan, and compared with sublimation. The sublime refers to a conflict of the Kantian faculties of reason and imagination, and involves the attempt to represent what is intrinsically unrepresentable. Sublimation, by contrast, involves the expression and partial satisfaction of primal desires in culturally acceptable terms. The sublime is negatively expressed in sublimation, because it is both the sourceof sublimation as well as that which resists being sublimated. That is, the Freudian sublime is related to the process of sublimation, but it also distorts or disrupts sublimation, and invokes what Lacan calls the Real. The effects of the sublime are not just psychoanalytic but, importantly, theological, because the sublime is the main form that Godtakes in the modern world. A radical postmodern theology attends to the workings of the sublime in our thinking and living, and provides resources to understand the complexity of reality. This book is one of the first sustained theological readings of Lacan in English.<br>

  Abstract: The problem of thinking is a problem of sublimation. To have language, meaning, and thereby religion, science, culture, and art, there must be sublimation in a broad sense. This book has traced some of the intricacies of sublimation through psychoanalytic theory as it impresses upon theology. Sublimation means that meaning is not direct and unmediated but consists of a detour. At the same time, my readings of theology, continental philosophy, and psychoanalytic theory suggest that sublimation is not an elevation above a material reality. In chapter 1, I appealed to Deleuze to question the two-level model of reality that sublimation<br>

  Book Title: Saintly Influence: Edith Wyschogrod and the Possibilities of Philosophy of Religion-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): KAVKA MARTIN<br>
  Abstract: Since the publication of her first book, Emmanuel Levinas: The Problem of Ethical Metaphysics, in 1974-the first book about Levinas published in English-Edith Wyschogrod has been at the forefront of the fields of Continental philosophy and philosophy of religion. Her work has crossed many disciplinary boundaries, making peregrinations from phenomenology and moral philosophy to historiography, the history of religions (both Western and non-Western), aesthetics, and the philosophy of biology. In all of these discourses, she has sought to cultivate an awareness of how the self is situated and influenced, as well as the ways in which a self can influence others.In this volume, twelve scholars examine and display the influence of Wyschogrod's work in essays that take up the thematics of influence in a variety of contexts: Christian theology, the saintly behavior of the villagers of Le Chambon sur Lignon, the texts of the medieval Jewish mystic Abraham Abulafia, the philosophies of Levinas, Derrida, and Benjamin, the practice of intellectual history, the cultural memory of the New Testament, and pedagogy.In response, Wyschogrod shows how her interlocutors have brought to light her multiple authorial personae and have thus marked the ambiguity of selfhood, its position at the nexus of being influenced by and influencing others.<br>

  Abstract: Three interrelated features may be said to characterize the work of Edith Wyschogrod. There is first an interdisciplinary drive to rise above institutionally sanctioned boundaries and to retrieve intellectual categories from their disciplinary captivity so as to reconfigure them in novel contexts. It is this desire and the ability to bring widely differing genres, discourses and traditionally separate intellectual orbits into productive coalitions that have increasingly distinguished her writings. This linking of philosophy and theology, psychoanalysis and science, literary criticism and linguistics, architecture and the arts, media studies and above all, ethics, is carried off with a high degree of<br>

  Author(s) KELLER CATHERINE<br>
  Abstract: What does theology have to say about the place of eroticism in the salvific transformation of human subjects, even of the cosmos itself? How, in turn, does eros infuse theological practice and transfigure doctrinal tropes? Veering off the well-worn path of sexual moralizing, this volume explores what is still largely uncharted territory in the realm of theological erotics even as it also deliberately disrupts the disciplinary boundaries of theology. Indeed, it invites and performs a mutual seduction of disciplines—theology, philosophy, scripture, history—at multiple sites charged by desires at once bodily, spiritual, intellectual, and political. It seeks new openings<br>

  Book Title: Postmodern Apologetics?: Arguments for God in Contemporary Philosophy-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: This book provides an introduction to the emerging field of continental philosophy of religion by treating the thought of its most important representatives, including its appropriations by several thinkers in the United States. Part I provides context by examining religious aspects of the thought of Martin Heidegger, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jacques Derrida. Christina Gschwandtner contends that, although the work of these thinkers is not apologetic in nature (i.e., it does not provide an argument for religion, whether Christianity or Judaism), it prepares the ground for the more religiously motivated work of more recent thinkers by giving religious language and ideas some legitimacy in philosophical discussions. Part II devotes a chapter to each of the contemporary French thinkers who articulate a phenomenology of religious experience: Paul Ricoeur, Jean-Luc Marion, Michel Henry, Jean-Louis Chretien, and Jean-Yves Lacoste. In it, the author argues that their respective philosophies can be read as an apologetics of sorts-namely, as arguments for the coherence of thought about God and the viability of religious experience-though each thinker does so in a different fashion and to a different degree. Part III considers the three major thinkers who have popularized and extended this phenomenology in the U.S. context: John D. Caputo, Merold Westphal, and Richard Kearney. The book thus both provides an introduction to important contemporary thinkers, many of whom have not yet received much treatment in English, and also argues that their philosophies can be read as providing an argument for Christian faith.<br>

  Book Title: Finding God in All Things: Celebrating Bernard Lonergan, John Courtney Murray, and Karl Rahner-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stagaman David<br>
  Abstract: Three of the most influential Catholic theologians of the twentieth century-Bernard Lonergan, John Courtney Murray, and Karl Rahner-were all born in 1904, at the height of the Church's most militant rhetoric against all things modern. In this culture of suspicion, Lonergan, Murray, and Rahner grew in faith to join the Society of Jesus and struggled with the burden of antimodernist policies in their formation. By the time of their mature work in the 1950s and 1960s, they had helped to redefine the critical dialogue between modern thought and contemporary Catholic theology. After the dtente of the Second Vatican Council, they brought Catholic tradition into closer relationship to modern philosophy, history, and politics. Written by leading scholars, friends, and family members, these original essays celebrate the legacies of Lonergan, Murray, and Rahner after a century of theological development. Offering a broad range of perspectives on their lives and works, the essays blend personal and anecdotal accounts with incisive critical appraisals. Together, they offer an accessible introduction to the distinctive character of three great thinkers and how their work shapes the way Catholics think and talk about God, Church, and State.<br>

  Book Title: Debates in Continental Philosophy: Conversations with Contemporary Thinkers-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): KEARNEY RICHARD<br>
  Abstract: This important book brings together in one volume a collection of illuminating encounters with some of the most important philosophers of our age-by one of its most incisive and innovative critics.For more than twenty years, Richard Kearney has been in conversation with leading philosophers, literary theorists, anthropologists, and religious scholars. His gift is eliciting memorably clear statements about their work from thinkers whose writings can often be challenging in their complexity. Here, he brings together twenty-one originally published extraordinary conversations-his 1984 collection Dialogues: The Phenomenological Heritage, his 1992 Visions of Europe: Conversations on the Legacy and Future of Europe, and his 1995 States of Mind: Dialogues with Contemporary Thinkers. Featured interviewees include Stanislas Breton, Umberto Eco, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Herbert Marcus, George Steiner, Julia Kristeva, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jean-Fran?ois Lyotard. To this classic core, he adds recent interviews, previously unpublished, with Paul Ricoeur, Jean-Luc Marion, Jacques Derrida, and George DumZzil, as well as six colloquies about his own work.Wide-ranging and accessible, these interviews provide a fascinating guide to the ideas, concerns, and personalities of thinkers who have shaped modern intellec-tual life. This book will be an essential point of entry for students, teachers, scholars, and anyone seeking to understand contemporary culture.ContentsPrefacePart One: Recent DebatesJacques Derrida: Terror, Religion, and the New PoliticsJean-Luc Marion: The Hermeneutics of RevelationPaul Ricour: (a) On Life Stories (b) On The Crisis of Authority (c) The Power of the Possible (d) Imagination, Testimony, and TrustGeorges Dumzil: Myth, Ideology, SovereigntyPart Two: From Dialogues: The Phenomenological Heritage, 1984Emmanuel Levinas: Ethics of the InfiniteHerbert Marcuse: The Philosophy of Art and PoliticsPaul Ricour: (a) The Creativity of Language (b) Myth as the Bearer of Possib~<br>

  Book Title: The Experience of God: A Postmodern Response-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: The book provides a series of approaches to the ancient question of whether and how God is a matter of experience,or, alternately, to what extent the notion of experience can be true to itself if it does not include God. On the one hand, it seems impossible to experience God: the deity does not offer Himself to sense experience. On the other hand, there have been mystics who have claimed to have encountered God. The essays in this collection seek to explore the topic again, drawing insights from phenomenology, theology, literature, and feminism. Throughout, this stimulating collection maintains a strong connection with concrete rather than abstract approaches to God.The contributors: Michael F. Andrews, Jeffrey Bloechl, John D.

  Book Title: Political Theologies: Public Religions in a Post-Secular World-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SULLIVAN LAWRENCE E.<br>
  Abstract: What has happened to religion in its present manifestations? In recent years, Enlightenment secularization, as it appeared in the global spread of political structures that relegate the sacred to a private sphere, seems suddenly to have foundered. Unexpectedly, it has discovered its own parochialism-has discovered, indeed, that secularization may never have taken place at all.With the return of the religious,in all aspects of contemporary social, political, and religious life, the question of political theology-of the relation between politicaland religiousdomains-takes on new meaning and new urgency. In this groundbreaking book, distinguished scholars from many disciplines-philosophy, political theory, anthropology, classics, and religious studies-seek to take the full measure of this question in today's world. This book begins with the place of the gods in the Greek polis, then moves through Augustine's two cities and early modern religious debates, to classic statements about political theology by such thinkers as Walter Benjamin and Carl Schmitt. Essays also consider the centrality of tolerance to liberal democracy, the recent French controversy over wearing the Muslim headscarf, and Bush's God talk.The volume includes a historic discussion between Jrgen Habermas and Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI, concerningthe prepolitical moral foundations of a republic, and it concludes with explorations of new, more open ways of conceptualizing society.<br>

  Book Title: Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness traces the reflections of the French philosopher and musicologist Vladimir Jankelevitch on the conditions and temporality of forgiveness in relation to creation, history, and memory. The author demonstrates the influence of Jewish and Christian thought on Jankelevitch's philosophy and compares his ideas about the gift character of forgiveness, the role of retributive emotions in conceptions of justice, and the limits of reason with those of Aristotle, Butler, Kant, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Scheler, Arendt, Derrida, Levinas, and Ricoeur. The Shoah was the pivotal historical event in Jankelevitch's life. As this book shows, Jankelevitch's question "Is forgiveness possible as a response to evil?" remains a potent philosophical conundrum today. Paradoxically, for Jankelevitch, evil is both the impetus and the obstacle to forgiveness.<br>

  Book Title: Technologies of Life and Death: From Cloning to Capital Punishment-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Oliver Kelly<br>
  Abstract: The central aim of this book is to approach contemporary problems raised by technologies of life and death as ethical issues that call for a more nuanced approach than mainstream philosophy can provide. To do so, it draws on the recently published seminars of Jacques Derrida to analyze the extremes of birth and dying insofar as they are mediated by technologies of life and death. With an eye to reproductive technologies, it shows how a deconstructive approach can change the very terms of contemporary debates over technologies of life and death, from cloning to surrogate motherhood to capital punishment, particularly insofar as most current discussions assume some notion of a liberal individual. The ethical stakes in these debates are never far from political concerns such as enfranchisement, citizenship, oppression, racism, sexism, and the public policies that normalize them. Technologies of Life and Death thus provides pointers for rethinking dominant philosophical and popular assumptions about nature and nurture, chance and necessity, masculine and feminine, human and animal, and what it means to be a mother or a father. In part, the book seeks to disarticulate a tension between ethics and politics that runs through these issues in order to suggest a more ethical politics by turning the force of sovereign violence back against itself. In the end, it proposes that deconstructive ethics with a psychoanalytic supplement can provide a corrective for moral codes and political cliches that turn us into mere answering machines.<br>

  Book Title: Reading Descartes Otherwise: Blind, Mad, Dreamy, and Bad-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Lee Kyoo<br>
  Abstract: Focusing on the first four images of the Other mobilized in Descartes' Meditations--namely, the blind, the mad, the dreamy, and the bad--Reading Descartes Otherwise casts light on what have heretofore been the phenomenological shadows of "Cartesian rationality." In doing so, it discovers dynamic signs of spectral alterity lodged both at the core and on the edges of modern Cartesian subjectivity. Calling for a Copernican reorientation of the very notion "Cartesianism," the book's series of close, creatively critical readings of Descartes' signature images brings the dramatic forces, moments, and scenes of the cogito into our own contemporary moment. The author patiently unravels the knotted skeins of ambiguity that have been spun within philosophical modernity out of such cliches as "Descartes, the abstract modern subject" and "Descartes, the father of modern philosophy"--a figure who is at once everywhere and nowhere. In the process, she revitalizes and reframes the legacy of Cartesian modernity, in a way more mindful of its proto-phenomenological traces.<br>

  Book Title: Thinking Through the Imagination: Aesthetics in Human Cognition-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Jones Jude<br>
  Abstract: Use your imagination! The demand is as important as it is confusing. What is the imagination? What is its value? Where does it come from? And where is it going in a time when even the obscene seems overdone and passe? This book takes up these questions and argues for the centrality of imagination in human cognition. It traces the development of the imagination in Kant's critical philosophy (particularly the Critique of Aesthetic Judgment) and claims that the insights of Kantian aesthetic theory, especially concerning the nature of creativity, common sense, and genius, influenced the development of nineteenth-century American philosophy. The book identifies the central role of the imagination in the philosophy of Peirce, a role often overlooked in analytic treatments of his thought. The final chapters pursue the observation made by Kant and Peirce that imaginative genius is a type of natural gift (ingenium) and must in some way be continuous with the creative force of nature. It makes this final turn by way of contemporary studies of metaphor, embodied cognition, and cognitive neuroscience.<br>

  Abstract: The imagination is notoriously difficult to define.¹ Indeed, this difficulty may explain the fact that prior to the Enlightenment there was no attempt to develop a unified theory of the imagination. In the history of ancient Greek philosophy, its amorphous character contributed to its being treated in two distinct, albeit related, ways. On the one hand, imagination was defined in terms of inspired artistic expression, outside the realm of explanation and description. On the other, it was described as a mysterious mental faculty that somehow accomplished the impossible, bridging the divide between the world of sensation and the world of<br>

  Book Title: The Human Eros: Eco-ontology and the Aesthetics of Existence-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): ALEXANDER THOMAS M.<br>
  Abstract: The Human Eros: Eco-ontology and the Aesthetics of Existence explores themes in classical American philosophy, primarily that of John Dewey, but also in the thought of Ralph Waldo Emerson, George Santayana, and Native American traditions. The primary claim is that human beings exist with a need for the experience of meaning and value, a "Human Eros." Our various cultures are symbolic environments or "spiritual ecologies" within which the Human Eros can thrive. This is how we inhabit the earth. Encircling and sustaining our cultural existence is nature. Western philosophy has not generally provided adequate conceptual models for thinking ecologically. Thus the idea of "eco-ontology" undertakes to explore ways in which this might be done beginning with the primacy of Nature over Being, but also including the recognition of possibility and potentiality as inherent aspects of existence. I argue for the centrality of Dewey for an effective ecological philosophy. Both "pragmatism" and "naturalism" need to be contextualized within an emergentist, relational, non-reductive view of nature and an aesthetic, imaginative, non-reductive view of intelligence.<br>

  Book Title: Malicious Objects, Anger Management, and the Question of Modern Literature-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kreienbrock Jörg<br>
  Abstract: Why do humans get angry with objects? Why is it that a malfunctioning computer, a broken tool, or a fallen glass causes an outbreak of fury? How is it possible to speak of an inanimate object's recalcitrance, obstinacy, or even malice? When things assume a will of their own and seem to act out against human desires and wishes rather than disappear into automatic, unconscious functionality, the breakdown is experienced not as something neutral but affectively--as rage or as outbursts of laughter. Such emotions are always psychosocial: public, rhetorically performed, and therefore irreducible to a "private" feeling. By investigating the minutest details of life among dysfunctional household items through the discourses of philosophy and science, as well as in literary works by Laurence Sterne, Jean Paul, Friedrich Theodor Vischer, and Heimito von Doderer, Kreienbrock reconsiders the modern bourgeois poetics that render things the way we know and suffer them.<br>

  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Hershock Peter D.<br>
  Abstract: Especially in the aftermath of what is now being called the Great Recession, awareness has mounted of the imperative to question the modern divorce of economics from ethics. While the domains of economics and ethics were from antiquity through at least the eighteenth century understood in many cultures to be coterminous and mutually entailing, the modern assumption has been that the goal of maximizing human prosperity and the aim of justly enhancing our lives as persons and as communities were functionally and practically distinct. Working from a wide array of perspectives, the contributors to this volume offer a set of challenges to the assumed independence of the quantitative and qualitative dimensions of human and planetary well-being. Reflecting on the complex interrelationship among economics, justice, and equity, the book resists "one size fits all" approaches and struggles to revitalize the marriage of economics and ethics by activating cultural differences as the basis of mutual contribution to shared human flourishing. The publication of this important collection will stimulate or extend critical debates among scholars and students working in a number of disciplines in the social sciences and humanities, including philosophy, history, environmental studies, economics, and law.<br>

  Book Title: Muscially Sublime: Indeterminacy, Infinity, Irresolvability-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wurth Kiene Brillenburg<br>
  Abstract: Musically Sublime rewrites musically the history and philosophy of the sublime. Music enables us to reconsider the traditional course of sublime feeling on a track from pain to pleasure. Resisting the notion that there is a single format for sublime feeling, Wurth shows how, from the mid eighteenth century onward, sublime feeling is, instead, constantly rearticulated in a complex interaction with musicality. Wurth takes as her point of departure Immanuel Kant's Critique of Judgment and Jean-Francois Lyotard's aesthetic writings of the 1980s and 1990s. Kant framed the sublime narratively as an epic of self-transcendence. By contrast, Lyotard sought to substitute open immanence for Kantian transcendence, yet he failed to deconstruct the Kantian epic. The book performs this deconstruction by juxtaposing eighteenth- and nineteenth-century conceptions of the infinite, Sehnsucht, the divided self, and unconscious drives with contemporary readings of instrumental music. Critically assessing Edmund Burke, James Usher, E.T.A. Hoffmann, Novalis, Friedrich Holderlin, Arthur Schopenhauer, Richard Wagner, and Friedrich Nietzsche, this book re-presents the sublime as a feeling that defers resolution and hangs suspended between pain and pleasure. Musically Sublime rewrites the mathematical sublime as differance, while it redresses the dynamical sublime as trauma: unending, undetermined, unresolved. Whereas most musicological studies in this area have focused on traces of the Kantian sublime in Handel, Haydn, and Beethoven, this book calls on the nineteenth-century theorist Arthur Seidl to analyze the sublime of, rather than in, music. It does so by invoking Seidl's concept of formwidrigkeit ("form-contrariness") in juxtaposition with Romantic piano music, (post)modernist musical minimalisms, and Lyotard's postmodern sublime. It presents a sublime of matter, rather than form-performative rather than representational. In doing so, Musically Sublime shows that the binary distinction ~<br>

  Book Title: Intention Interpretation-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): ISEMINGER GARY<br>
  Abstract: "...an excellent and comprehensive discussion of a debate that was initiated in this century in William Wimsatt's and Monroe C. Beardsley's influential article 'The Intentional Fallacy.'...this is a splendidly conceived and very useful collection of essays. Readers will want to take issue with the arguments of individual authors, but this is to be expected in a volume at the cutting edge of a fertile philosophical controversy." --David Novitz, The Philosophical Quarterly "What is the connection, if any, between the author's intentions in (while) writing a work of literature and the truth (acceptability, validity) of interpretive statements about it?" With this question, Gary Isminger introduces a literary debate that has been waged for the past four decades and is addressed by philosophers and literary theorists in Intention and Interpretation. Thirteen essays discuss the role of appeals to the author's intention in interpreting works of literature. A well-known argument by E.D. Hirsch serves as the basic text, in which he defends the appeal to the author's intention against Wimsatt and Beardsley's claim that such an appeal involved "the intentional fallacy." The essays, mostly commissioned by the editor, explore the presuppositions and consequences of arguing for the importance of the author's intentions in the way Hirsch does. Connections emerge between this issue and many fundamental issues in metaphysics and the philosophy of mind as well as in aesthetics. The (old) "New Criticism" and current Post-Structuralism tend to agree in disenfranchising the author, and many people now are disinclined even to consider the alternative. Hirsch demurs, and arguments like his deserve the careful attention, both from critics and sympathizers, that they receive here. Literary scholars and philosophers who are sympathetic to Continental as well as to Anglo-American styles of philosophy are among the contributors.

  Book Title: The Roots Of Thinking-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): Sheets-Johnstone Maxine<br>
  Abstract: "A significant contribution to the study of early humans, this book is a philosophical anthropology.... it makes genuinely novel, and highly persuasive, claims within the field itself." --David Depew In this ground-breaking interdisciplinary study about conceptual origins, Maxine Sheets-Johnstone shows that there is an indissoluble bond between hominid thinking and hominid evolution, a bond cemented by the living body. Her thesis is concretely illustrated in eight paleoanthropological case studies ranging from tool-using/tool-making to counting, sexuality, representation, language, death, and cave art. In each case, evidence is brought forward that shows how thinking is modeled on the body-specifically, how concepts are generated by animate form and the tactile-kinesthetic experience. Later chapters critically examine key theoretical and methodological issues posed by the thesis, Sheets-Johnstone demonstrates in detail how and why a corporeal turn in philosophy and the human sciences can yield insights no less extraordinary than those produced by the linguistic turn. In confronting the currently popular doctrine of cultural relativism and the classic Western metaphysical dualism of mind and body, she shows how pan-cultural invariants of human bodily life have been discounted and how the body itself has not been given its due. By a precise exposition of how a full-scale hermeneutics and a genetic phenomenology may be carried out with respect to conceptual origins, she shows how methodological issues are successfully resolved. "Ranging across the humanities and sciences, this thoroughly original book challenges both traditional metaphysics and contemporary cultural relativism. In their place, it persuasively develops a phenomenonological, tactile-kinesthetic account of the origins of thinking. This philosophical anthropology could not be more timely. It replaces the 'linguistic turn' with a promising new 'corporeal turn.'" --John J. Stuhr, University of Oregon "This w~<br>

  Author(s) Ormerod Neil<br>
  Abstract: This chapter discusses theological foundations for knowledge of God. Our approach emphasizes the conversion of the theologian and builds on previous chapters by illustrating how a theologian’s fourfold conversion determines the horizon within which discourse about God becomes meaningful. The chapter begins by identifying the main lines or themes of several major conversations about knowledge of God in the history of philosophy and theology. In this way, the reader may gain a sense of how our discussion of foundations allows us to revisit classic themes or questions about God.<br>

  Abstract: Since the beginning of the 1990s there has been a marked revival of interest in both Kant and aesthetics.¹ This revival has been accompanied with a move beyond the theoretical positions that sought to displace the notion of aesthetics and often requires a rethinking of the relationship between criticism and philosophy. I wish to present here an account of Kant’s ‘invention’ of aesthetics that allows its terms to become both operative within and yet also transformed by the practice of critical engagement with literary and visual works of art.

  Book Title: The subject of love-Hélène Cixous and the feminine divine<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Renshaw Sal<br>
  Abstract: *The Subject of Love: Hélène Cixous and the Feminine Divine* is about abundant, generous, other-regarding love. In the history of Western ideas of love, such a configuration has been inseparable from our ideas about divinity and the sacred; often reserved only for God; and rarely thought of as a human achievement. This book is a substantial engagement with her philosophies of love, inviting the reader to reflect on the conditions of subjectivity that just might open us to something like a divine love of the other. Renshaw follows this thread in this genealogy of abundant love: the thread that connects the subject of love from 5th century B.C.E. Greece and Plato, to the 20th century protestant theology of agapic love of Anders Nygren, to the late 20th century poetico-philosophy of Hélène Cixous. This study will be of particular interest to academics and students of the history of gender, cultural studies, criticism and gender studies<br>

  Abstract: New, completely revised and re-written edition. Offers a detailed, but asccesible account of the vital German philosophical tradition of thinking about art and the self. Looks at recent historical research and contemporary arguments in philosophy and theory in the humanities, following the path of German philosophy from Kant, via Ficthe and Holderlin, the early Romantis, Schelling, Hegel, Scleimacher, to Nietzsche. Develops the approaches to subjectivity, aesthetics, music and language in relation to new theoretical developments bridging the divide between the continental and analytical traditions of philosophy. The huge growth of interest in German philosophy as a resource for re-thinking both literary and cultural theory, and contemporary philosophy will make this an indispensible read.<br>

  Abstract: The alternatives in some of the most controversial debates in recent philosophy often come down to whether what is at issue is in essence a Hegelian, or a Nietzschean position. The differences between Habermas and Rorty, or between the early Derrida and Davidson, for example, can be seen in these terms. These figures are all what Habermas would call ‘post metaphysical’ thinkers. However, despite their renunciation of the idea of a foundational ‘first philosophy’, Habermas and Davidson wish to sustain a universalist conception of rationality; Rorty and Derrida, in contrast, think that such a conception is a residue of a<br>

We’re a pragmatic people; we’re practical people; we’re concerned about how to do things and how to act. In fact, pragmatism as a philosophy argues that theorizing follows action. Whereas classical Western wisdom stresses the thinking first and only thereupon the action that follows, Americans are very strong on action, and when it comes to defining religion, we tend to divide religions according to how they influence people’s behavior.

  Abstract: The publication of the Vatican II document on Divine Revelation (Dei Verbum) was an exciting and challenging moment for the Church. While honouring the tradition, it also marked a quite dramatic development in the Church’s attitude to modern critical analysis of the Bible and encouraged study and reflection on it by all members of the Church. The golden jubilee of its publication is a timely moment for a book such as this. It contains essays on various aspects of Dei Verbum by authors from around the world. They write from the perspective of their respective disciplines of biblical studies, patristics, theology, liturgy, philosophy, and communications media. They situate the document within the Jewish-Christian tradition, assess its reception since Vatican II, and its implications for the future.<br>

  Book Title: Redemptive Hope: From the Age of Enlightenment to the Age of Obama-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Campbell Timothy C.<br>
  Abstract: This is a book about the need for redemptive narratives to ward off despair and the dangers these same narratives create by raising expectations that are seldom fulfilled. The quasi-messianic expectations produced by the election of President Barack Obama in 2008, and their diminution, were stark reminders of an ongoing struggle between ideals and political realities. Redemptive Hope begins by tracing the tension between theistic thinkers, for whom hope is transcendental, and intellectuals, who have striven to link hopes for redemption to our intersubjective interactions with other human beings. Lerner argues that a vibrant democracy must draw on the best of both religious thought and secular liberal political philosophy. By bringing Richard Rorty's pragmatism into conversation with early-twentieth-century Jewish thinkers, including Martin Buber and Ernst Bloch, Lerner begins the work of building bridges, while insisting on holding crucial differences in dialectical tension. Only such a dialogue, he argues, can prepare the foundations for modes of redemptive thought fit for the twenty-first century.<br>

They look at the ways concepts such as liberation, sovereignty, and post-colonialism have engaged this new generation with political theology and the new pathways of thought that have opened in the wake of speculative realism and recent findings in neuroscience and evolutionary psychology.

  Abstract: The philosophical work of Jean-Luc Marion has opened new ways of speaking about religious convictions and experiences. In this exploration of Marion's philosophy and theology, Christina M. Gschwandtner presents a comprehensive and critical analysis of the ideas of saturated phenomena and the phenomenology of givenness. She claims that these phenomena do not always appear in the excessive mode that Marion describes and suggests instead that we consider degrees of saturation. Gschwandtner covers major themes in Marion's work-the historical event, art, nature, love, gift and sacrifice, prayer, and the Eucharist. She works within the phenomenology of givenness, but suggests that Marion himself has not considered important aspects of his philosophy.<br>

Kierkegaard and Death brings together new work on Kierkegaard's multifaceted discussions of death and provides a thorough guide to the development, in various texts and contexts, of Kierkegaard's ideas concerning death. Essays by an international group of scholars take up essential topics such as dying to the world, living death, immortality, suicide, mortality and subjectivity, death and the meaning of life, remembrance of the dead, and the question of the afterlife. While bringing Kierkegaard's philosophy of death into focus, this volume connects Kierkegaard with important debates in contemporary philosophy.<br>

Within philosophy, phenomenology is as diverse as its practitioners. Indeed, Moran (2000: 3) in an introduction to philosophical traditions of phenomenology finds it important to warn readers not to overstate the degree to which phenomenology “coheres into an agreed method, or accepts one theoretical outlook, or one set of philosophical theses about consciousness, knowledge, and the world.” Some of this diversity continues to be a feature of anthropological uses of phenomenology, as we show here.

If such an undertaking might be deemed risky, it is because of Cavell’s own repeated resistance toward certain Christian depictions of the human state as helpless, fixed, awaiting supernatural aid, pursuing untimely theologizing, and the like. This resistance has been emphasized by his commentators and has often been taken as Cavell’s prevalent attitude.

  Abstract: Hans-Georg Gadamer (1900-2002), one of the towering figures of contemporary Continental philosophy, is best known for Truth and Method, where he elaborated the concept of "philosophical hermeneutics," a programmatic way to get to what we do when we engage in interpretation. Donatella Di Cesare highlights the central place of Greek philosophy, particularly Plato, in Gadamer's work, brings out differences between his thought and that of Heidegger, and connects him with discussions and debates in pragmatism. This is a sensitive and thoroughly readable philosophical portrait of one of the 20th century's most powerful thinkers.<br>

Gadamer’s work found great resonance, insofar as it was soon recognized as one of the most significant contributions to twentieth-century philosophy, which is evinced by the numerous reviews from the 1960s onward.¹ The widespread enthusiasm with which it was received in Europe, as well as in North America, gives a sense of its potential, which extends far beyond the horizon of philosophy.<br>

  Book Title: Nietzsche and Phenomenology-Power, Life, Subjectivity<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Daigle Christine<br>
  Abstract: What are the challenges that Nietzsche's philosophy poses for contemporary phenomenology? Elodie Boublil, Christine Daigle, and an international group of scholars take Nietzsche in new directions and shed light on the sources of phenomenological method in Nietzsche, echoes and influences of Nietzsche within modern phenomenology, and connections between Nietzsche, phenomenology, and ethics. Nietzsche and Phenomenology offers a historical and systematic reconsideration of the scope of Nietzsche's thought.<br>

  Abstract: If we take phenomenology in a general sense to be concerned with “appearance,” Nietzsche’s philosophy offers a wealth of pertinent material. Yet the meaning of appearance in Nietzsche’s texts is not always easy to fathom. In this chapter I want to explore a “phenomenology of values” by coordinating Nietzsche’s complex approach to appearance with his critique of morality.¹<br>

  Book Title: Philosophy, Feminism, and Faith-  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): BOWER MARYA<br>
  Abstract: How can the seemingly separate lives of philosopher, feminist, and follower of a religious tradition come together in one person's life? How does religious commitment affect philosophy or feminism? How does feminism play out in religious or philosophical commitment? Wrestling with answers to these questions, women who balance philosophy, feminism, and faith write about their lives. The voices gathered here from several different traditions-Catholic, Protestant, Quaker, Jewish, and Muslim-represent diverse ethnicities, races, and ages. The challenging and poignant reflections in Philosophy, Feminism, and Faith show how critical thought can successfully mesh with religious faith and social responsibility.<br>

  Book Title: Material Feminisms-  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hekman Susan<br>
  Abstract: Harnessing the energy of provocative theories generated by recent understandings of the human body, the natural world, and the material world, Material Feminisms presents an entirely new way for feminists to conceive of the question of materiality. In lively and timely essays, an international group of feminist thinkers challenges the assumptions and norms that have previously defined studies about the body. These wide-ranging essays grapple with topics such as the material reality of race, the significance of sexual difference, the impact of disability experience, and the complex interaction between nature and culture in traumatic events such as Hurricane Katrina. By insisting on the importance of materiality, this volume breaks new ground in philosophy, feminist theory, cultural studies, science studies, and other fields where the body and nature collide.<br>

Whether this aspiration is itself justifiable, however, is another question. Can religious faith be grasped and grounded, so that its content is justified by the necessity of the philosophical concept? Does religious faith have its telos in philosophical consummation? Or does there remain some residual opacity that philosophy cannot penetrate, some otherness that philosophy cannot reconcile within its own conceptual scheme?

  Abstract: The Insistence of God presents the provocative idea that God does not exist, God insists, while God's existence is a human responsibility, which may or may not happen. For John D. Caputo, God's existence is haunted by "perhaps," which does not signify indecisiveness but an openness to risk, to the unforeseeable. Perhaps constitutes a theology of what is to come and what we cannot see coming. Responding to current critics of continental philosophy, Caputo explores the materiality of perhaps and the promise of the world. He shows how perhaps can become a new theology of the gaps God opens.<br>

  Abstract: Throughout this book I have underlined an issue that accompanies the various discourses of liberation and decolonial thought in Latin America, namely, the issue of its aesthetic dimension. As we saw, Dussel’s philosophy of liberation is based on a pre-rational and pre-linguistic sensibility, a sense of radical exteriority, that distinguishes humans. Quijano exposes a pre-rational disposition or sensibility that sustains the coloniality of power and knowledge. Moreover, as he goes on to uncover and engage ana-chronic simultaneity in Latin American existence, Quijano turns to the writers, poets, and artists of Latin America, who articulate senses of existence beyond and otherwise<br>

  Book Title: Speak Thus-Christian Language in Church and World<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Hovey Craig R.<br>
  Abstract: In its various forms, speech is absolutely integral to the Christian mission. The gospel is a message, news that must be passed on if it is to be known by others. Nevertheless, the reality of God cannot be exhausted by Christian knowledge and Christian knowledge cannot be exhausted by our words. All the while, the philosophy of modernity has left Christianity an impoverished inheritance within which to think these things. In Speak Thus, Craig Hovey explores the possibilities and limits of Christian speaking. At times ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical, these essays go to the heart of what it means to be the church today. In practice, the Christian life often has a linguistic shape that surprisingly implicates and reveals the commitments of people like those who care for the sick or those who respond as peacemakers in the face of violence. Because learning to speak one way as opposed to another is a skill that must be learned, Christian speakers are also guides who bear witness to the importance of churches for passing on a felicity with Christian ways of speaking. Through constructive engagements with interlocutors like Ludwig Wittgenstein, George Lindbeck, Jeffrey Stout, Stanley Hauerwas, John Howard Yoder, Thomas Aquinas, and the theology of Radical Orthodoxy, Hovey offers a challenging vision of the church'able to speak with a confidence that only comes from a deep attentiveness to its own limitations while able to speak prophetically in a world weary of words.<br>

Recent philosophical trends within postmodernity, however, provide fresh models for reassessing Anabaptism in terms more attuned to Anabaptism’s unique character. Some working within the Anglo-American strains of postmodernity have addressed and advanced post-Enlightenment thought in a remarkably successful manner, especially in regard to theology.¹ In this idiom, George Lindbeck is prominent among recent scholars using postmodern philosophy to help us imagine new ways of thinking about theology, particularly regarding the nature of religion, doctrine, and<br>

  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Pallasmaa Juhani<br>
  Abstract: Although we spend more than ninety percent of our lives inside buildings, we understand very little about how the built environment affects our behavior, thoughts, emotions, and well-being. We are biological beings whose senses and neural systems have developed over millions of years; it stands to reason that research in the life sciences, particularly neuroscience, can offer compelling insights into the ways our buildings shape our interactions with the world. This expanded understanding can help architects design buildings that support both mind and body. In
      Mind in Architecture, leading thinkers from architecture and other disciplines, including neuroscience, cognitive science, psychiatry, and philosophy, explore what architecture and neuroscience can learn from each other. They offer historical context, examine the implications for current architectural practice and education, and imagine a neuroscientifically informed architecture of the future. Architecture is late in discovering the richness of neuroscientific research. As scientists were finding evidence for the bodily basis of mind and meaning, architecture was caught up in convoluted cerebral games that denied emotional and bodily reality altogether. This volume maps the extraordinary opportunity that engagement with cutting-edge neuroscience offers present-day architects.ContributorsThomas D.

  Abstract: Transdisciplinary and intermedial analysis of the experience of music Nowadays musical semiotics no longer ignores the fundamental challenges raised by cognitive sciences, ethology, or linguistics. Creation, action and experience play an increasing role in how we understand music, a sounding structure impinging upon our body, our mind, and the world we live in. Not discarding music as a closed system, an integral experience of music demands a transdisciplinary dialogue with other domains as well. Music, Analysis, Experience brings together contributions by semioticians, performers, and scholars from cognitive sciences, philosophy, and cultural studies, and deals with these fundamental questionings. Transdisciplinary and intermedial approaches to music meet musicologically oriented contributions to classical music, pop music, South American song, opera, narratology, and philosophy.<br>

  Book Title: Religion Without Redemption-Social Contradictions and Awakened Dreams in Latin America<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Löwy Michael<br>
  Abstract: The world’s eyes are on Latin America as a place of radical political inspiration and as an alternative to the neoliberal model. Each country in the region deals differently in its method of government, yet there are common cultural themes that tie the continent’s trajectory together. Religion without Redemption looks at the sociology of religion, political philosophy and the history of ideas of the continent, in an attempt to show how Western understanding fails to come close to a correct analysis of how and why political and economic characteristics work as they do. Luis Martínez Andrade focuses on how the centrality of religion for the people of Latin America has influenced how they interact with the changes in the modern economic system. Capitalism, for example, has taken on religious characteristics: it has sacred places of worship (the shopping mall) as well as its own prophets. Martínez Andrade discusses how this form of ‘cultural religion’ accompanies many aspects of life in a contradictory manner: not only does it fulfil the role of legitimating oppression, it also can be a powerful source of rebellion, unveiling thus a subversive side to the status quo. Religion Without Redemption advances the ideas of liberation theory into the 21st century, and challenges the provincialism to which many Latin American thinkers are usually consigned.<br>

  Abstract: In his obituary of Ernest Gellner (1925–1996), Tom Nairn (1996) suggests that Gellner’s first academic appointment, a Demonstratorship in Moral Philosophy at Edinburgh University between 1947 and 1949, may have had a formative influence upon him. Not only did Gellner become aware of how a geographical periphery could be a centre of civilization (
                  polisvis-à-viscosmos) but also how the Scottish Enlightenment idea of a civil society – of ‘society’ as distinct from ‘culture’ – could be rehabilitated so as to illuminate contemporary conditions of political liberty. This then gave onto a lifetime’s deliberations on the rise of nationalism<br>

  Book Title: The Hidden God-Luther, Philosophy, and Political Theology<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): MJAALAND MARIUS TIMMANN<br>
  Abstract: In this phenomenological reading of Luther, Marius Timmann Mjaaland shows that theological discourse is never philosophically neutral and always politically loaded. Raising questions concerning the conditions of modern philosophy, religion, and political ideas, Marius Timmann Mjaaland follows a dark thread of thought back to its origin in Martin Luther. Thorough analyses of the genealogy of secularization, the political role of the apocalypse, the topology of the self, and the destruction of metaphysics demonstrate the continuous relevance of this highly subtle thinker.<br>

  Book Title: Recognizing the Gift-Toward a Renewed Theology of Nature and Grace<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortres<br>
  Author(s): Rober Daniel A.<br>
  Abstract: Recognizing the Gift puts twentieth-century Catholic theological conversations on nature and grace, particularly those of Henri de Lubac and Karl Rahner, into dialogue with Continental philosophy, notably the thought of Jean-Luc Marion and Paul Ricoeur. It argues that a renewed theology of nature and grace must build on the accomplishments of the recent past while acknowledging that an engagement with the political is unavoidable for theology. Ultimately, the aim is to revive and broaden discussion of nature and grace by drawing together the insights of contemporary theologians and Continental philosophers. Too often these areas of inquiry remain quite separate, in part due to differing priorities. This work tries to open that conversation, in part by critically pointing out, in dialogue with Ricoeur, the need in Marion’s work for an acknowledgment of recognition, reciprocity, and the political. It thus argues for a theology of nature and grace in terms of recognition of the gift, drawing out the reciprocal and political nature of gift and givenness in opposition to those, including Marion, who would seek to avoid politics and reciprocity as a proper avenue of inquiry for theology.<br>

  Author(s): HACKETT W. CHRIS<br>
  Abstract: Quiet Powers of the Possible offers an excellent introduction to contemporary French phenomenology through a series of interviews with its most prominent figures. Guided by rigorous questions that push into the most important aspects of the latest phenomenological research, the book gives readers a comprehensive sense of each thinker's intellectual history, motivations, and philosophical commitments. The book introduces readers to debates that have not previously been accessible to the English-speaking world, such as the growing interest in the phenomenological concept of life in its affective and even vital dimensions, the emerging dialogue with the analytic philosophy of mind and language, and reassessments of the so-called theological turn. The diversity of approaches collected here has its origin in a deeper debate about the conceptual and historical foundations of phenomenology itself. In this way the book offers the most accessible and wide-ranging introduction to French phenomenology to have appeared in the English-speaking world to date.<br>

  Author(s) Neville Robert Cummings<br>
  Abstract: As a theory of action, classical pragmatism—founded by the scientifically trained philosophers Charles S. Peirce and William James in New England—is also always a philosophy of religion. Human experience is not (as in the German tradition) divided according to practical experience, on the one hand, and scientific empiricism, on the other. Instead, it is precisely the interplay of belief in relation to action that explains our everyday behavior as much as the scientific method and religious experience. While different conceptions of god have inevitably resulted from the latter over time, the images, narratives, and symbols are nonetheless comparable.<br>

  Author(s): IHDE DON<br>
  Abstract: Husserl's Missing Technologies looks at the early-twentieth-century "classical" phenomenology of Edmund Husserl, both in the light of the philosophy of science of his time, and retrospectively at his philosophy from a contemporary "postphenomenology." Of central interest are his infrequent comments upon technologies and especially scientific instruments such as the telescope and microscope. Together with his analysis of Husserl, Don Ihde ventures through the recent history of technologies of science, reading and writing, and science praxis, calling for modifications to phenomenology by converging it with pragmatism. This fruitful hybridization emphasizes human-technology interrelationships, the role of embodiment and bodily skills, and the inherent multistability of technologies. In a radical argument, Ihde contends that philosophies, in the same way that various technologies contain an ever-shortening obsolescence, ought to have contingent use-lives.<br>

  Book Title: Radical Theology-An Essay on Faith and Theology in the Twenty-First Century<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Dalferth Ingolf U.<br>
  Abstract: Ingolf U. Dalferth develops a “radical theology" that unfolds the orienting strength of faith for human life from the event of God’s presence to every present. In a concise and clear manner, Dalferth outlines the theological and philosophical approaches to hermeneutics in the modern era, in order to promote a convincing and defensible theology for the twenty-first century, critically carrying on Martin Heidegger and Rudolf Bultmann, without forgetting Karl Barth. The result of his reconstruction is a “radical theology" that neither glorifies premodern theology in an antimodern attitude nor seeks a mystical deepening of the secular, but argues for a radical change in theological perspective of the possible. In doing so, theology unfolds “limit concepts" that restrict the claims of science and philosophy critically, and develops “ideas of orientation" that illumine the ways in which human life is understood and lived in radically new ways in faith. From here, Dalferth unfolds the reality of revelation and the Christian sense of an unconditional hope that fundamentally transcends all beliefs based on mundane realities and orients the world on something beyond its own temporal horizon—its loving Creator.<br>

  Book Title: Grand Hotel Abyss-Desire, Recognition and the Restoration of the Subject<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): Safatle Vladimir<br>
  Abstract: Long-expected translation of the Portuguese academic bestseller Grande Hotel Abismo. In the last two decades recognition - arguably one of the most central notions of the dialectical tradition since Hegel - has once again become a crucial philosophical theme. Nevertheless, the new theories of recognition fail to provide room for reflection on transformation processes in politics and morality. This book aims to recover the disruptive nature of the dialectical tradition by means of a severe critique of the dominance of an anthropology of the individual identity in contemporary theories of recognition. This critique implies a thorough rethinking of basic concepts such as desire, negativity, will and drive, with Hegel, Lacan and Adorno being our main guides. The Marxist philosopher György Lukács said that the Frankfurt School (Horkheimer, Adorno, etc.) left us with nothing but negativity towards the state of the world. Their work failed to open up a concrete possibility of practical engagement in this world. All too eager to describe the impasses of reason, the Frankfurt philosphers remained trapped in a metaphorical Grand Hotel Abyss (Grand Hotel Abgrund). It was as living and being guardian of lettered civilization in a beautiful and melancholy grand hotel, of which the balconies face a gaping abyss. But perhaps in this way Lukács gave – and no doubt without realizing it himself – a perfect definition of contemporary philosophy, namely to confront chaos, to peer into what appears to a certain rationality as an abyss and to feel good about it. Touching Hegelian dialectics, critical theory and psychoanalysis, Grand Hotel Abyss gives a new meaning to the notion of negativity as the first essential step for rethinking political and moral engagement.<br>

  Author(s): LOCHRIE KARMA<br>
  Abstract: Drawing on a range of contemporary scholarship on utopianism and a broad premodern archive, Lochrie charts variant utopian strains in medieval literature and philosophy that diverge from More's work and at the same time plot uncanny connections with it. Examining works such as Macrobius's fifth-century
      Commentary on the Dream of Scipio,Mandeville's Travels, and William Langland'sPiers Plowman, she finds evidence of a number of utopian drives, including the rejection of European centrality, a desire for more egalitarian politics, and a rethinking of the division between animals and humans.Nowhere in the Middle Agesinsists on the relevance and transformative potential of medieval utopias for More's work and positions the sixteenth-century text as one alternative in a broader historical phenomenon of utopian thinking. Tracing medieval utopianisms forward in literary history to reveal their influences on early modern and modern literature and philosophy, Lochrie demonstrates that looking backward, we might extend future horizons of utopian thinking.<br>

  Book Title: Crossing the Rubicon: The Borderlands of Philosophy and Theology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Shank Reuben<br>
  Abstract: In France today, philosophy--phenomenology in particular--finds itself in a paradoxical relation to theology. Some debate a "theological turn." Others disavow theological arguments as if such arguments would tarnish their philosophical integrity, while nevertheless carrying out theology in other venues. In Crossing the Rubicon, Emmanuel Falque seeks to end this face-off. Convinced that "the more one theologizes, the better one philosophizes," he proposes a counterblow by theology against phenomenology. Instead of another philosophy of "the threshold" or "the leap"--and through a retrospective and forward-looking examination of his own method--he argues that an encounter between the two disciplines will reveal their mutual fruitfulness and their true distinctive borders. Falque shows that he has made the crossing between philosophy and theology and back again with audacity and perhaps a little recklessness, knowing full well that no one thinks without exposing himself to risk.<br>

  Abstract: This work explores the philosophy and nature of film archiving in Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ) through an analysis of the role played by Jonathan Dennis, firstly at the New Zealand Film Archive, Ngā Kaitiaki o ngā Taonga Whitiāhua (NZFA), from 1981 until 1990 and thereafter as a freelance film curator until his death in 2002. The construction of a film archive in the early 1980s offers a valuable moment in which to analyse the wider purpose and the more specific process for the formation of a film archive. As a national institution presenting materials from the past, an archive quickly<br>

  Author(s) Sivan Emanuel<br>
  Abstract: Many formalised discourses of the human sciences—such as law, liberal political philosophy and neo-classical economics—work with a notion of the singular human being as a unit that is characterised by its indivisibility, for those reasons also called the individual. An additional assumption about the guiding orientation or behaviour of these units then needs to be introduced to arrive at ways of conceptualising stable collectivities. In the discourses mentioned above, this assumption is basically one of rationality, with specific variations. In liberal political theory, their capacity for rationality leads the individuals to enter into a social contract for their<br>

  Abstract: Where we are positioned in society, and how we think of and live in our bodies, are questions we do not usually connect to the (both everyday and scholarly) claims we make about social and legal problems. “The body” and “knowledge” have traditionally been understood as unrelated categories. However, recent interdisciplinary work in philosophy and law emphasizes “positionality,” and calls into question the abstract, disembodied quality of conventional Western theories of knowledge (epistemologies) which ground the Western conception of law. Western epistemology, its critics say, has artificially bracketed off the material particulars of experience and identity, including the spatial particularity<br>

  Abstract: Paul Ricoeur’s work remains lamentably underappreciated a few years after this death. Several factors contribute to the relative neglect of his thought. First, Ricoeur is fastidious to a fault in acknowledging his intellectual debts, which can, deceptively, make his thought appear derivative. Second, the pattern of “detour and return” that characterizes his thinking can make it difficult to keep up with him. Following Ricoeur takes one through the diverse fields of existentialism, structuralism, psychoanalysis, and analytic philosophy, to name only a few of his better-known detours.

  Book Title: Religion: Beyond a Concept-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): de VRIES HENT<br>
  Abstract: What do we talk about when we talk about religion? Is it an array of empirical facts about historical human civilizations? Or is religion what is in essence unpredictable-perhaps the very emergence of the new? In what ways are the legacies of religion-its powers, words, things, and gestures-reconfiguring themselves as the elementary forms of life in the twenty-first century?Given the Latin roots of the word religion and its historical Christian uses, what sense, if any, does it make to talk about religionin other traditions? Where might we look for common elements that would enable us to do so? Has religion as an overarching concept lost all its currency, or does it ineluctably return-sometimes in unexpected ways-the moment we attempt to do without it? This book explores the difficulties and double binds that arise when we ask What is religion? Offering a marvelously rich and diverse array of perspectives, it begins the task of rethinking religionand religious studiesin a contemporary world. Opening essays on the question What is religion?are followed by clusters exploring the relationships among religion, theology, and philosophy and the links between religion, politics, and law. Pedagogy is the focus of the following section. Religion is then examined in particular contexts, from classical times to the present Pentacostal revival, leading into an especially rich set of essays on religion, materiality, and mediatization. The final section grapples with the ever-changing forms that religionis taking, such as spirituality movements and responses to the ecological crisis.Featuring the work of leading scholars from a wide array of disciplines, traditions, and cultures, Religion: Beyond a Concept will help set the agenda for religious studies for years to come. It is the first of five volumes in a collection entitled The Future of the Religious Past, the fruit of a major international research initiative funded by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research.<br>

  Book Title: Death's Following: Mediocrity, Dirtiness, Adulthood, Literature-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): LIMON JOHN<br>
  Abstract: Almost all twentieth-century philosophy stresses the immanence of death in human life-as drive (Freud), as the context of Being (Heidegger), as the essence of our defining ethics (Levinas), or as language (de Man, Blanchot). In Death's Following, John Limon makes use of literary analysis (of Sebald, Bernhard, and Stoppard), cultural analysis, and autobiography to argue that death is best conceived as always transcendentally beyond ourselves, neither immanent nor imminent. Adapting Kierkegaard's variations on the theme of Abraham's near-sacrifice of Isaac while refocusing the emphasis onto Isaac, Limon argues that death should be imagined as if hiding at the end of an inexplicable journey to Moriah. The point is not to evade or ignore death but to conceive it more truly, repulsively, and pervasively in its camouflage: for example, in jokes, in logical puzzles, in bowdlerized folk songs. The first of Limon's two key concepts is adulthood: the prolonged anti-ritual for experiencing the full distance on the look of death. His second is dirtiness, as theorized in a Jewish joke, a logical exemplum, and T. S. Eliot's "Ash Wednesday": In each case, unseen dirt on foreheads suggests the invisibility of inferred death. Not recognizing death immediately or admitting its immanence and imminence is for Heidegger the defining characteristic of the "they," humanity in its inauthentic social escapism. But Limon vouches throughout for the mediocrity of the "they" in its dirty and ludicrous adulthood. Mediocrity is the privileged position for previewing death, in Limon's opinion: practice for being forgotten. In refusing the call of twentieth-century philosophy to face death courageously, Limon urges the ethical and aesthetic value of mediocre anti-heroism.<br>

  Abstract: As trauma theory narrated shattering endings, it turns, in a new century, to imagine impossible beginnings. How do we figure life?

How might carnal hermeneutics, as it draws on multiple senses, participate in the work of refiguring traumatic wounds? The essays in this volume note the privileging of the visual as the dominant sense in Western philosophy. The study of trauma, largely a Western enterprise, is often referred to through the image<br>

  Book Title: Re-treating Religion: Deconstructing Christianity with Jean-Luc Nancy-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Nancy Jean-Luc<br>
  Abstract: One of the most complicated and ambiguous tendencies in contemporary western societies is the phenomenon referred to as the turn to religion.In philosophy, one of the most original thinkers critically questioning this turnis Jean-Luc Nancy. Re-treating Religion is the first volume to analyze his long-term project The Deconstruction of Christianity,especially his major statement of it in Dis-Enclosure.Nancy conceives monotheistic religion and secularization not as opposite worldviews that succeed each other in time but rather as springing from the same history. This history consists in a paradoxical tendency to contest one's own foundations-whether God, truth, origin, humanity, or rationality-as well as to found itself on the void of this contestation. Nancy calls this unique combination of self-contestation and self-foundation the self-deconstructionof the Western world.The book includes discussion with Nancy himself, who contributes a substantial Preambleand a concluding dialogue with the volume editors. The contributions follow Nancy in tracing the complexities of Western culture back to the persistent legacy of monotheism, in order to illuminate the tensions and uncertainties we face in the twenty-first century.<br>

  Book Title: On the Anarchy of Poetry and Philosophy-A Guide for the Unruly<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRUNS GERALD L.<br>
  Abstract: Marcel Duchamp once asked whether it is possible to make something that is not a work of art. This question returns over and over in modernist culture, where there are no longer any authoritative criteria for what can be identified (or excluded) as a work of art. As William Carlos Williams says, A poem can be made of anything,even newspaper clippings.At this point, art turns into philosophy, all art is now conceptual art, and the manifesto becomes the distinctive genre of modernism. This book takes seriously this transformation of art into philosophy, focusing upon the systematic interest that so many European philosophers take in modernism. Among the philosophers Gerald Bruns discusses are Theodor W. Adorno, Maurice Blanchot, Arthur Danto, Stanley Cavell, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Franois Lyotard, Jean-Luc Nancy, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, and Emmanuel Levinas.As Bruns demonstrates, the difficulty of much modern and contemporary poetry can be summarized in the idea that a poem is made of words, not of any of the things that we use words to produce: meanings, concepts, propositions, narratives, or expressions of feeling. Many modernist poets have argued that in poetry language is no longer a form of mediation but a reality to be explored and experienced in its own right. But what sort of experience, philosophically, might this be? The problem of the materiality or hermetic character of poetic language inevitably leads to questions of how philosophy itself is to be written and what sort of communitydefines the work of art-or, for that matter, the work of philosophy.In this provocative study, Bruns answers that the culture of modernism is a kind of anarchist community, where the work of art is apt to be as much an event or experience-or, indeed, an alternative form of life-as a formal object. In modern writing, philosophy and poetry fold into one another. In this book, Bruns helps us to see how.<br>

  Book Title: Writings on Medicine-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Meyers Todd<br>
  Abstract: At the time of his death in 1995, Georges Canguilhem was a highly respected historian of science and medicine, whose engagement with questions of normality, the ideologization of scientific thought, and the conceptual history of biology had marked the thought of philosophers such as Michel Foucault, Louis Althusser, Pierre Bourdieu, and Gilles Deleuze. This collection of short, incisive, and highly accessible essays on the major concepts of modern medicine shows Canguilhem at the peak of his use of historical practice for philosophical engagement. In order to elaborate a philosophy of medicine, Canguilhem examines paramount problems such as the definition and uses of health, the decline of the Hippocratic understanding of nature, the experience of disease, the limits of psychology in medicine, myths and realities of therapeutic practices, the difference between cure and healing, the organism's self-regulation, and medical metaphors linking the organism to society. Writings on Medicine is at once an excellent introduction to Canguilhem's work and a forceful, insightful, and accessible engagement with elemental concepts in medicine. The book is certain to leave its imprint on anthropology, history, philosophy, bioethics, and the social studies of medicine.<br>

  Book Title: Constellations of a Contemporary Romanticism-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): McGrath Brian<br>
  Abstract: Constellations of a Contemporary Romanticism takes its title and point of departure from Walter Benjamin's concept of the historical constellation, which puts both "contemporary" and "romanticism" in play as period designations and critical paradigms. Featuring fascinating and diverse contributions by an international roster of distinguished scholars working in and out of romanticism--from deconstruction to new historicism, from queer theory to postcolonial studies, from visual culture to biopolitics--this volume makes good on a central tenet of Benjamin's conception of history: These critics "grasp the constellation" into which our "own era has formed with a definite earlier one." Each of these essays approaches romanticism as a decisive and unexpired thought experiment that makes demands on and poses questions for our own time: What is the unlived of a contemporary romanticism? What has romanticism's singular untimeliness bequeathed to futurity? What is romanticism's contemporary "redemption value" for painting and politics, philosophy and film?<br>

  Abstract: This book is a marker of the state of theorytoday. Its rich array of wideranging essays explores the dimensions and implications of the work of J.

For nearly half a century, Miller has been known for his close and imaginative engagement with the implications of European philosophical thought and for his passionate advocacy of close reading.Building on this intellectual legacy, the contributors instantiate and extend the practice and ethics of sustained close reading that is Miller's hallmark. The book culminates in a moving piece by Jacques Derrida, Miller's close friend of forty years, who engages Miller's readings of Gerard Manley Hopkins in a historic encounter between French philosophy and American reading practices.A provocation to reading for new generations of students and teachers, these essays offer important resources for grasping the question of language in historical perspective and in contemporary life-a task essential for any democratic future.

  Book Title: Archaeology and Memory-  Publisher: Oxbow Books<br>
  Author(s): Borić Dušan<br>
  Abstract: Memory can be both a horrifying trauma and an empowering resource. From the Ancient Greeks to Nietzsche and Derrida, the dilemma about the relationship between history and memory has filled many pages, with one important question singled out: is the writing of history to memory a remedy or a poison? Recently, a growing interest in and preoccupation with the issue of memory, remembering and forgetting has resulted in a proliferation of published works, in various disciplines, that have memory as their focus. This trend, to which the present volume contributes, has started to occupy the dominant discourses of disciplines such as sociology, philosophy, history, anthropology and archaeology, and has also disseminated into the wider public discourse of society and culture today. Such a condition may perhaps echo the phenomenon of a melancholic experience at the turn of the millennium. Archaeology and Memory seeks to examine the diversity of mnemonic systems and their significance in different past contexts as well as the epistemological and ontological importance of archaeological practice and narratives in constituting the human historical condition. The twelve substantial contributions in this volume cover a diverse set of regional examples and focus on a range of prehistoric and classical case studies in Eurasian regional contexts as well as on the predicaments of memory in examples of the archaeologies of 'contemporary past'. From the Mesolithic and Neolithic burial chambers to the trenches of World War I and the role of materiality in international criminal courts, a number of contributors examine how people in the past have thought about their own pasts, while others reflect on our own present-day sensibilities in dealing with the material testimonies of recent history. Both kinds of papers offer wider theoretical reflections on materiality, archaeological methodologies and the ethical responsibilities of archaeological narration about the past.<br>

  Book Title: Land and People-Papers in Memory of John G. Evans<br>
  Publisher: Oxbow Books<br>
  Author(s): O’Connor Terry<br>
  Abstract: This volume is derived, in concept, from a conference held in honour of John Evans by the School of History and Archaeology and The Prehistoric Society at Cardiff University in March 2006. It brings together papers that address themes and landscapes on a variety of levels. They cover geographical, methodological and thematic areas that were of interest to, and had been studied by, John Evans. The volume is divided into five sections, which echo themes of importance in British prehistory. They include papers on aspects of environmental archaeology, experiments and philosophy; new research on the nature of woodland on the chalklands of southern England; coasts and islands; people, process and social order, and snails and shells - a strong part of John Evans' career. This volume presents a range of papers examining people's interaction with the landscape in all its forms. The papers provide a diverse but cohesive picture of how archaeological landscapes are viewed within current research frameworks and approaches, while also paying tribute to the innovative and inspirational work of one of the leading protagonists of environmental archaeology and the holistic approach to landscape interpretation.<br>

In this section, I explore how different satanic characters in literature represent manifestations of evil, in conjunction with the theological concepts of theodicy and theological discussions of evil. I refer to it as a literary exploration of postmodern or contemporary thoughts on evil in philosophy and theology. We have seen now how Satan is a literary figure and finds his

  Book Title: The Atheist's Primer-  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Palmer Michael<br>
  Abstract: In The Atheist's Primer, a prominent philosopher, Dr Michael Palmer, reinstates the importance of philosophy in the debate about God's existence. The 'new atheism' of Richard Dawkins and others has been driven by largely Darwinian objections to God's existence, limiting the debate to within a principally scientific framework. This has obscured the philosophical tradition of atheism, in which the main intellectual landmarks in atheism's history are to be found. With an analysis of atheistic thought from the Ancient Greeks to the present day, Palmer explains and comments on the philosophical arguments warranting atheism, discussing issues such as evil, morality, miracles, and the motivations for belief. The emphasis placed on materialism and the limitations of our knowledge might seem disheartening to some; but Palmer concludes on a positive note, arguing – alongside Nietzsche, Marx and Freud and many others – that happiness and personal fulfilment are to be found in the very materialism that religious belief rejects. Michael Palmer first addressed these issues in his student-oriented edition, The Atheist's Creed, of which The Atheist's Primer is a revised abridgement for the general reader. Palmer has now stripped out the primary texts and expanded his commentaries into fluent and concise analyses of the arguments. Free of philosophical jargon and assumptions of prior knowledge, this is an important introduction to a major cultural debate.<br>

  Abstract: The origins of Western atheism lie in classical antiquity, in which first developed a naturalistic and empirical explanation of the world. Already visible in Greece in the philosophy of the Sophists of the second half of the fifth century B.C., this replacement of divine by natural causation became much more pronounced in the later schools of Epicurean Materialism and Scepticism. It is not easy to say precisely why this occurred, and why the old mythological conception of the gods as the sole agents of creation should have declined so rapidly.

Focusing on knowledge will allow a certain clarity with respect to the possible relations between self and otherness as explicitly defined by different traditional positions like idealism and realism.

  Book Title: Theology in Language, Rhetoric, and Beyond-Essays in Old and New Testament<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Lundbom Jack R.<br>
  Abstract: Theology in Language, Rhetoric, and Beyond' places before a broad audience of students and general readers theological essays on both the Old and New Testaments. Theology is seen to derive from a number of sources: the biblical language, biblical rhetoric and composition, academic disciplines other than philosophy, and above all a careful exegesis of the biblical text. The essay on Psalm 23 makes use of anthropology and human-development theory; the essay on Deuteronomy incorporates Wisdom themes; the essay called "Jeremiah and the Created Order" looks at ideas not only about God and creation but also about the seldom-considered idea of God and a return to chaos; and the essay on the "Confessions of Jeremiah" examines, not the words that this extraordinary prophet was given by God to preach, but what he himself felt and experienced in the office to which he was called. One essay on "Biblical and theological themes" includes a translation into the African language of Lingala, which weaves together the story of early Christianity with the more recent founding of churches in Africa and Asia. Jack R. Lundbom argues eloquently through these essays that theology is rooted in biblical words, in themselves, in rhetoric and their different contexts.<br>

  Book Title: Facing the Other-John Paul II, Levinas, and the Body<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): de Malherbe Brice<br>
  Abstract: What is the significance of the body? What might phenomenology contribute to a theological account of the body? And what is gained by prolonging the overlooked dialogue between St. John Paul II and Emmanuel Levinas? Nigel Zimmermann answers these questions through the agreements and the tensions between two of the most important thinkers of the twentieth century. John Paul II, the Polish pope, philosopher, and theologian, and Emmanuel Levinas, the French-Jewish philosopher of Lithuanian heritage, were provocative thinkers who courageously faced and challenged the assumptions of their age. Both held the human person in high regard and did their thinking with constant reference to God and to theological language. Zimmermann does not shirk from the challenges of each thinker and does not hide their differences. However, he shows how they bequeath a legacy regarding the body that we would overlook at significant ethical peril. We are called, Zimmermann argues, to face the other. In this moment God refuses a banal marginalisation and our call to responsibility for the other person is issued in their disarming vulnerability. In the body, philosophy, theology, and ethics converge to call us to glory, even in the paradox of lowly suffering.<br>

  Book Title: Philosophical Apprenticeships-Contemporary Continental Philosophy in Canada<br>
  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>
  Author(s): Robinson Jason<br>
  Abstract: Philosophical Apprenticeshipsgathers fresh and innovative essays written by the next generation of Canada's philosophers on the work of prominent Canadian philosophers currently researching topics in continental philosophy. The authors--doctoral students studying at Canadian universities--have studied with, worked with, or been deeply influenced by these philosophers. Their essays present, discuss, and develop the work of their mentors, addressing issues such as time, art, politics, hermeneutics, and phenomenology. The result is a volume that introduces the reader to the work of current Canadian philosophers and to that of their successors, who will soon be making their own contributions to Canadian continental philosophy.Includes articles by Gabriel Malenfant on Bettina Bergo, Saulius Geniusas on Gary Madison, John Marshall on Samuel Mallin, François Doyon on Claude Piché, Stephanie Zubcic on Jennifer Bates, Alexandra Morrison on Graeme Nicholson, Scott Marratto on John Russon, and Jill Gilbert on John Burbridge.<br>

  Book Title: Northrop Frye-New Directions from Old<br>
  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>
  Author(s): Rampton David<br>
  Abstract: More than fifty years after the publication of
      Anatomy of Criticism, Northrop Frye remains one of Canada's most influential intellectuals. This reappraisal reasserts the relevance of his work to the study of literature and illuminates its fruitful intersection with a variety of other fields, including film, cultural studies, linguistics, and feminism. Many of the contributors draw upon the early essays, correspondence, and diaries recently published as part of theCollected Works of Northrop Fryeseries, in order to explore the development of his extraordinary intellectual range and the implications of his imaginative syntheses. They refute postmodernist arguments that Frye's literary criticism is obsolete and propose his wide-ranging and non-linear ways of thinking as a model for twenty-first century readers searching for innovative ways of understanding literature and its relevance to contiguous disciplines. The volume provides an in-depth examination of Frye's work on a range of literary questions, periods, and genres, as well as a consideration of his contributions to literary theory, philosophy, and theology. The portrait that emerges is that of a writer who still has much to offer those interested in literature and the ways it represents and transforms our world. The book's overall argument is that Frye's case for the centrality of the imagination has never been more important where understanding history, reconciling science and culture, or reconceptualizing social change is concerned.<br>

  Abstract: We have been reading certain developments in German philosophy as an attempt to close the gap between Kant’s transcendental apparatus and the world to which that apparatus gives order and coherence. We have seen, however, that none of the developments under consideration has been able to provide a completely transcendental or a priori account of the Kantian schema. Rather schemata appear to result from the interaction of the mind and the empirical data of experience. Hence we might conclude with Heidegger that it is through schemata that what we call a “world” is first opened up. In confronting these diverse<br>

  Abstract: A leading Polish philosopher of the 20th century, Roman Ingarden is principally renowned in Western culture for his work in aesthetics and the theory of literature. Jeff Mitscherling demonstrates, in this extensive work, how Ingarden's thought constitutes a major contribution to the more fundamental fields of ontology and metaphysics. Unparalleled in existing literature, Mitscherling's comprehensive survey of Ingarden's philosophy will give the reader an informed introduction to this major work of phenomenological analysis.<br>

  Abstract: As we have seen, Ingarden’s primary philosophical concern lay not in aesthetics per se but in ontology. He undertook his extensive analyses of art in order not to gather material for the construction of a general ‘theory of art’ but rather to elucidate and, to some extent, ground his position with regard to the idealism/realism debate. Seen in this light, it is not at all surprising that his analyses of the different sorts of art do not yield a single conception of ‘the nature of art’,¹ which had been the goal of most traditional philosophy of art and aesthetic theory<br>

Unless one has actually seen some live philosophical tangle unsnarled by such a technique, one will not be very convinced by even a very accurate general description of the methods used. On the other hand, sample analyses of moral concepts often do not make clear their relevance (direct or indirect) to actual moral perplexities.

  Book Title: The Wedding Feast of the Lamb-Eros, the Body, and the Eucharist<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hughes George<br>
  Abstract: Emmanuel Falque's The Wedding Feast of the Lamb represents a turning point in his thought. Here, Falque links philosophy and theology in an original fashion that allows us to see the full effect of theology's "backlash" against philosophy. By attending closely to the incarnation and the eucharist, Falque develops a new concept of the body and of love: By avoiding the common mistake of "angelism"--consciousness without body--Falque considers the depths to which our humanity reflects animality, or body without consciousness. He shows the continued relevance of the question "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?" (John 6:52), especially to philosophy. We need to question the meaning of "this is my body" in "a way that responds to the needs of our time" (Vatican II). Because of the ways that "Hoc est corpus meum" has shaped our culture and our modernity, this is a problem both for religious belief and for culture.<br>

  Abstract: The return to the ontological questions of philosophy and their renewal is Gilles Deleuze’s most pressing project. It is his philosophical priority to refuse any transcendent ideas or transcendental conditions; instead, he tends to examine the vital forces of an immanent structure. Using the term “plane of immanence,” Deleuze suggests that thinking relates to the surface of a concrete reality that it absolutely does not transcend. Thinking does not merely depend on real experience: like a pre-Socratic sage of nature, Deleuze claims that the force of thinking, its astonishment and creativity, consists of the material movement of Being, as if<br>

  Abstract: While some theorists have suggested that translation is impossible (Payne 1971), to a large degree Western civilization and culture has depended upon translated documents originally written in one language into some other, usually more common, language. A large portion of our current understanding of philosophy, history, mythology, and religion comes to us through translated documents. What could we know of Aristotle, Plato, Moses, or Muhammad without contemporary translations of their writings into our mother tongue? From the philosophy of Immanuel Kant to the literature of Victor Hugo, the breadth of human knowledge is inextricably linked to the translation of documents<br>

  Book Title: Hermeneutics Ancient and Modern-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRUNS GERALD L.<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging meditation on the nature and purpose of hermeneutics, Gerald L. Bruns argues that hermeneutics is not merely a contemporary theory but an extended family of questions about understanding and interpretation that have multiple and conflicting histories going back to before the beginning of writing.What does it mean to understand a riddle, an action, a concept, a law, an alien culture, or oneself? Bruns expands our sense of the horizons of hermeneutics by situating its basic questions against a background of different cultural traditions and philosophical topics. He discusses, for example, the interpretation of oracles, the silencing of the muses and the writing of history, the quarrel between philosophy and poetry, the canonization of sacred texts, the nature of allegorical exegesis, rabbinical midrash, the mystical exegesis of the Qur'an, the rise of literalism and the individual interpreter, and the nature of Romantic hermeneutics. Dealing with thinkers ranging from Socrates to Luther to Wordsworth to Ricoeur, Bruns also ponders several basic dilemmas about the nature of hermeneutical experience, the meaning of tradition, the hermeneutical function of narrative, and the conflict between truth and freedom in philosophy and literature. His eloquent book demonstrates the continuing power of hermeneutical thinking to open up questions about the world and our place in it.<br>

My sense is that every hermeneutical situation has the structure of this quarrel, which is governed by a logic that is by turns exclusionary and allegorical. Plato’s idea seems to have been that poetry embodies something (we’re not sure what) that interferes with the sort of discourse Socrates is trying to set up and that he seems to be practicing in texts like the

  Abstract: What can the universals of political philosophy offer to those who experience the living paradox of an inegalitarian construction of egalitarian citizenship? Citizen Subject is the summation of +ëtienne BalibarGÇÖs career-long project to think the necessary and necessarily antagonistic relation between the categories of citizen and subject. In this magnum opus, the question of modernity is framed anew with special attention to the self-enunciation of the subject (in Descartes, Locke, Rousseau, and Derrida), the constitution of the community as GÇ£weGÇ¥ (in Hegel, Marx, and Tolstoy), and the aporia of the judgment of self and others (in Foucualt, Freud, Kelsen, and Blanchot)._x000D_ After the GÇ£humanist controversyGÇ¥ that preoccupied twentieth-century philosophy, Citizen Subject proposes foundations for philosophical anthropology today, in terms of two contrary movements: the becoming-citizen of the subject and the becoming-subject of the citizen. The citizen-subject who is constituted in the claim to a GÇ£right to have rightsGÇ¥ (Arendt) cannot exist without an underside that contests and defies it. HeGÇöor she, because Balibar is concerned throughout this volume with questions of sexual differenceGÇöfigures not only the social relation but also the discontent or the uneasiness at the heart of this relation. The human can be instituted only if it betrays itself by upholding GÇ£anthropological differencesGÇ¥ that impose normality and identity as conditions of belonging to the community._x000D_ The violence of GÇ£civilGÇ¥ bourgeois universality, Balibar argues, is greater (and less legitimate, therefore less stable) than that of theological or cosmological universality. Right is thus founded on insubordination, and emancipation derives its force from otherness._x000D_ Ultimately, Citizen Subject offers a revolutionary rewriting of the dialectic of universality and differences in the bourgeois epoch, revealing in the relationship between the common and the universal ~<br>

Yet his influence on French philosophical thought can hardly be overestimated. Levinas wrote that GÇ£during over a half century of teaching and research, [Wahl] was the life force of the academic, extra-academic, and even, to a degree anti-academic philosophy necessary to a great culture.GÇ¥ And Deleuze, for his part, commented that GÇ£Apart from Sartre, who remained caught none the less in the trap of the verb to be, the most important philosopher in France was Jean Wahl.GÇ¥_x000D_ Besides engaging with the likes of Bataille, Bergson, Deleuze, Derrida, Levinas, Maritain, and Sartre, Wahl also played a significant role, in some cases almost singlehandedly, in introducing French philosophy to movements like existentialism, and American pragmatism and literature, and thinkers like Hegel, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Jaspers, and Heidegger. Yet Wahl was also an original philosopher and poet in his own right. This volume of selections from WahlGÇÖs philosophical writings makes a selection of his most important work available to the English-speaking philosophical community for the first time._x000D_ Jean Wahl was Professor of Philosophy at the Sorbonne from 1936 to 1967, save during World War II, which he spent in the United States, having escaped from the Drancy internment camp. His books to appear in English include The Pluralist Philosophies of England and America (Open Court, 1925), The Philosopher's Way (Oxford UP, 1948), A Short History of Existentialism (Philosophical Library, 1949), and Philosophies of Existence (Schocken, 1969).<br>

  Author(s) Goodchild Philip<br>
  Abstract: In this essay I discuss in part I some aspects of the approach to religion that Schelling developed in his late “positive philosophy.” In part II, I explain how these ideas were taken up and reworked by Ernst Bloch. In part III, I interpret the implications of these developments for the contemporary Continental philosophy of religion. The first two parts of the essay are fairly conventional; the third part is not. Since at least the seventeenth century, there have been attempts to challenge “stasis thinking” in the West. The most important challenge to stasis thought, however, occurred in the work<br>

  Abstract: Mimesisis the imitation of nature and life in art or literature. According to Plato, all art is mimetic of life and therefore a reflection of reality. This theory has spawned an entire philosophy and study of art and the nature of reality and identity (i.e.Potolsky 2006, Halliwell 2009 — for a prehistoric example see Borić 2007). If art does indeed reflect reality, then this could present a window into the past, representing either ideal images for a particular period or specific individuals. In some cases, it is possible to observe the integration of a specific biological phenomenon into artistic<br>

  Author(s) Silva Fernando Candido da<br>
  Abstract: Psychoanalysis may be viewed (following suggestions by Paul Ricoeur [1970] in
                     Freud and Philosophy) as a hermeneutics, specifically as a hermeneutics of desire. it traces or tracks the imprint of desire first in the dream and then in a variety of behavioral symptoms (jokes, slips of the tongue, as well as bodily symptoms). This hermeneutics is, however, never simple since desire is constitutionally conflicted, divided, deflected, and disguised. Thus desire is never only or primarily what it seems. it is constitutionally enigmatic. it is this that necessitates something like a science of desire, an analytics of desire.<br>

  Abstract: Theodor W. Adorno’s preoccupation with language is gleaned from the context of his theory of knowledge, particularly his critique of identity thinking. He tackles the problem of conceptual reification genealogically, that is, he traces conceptual reification via an analysis of the structure of language. My aim in this paper is to argue that Adorno’s engagement with the nature of language is informed by an implicit attempt at a revaluation of the language of philosophy, a revaluation that has significant consequences for a global understanding of how we conceive the world of objects, in general, and how philosophy’s configurative use of<br>

  Abstract: An anthropological investigation into philosophy can provide us with insights and information about traditions of knowledge and intellectual practice elsewhere in the world, in social contexts very different from our own. The project needs to engage with – and first of all be able to identify – philosophy as part of social discourse, and as a social practice, within any given region. Here, I am carving out one particular approach about how this could work, in relation to the Swahili context and against the background of discussions in African philosophy. Philosophy, as socialized discourse and practice, overlaps with other (more established) areas<br>

  Abstract: Pierre Bourdieu’s conception of habitus marks a theoretical step which no adequate understanding of social reality can ignore. By introducing habitus, Bourdieu is able both to integrate and to transcend major insights of the linguistic turn in philosophy, most prominently the idea that conscious intentional understanding necessarily relies on a host of implicit, practical, and holistic background assumptions which constitute meaning while being themselves unrepresented (Searle, 1989). The concept of habitus incorporates this idea since it shows that individual agency and its self-understanding are constituted by relying on an acquired social sense, the cognitive habitus, which defines how an agent<br>

  Book Title: The Resounding Soul-Reflections on the Metaphysics and Vivacity of the Human Person<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Kimbriel Samuel<br>
  Abstract: It is surely not coincidental that the term “soul" should mean not only the centre of a creature’s life and consciousness, but also a thing or action characterized by intense vivacity (“that bike’s got soul!"). It also seems far from coincidental that the same contemporary academic discussions that have largely cast aside the language of “soul" in their quest to define the character of human mental life should themselves be so – how to say it? – bloodless, so lacking in soul. This volume arises from the opposite premise, namely that the task of understanding human nature is bound up with and in important respects dependent upon the more critical task of learning to be fully human, of learning to have soul. The papers collected here are derived from a conference in Oxford sponsored by the Centre of Theology and Philosophy and together explore the often surprising landscape that emerges when human consciousness is approached from this angle. Drawing upon literary, philosophical, theological, historical, and musical modes of analysis, the essays of this volume vividly remind the reader of the power of the ancient language of soul over against contemporary impulses to reduce, fragment, and overly determine human selfhood.<br>

  Book Title: Children of God in the World-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): O’Callaghan Paul<br>
  Abstract: Children of God in the World is a textbook of theological anthropology structured in four parts. The first attempts to clarify the relationship between theology, philosophy and science in their respective approaches to anthropology, and establishes the fundamental principle of the text, stated in Vatican II's Gaudium et spes, n. 22, "Christ manifests man to man." The second part provides a historical overview of the doctrine of grace: in Scripture (especially the teaching of the book of Genesis on humans 'made in the image of God', as well as Paul and John), among the Fathers (in particular the oriental doctrine of 'divinization' and Augustine), during the Middle Ages (especially Thomas Aquinas) and the Reformation period (centered particularly on Luther and the Council of Trent), right up to modern times. The third part of the text, the central one, provides a systematic understanding of Christian grace in terms of the God's life present in human believers by which they become children of God, disciples, friends and brothers of Christ, temples of the Holy Spirit. This section also provides a reflection on the theological virtues (faith, hope and charity), on the relationship between grace and human freedom, on the role of the Church and Christian apostolate in the communication of grace, and on the need humans have for divine grace. After considering the relationship between the natural and the supernatural order, the fourth and last part deals with different philosophical aspects of the human condition, in the light of Christian faith: the union between body and soul, humans as free, historical, social, sexual and working beings. The last chapter concludes with a consideration of the human person, Christianity's greatest and most enduring contribution to human thought.<br>

  Publisher: Ohio University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wood Robert E.<br>
  Abstract: Examining select high points in the speculative tradition from Plato and Aristotle through the Middle Ages and German tradition to Dewey and Heidegger,
      Placing Aestheticsseeks to locate the aesthetic concern within the larger framework of each thinker's philosophy.In Professor Robert Wood's study, aesthetics is not peripheral but rather central to the speculative tradition and to human existence as such. In Dewey's terms, aesthetics is "experience in its integrity." Its personal ground is in "the heart," which is the dispositional ground formed by genetic, cultural , and personal historical factors by which we are spontaneously moved and, in turn, are inclined to move, both practically and theoretically, in certain directions.Prepared for use by the student as well as the philosopher,Placing Aestheticsaims to recover the fullness of humanness within a sense of the fullness of encompassing Being. It attempts to overcome the splitting of thought, even in philosophy, into exclusive specializations and the fracturing of life itself into theoretical, practical, and emotive dimensions.<br>

Heidegger’s approach falls in the line of his teacher, Edmund Husserl, the founder of Phenomenology. Husserl understood Phenomenology to be comprehensive philosophy; it is at least permanent prolegomenon, acknowledged or not, to any philosophy.

  Book Title: Prophetic Politics-Emmanuel Levinas and the Sanctification of Suffering<br>
  Publisher: Ohio University Press<br>
  Author(s): HAROLD PHILIP J.<br>
  Abstract: In
      Prophetic Politics,Philip J. Haroldoffers an original interpretation of the political dimension of Emmanuel Levinas's thought. Harold argues that Levinas's mature position inOtherwise Than Beingbreaks radically with the dialogical inclinations of his earlierTotality and Infinityand that transformation manifests itself most clearly in the peculiar nature of Levinas's relationship to politics.Levinas's philosophy is concerned not with the ethical per se, in either its applied or its transcendent forms, but with the source of ethics. Once this source is revealed to be an anarchic interruption of our efforts to think the ethical, Levinas's political claims cannot be read as straightforward ideological positions or principles for political action. They are instead to be understood "prophetically," a position that Harold finds comparable to the communitarian critique of liberalism offered by such writers as Alasdair MacIntyre and Charles Taylor. In developing this interpretation, which runs counter to formative influences from the phenomenological tradition, Harold traces Levinas's debt to phenomenological descriptions of such experiences as empathy and playfulness.Prophetic Politicswill highlight the relevance of the phenomenological tradition to contemporary ethical and political thought-a long-standing goal of the series-while also making a significant and original contribution to Levinas scholarship.<br>

Freewheeling through centuries of critical ideas, he sheds light on the place of literature in our culture, and in doing so reaffirms the value and validity of literary thought today.<br>

  Abstract: Who Was Jacques Derrida?is the first intellectual biography of Derrida, the first full-scale appraisal of his career, his influence, and his philosophical roots. It is also the first attempt to define his crucial importance as the ambassador of "theory," the phenomenon that has had a profound influence on academic life in the humanities. Mikics lucidly and sensitively describes for the general reader Derrida's deep connection to his Jewish roots. He succinctly defines his vision of philosophy as a discipline that resists psychology. While pointing out the flaws of that vision and Derrida's betrayal of his most adamantly expounded beliefs, Mikics ultimately concludes that "Derrida was neither so brilliantly right nor so badly wrong as his enthusiasts and critics, respectively, claimed."<br>

  Abstract: In the 1990s, as he neared the close of his life and his academic career, Derrida again sought an arena outside philosophy: a wider and more consequential place than arguments about the coherence of metaphysical texts could provide. His chosen term, increasingly, was politics. And the accent of Derrida’s political writings was a prophetic one, full of commanding ethical import. He relied more than before on a Lévinasian view of our responsibility toward others. Derrida was no doubt reacting to his own role in the de Man and Heidegger scandals, when he failed to confront the political commitments of these<br>

  Abstract: Animal and human gestures are used for action but also as signposts, symbols, and to indicate intention. They are neither simple nor complex. They are simplex because, in a very global and immediate way, they enable the brain to grasp a reality, an emotion, a thought, or a complex social relationship. Gesture is a fundamental mark of culture and art, which are always simplex expressions. Gesture is essential to them. Drawing, painting, music, mime, acting, sculpture, and dance are always expressed in gestures. For this reason, we must not be content with a physiology (or a philosophy) of action. We<br>

  Author(s) Meeks Wayne A.<br>
  Abstract: We have now become accustomed to say that earliest Christianity was a sect of Judaism. This is useful language: it helps us avoid some kinds of anachronism, and it may assist Christians to approach the painful history of Jewish-Christian relations with appropriate humility. Moreover, there is ancient support for this terminology. It was Josephus who depicted the “Jewish philosophy” as made up of three or four “sects” (αìρέσεις,

  Abstract: The suppression of some conceptual elements and forms of discourse already found in ancient Jewish circles is characteristic of the rather homogeneous type of rabbinic discourse. Though allowing divergences of opinion and, one may even claim, encouraging, preserving, and studying them for generations, the ancient rabbis nevertheless controlled the nature of the topics on which divergences are allowed. No allegorical or symbolic interpretations of the Bible, abundant as they were in Alexandrian Judaism (especially Philo), were given access to the exegetical methods characteristic of rabbinic literature. Alchemy, astrology, philosophy, and physical sciences remained at the margin of rabbinic discourse. A<br>

  Author(s) Changeux Jean-Pierre<br>
  Abstract: Western philosophy grew from that of the ancient Greeks at the end of the seventh century bce. Among the first were the Milesians: Thales (ca. 624–548 bce), Anaximander (ca. 611–547 bce), and Anaximenes (ca. 570–500 bce). As Geoffrey Lloyd recounted in 1970, this was a time of important technological progress, the end of the Bronze Age and the beginning of the Iron Age. Classification developed from observation and rationalization. These early philosophers discovered nature and distinguished between natural and supernatural, and they then avoided the supernatural. Thales declared that gods were everywhere, but he left them there.<br>

  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): KELLEY DONALD R.<br>
  Abstract: This book, the third volume of Donald Kelley's monumental survey of Western historiography, covers the twentieth century, especially Europe. As in the first two volumes, the author discusses historical methods and ideas of all sorts to provide a detailed map of historical learning. Here he carries the survey forward to our own times, confronting directly the challenges of postmodernism and historical narrative. Kelley offers highly original discussions of historians of the last half century (including friends and mentors), the "linguistic turn," the "end of history," the philosophy of history, and various new methods of histories.The book focuses first on the state of the art of history in France, Germany, Britain, and the United States on the eve of World War I. Kelley then traces every important historiographical issue and development historians have encountered in the twentieth century. With the completion of this trilogy, Kelley presents the only comprehensive modern survey of historical writing. He provides an unparalleled portrait of the rich variety of historical method along with an insider's view of the challenges of capturing history on the written page.<br>

  Book Title: Engaging the Moving Image-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Carroll Noël<br>
  Abstract: Noël Carroll, a brilliant and provocative philosopher of film, has gathered in this book eighteen of his most recent essays on cinema and television-what Carroll calls "moving images." The essays discuss topics in philosophy, film theory, and film criticism.Drawing on concepts from cognitive psychology and analytic philosophy, Carroll examines a wide range of fascinating topics. These include film attention, the emotional address of the moving image, film and racism, the nature and epistemology of documentary film, the moral status of television, the concept of film style, the foundations of film evaluation, the film theory of Siegfried Kracauer, the ideology of the professional western, and films by Sergei Eisenstein and Yvonne Rainer. Carroll also assesses the state of contemporary film theory and speculates on its prospects. The book continues many of the themes of Carroll's earlier work
      Theorizing the Moving Imageand develops them in new directions. A general introduction by George Wilson situates Carroll's essays in relation to his view of moving-image studies.<br>

  Book Title: Whose Freud?-The Place of Psychoanalysis in Contemporary Culture<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Woloch Alex<br>
  Abstract: One hundred years after the publication of
      The Interpretation of Dreams,Freud remains the most frequently cited author of our culture-and one of the most controversial. To some he is the presiding genius of modernity, to others the author of its symptomatic illnesses. The current position of psychoanalysis is very much at issue. Is it still valid as a theory of the mind? Have its therapeutic applications been rendered obsolete by drugs? Why does it still figure in debates about sexual identity, despite its rejection by many feminists? How does it contribute to cultural analysis?This book offers a new assessment of the status of psychoanalysis as a discipline and a discourse in contemporary culture. It brings together an exceptional group of theorists and practitioners, such partisans and critics of Freud as Frederic Crews, Judith Butler, Leo Bersani, Juliet Mitchell, Robert Jay Lifton, Richard Wollheim, Jonathan Lear, and others.These contributors, who are active in literature, philosophy, film, history, cultural studies, neuroscience, psychotherapy, and other disciplines, debate how psychoanalysis has enriched-and been enriched by-these fields.<br>

Truth, then, is deployed as a

By contrast, when we are working “from the inside,” we are concerned with how the issue of truth ariseswithinthe analytic situation. There is value in<br>

  Book Title: Becoming Human Again-The Theological Life of Gustaf Wingren<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Olson Daniel M.<br>
  Abstract: One of the most influential Swedish theologians of the twentieth century, Gustaf Wingren’s career spanned more than forty years of upheaval both in his field and around the globe. Provocative and challenging, Wingren revelled in a good argument and this attitude set the tone for much of his scholarship. A Swedish Lutheran, he made his name through his research into the theology of Martin Luther, breaking away from both traditional interpretations of Luther and the theology of his famous teachers, Karl Barth and Anders Nygren, before shifting his focus onto systematic theology. In a fresh take, Bengt Kristensson Uggla delves into the influence of Wingren’s second wife, Greta Hofsten, on the direction of his theology. Hofsten, a left-wing political activist who was searching for a new language of faith, wove Wingren’s work together with her own political philosophy to create an unusual kind of Christian socialism. Her thinking had a profound effect on Wingren, causing him to recontextualise his older work entirely. In Becoming Human Again, Uggla examines how Wingren’s combative nature often served him well as a theologian, driving him to engage with innovations in the field and re-examine his older views.<br>

  Book Title: The Vision of the Soul-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): Wilson James Matthew<br>
  Abstract: Ours is an age full of desires but impoverished in its understanding of where those desires lead-an age that claims mastery over the world but also claims to find the world as a whole absurd or unintelligible. In
      The Vision of the Soul, James Matthew Wilson seeks to conserve the great insights of the western tradition by giving us a new account of them responsive to modern discontents. The western- or Christian Platonist-tradition, he argues, tells us that man is an intellectual animal, born to pursue the good, to know the true, and to contemplate all things in beauty. Wilson begins by reconceiving the intellectual conservatism born of Edmund Burke's jeremiad against the French Revolution as an eff­ort to preserve the West's vision of man and the cosmos as ordered by and to beauty. After defining the achievement of that vision and its tradition, Wilson off­ers an extended study of the nature of beauty and the role of the fine arts in shaping a culture but above all in opening the human intellect to the perception of the form of reality. Through close studies of Theodor W. Adorno and Jacques Maritain, he recovers the classical vision of beauty as a revelation of truth and being. Finally, he revisits the ancient distinction between reason and story-telling, between mythos and logos, in order to rejoin the two.Story-telling is foundational to the forms of the fine arts, but it is no less foundational to human reason. Human life in turn constitutes a specific kind of form-a story form. The ancient conception of human life as a pilgrimage to beauty itself is one that we can fully embrace only if we see the essential correlation between reason and story and the essential convertibility of truth, goodness and beauty in beauty. By turns a study in fundamental ontology, aesthetics, and political philosophy, Wilson's book invites its readers to a renewal of the West's intellectual tradition.<br>

The book is structured around six philosophical ideas concerning our relations with others: values, morality, aesthetics, order, rules and respect. Building on the author’s theoretical and empirical research, the book considers the boundaries of criminology and the scope for greater exchange between criminology and philosophy. The book is illustrated using examples from a range of countries, and provides a platform for engaging with important topical issues using philosophical and theoretical insights.<br>

  Abstract: Historically, philosophers have written very little about the subject of crime. Similarly, criminologists have written very little about the subject of philosophy. In both cases, the linkages between philosophy and crime have been left implicit … However, to be sure, law and justice have been particularly significant concerns throughout the history of philosophy.<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapter we explored care and its generic realisation in a variety of social relations. Although care can be viewed through the lens of moral philosophy – as a moral duty that is realised through a set of practices embodying distinct virtues – care itself, we argued, can only ever be socially realised within particular forms of relationship. Questions such as who should receive and who should provide care, how and where care should be delivered, and what care means to those who are carers and to those who are cared for will elicit different answers at different<br>

  Abstract: The doctrine of divine simplicity has a long history involving complex accounts that interweave philosophy, scripture, and theology. Without a doubt, there is no single doctrine of divine simplicity that remained perfectly unaltered throughout the Christian tradition. Perhaps this is because, as Christopher Stead argues, throughout the early church various senses of divine simplicity were used to speak about God without ever clarifying which sense was in use. In other words, “we must not think that simplicity is itself a simple notion.”¹ However, the simplistic versions of divine simplicity represented in much contemporary theology—primarily from critics—might lead others<br>

  Author(s) Puyol Angel<br>
  Abstract: The French Revolution proclaimed an ethical and political ideal with its three principles that have not been improved on since: liberty, equality and fraternity. Since then, western political philosophy has put its greatest efforts into analysing the former two (liberty and equality), but has ignored, and even disdained, the third part of the revolutionary triad: fraternity. In my opinion, forgetting or underestimating fraternity as a political category is unjustifiable, given that so many injustices in our world are not only related to a lack of liberty and equality, but also to the scarcity, and sometimes inexistence, of fraternity.<br>

  Author(s): JANECZEK Ks. Stanisław<br>
  Abstract: Antropologia [Anthropology] is a gateway to the series of volumes devoted to particular disciplines of philosophy, taking into account their relationship with the Christian worldview and recognizing the need to include the philosophical and ideological diversity of contemporary culture. Antropologia covers Thomist tradition, enriching its achievements with other perspectives, especially Karol Wojtyla's personalism. Increasing influence of "third culture thinking", where the humanities are carried out in the context of the natural sciences, justifies the need to take up the difficult task of demonstrating complex problems of philosophical and natural anthropology. Anthropological considerations force us to realize the multifaceted nature of classical discussions on the nature of man, including theirs scientific and ideological facets, and to demonstrate them in a well-balanced manner. In this context, it enables readers to gain guidance in the debate on the philosophy of mind, providing ways of understanding and assessing the problem of the human soul (concerning the mind-body problem).<br>

Rather than starting with contemporary democratic theory or continental philosophy, Hugo Drochon argues that Nietzsche's political ideas must first be understood in light of Bismarck's policies, in particular his "Great Politics," which transformed the international politics of the late nineteenth century.<br>

  Book Title: Norms of Rhetorical Culture-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Farrell Thomas B.<br>
  Abstract: Rhetoric is widely regarded by both its detractors and advocates as a kind of antithesis to reason. In this book Thomas B. Farrell restores rhetoric as an art of practical reason and enlightened civic participation, grounding it in its classical tradition-particularly in the rhetoric of Aristotle. And, because prevailing modernist world views bear principal responsibility for the disparagement of rhetorical tradition, Farrell also offers a critique of the dominant currents of modern humanist thought.Farrell argues that rhetoric is not antithetical to reason but is a manner of posing and answering questions that is distinct from the approaches of analytic and dialectical reason. He develops this position in a number of ways: through a series of bold reinterpretations of Aristotle's
      Rhetoric; through a detailed appraisal of traditional rhetorical concepts as seen in modern texts from the Army-McCarthy hearings to Edward Kennedy's memorial for his brother, Mario Cuomo's address on abortion, Betty Friedan'sFeminine Mystique, and Vaclav Havel's inaugural address; and through a fresh appraisal of theories on the character of language and discourse found in contemporary philosophy, literary criticism, anthropology, deconstructionism, Marxism, and especially in Habermas's critical theory of communicative action.<br>

  Book Title: Return from Exile - Rückkehr aus dem Exil-Exiles, Returnees and Their Impact in the Humanities and Social Sciences in Austria and Central Europe<br>
  Publisher: Verlag der österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften<br>
  Author(s): PRISCHING MANFRED<br>
  Abstract: The tremendous loss to the humanities and social sciences in the 20th century resulting from the expulsion of thousands of scholars and artists from Austria and Central Europe has been well documented. The present collection of articles deals with a related but under-researched aspect – it combines analyses of the complex bureaucratic and the ideological obstacles which exiled scholars from a wide range of disciplines in the humanities and social sciences and creative artists faced when they were willing to return and specific essays documenting the varying opportunities for individual returnees to influence the development of their different disciplines after the end of the Nazi tyranny. The 27 essays highlight the roles of a number of returnees as generous mentors for younger scholars and their encouragement of modernization and internationalization in an atmosphere of stagnation and provincialism in the universities. Eminent experts in history, philosophy or political science who had returned were hampered by the denial of full academic appointments despite their highly stimulating initiatives, while theatre directors had a relatively strong impact on the programs in the theaters and the other media. The volume also illustrates personal factors, including the understandable hesitation of prominent intellectuals such as Oskar Morgenstern or Ernst Krenek to give up the advantages of US American citizenship for academic positions, especially in a country exposed to political threats in the Cold War; but the essays also bring out the fact that quite a few of the émigrés remained exiles on both sides of the Atlantic. A particular strength of the volume is the detailed consideration of the fortunes and the influence of the impressive array of exiled Austrian economists. Many of them returned from Britain, helping to shape economic theory and Austrian economic policy, even though necessarily mainly from outside the universities, while transatlantic exiles largely remain~<br>

  Publisher: Academic Studies Press<br>
  Author(s): TRUBIKHINA JULIA<br>
  Abstract: Using Vladimir Nabokov as its “case study," this volume approaches translation as a crucial avenue into literary history and theory, philosophy and interpretation. It attempts to bring together issues in translation and the shift in Nabokov studies from its earlier emphasis on the “metaliterary" to the more recent “metaphysical" approach. Addressing specific texts (both literary and cinematic), the book investigates Nabokov’s deeply ambivalent relationship to translation as a hermeneutic oscillation on his part between the relative stability of meaning, which expresses itself philosophically as a faith in the beyond, and deep metaphysical uncertainty. While Nabokov’s practice of translation changed profoundly over the course of his career, his adherence to the Romantic notion of a “true" but ultimately elusive metaphysical language remained paradoxically constant.<br>

It is hard to separate Vladimir Nabokov from the act of translation, in all senses of the word—ranging from “moving across” geographical borders and cultural and linguistic boundaries to the transposing of the split between “here” and “there” and “then” and “now” (the essential elements of exile, components of every émigré experience) onto a metaphysical plane sometimes suggested<br>

  Book Title: Reasoning from Faith-Fundamental Theology in Merold Westphal’s Philosophy of Religion<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): SANDS JUSTIN<br>
  Abstract: Merold Westphal is considered to be one of the preeminent Continental philosophers of religion. His articulation of faith as the task of a lifetime has become a touchstone in contemporary debates concerning faith's relationship to reason. As Justin Sands explores his philosophy, he illuminates how Westphal's concept of faith reveals the pastoral, theological intent behind his thinking. Sands sees Westphal's philosophy as a powerful articulation of Protestant theology, but one that is in ecumenical dialogue with questions concerning apologetics and faith's relationship to ethics and responsibility, a more Catholic point of view. By bringing out these features in Westphal's philosophy, Sands intends to find core philosophical methodologies as well as a passable bridge for philosophers to cross over into theological discourses.<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapter, we discussed Merold Westphal’s thought in light of his primary debate partner, John Caputo. As I argued, Westphal is almost always discussed alongside his friend Caputo as both represent different, opposing sides of various debates in Continental philosophy of religion in North America. On the one hand, Westphal argues for a ‘thick theology’—a hearty soup—that provides a theistic, religious appropriation of postmodern thought to nourish the believing soul. On the other hand, Caputo analyses theism through a radical critique of religion’s onto-theo-logico-centrism. Caputo’s postmodernism declares that religion must be rethought—even to the point<br>

  Book Title: Feminist Philosophy and the Problem of Evil-  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): SCHOTT ROBIN MAY<br>
  Abstract: Any glance at the contemporary history of the world shows that the problem of evil is a central concern for people everywhere. In the last few years, terrorist attacks, suicide bombings, and ethnic and religious wars have only emphasized humanity's seemingly insatiable capacity for violence. In Feminist Philosophy and the Problem of Evil, Robin May Schott brings an international group of contemporary feminist philosophers into debates on evil and terrorism. The invaluable essays collected here consider gender-specific evils such as the Salem witch trials, women's suffering during the Holocaust, mass rape in Bosnia, and repression under the Taliban, as well as more generalized acts of violence such as the 9/11 bombings, the Madrid train station bombings, and violence against political prisoners. Readers of this sobering volume will find resources for understanding the vulnerability of human existence and what is at stake in the problem of evil.<br>

  Book Title: In Praise of Heteronomy-Making Room for Revelation<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Westphal Merold<br>
  Abstract: Recognizing the essential heteronomy of postmodern philosophy of religion, Merold Westphal argues against the assumption that human reason is universal, neutral, and devoid of presupposition. Instead, Westphal contends that any philosophy is a matter of faith and the philosophical encounter with theology arises from the very act of thinking. Relying on the work of Spinoza, Kant, and Hegel, Westphal discovers that their theologies render them mutually incompatible and their claims to be the voice of autonomous and universal reason look dubious. Westphal grapples with this plural nature of human thought in the philosophy of religion and he forwards the idea that any appeal to the divine must rest on a historical and phenomenological analysis.<br>

  Author(s): RAYMAN JOSHUA<br>
  Abstract: What are the foundations of human self-understanding and the value of responsible philosophical questioning? Focusing on Heidegger's early work on facticity, historicity, and the phenomenological hermeneutics of factical-historical life, Hans-Helmuth Gander develops an idea of understanding that reflects our connection with the world and other, and thus invites deep consideration of phenomenology, hermeneutics, and deconstruction. He draws usefully on Husserl's phenomenology and provides grounds for exchange with Descartes, Dilthey, Nietzsche, Gadamer, Ricoeur, and Foucault. On the way to developing a contemporary hermeneutical philosophy, Gander clarifies the human relation to self in and through conversation with Heidegger's early hermeneutics. Questions about reading and writing then follow as these are the very actions that structure human self-understanding and world understanding.<br>

Central to this debate is the Kantian distinction between determinant (i.e., cognitive) judgment and reflective (i.e., aesthetic or teleological) judgment. Arendt’s own conception of judgment originates largely from her interest in and her commentaries on Kant’s elaboration of the judgment of taste in the

  Author(s): Tatman Lucy<br>
  Abstract: Part religious studies, part feminist theory, part philosophy, part indescribable: such is Numinous Subjects. Described by the author as 'a kaleidoscopic exploration of why three gendered figures of the sacred matter within western culture,' the experience of reading this text truly is akin to gazing through a constantly turning kaleidoscope. Images, concepts, phrases and quotes are continually revisited, recombined, though never repeated in quite the same way. From these tumbling constellations arises a new understanding and wary appreciation of the figures of the virgin, the mother, and the whore. Drawing on the insights of thinkers as diverse as Rudolph Otto, Julia Kristeva, Simone de Beauvoir, and Martin Buber, Numinous Subjects simultaneously expands and focuses our attention on the myth of the sacred and its implications for female subjects in western culture today.<br>

  Publisher: University Press of Mississippi<br>
  Author(s): Garlough Christine L.<br>
  Abstract: Desi Divas: Activism in South Asian American Cultural Performancesis the product of five years of field research with progressive activists associated with the School for Indian Languages and Cultures (SILC), South Asian Americans Leading Together (SAALT), the feminist dance collective Post Natyam, and the grassroots feminist political organization South Asian Sisters. Christine L. Garlough explores how traditional cultural forms may be critically appropriated by marginalized groups and used as rhetorical tools to promote deliberation and debate, spur understanding and connection, broaden political engagement, and advance particular social identities. Within this framework she examines how these performance activists advocate a political commitment to both justice and care, to both deliberative discussion and deeper understanding. To consider how this might happen in diasporic performance contexts, Garlough weaves together two lines of thinking. One grows from feminist theory and draws upon a core literature concerning the ethics of care. The other comes from rhetoric, philosophy, and political science literature on recognition and acknowledgment. This dual approach is used to reflect upon South Asian American women's performances that address pressing social problems related to gender inequality, immigration rights, ethnic stereotyping, hate crimes, and religious violence.<br>

As his views on facticity and historicity developed, he became increasingly critical of “the system of Catholicism.” He came to believe that Catholicism inured itself from life through an architectonic of Scholastic concepts, a “pseudo-philosophy” with “police power” (GA60 313). Scholasticism (not identical to Catholicism in Heidegger’s mind but nonetheless inseparable from it) distorted Aristotle and compounded the forgetfulness of being already underway in antiquity<br>

  Book Title: Negotiating the Sacred-Blasphemy and Sacrilege in a Multicultural Society<br>
  Publisher: ANU E Press<br>
  Author(s): WHITE KEVIN<br>
  Abstract: This cross-disciplinary exploration of the role of the sacred, blasphemy and sacrilege in a multicultural society brings together philosophers, theologians, lawyers, historians, curators, anthropologists and sociologists, as well as Christian, Jewish and Islamic and secular perspectives. In bringing together different disciplinary and cultural approaches, the book provides a way of broadening our conceptions of what might count as sacred, sacrilegious and blasphemous, in moral and political terms. In addition, it provides original research data on blasphemy, sacrilege and religious tolerance from a range of disciplines. The book is presented in four sections: Section I: Religion Sacrilege and Blasphemy in Australia. Section II: Sacrilege and the Sacred Section III: The State, Religion and Tolerance Section IV: The Future: Openness and Dogmatism. The book will appeal to both those actively involved in religious negotiation and to scholars and students of religion in history, philosophy, anthropology, sociology and political science.<br>

Even the bravest heroes, such as Hector and Achilles, lament the fact that their lives will have been so short.

  Abstract: In addition to war, terrorism, and unchecked military violence, modernity is also subject to less visible but no less venomous conflicts. Global in nature, these "culture wars" exacerbate the tensions between tradition and innovation, virtue and freedom. Internationally acclaimed scholar Fred Dallmayr charts a course beyond these persistent but curable dichotomies in Integral Pluralism: Beyond Culture Wars. Consulting diverse fields such as philosophy, literature, political science, and religious studies, Dallmayr equates modern history with a process of steady pluralization. This process, which Dallmayr calls "integral pluralism," requires new connections and creates ethical responsibilities.<br>

In his long string of writings, Nicolaus of Cusa never ceased to stress this need for measurement, but with a dramatic twist. Had<br>

  Book Title: The Philosophy of Science Fiction Film-  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Sanders Steven M.<br>
  Abstract: The science fiction genre maintains a remarkable hold on the imagination and enthusiasm of the filmgoing public, captivating large audiences worldwide and garnering ever-larger profits. Science fiction films entertain the possibility of time travel and extraterrestrial visitation and imaginatively transport us to worlds transformed by modern science and technology. They also provide a medium through which questions about personal identity, moral agency, artificial consciousness, and other categories of experience can be addressed. In The Philosophy of Science Fiction Film, distinguished authors explore the storylines, conflicts, and themes of fifteen science fiction film classics, from Metropolis to The Matrix. Editor Steven M. Sanders and a group of outstanding scholars in philosophy, film studies, and other fields raise science fiction film criticism to a new level by penetrating the surface of the films to expose the underlying philosophical arguments, ethical perspectives, and metaphysical views. Sanders's introduction presents an overview and evaluation of each essay and poses questions for readers to consider as they think about the films under discussion.The first section, "Enigmas of Identity and Agency," deals with the nature of humanity as it is portrayed in Blade Runner, Dark City, Frankenstein, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and Total Recall. In the second section, "Extraterrestrial Visitation, Time Travel, and Artificial Intelligence," contributors discuss 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Terminator, 12 Monkeys, and The Day the Earth Stood Still and analyze the challenges of artificial intelligence, the paradoxes of time travel, and the ethics of war. The final section, "Brave Newer World: Science Fiction Futurism," looks at visions of the future in Metropolis, The Matrix, Alphaville, and screen adaptations of George Orwell's 1984.<br>

  Book Title: The Philosophy of Neo-Noir-  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Conard Mark T.<br>
  Abstract: Film noir is a classic genre characterized by visual elements such as tilted camera angles, skewed scene compositions, and an interplay between darkness and light. Common motifs include crime and punishment, the upheaval of traditional moral values, and a pessimistic stance on the meaning of life and on the place of humankind in the universe. Spanning the 1940s and 1950s, the classic film noir era saw the release of many of Hollywood's best-loved studies of shady characters and shadowy underworlds, including Double Indemnity, The Big Sleep, Touch of Evil, and The Maltese Falcon. Neo-noir is a somewhat loosely defined genre of films produced after the classic noir era that display the visual or thematic hallmarks of the noir sensibility. The essays collected in The Philosophy of Neo-Noir explore the philosophical implications of neo-noir touchstones such as Blade Runner, Chinatown, Reservoir Dogs, Memento, and the films of the Coen brothers. Through the lens of philosophy, Mark T. Conard and the contributors examine previously obscure layers of meaning in these challenging films. The contributors also consider these neo-noir films as a means of addressing philosophical questions about guilt, redemption, the essence of human nature, and problems of knowledge, memory and identity. In the neo-noir universe, the lines between right and wrong and good and evil are blurred, and the detective and the criminal frequently mirror each other's most debilitating personality traits. The neo-noir detective -- more antihero than hero -- is frequently a morally compromised and spiritually shaken individual whose pursuit of a criminal masks the search for lost or unattainable aspects of the self. Conard argues that the films discussed in The Philosophy of Neo-Noir convey ambiguity, disillusionment, and disorientation more effectively than even the most iconic films of the classic noir era. Able to self-consciously draw upon noir conventions and simultaneously subvert them, neo-noir d~<br>

What they have in common reflects the creative understanding of the meaning of "catholic" as Haughey has found it to operate in Catholic higher education. Each essay in the first six chapters describes how its author has assembled a unique whole from within his or her particular area of academic competence. The last six chapters are more autobiographical, with each author describing what has become central to his or her identity. All twelve are "anticipating an entirety" with each contributing a coherence that is as surprising as it is delightful.<br>

  Book Title: Overcoming Our Evil-Human Nature and Spiritual Exercises in Xunzi and Augustine<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stalnaker Aaron<br>
  Abstract: Can people ever really change? Do they ever become more ethical, and if so, how?
      Overcoming Our Evilfocuses on the way ethical and religious commitments are conceived and nurtured through the methodical practices that Pierre Hadot has called "spiritual exercises." These practices engage thought, imagination, and sensibility, and have a significant ethical component, yet aim for a broader transformation of the whole personality. Going beyond recent philosophical and historical work that has focused on ancient Greco-Roman philosophy, Stalnaker broadens ethical inquiry into spiritual exercises by examining East Asian as well as classical Christian sources, and taking religious and seemingly "aesthetic" practices such as prayer, ritual, and music more seriously as objects of study. More specifically,Overcoming Our Evilexamines and compares the thought and practice of the early Christian Augustine of Hippo, and the early Confucian Xunzi. Both have sophisticated and insightful accounts of spiritual exercises, and both make such ethical work central to their religious thought and practice. Yet to understand the two thinkers' recommendations for cultivating virtue we must first understand some important differences. Here Stalnaker disentangles the competing aspects of Augustine and Xunxi's ideas of "human nature." His groundbreaking comparison of their ethical vocabularies also drives a substantive analysis of fundamental issues in moral psychology, especially regarding emotion and the complex idea of "the will," to examine how our dispositions to feel, think, and act might be slowly transformed over time. The comparison meticulously constructs vivid portraits of both thinkers demonstrating where they connect and where they diverge, making the case that both have been misunderstood and misinterpreted. In throwing light on these seemingly disparate ancient figures in unexpected ways, Stalnaker redirects recent debate regarding practices of personal formation, and more ~<br>

  Author(s): Descombes Vincent<br>
  Abstract: Offering a critical view of all the texts in which Wittgenstein mentions Freud, Bouveresse immerses us in the intellectual climate of Vienna in the early part of the twentieth century. Although we come to see why Wittgenstein did not view psychoanalysis as a science proper, we are nonetheless made to feel the philosopher's sense of wonder and respect for the cultural task Freud took on as he found new ways meaningfully to discuss human concerns. Intertwined in this story of Wittgenstein's grappling with the theory of the unconscious is the story of how he came to question the authority of science and of philosophy itself. While aiming primarily at the clarification of Wittgenstein's opinion of Freud, Bouveresse's book can be read as a challenge to the French psychoanalytic school of Lacan and as a provocative commentary on cultural authority.<br>

Freud’s position in this regard is rather comparable to that of the Vienna Circle, as its members certainly recognized. Moreover, we can see that Freud’s attitude toward philosophy, if not, like theirs, the attitude of someone who would criticize it from within in order to reinvigorate<br>

  Book Title: Truth Matters-Knowledge, Politics, Ethics, Religion<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Shuker Ronnie<br>
  Abstract: Why should we seek and tell the truth? Does anyone know what truth is? Many are skeptical about the relevance of truth. Truth Matters endeavours to show why truth is important in a world where the very idea of truth is contested. Putting philosophers in conversation with educators, literary scholars, physicists, political theorists, and theologians, Truth Matters ranges across both analytic and continental philosophy and draws on the ideas of thinkers such as Aquinas, Balthasar, Brandom, Davidson, Dooyeweerd, Gadamer, Habermas, Kierkegaard, Plantinga, Ricoeur, and Wolterstorff. Some essays attempt to provide a systematic account of truth, while others wrestle with the question of how truth is told and what it means to live truthfully. Contributors address debates between realists and anti-realists, explore issues surrounding relativism and constructivism in education and the social sciences, examine the politics of truth telling and the ethics of authenticity, and consider various religious perspectives on truth. Most scholars agree that truth is propositional, being expressed in statements that are subject to proof or disproof. This book goes a step farther: yes, propositional truth is important, but truth is more than propositional. To recognize how it is more than propositional is crucial for understanding why truth truly matters.

  Author(s) SEERVELD CALVIN<br>
  Abstract: Writing in the wake of the furor over her account of the Eichmann trial, Hannah Arendt reflects on why truth and politics are, in her words, “on rather bad terms.”¹ Her analysis rests on dividing truth into two different types. The first type, rational truth, is the subject of mathematics and philosophy. It has a long history of tension with politics, going back at least to Plato, who worried about the displacement of rational truth by mere opinion. In the modern age, Arendt says, opinion has generally won the day, rendering rational truth politically irrelevant.² The second type, factual truth,<br>

  The Pragmatic Intimacy Between Rhetoric and Hermeneutics from:

  Author(s) Mailloux Steven<br>
  Abstract: Philosophical hermeneutics takes as its task the opening up of the hermeneutical dimension in its full scope, showing its fundamental significance for our entire understanding of the world and thus for all the various forms in which this understanding manifests itself: from interhuman communication to manipulation of society; from personal experience by the individual in society to the way in which he encounters society; and from the tradition as it is built of religion and law, art and philosophy, to the revolutionary consciousness that unhinges the tradition through emancipatory reflection.<br>

  Book Title: Rhetoric in an Antifoundational World-Language, Culture, and Pedagogy<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Glejzer Richard R.<br>
  Abstract: In this brilliant collection, literary scholars, philosophers, and teachers inquire into the connections between antifoundational philosophy and the rhetorical tradition. What happens to literary studies and theory when traditional philosophical foundations are disavowed? What happens to the study of teaching and writing when antifoundationalism is accepted? What strategies for human understanding are possible when the weaknesses of antifoundationalism are identified? This volume offers answers in classic essays by such thinkers as Richard Rorty, Terry Eagleton, and Stanley Fish, and in many new essays never published before.The contributors to this book explore the nexus of antifoundationalism and rhetoric, critique that nexus, and suggest a number of pedagogical and theoretical alternatives. The editors place these statements into a context that is both critical and evaluative, and they provide for voices that dissent from the antifoundational perspective and that connect specific, practical pedagogies to the broader philosophical statements. For those with an interest in rhetoric, philosophy, comparative literature, or the teaching of composition, this book sets forth a wealth of thought-provoking ideas.<br>

For example, there is the famous observation on method in the introduction to the

  Hermeneutics as the Interpretation of Existence from:

  Author(s) Gadamer Hans-Georg<br>
  Abstract: In the nineteenth century, hermeneutic reflection remained peripheral in certain respects (especially to philosophy). Though their founding intuitions were broadly based, the classic figures in hermeneutics who were representative of the century—Böckh, Schleiermacher, Droysen, and Dilthey—did not manage to develop a unified conception of hermeneutics or publish it in systematic form. Indicative of this state of affairs is that their hermeneutic inquiries had to be compiled from posthumous writings edited by their students and published mostly in the form of overviews and fragments. This situation slowly begins to change with Heidegger (1889–1976), who was demonstrably influenced early<br>

Archaic religion, ancient philosophy, Hebrew and Christian revelation—in an order of increasing intensity—all responded to the same divine impulse.

  Abstract: This exceptional collection of writings offers for the first time a discussion among leading thinkers about the points at which rhetoric and religion illuminate and challenge each other. The contributors to the volume are eminent theorists and critics in rhetoric, theology, and religion, and they address a variety of problems and periods.Together these writings shed light on religion as a human quest and rhetoric as the origin and sustainer of that quest. They show that when pursued with intelligence and sensitivity, rhetorical approaches to religion are capable of revitalizing both language and experience. Rhetorical figures, for example, constitute forms of language that say what cannot be said in any other way, and that move individuals toward religious truths that cannot be known in any other way. When firmly placed within religious, social, and literary history, the convergence of rhetoric and religion brings into focus crucial issues in several fields-including philosophy, psychology, history, and art-and interprets relations among self, language, and world that are central to both past and present cultures.<br>

  Book Title: Faces of History-Historical Inquiry from Herodotus to Herder<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): KELLEY DONALD R.<br>
  Abstract: In this book, one of the world's leading intellectual historians offers a critical survey of Western historical thought and writing from the pre-classical era to the late eighteenth century. Donald R. Kelley focuses on persistent themes and methodology, including questions of myth, national origins, chronology, language, literary forms, rhetoric, translation, historical method and criticism, theory and practice of interpretation, cultural studies, philosophy of history, and "historicism."Kelley begins by analyzing the dual tradition established by the foundational works of Greek historiography-Herodotus's broad cultural and antiquarian inquiry and the contrasting model of Thucydides' contemporary political and analytical narrative. He then examines the many variations on and departures from these themes produced in writings from Greek, Roman, Jewish, and Christian antiquity, in medieval chronicles, in national histories and revisions of history during the Renaissance and Reformation, and in the rise of erudite and enlightened history in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Throughout, Kelley discusses how later historians viewed their predecessors, including both supporters and detractors of the authors in question.The book, which is a companion volume to Kelley's highly praised anthology
      Versions of History from Antiquity to the Enlightenment,will be a valuable resource for scholars and students interested in interpretations of the past.<br>

There were established chairs of history in the universities of Europe, especially in England, France, and Germany, as well as official historiographers, official collections of documents, and other kinds of private and public support for practitioners of history.¹ What was new in the Enlightenment was the encounters between history and philosophy, which had likewise, and even earlier, emerged as a professional field with an academic base.<br>

  Book Title: Metaphysics in Ordinary Language-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Rosen Stanley<br>
  Abstract: In this rich collection of philosophical writings, Stanley Rosen addresses a wide range of topics-from eros, poetry, and freedom to problems like negation and the epistemological status of sense perception. Though diverse in subject, Rosen's essays share two unifying principles: there can be no legitimate separation of textual hermeneutics from philosophical analysis, and philosophical investigation must be oriented in terms of everyday language and experience, although it cannot simply remain within these confines. Ordinary experience provides a minimal criterion for the assessment of extraordinary discourses, Rosen argues, and without such a criterion we would have no basis for evaluating conflicting discourses: philosophy would give way to poetry.Philosophical problems are not so deeply embedded in a specific historical context that they cannot be restated in terms as valid for us today as they were for those who formulated them, the author maintains. Rosen shows that the history of philosophy-a story of conflicting interpretations of human life and the structure of intelligibility-is a story that comes to life only when it is rethought in terms of the philosophical problems of our own personal and historical situation.<br>

  Abstract: I propose to deal with the question of the relation between philosophy and ordinary experience. This sounds quite straightforward, but I am afraid that it is actually an unusually difficult problem. It is a striking fact of our century that philosophy has become increasingly concerned with ordinary experience, ordinary language, everyday life, or the life-world, to cite four often-used expressions. This concern is evident in both wings of the two major contemporary philosophical movements, which are popularly if inaccurately designated as the analytical and the continental or phenomenological schools.

After identifying the need for a legitimate philosophical approach to Israelite religion, the volume traces the history of interdisciplinary relations and shows how descriptive varieties of philosophy of religion can aid the clarification of the Hebrew Bible’s own metaphysical, epistemological, and moral assumptions. Two new interpretative methodologies are developed and subsequently applied through an introduction to what the biblical texts took for granted about the nature of religious language, the concept of deity, the properties of Yhwh, the existence of gods, religious epistemology, and the relation between religion and morality.<br>

  Book Title: Allegory and Philosophy in Avicenna (Ibn Sina)-With a Translation of the Book of the Prophet Muhammad's Ascent to Heaven<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Heath Peter<br>
  Abstract: Islamic allegory is the product of a cohesive literary tradition to which few contributed as significantly as Ibn Sina (Avicenna), the eleventh-century Muslim philosopher. Peter Heath here offers a detailed examination of Avicenna's contribution, paying special attention to Avicenna's psychology and poetics and to the ways in which they influenced strains of theological, mystical, and literary thought in subsequent Islamic-and Western-intellectual and religious history. Heath begins by showing how Avicenna's writings fit into the context and general history of Islamic allegory and explores the interaction among allegory, allegoresis, and philosophy in Avicenna's thought. He then provides a brief introduction to Avicenna as an historical figure. From there, he examines the ways in which Avicenna's cosmological, psychological, and epistemological theories find parallel, if diverse, expression in the disparate formats of philosophical and allegorical narration. Included in this book is an illustration of Avicenna's allegorical practice. This takes the form of a translation of the Mi'raj Nama (The Book of the Prophet Muhammad's Ascent to Heaven), a short treatise in Persian generally attributed to Avicenna. The text concludes with an investigation of the literary dimension Avicenna's allegorical theory and practice by examining his use of description metaphor. Allegory and Philosophy in Avicenna is an original and important work that breaks new ground by applying the techniques of modern literary criticism to the study of Medieval Islamic philosophy. It will be of interest to scholars and students of medieval Islamic and Western literature and philosophy.<br>

  Author(s): Weststeijn Thijs<br>
  Abstract: This book is the first step towards the development of a comparative history of the humanities. Specialists in philology, musicology, art history, linguistics, literary theory, and other disciplines highlight the intertwining of the various fields and their impact on the sciences. This first volume in the series The Making of the Humanities focuses on the early modern period. Different perspectives reveal how the humanities developed from the 'liberal arts', via the curriculum of humanistic schools, to modern disciplines. The authors show in particular how discoveries in the humanities contributed to a secular world view, pointing up connections with the scientific revolution. The main themes are: the humanities versus the sciences; the visual arts as liberal arts; humanism and heresy; language and poetics; linguists and logicians; philology and philosophy; the history of history. Contributions come from a selection of internationally renowned European and American scholars, including Floris Cohen, David Cram, and Ingrid Rowland. The book offers a wealth of insights for specialists, students, and those interested in the humanities in a broad sense. This title is available in the OAPEN Library - http://www.oapen.org.<br>

  Book Title: The Children's Table-Childhood Studies and the Humanities<br>
  Publisher: University of Georgia Press<br>
  Author(s): DUANE ANNA MAE<br>
  Abstract: Like the occupants of the children's table at a family dinner, scholars working in childhood studies can seem sidelined from the "adult" labor of humanities scholarship. The Children's Table brings together scholars from architecture, philosophy, law, and literary and cultural criticism to provide an overview of the innovative work being done in childhood studies-a transcript of what is being said at the children's table. Together, these scholars argue for rethinking the academic seating arrangement in a way that acknowledges the centrality of childhood to the work of the humanities. The figure we now recognize as a child was created in tandem with forms of modernity that the Enlightenment generated and that the humanities are now working to rethink. Thus the growth of childhood studies allows for new approaches to some of the most important and provocative issues in humanities scholarship: the viability of the social contract, the definition of agency, the performance of identity, and the construction of gender, sexuality, and race. Because defining childhood is a means of defining and distributing power and obligation, studying childhood requires a radically altered approach to what constitutes knowledge about the human subject. The diverse essays in The Children's Table share a unifying premise: to include the child in any field of study realigns the shape of that field, changing the terms of inquiry and forcing a different set of questions. Taken as a whole, the essays argue that, at this key moment in the state of the humanities, rethinking the child is both necessary and revolutionary.

  Author(s): Flescher Andrew Michael<br>
  Abstract: The idea of moral evil has always held a special place in philosophy and theology because the existence of evil has implications for the dignity of the human and the limits of human action. Andrew M. Flescher proposes four interpretations of evil, drawing on philosophical and theological sources and using them to trace through history the moral traditions that are associated with them.The first model, evil as the presence of badness, offers a traditional dualistic model represented by Manicheanism. The second, evil leading to goodness through suffering, presents a theological interpretation known as theodicy. Absence of badness-that is, evil as a social construction-is the third model. The fourth, evil as the absence of goodness, describes when evil exists in lieu of the good-the "privation" thesis staked out nearly two millennia ago by Christian theologian St. Augustine. Flescher extends this fourth model-evil as privation-into a fifth, which incorporates a virtue ethic. Drawing original connections between Augustine and Aristotle, Flescher's fifth model emphasizes the formation of altruistic habits that can lead us to better moral choices throughout our lives.Flescher eschews the temptation to think of human agents who commit evil as outside the norm of human experience. Instead, through the honing of moral skills and the practice of attending to the needs of others to a greater degree than we currently do, Flescher offers a plausible and hopeful approach to the reality of moral evil.<br>

  Book Title: Philosophy of Communication-  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Butchart Garnet C.<br>
  Abstract: To philosophize is to communicate philosophically. From its inception, philosophy has communicated forcefully. Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle talk a lot, and talk ardently. Because philosophy and communication have belonged together from the beginning--and because philosophy comes into its own and solidifies its stance through communication--it is logical that we subject communication to philosophical investigation. This collection of key works of classical, modern, and contemporary philosophers brings communication back into philosophy's orbit. It is the first anthology to gather in a single volume foundational works that address the core questions, concepts, and problems of communication in philosophical terms. The editors have chosen thirty-two selections from the work of Plato, Leibniz, Hegel, Husserl, Heidegger, Wittgenstein, Benjamin, Lacan, Derrida, Sloterdijk, and others. They have organized these texts thematically, rather than historically, in seven sections: consciousness; intersubjective understanding; language; writing and context; difference and subjectivity; gift and exchange; and communicability and community. Taken together, these texts not only lay the foundation for establishing communication as a distinct philosophical topic but also provide an outline of what philosophy of communication might look like.<br>

  Abstract: The correlation between

The comprehension of being—the semantics of this verb—would thus be the very possibility of or the occasion for wisdom and the wise and, as such, isfirst philosophy. The intellectual, and even spiritual life, of the West, through the priority it gives to knowledge identified with Spirit, demonstrates its fidelity to the first philosophy of Aristotle, whether one interprets the latter according to the ontology of book Γ of theMetaphysicsor<br>

  Book Title: The Machine Question-Critical Perspectives on AI, Robots, and Ethics<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Gunkel David J.<br>
  Abstract: One of the enduring concerns of moral philosophy is deciding who or what is deserving of ethical consideration. Much recent attention has been devoted to the "animal question" -- consideration of the moral status of nonhuman animals. In this book, David Gunkel takes up the "machine question": whether and to what extent intelligent and autonomous machines of our own making can be considered to have legitimate moral responsibilities and any legitimate claim to moral consideration. The machine question poses a fundamental challenge to moral thinking, questioning the traditional philosophical conceptualization of technology as a tool or instrument to be used by human agents. Gunkel begins by addressing the question of machine moral agency: whether a machine might be considered a legitimate moral agent that could be held responsible for decisions and actions. He then approaches the machine question from the other side, considering whether a machine might be a moral patient due legitimate moral consideration. Finally, Gunkel considers some recent innovations in moral philosophy and critical theory that complicate the machine question, deconstructing the binary agent--patient opposition itself. Technological advances may prompt us to wonder if the science fiction of computers and robots whose actions affect their human companions (think of HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey) could become science fact. Gunkel's argument promises to influence future considerations of ethics, ourselves, and the other entities who inhabit this world.<br>

  Abstract: Moral philosophy has typically, in one way or another, made exclusive decisions about who is and who is not a legitimate moral agent and/or patient. We have, in effect, sought to determine the line dividing who or what is considered a member of the community of moral subjects from who or what remains outside. And we have done so by, as Thomas Birch (1993, 315) explains, assuming “that we can and ought to find, formulate, establish, institute in our practices, a criterion for (a proof schema of) membership in the class of beings that are moral

Ricoeur’s analysis is anchored to the established phenomenological precepts of Kant and Husserl, for in order that metaphor may refer, its transgressive character must ultimately be tamed by the master discourse of philosophy. However, according to Jacques Derrida’s deconstructive practice, the philosopher’s discourse is itself shot through with metaphor. It<br>

  Book Title: Varieties of World Making-Beyond Globalization<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): WAGNER PETER<br>
  Abstract: Globalization has been the topic of heated debate in recent years, with one side asserting that it will produce a better standard of living for people around the world, and a fierce opposition arguing that it will ultimately lead to greater poverty and the destruction of unique human cultures. Varieties of World Making tackles the issue from a different angle, proposing that the contemporary global network of business, politics and culture be viewed from the inter-disciplinary perspective of ‘world making’. Drawn from the ranks of sociology, law, international relations, political philosophy and history, the distinguished contributors cut through polarized rhetoric to examine the current global situation. Their proposed diagnoses draw upon thoughtful analyses of various political dilemmas whose ripple effects are felt around the world, such as the volatile relationship between Islam and Europe, or the legal foundations for a true international order absent in the shadows of imperialism. Varieties of World Making will be an essential resource for all those grappling with the complex consequences of globalization for the future.<br>

  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): FRAITURE PIERRE-PHILIPPE<br>
  Abstract: VY Mudimbe: Undisciplined Africanism is the first English-language monograph dedicated to the work of Valentin Yves Mudimbe. This book charts the intellectual history of the seminal Congolese philosopher, epistemologist, and philologist from the late 1960s to the present day, exploring his major essays and novels. Pierre-Philippe Fraiture highlights Mudimbe’s trajectory through major debates on African nationalism, Panafricanism, neo-colonialism, negritude, pedagogy, Christianisation, decolonisation, anthropology, postcolonial representations, and a variety of other subjects, using these as contexts for close readings of many of Mudimbe’s texts, both influential and lesser-known. The book demonstrates that Mudimbe’s intellectual career has been informed by a series of decisive dialogues with some of the key exponents of Africanism (Herodotus, EW Blyden, Placide Tempels), continental and postcolonial thought (Jean-Paul Sartre, Frantz Fanon, Michel Foucault, and Claude Lévi-Strauss), and African thought and philosophy from Africa and the diaspora (L.S.

With the expansion of the medical humanities and the development of ‘narrative medicine’, medical practitioners have looked to other disciplines – literary analysis, philosophy, history and anthropology – for models and metaphors by which to express the experiences of patients, carers and clinicians. The attraction of the notion of rite of passage is obvious, offering a versatile means of expressing a range of phenomena including:<br>

  Book Title: Heidegger and the Thinking of Place-Explorations in the Topology of Being<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Malpas Jeff<br>
  Abstract: The idea of place--topos--runs through Martin Heidegger's thinking almost from the very start. It can be seen not only in his attachment to the famous hut in Todtnauberg but in his constant deployment of topological terms and images and in the situated, "placed" character of his thought and of its major themes and motifs. Heidegger's work, argues Jeff Malpas, exemplifies the practice of "philosophical topology." In Heidegger and the Thinking of Place, Malpas examines the topological aspects of Heidegger's thought and offers a broader elaboration of the philosophical significance of place. Doing so, he provides a distinct and productive approach to Heidegger as well as a new reading of other key figures--notably Kant, Aristotle, Gadamer, and Davidson, but also Benjamin, Arendt, and Camus. Malpas, expanding arguments he made in his earlier book Heidegger's Topology (MIT Press, 2007), discusses such topics as the role of place in philosophical thinking, the topological character of the transcendental, the convergence of Heideggerian topology with Davidsonian triangulation, the necessity of mortality in the possibility of human life, the role of materiality in the working of art, the significance of nostalgia, and the nature of philosophy as beginning in wonder. Philosophy, Malpas argues, begins in wonder and begins in place and the experience of place. The place of wonder, of philosophy, of questioning, he writes, is the very topos of thinking.<br>

  Abstract: There can be little dispute that culture influences philosophy: we see this in the way that classical Greek culture influenced Greek philosophy, that Christianity influenced mediaeval western philosophy, that French culture influenced a range of philosophies in France from Cartesianism to post-modernism, and so on. Yet many philosophical texts and traditions have also been introduced into very different cultures and philosophical traditions than their cultures of origin – through war and colonialization, but also through religion and art, and through commercial relations and globalization. And this raises questions such as: What is it to do French philosophy in Africa, or Analytic philosophy in India, or Buddhist philosophy in North America? This volume examines the phenomenon of the ‘migration’ of philosophical texts and traditions into other cultures, identifies places where it may have succeeded, but also where it has not, and discusses what is presupposed in introducing a text or a tradition into another intellectual culture.<br>

In light of this fact, it is remarkable that there should be so little dialogue between historians of philosophy (including those who study political and religious philosophy) and intellectual historians, particularly with respect to study of ‘non-Western’ thought systems or world views. A common tendency among intellectual historians today is to reduce history of philosophy to a minor province of philosophical hermeneutics.

  Abstract: Jerome McGann's manifesto argues that the history of texts and how they are preserved and accessed for interpretation are the overriding subjects of humanist study in the digital age. Theory and philosophy no longer suffice as an intellectual framework. But philology--out of fashion for decades--models these concerns with surprising fidelity.<br>

  Abstract: Just about a hundred years before Lyotard and the Paris VIII philosophy department tried to reform both the theory and practice of humanities education and knowledge research, a famous controversy broke out in Germany around the same issues. The publication of Nietzsche’s
                  The Birth of Tragedy(1872) provoked Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff to a sharp attack—at once witty, trenchant, and ad hominem. Nearly everyone agrees that Wilamowitz largely swept the field. In a confident if nasty peroration, he called for Nietzsche’s resignation as professor of philology at the University of Basel. Six years later Nietzsche did just that, shaking dryasdust<br>

  Abstract: From the later Unamuno’s perspective, science holds a position of primacy in European culture, a fact that permanently distances Spain from Europe. The “tragic feeling of life” results from the most difficult question ever to face philosophy: how to justify its pursuit of reason as a worthy facet of a life well lived. For Unamuno, reason alone can provide only intellectual, not emotive or spiritual, fulfillment: “el más trágico problema de la filosofía es el de conciliar las necesidades intelectuales con las necesidades afectivas y con las volitivas”

  Book Title: A Jesuit Garden in Beijing and Early Modern Chinese Culture-  Publisher: Purdue University Press<br>
  Author(s): Zou Hui<br>
  Abstract: In this volume, Hui Zou analyzes historical, architectural, visual, literary, and philosophical perspectives on the Western-styled garden that formed part of the great Yuanming Yuan complex in Beijing, constructed during the Qing dynasty. Designed and built in the late eighteenth century by Italian and French Jesuits, the garden described in this book was a wonderland of multistoried buildings, fountains, labyrinths, and geometrical hills. It even included an open-air theater. Through detailed examination of historical literature and representations, Zou analyzes the ways in which the Jesuits accommodated their design within the Chinese cultural context. He shows how an especially important element of their approach was the application of a linear perspective—the “line-method”—to create the jing, the Chinese concept of the bounded bright view of a garden scene. Hui Zou’s book demonstrates how Jesuit metaphysics fused with Chinese cosmology and broadens our understanding of cultural and religious encounters in early Chinese modernity. It presents an intriguing reflection on the interaction between Western metaphysics and the poetical tradition of Chinese culture. The volume will be of interest to scholars and students in a variety of fields, including literature, philosophy, architecture, landscape and urban studies, and East-West comparative cultural studies.<br>

On the one hand, we are faced with problems of methods and the cultural consequences of historical representation; on the other hand, there are questions related to certain claims made by scholars of contemporary philosophy of history, asserting the relative character of historical representation. According to this relativist perspective—expressed most clearly in Hayden White's "metahistory"—any kind of historical narrative is legitimate, or more precisely, there is no external viewpoint from which any of these<br>

  Abstract: With
      Japanese Philosophy: A Sourcebook,readers of English can now access in a single volume the richness and diversity of Japanese philosophy as it has developed throughout history. Leading scholars in the field have translated selections from the writings of more than a hundred philosophical thinkers from all eras and schools of thought, many of them available in English for the first time.TheSourcebookeditors have set out to represent the entire Japanese philosophical tradition-not only the broad spectrum of academic philosophy dating from the introduction of Western philosophy in the latter part of the nineteenth century, but also the philosophical ideas of major Japanese traditions of Buddhism, Confucianism, and Shinto. The philosophical significance of each tradition is laid out in an extensive overview, and each selection is accompanied by a brief biographical sketch of its author and helpful information on placing the work in its proper context. The bulk of the supporting material, which comprises nearly a quarter of the volume, is given to original interpretive essays on topics not explicitly covered in other chapters: cultural identity, samurai thought, women philosophers, aesthetics, bioethics.An introductory chapter provides a historical overview of Japanese philosophy and a discussion of the Japanese debate over defining the idea of philosophy, both of which help explain the rationale behind the design of the Sourcebook. An exhaustive glossary of technical terminology, a chronology of authors, and a thematic index are appended. Specialists will find information related to original sources and sinographs for Japanese names and terms in a comprehensive bibliography and general index.Handsomely presented and clearly organized for ease of use,Japanese Philosophy: A Sourcebookwill be a cornerstone in Japanese studies for decades to come.

  Abstract: Over his distinguished career as a European intellectual historian and cultural critic, Martin Jay has explored a variety of major themes: the Frankfurt School, the exile of German intellectuals in America during the Nazi era, Western Marxism, the denigration of vision in twentieth-century French thought, the discourse of experience in modern Europe and America, and lying in politics.

Several essays focus on methodological debates in the humanities and social sciences: the limits of interdisciplinarity, the issue of national or universal philosophy, cultural relativism and visuality, and the implications of periodization in historical narrative. Others examine the concept of "scopic regime" and the metaphors of revolution and the gardening impulse. Among the theorists treated at length are Theodor Adorno, Hannah Arendt, Jacques Derrida, and Michel Foucault. The essays also include several of Jay'sSalmagundicolumns, dealing with subjects as varied as the new Museum of Modern Art in New York, the impact of Colin Wilson's The Outsider, and the demise of thePartisan Review.<br>

Many traditional as well as current approaches regard political thought as the area in which issues of moral philosophy pertaining to political entities are aired, with the objective of setting defining ethical and validating criteria that are then to be applied to political practice. A grounding of this view may be found in Kant, for whom individuals were subjected to clear and unequivocal moral duties and were

He links their interest in symbolism to the importance of divination and magic in ancient times, and he demonstrates how important symbolism became when they thought about religion and philosophy. "They see the whole of great poetic language as deeply figurative," he writes, "with the potential always, even in the most mundane details, to be freighted with hidden messages."<br>

  Abstract: Geertz, who once considered a career in philosophy, begins by explaining how he got swept into the revolutionary movement of symbolic anthropology. At that point, his work began to encompass not only the ethnography of groups in Southeast Asia and North Africa, but also the study of how meaning is made in all cultures--or, to use his phrase, to explore the "frames of meaning" in which people everywhere live out their lives. His philosophical orientation helped him to establish the role of anthropology within broader intellectual circles and led him to address the work of such leading thinkers as Charles Taylor, Thomas Kuhn, William James, and Jerome Bruner. In this volume, Geertz comments on their work as he explores questions in political philosophy, psychology, and religion that have intrigued him throughout his career but that now hold particular relevance in light of postmodernist thinking and multiculturalism.

A final essay examines why this advocate of a "tranquil universal philosophy" ended up being burned at the stake as a heretic by the Roman Inquisition. While the essays take many different approaches, they are united by a number of assumptions: that, although well versed in magic, Bruno cannot be defined primarily as a Renaissance Magus; that his aim was to articulate a new philosophy of nature; and that his thought, while based on ancient and medieval sources, represented a radical rupture with the philosophical schools of the past, helping forge a path toward a new modernity.<br>

  Abstract: Mimesis is one of the oldest, most fundamental concepts in Western aesthetics. This book offers a new, searching treatment of its long history at the center of theories of representational art: above all, in the highly influential writings of Plato and Aristotle, but also in later Greco-Roman philosophy and criticism, and subsequently in many areas of aesthetic controversy from the Renaissance to the twentieth century. Combining classical scholarship, philosophical analysis, and the history of ideas--and ranging across discussion of poetry, painting, and music--Stephen Halliwell shows with a wealth of detail how mimesis, at all stages of its evolution, has been a more complex, variable concept than its conventional translation of "imitation" can now convey.<br>

  Book Title: Freud, the Reluctant Philosopher-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Tauber Alfred I.<br>
  Abstract: Freud began university intending to study both medicine and philosophy. But he was ambivalent about philosophy, regarding it as metaphysical, too limited to the conscious mind, and ignorant of empirical knowledge. Yet his private correspondence and his writings on culture and history reveal that he never forsook his original philosophical ambitions. Indeed, while Freud remained firmly committed to positivist ideals, his thought was permeated with other aspects of German philosophy. Placed in dialogue with his intellectual contemporaries, Freud appears as a reluctant philosopher who failed to recognize his own metaphysical commitments, thereby crippling the defense of his theory and misrepresenting his true achievement. Recasting Freud as an inspired humanist and reconceiving psychoanalysis as a form of moral inquiry, Alfred Tauber argues that Freudianism still offers a rich approach to self-inquiry, one that reaffirms the enduring task of philosophy and many of the abiding ethical values of Western civilization.<br>

  KANT, NIETZSCHE, AND FREUD from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rrpr">Freud, the Reluctant Philosopher</a><br>
  Abstract: Freud’s disavowals about philosophy do not absolve him from complex philosophical debts: Indeed, Freud (and later commentators) have failed to explain how the origins of psychoanalytical theory began with a positivistic investment without recognizing a dual epistemological commitment. Simply, Freud engaged positivism because he believed it generally equated with empiricism, which he valued, and he rejected “philosophy,” and, more specifically, Kantianism, because of the associated “transcendental” qualities of its epistemology. But the relationship between Freud and Kant is not so simple.<br>

  Book Title: Plato's Fable-On the Mortal Condition in Shadowy Times<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mitchell Joshua<br>
  Abstract: Plato's Fableis not simply a work of textual exegesis. It is an attempt to move debates within political theory beyond their current location. Mitchell recovers insights about the depth of the problem of mortal imitation from Plato's magnificent work, and seeks to explicate the meaning of Plato's central claim--that "only philosophy can save us."<br>

  Book Title: Contesting Spirit-Nietzsche, Affirmation, Religion<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROBERTS TYLER T.<br>
  Abstract: Nietzsche criticizes the ascetic hatred of the body and this-worldly life, yet engages in rigorous practices of self-denial--he sees philosophy as such a practice--and affirms the need of imposing suffering on oneself in order to enhance the spirit. He dismisses the "intoxication" of mysticism, yet links mysticism, power, and creativity, and describes his own self-transcending experiences. The tensions in his relation to religion are closely related to that between negation and affirmation in his thinking in general. In Roberts's view, Nietzsche's transfigurations of religion offer resources for a postmodern religious imagination. Though as a "master of suspicion," Nietzsche, with Freud and Marx, is an integral part of modern antireligion, he has the power to take us beyond the flat, modern distinction between the secular and the religious--a distinction that, at the end of modernity, begs to be reexamined.<br>

  Abstract: In the 1886 preface to his first book,
                  The Birth of Tragedy(originally published in 1872), Nietzsche offered a critical review of that book’s attempt to grapple with the question, What is the value of existence? By 1886 the significance of the question had changed for him, yet it continued to occupy his reflections on affirmation. The new preface recalls how he had tried to pose the problem of the value of existence by contrasting the “pessimism” of Greek tragedy and the “optimism” of Socratic philosophy. Nietzsche had claimed that with the demise of tragic sensibility Western culture had lost<br>

  Abstract: Through no fault of his own, Michel Foucault missed out on May 1968. When the explosion erupted, he was hundreds of miles away teaching philosophy at the University of Tunis. Nonetheless, the May events had a profound effect on Foucault’s intellectual and political trajectory. Foucault himself acknowledged as much, observing that May was the unanticipated “political opening” that gave him the courage to investigate the mechanisms of power operating in Western societies and to “pursue [his] research in the direction of penal theory, prisons, and disciplines.”¹<br>

  Book Title: Modernity's Wager-Authority, the Self, and Transcendence<br>

  Abstract: Adam Seligman, one of our most important social thinkers, continues the incisive critique of modernity he began in his previously acclaimed
         The Idea of Civil SocietyandThe Problem of Trust.In this provocative new work of social philosophy, Seligman evaluates modernity's wager, namely, the gambit to liberate the modern individual from external social and religious norms by supplanting them with the rational self as its own moral authority. Yet far from ensuring the freedom of the individual, Seligman argues, "the fundamentalist doctrine of enlightened reason has called into being its own nemesis" in the forms of ethnic, racial, and identity politics. Seligman counters that the modern human must recover a notion of authority that is essentially transcendent, but which extends tolerance to those of other--or no--faiths.<br>

This question reads like one of those conundrums in philosophy, prompting the reflective to ask, “Who is this ‘I,’ then?” As an instance of discourse in an autobiography, it seems doubly problematic, for autobiography is nothing if not a referential art, and the self or subject is its principal referent.

  Book Title: Politics and the Imagination-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Geuss Raymond<br>
  Abstract: In politics, utopians do not have a monopoly on imagination. Even the most conservative defenses of the status quo, Raymond Geuss argues, require imaginative acts of some kind. In this collection of recent essays, including his most overtly political writing yet, Geuss explores the role of imagination in politics, particularly how imaginative constructs interact with political reality. He uses decisions about the war in Iraq to explore the peculiar ways in which politicians can be deluded and citizens can misunderstand their leaders. He also examines critically what he sees as one of the most serious delusions of western political thinking--the idea that a human society is always best conceived as a closed system obeying fixed rules. And, in essays on
      Don Quixote, museums, Celan's poetry, Heidegger's brother Fritz, Richard Rorty, and bourgeois philosophy, Geuss reflects on how cultural artifacts can lead us to embrace or reject conventional assumptions about the world. While paying particular attention to the relative political roles played by rule-following, utilitarian calculations of interest, and aspirations to lead a collective life of a certain kind, Geuss discusses a wide range of related issues, including the distance critics need from their political systems, the extent to which history can enlighten politics, and the possibility of utopian thinking in a world in which action retains its urgency.<br>

  Abstract: Philosophers are at a serious disadvantage when it comes to understanding politics, and it is a disadvantage that results from the very peculiarity of their special vocation and training. From almost the very beginning of its existence as a distinct activity, Western philosophy has been committed to certain principles of at least minimal self-awareness, clarity, coherence, and consistency of thought, speech, valuation, and action. Socrates, who notoriously took no part in city politics beyond what was strictly required of him by his obligations as a citizen, also started philosophy down the path of exhortation to

  Book Title: Circles Disturbed-The Interplay of Mathematics and Narrative<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): MAZUR BARRY<br>
  Abstract: Circles Disturbedbrings together important thinkers in mathematics, history, and philosophy to explore the relationship between mathematics and narrative. The book's title recalls the last words of the great Greek mathematician Archimedes before he was slain by a Roman soldier--"Don't disturb my circles"--words that seem to refer to two radically different concerns: that of the practical person living in the concrete world of reality, and that of the theoretician lost in a world of abstraction. Stories and theorems are, in a sense, the natural languages of these two worlds--stories representing the way we act and interact, and theorems giving us pure thought, distilled from the hustle and bustle of reality. Yet, though the voices of stories and theorems seem totally different, they share profound connections and similarities.<br>

  Abstract: Mathematics has been and still is commonly viewed as independent, at least essentially or constitutively independent, of narrative or other purportedly literary or rhetorical elements, such as metaphor.¹ Indeed, this independence has been deemed to be especially characteristic of mathematics as against other sciences or philosophy, which also aspire and claim to be able, sometimes on the model of mathematics, to dispense with the constitutive role of such elements. Their auxiliary, such as pedagogical, role has always been acknowledged and, more recently, investigated in historical and sociological studies of mathematics and science, for example, in considering how narrative is used<br>

  Book Title: Sung Dynasty Uses of the I Ching-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wyatt Don J.<br>
  Abstract: The
         I Ching, or Book of Changes, has been one of the two or three most influential books in the Chinese canon. It has been used by people on all levels of society, both as a method of divination and as a source of essential ideas about the nature of heaven, earth, and humankind. During the eleventh and twelfth centuries, Sung dynasty literati turned to it for guidance in their fundamental reworking of the classical traditions. This book explores how four leading thinkers--Su Shih, Shao Yung, Ch'eng I, and Chu Hsi--applied theI Chingto these projects. These four men used the Book of Changes in strikingly different ways. Yet each claimed to find in it a sure foundation for human values. Their work established not only new meanings for the text but also new models for governance and moral philosophy that would be debated throughout the next thousand years of Chinese intellectual history. By focusing on their uses of theI Ching, this study casts a unique light on the complex continuity-within-change and rich diversity of Sung culture.<br>

These men sought to define the relationship between the natural world of heaven-and-earth (

Furthermore, this sentence, and Eliot’s general dependence upon the idea of wholeness and the “systematic” nature of truth, reveal his strong reliance upon nineteenth-century traditions in both philosophy and poetry.<br>

  Abstract: Merleau-Ponty offers us an existentialist philosophy that understands our freedom and responsibility as inseparable from our embodiment. Though he does not explicitly and systematically articulate an ethics, his notion of embodiment nonetheless implies a certain existentialist ethics. For, according to Merleau-Ponty, to be embodied is to be inherently in relation to others, and thus, as I will argue, it is to be implicated in and moved by an imperative to strive for mutual recognition. This paper seeks to elucidate this embodied ethics of mutual recognition.<br>

  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Thomson Eoin S.<br>
  Abstract: The Distant Relation breaks down the artificial division between philosophy and literature by weaving contemporary philosophic arguments through close readings of Carpentier, Rulfo, Paz, and Garcia Marquez. Thomson draws the reader into the largely uninhabited space between philosophy and literature, providing new critical strategies that allow text and reader to respond to the very distance they share. These strategies involve a reconceptualization of distance that recognizes the productive and affirmative nature of separation.<br>

  Abstract: Hubris or chutzpah? The successful philosopher, it seems, must have a bit of both. For despite the number of rival conceptions of philosophy on offer today, almost everyone recognizes that to philosophize, even when the results of doing so mean that one ends up rejecting philosophy, involves making claims of the greatest scope and generality. Whether these are understood to be universally or more locally relevant is, of course, one of the central issues at stake in the contemporary debates. But even those who emphasize philosophy’s limitations tend to do so with reference to
                  allphilosophy and philosophers, everywhere. That,<br>

  Author(s) Darby Tom<br>
  Abstract: In the immense secondary literature on Nietzsche relatively little attention seems to have been paid to the influence of kynic motives and ideas on both the form and substance of his philosophy. This is the case despite the fact that Nietzsche explicitly associated himself with Kynism¹ in a number of aphorisms,² while at the same time adopting the literary style,³ the manner of philosophizing, as well as important concepts and figures⁴ of this school of antiquity. A close examination of the main philosophical project of Nietzsche, the transvaluation of values, moreover, reveals his kinship with the intention of Kynism to<br>

  Abstract: TO STRIVE TO UNDERSTAND the significance of the physical world is to enter into the discourse of natural philosophy. This discourse holds a privileged yet variegated position in the flux of Western thought, and studying the various meanings that natural philosophy has attributed to the world throughout the epochs reveals how humankind has placed itself in its self-defined cosmos. Such study also reveals, however, that the human subject has always been an integral part of that cosmos and that this integration has rooted culture to

  Abstract: “Ontology” is not a widely used word or concept in contemporary philosophy. The dominance of the perspectives of formal logic and linguistic analysis in the schools of philosophy in the academic scene has largely relegated traditional metaphysics and its interest in ontology to a purely historical account of the past. But some scientists and philosophers of science have not been satisfied with the reduction of truth to matters of formal methodology and abstractions expressed in mathematical formulae.

  Abstract: Moving away from Jacques Derrida's deconstructionism and Paul Ricoeur's hermeneutics, and building on his experiences as a politician, Vattimo asks if it is still possible to speak of moral imperatives, individual rights, and political freedom. Acknowledging the force of Nietzsche's "God is dead," Vattimo argues for a philosophy of pensiero debole or "weak thinking" that shows how moral values can exist without being guaranteed by an external authority. His secularising interpretation stresses anti-metaphysical elements and puts philosophy into a relationship with postmodern culture.<br>

  Book Title: Philosophy of Merleau-Ponty-  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Matthews Eric<br>
  Abstract: In this clear and comprehensive account of Merleau-Ponty's thought Eric Matthews shows how Merleau-Ponty has contributed to current debates in philosophy, such as the nature of consciousness, the relation between biology and personality, the historical understanding of human thought and society, and many others. Surveying the whole range of Merleau-Ponty's thinking, Matthews examines his views about the nature of phenomenology and the primacy of perception; his account of human embodiment, being-in-the-world, and the understanding of human behaviour; his conception of the self and its relation to other selves; and his views on society, politics, and the arts. A final chapter considers his later thought, published posthumously. The ideas of Merleau-Ponty are of immensely important to the development of modern French philosophy. Matthews evaluates his distinctive contributions and relates his thought to that of his predecessors, contemporaries, and successors, both in France and elsewhere. This unrivalled introduction will be welcomed by analytic philosophers and cognitive scientists as well as all students taking courses in contemporary continental philosophy.<br>

  Book Title: The Sense of the Universe-Philosophical Explication of Theological Commitment in Modern Cosmology<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Nesteruk Alexei V.<br>
  Abstract: The Sense of the Universe deals with existential and phenomenological reflection upon modern cosmology with the aim to reveal hidden theological commitments in cosmology related to the mystery of human existence. The book proposes a new approach to the dialogue between science and theology based in a thorough philosophical analysis of acting forms of subjectivity involved in the study of the world and in religious experience. The uniqueness of this book is that it uses recent advances in phenomenological philosophy and philosophical theology in order to accentuate the existential meaning of cosmology as the discourse that ultimately explicates the human condition. The objective of the book is not to make a comparative analysis of the cosmological scientific narrative and that of the Bible, or the Fathers of the Church (in what concerns the structure of the universe), but to reveal the presence of a hidden theological dimension in cosmology originating in the God-given ability of humanity to discern and disclose the sense of creation. The book contributes to the synthesis of appropriation and incorporation of modern philosophical ideas in Christian theology, in particular its Eastern Orthodox form.<br>

Rhetoric in its conventional guise has been deemed a quintessentially public enterprise, oriented to the marketplace of propositions projected to appeal to others. In the market square of civil discourse, sellers of ideas invite prospective buyers to critically test the proffered wares for plausibility and persuasiveness.

  Book Title: Melanesian Odysseys-Negotiating the Self, Narrative, and Modernity<br>

  Abstract: In a series of epic self-narratives ranging from traditional cultural embodiments to picaresque adventures, Christian epiphanies and a host of interactive strategies and techniques for living, Kewa Highlanders (PNG) attempt to shape and control their selves and their relentlessly changing world. This lively account transcends ethnographic particularity and offers a wide-reaching perspective on the nature of being human. Inverting the analytic logic of her previous work, which sought to uncover what social structures concealed, Josephides focuses instead on the cultural understandings that people make explicit in their actions and speech. Using approaches from philosophy and anthropology, she examines elicitation (how people create their selves and their worlds in the act of making explicit) and mimesis (how anthropologists produce ethnographies), to arrive at an unexpected conclusion: that knowledge of self and other alike derives from self-externalization rather than self-introspection.<br>

Among the many authors dealing with this subject, Farrell (1999) has examined rhetoric in terms of practice, and practice in terms of rhetoric, and his questions are very close to those I pose below.

  Author(s) Ames Michael M.<br>
  Abstract: In
                  The conflict of interpretations(1974), Paul Ricoeur makes a distinction between three types of knowledge based on their different epistemological ascriptions. These distinctions provide a useful starting point for discussion about the variants of anthropological discourse and their relationship with what I have termed elsewhere, ‘the three museologies’ (Shelton 1995b: 7). Briefly, Ricoeur distinguishes between what we might call a culture’s operative discourses, disciplinary regimes of knowledge, and critical philosophy. This latter practice subjects the first two narrative forms to analytical scrutiny or, to use a postmodernist idiom, fields a sustained ‘incredulity to meta-narratives’ (Lyotard 1984: xxiv).

At first sight, that is rather remarkable, because the question about how it should be done contrasts sharply with the blurred norms that are prevalent in postmodern society, as well as with the plurality of opinions and views that are consciously cultivated there. Perhaps it is because in the field of the history of education, there are no longer any “eminent examples”¹ that the question is put explicitly? There too, a diversity of approaches prevails.<br>

  Book Title: Origins and Ends of the Mind-Philosophical Essays on Psychoanalysis<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): Brassier Ray<br>
  Abstract: Psychoanalysis claims that the individual human mind is structured by its childhood relationships with its parents. But the theory of attachment, evolutionary psychology and contemporary philosophy of mind have all recently re-introduced new dimensions of innateness into mental development and pathology. If attachment is an instinct, then what is the psychological status of the child's relation to the mother? If the mind is in part a product of evolution, then how far down do the inhibitory mechanisms of the mind go? If the mind of the child is shaped by their encounter with a set of prohibitions, how, in the light of contemporary 'cognitive science' and philosophy of mind, can the child be conceived as 'taking on' a rule? How is the construction of the mind related to the normative ends of cognitive experience? Today, it is Lacanian psychoanalysis which most vigorously defends psychoanalytic theory and practice from the encroachment of the biological and 'cognitive' sciences. But a paradigm shift nevertheless appears to be underway, in which the classical psychoanalytic theories about the Oedipus complex, primary and secondary repression, sexual difference and psychosexuality, the role of symbols,etc, are being dismantled and reintegrated into a new synthesis of biological and psychological theories. In this collection of theoretical essays by philosophers and psychoanalysts, encounters are brought about between Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalysis on the one hand, and attachment theory, evolutionary psychology and philosophy of mind on the other.<br>

  Abstract: Psychoanalysis has, from its origins, remained indifferent to or suspicious towards ontology. More precisely, the practice of psychoanalysis has not necessitated that clinical psychoanalysts intervene directly in ontological questioning, whether implicitly or explicitly. Even in the most volatile moments of its struggles to sustain itself as a singular practice, psychoanalysis has remained relatively unmoved in the face of the counter-claims, concepts and criticisms coming from philosophy — and,
                  a fortiori, from philosophical ontologies. Indeed, the reverse seems to have been the case: it is philosophers who have had to respond, with some urgency, to the challenges offered by psychoanalysis. However<br>

  Book Title: Scientific Understanding-Philosophical Perspectives<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Eigner Kai<br>
  Abstract: To most scientists, and to those interested in the sciences, understanding is the ultimate aim of scientific endeavor. In spite of this, understanding, and how it is achieved, has received little attention in recent philosophy of science.
      Scientific Understandingseeks to reverse this trend by providing original and in-depth accounts of the concept of understanding and its essential role in the scientific process. To this end, the chapters in this volume explore and develop three key topics: understanding and explanation, understanding and models, and understanding in scientific practice.Earlier philosophers, such as Carl Hempel, dismissed understanding as subjective and pragmatic. They believed that the essence of science was to be found in scientific theories and explanations. In Scientific Understanding, the contributors maintain that we must also consider the relation between explanations and the scientists who construct and use them. They focus on understanding as the cognitive state that is a goal of explanation and on the understanding of theories and models as a means to this end.The chapters in this book highlight the multifaceted nature of the process of scientific research. The contributors examine current uses of theory, models, simulations, and experiments to evaluate the degree to which these elements contribute to understanding. Their analyses pay due attention to the roles of intelligibility, tacit knowledge, and feelings of understanding. Furthermore, they investigate how understanding is obtained within diverse scientific disciplines and examine how the acquisition of understanding depends on specific contexts, the objects of study, and the stated aims of research.<br>

  Abstract: Since Thomas Kuhn’s characterization of science by means of a list of epistemic values that provide “
                     theshared basis for theory choice,” there is a debate in philosophy of science about what the epistemic values of science are (for example, Kuhn 1977; McMullin 1983; Longino 1990; Lacey 2005). Kuhn’s list comprised such values as empirical accuracy, consistency, scope, simplicity, and fruitfulness (Kuhn 1977, 321–22), which, as he argued, can be seen as constitutive of science. An enterprise could have different criteria for judging theories, but then it would not be science (331).<br>

  Abstract: IT IS IMPORTANT to acknowledge the contributions of Enrique Dussel, Iris Marion Young, and Achille Mbembe to the criticism of liberalism and modern reason. These three thinkers excavate the occult sites of Western philosophy, radically questioning their social integrity and viability and obstinately pointing to their flawed logic as ways of recognizing liberalism’s ethical obligation to unassimilable Otherness—Dussel in his reconsideration of modernity from its underside, Young in her all-out offensive against liberalism’s “innocent spaces” and “essentially contested concepts,” and Mbembe in his redefinition of sovereignty as necropolitics, the power to decide who lives and who dies.

  Book Title: Externalism-Putting Mind and World Back Together Again<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Rowlands Mark<br>
  Abstract: The externalist conception of the mind was one of the most significant developments in the philosophy of mind in the second half of the twentieth century. Despite its central importance, however, most recent work on externalism has been very technical, often making the basic ideas and principles difficult for students to grasp. As well, comparatively little work has been done to situate externalism in the history of philosophy, in either analytic and continental traditions. Mark Rowlands remedies both these problems, presenting a clear and accessible introduction to externalism that is grounded in wider developments in the history of philosophy. Rowlands discusses Sartre's radical reversal of idealism and the Husserlian views that prompted it; Wittgenstein's attack on the assimilation of meaning and understanding to an inner process; Putnam's and Burge's thought experiments and the externalism about content to which those experiments gave rise; the scope and limits of content externalism; and the extension of externalism to consciousness.<br>

  Abstract: As we saw in Chapter 3, what Kant referred to as his “Copernican revolution” in philosophy was motivated by the
                  matching problem.According to Kant, if our knowledge-acquiring faculties are capable of yielding knowledge of the world, as they certainly seem to be, then this must be because they must, in some way, match up to the world. There must be some sort offitormatchbetween the nature of our knowledge-acquiring faculties and the nature of the world. The question of how knowledge is possible, then, translates into a question about how this matching can occur. Kant’s answer<br>

By the close of the nineteenth century each nation possessed its own civility and interaction ethos.

  Abstract: Herder’s expressivist theory of language marks a distinctive break from the designative view of language held by both rationalists and empiricists in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Put simply, according to the designative view, a word is a sign that ‘stands in for’ by serving as a substitute, or kind of proxy, for the object or idea it represents.¹ It is predicated on the long-held belief in the hierarchical dependence of language on the prior existence of thought, a position known in philosophy as ‘internalism.’ Herder rejects the very possibility of non-symbolic thought and instead develops a view of language<br>

  Abstract: There is a common tendency to regard existentialism as a passing fad rather than as a valid philosophy. This has been largely due to the existentialist writers’ presentation of certain risqué themes as well as to the wide distribution of Sartre’s journalistic and artistic writings. However, this popularizing is due not to a desire for scandal only, but, more fundamentally, to the moral mission which Sartre has assigned himself, to bring as many men as possible to an awareness of themselves and of their freedom. Though there are elements in the philosophies of the non-Christian existentialists which encourage scandal and<br>

And what does the possibility of sudden death mean for our ability to understand the narrative of ourselves?For the first time, this collection brings together figures in contemporary philosophy and Kierkegaard studies to explore pressing questions like these in the philosophy of personal identity and moral psychology. These essays will both advance important ongoing discussions of selfhood and expand the light that, 200 years after his birth, Kierkegaard is still able to shed on contemporary problems.<br>

Inevitably, this is a categorisation that is difficult to define precisely, either historically or conceptually. Nevertheless, we can see many of the diverse movements and figures of the modernist breakthrough as sharing a concern to achieve a decisively unambiguous life, piercing through the superficial compromises of bourgeois society, looking reality in the face, and affirming the truth of iving personality.

  Abstract: Having provided an overview of the various ways we might read Levinas in relation to law, and the issues they raise, it is time to put forward the substantive argument of the book. This is the first of two concluding chapters making the argument that Levinas is best read as someone who offers us the possibility of thinking about ethics as perpetual critique of the law, rather than as a legal theorist. In other words, instead of using his work to think about how we inject ethics into law or unveil law’s ethical foundation, his philosophy provides resources to understand<br>

They helped her embrace the precariousness of a cultural expanse, symbolised by the city environment, where the philosopher is one with the archetype of the solitary artist lost in the crowd, where thinking and writing are experienced as a pressure coming from the outside: ‘I write what I can: that is, what’s given to me and what seems worth writing, by me’ (‘Singleness’ 259)<br>

  Abstract: African philosophy’s development in the twentieth century is both relatively recent, traceable to some seminal texts, and ancient, drawing on cultural forms that stretch back in time and space. This seeming contradiction can be understood if we realize that philosophy itself is ambiguous. It designates on one hand a set of reflective practices rooted in culture and reason, which rigorously and critically explicate a life-world, and on the other a discipline in the university, with a set of codes, standards, recognized practitioners, and customs. More than almost any other site of philosophy, African philosophy has struggled with the similarities and<br>

  Abstract: Aesthetics is one of the most intellectually stimulating and enriching fields of philosophical inquiry. This statement may sound a bit strange to anyone who is easily impressed by the longevity of ancient metaphysical problems or by the cutting-edge verve of recent empirically informed debates in the theory of consciousness, or by the applicative promise and popular demand of business ethics, and so tends to dismiss aesthetics as peripheral to philosophy.

  Abstract: Reflections on the relationships between one period of philosophy and another raise important methodological issues which first emerge in their modern form in the wake of Kant, Herder and other thinkers in the second half of the eighteenth century. This is the period in which the ramifications of the idea that philosophy is bound up with the historical circumstances of its production begin to be apparent. In the light of these ramifications, the apparently obvious aim of identifying anticipations or echoes of twentieth-century forms of philosophy in the nineteenth century is by no means as straightforward as it might at<br>

Evanescence is found in the ‘in-between’. The evanescent moment is defined as the event of ‘the philosophical realisation of the art of politics’ (Rancière 1995: 19). As these three trajectories of art, politics and philosophy coalesce to transform themselves as in-between discourse, they emancipate the evanescent moment from being an ideational or mythic impossible utopia, opening out the possibility of a realizable utopia.

  Abstract: We noted early in our opening chapter that in

  Book Title: Poetic Language-Theory and Practice from the Renaissance to the Present<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Jones Tom<br>
  Abstract: The discussions provide a jargon-free account of a wide range of historical and contemporary schools of thought about poetic language, and an organised, coherent critique of those schools (including analytical philosophy, cognitive poetics, structuralism and post-structuralism). Via close readings of whole poems from 1600 to the present readers are taken through a wide range of modernist, experimental and innovative poetries. Paired chapters within a chronological structure allow lecturers and students to approach the material in a variety of ways (by individual chapters, paired historical periods) that are appropriate to different courses.<br>

  Abstract: Fifty years ago a scan of bookshop shelves would have been as likely to find a dictionary of terms for alchemy as one for Christian philosophy. Indeed, one might well have thought that, though of course there were some Christian philosophers then, they were doomed to the same fate as the dodo. But, in a stunning reversal, today Christian philosophy is among the most vibrant areas of philosophy. While the story of that change is still being written, there are a few key factors. On the negative side, the last fifty years have seen the demise of some historically formidable<br>

  Abstract: What is radical democracy? Karl Marx’s definition of ‘radical’, from his 1844 ‘Introduction’ to
                  A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right, states that to be radical is ‘to grasp the root of the matter’ (Marx [1844] 1970: 137). Thus, ‘radical democracy’ means to grasp or draw out the root meaning or conditions of democracy that have been obscured in its various historical appropriations. Radical democrats argue that there are two central, intertwined and historically constituted root meanings or conditions of democracy: first, the free and equal participation of ‘the people’ (thedemos) in power (kratos); and,<br>

After many twists and turns, it gradually spread across all branches of modern knowledge: economics, animal ethics, morality, political science, and law. This ‘consequentialist’ moral theory focuses on an action’s consequences, and not on an action’s intention or intrinsic value. The theory recommends acting so that every being’s well-being increases.

  Abstract: The argument about the relationship between time and narrative is now coming into focus. It begins in the Kantian notion that we have no access to things in themselves, but only, as phenomenology holds, to things as they are experienced, apprehended in consciousness, thought about, or understood. But the concept of consciousness cannot be taken for granted. Philosophy in general, both in the phenomenological and in the Anglo-American analytical traditions, has turned to language in order to investigate the realms of experience, perception, thought and understanding. If consciousness is fundamentally linguistic, it follows that we ought to be able to<br>

  Abstract: Within much contemporary analytic philosophy of mind desires are conceived of primarily as the inner states which provide us, together with beliefs, with reasons for forming intentions and consequently acting. When linked with beliefs, such desires then cause us to act in appropriate ways. Desires therefore have a role both in providing premises for practical reasoning and a causal, functional role in terms of the agent’s behaviour. Weaving these two roles together has been one of the challenges of contemporary materialism. Within standard accounts of practical reasoning the agent derives an intention or proceeds to action on the basis of<br>

  Book Title: Phenomenology or Deconstruction?-The Question of Ontology in Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Paul Ricoeur and Jean-Luc Nancy<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Watkin Christopher<br>
  Abstract: Phenomenology or Deconstruction? challenges traditional understandings of the relationship between phenomenology and deconstruction through new readings of the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Paul Ricœur and Jean-Luc Nancy. A constant dialogue with Jacques Derrida's engagement with phenomenological themes provides the impetus to establishing a new understanding of 'being' and 'presence' that exposes significant blindspots inherent in traditional readings of both phenomenology and deconstruction.In reproducing neither a stock phenomenological reaction to deconstruction nor the routine deconstructive reading of phenomenology, Christopher Watkin provides a fresh assessment of the possibilities for the future of phenomenology, along with a new reading of the deconstructive legacy. Through detailed studies of the philosophy of Merleau-Ponty, Ricœur and Nancy, he shows how a phenomenological tradition much wider and richer than Husserlian or Heideggerean thought alone can take account of Derrida's critique of ontology and yet still hold a commitment to the ontological. This new reading of being and presence fundamentally re-draws our understanding of the relation of deconstruction and phenomenology, and provides the first sustained discussion of the possibilities and problems for any future 'deconstructive phenomenology'.<br>

Philosopher Michael Williams writes: ‘Is it possible to obtain knowledge

For Badiou, true philosophy is always systematic, yet it is not systematic in the sense of being centered around a keystone: ‘if by “system” you mean, first, that philosophy is conceived as an argumentative discipline with a requirement of coherence, and second, that philosophy never takes the form of a singular body of knowledge but, to use my own vocabulary, exists conditionally with respect to a complex set of truths,<br>

  Book Title: The Unexpected-Narrative Temporality and the Philosophy of Surprise<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Currie Mark<br>
  Abstract: This new study asks how stories affect the way we think about time and, in particular, how they condition thinking about the future. Focusing on surprise and the unforeseeable, the book argues that stories are mechanisms that reconcile what is taking place with what will have been. This relation between the present and the future perfect offers a grammatical formula quite different from our default notions of narrative as recollection or recapitulation. It promises new understandings of the reading process within the strange logic of a future that is already complete. It also points beyond that to some of the key temporal concepts of our epoch: prediction and unpredictability, uncertainty, the event, the untimely and the messianic. The argument is worked out in new readings of Sarah Waters’ Fingersmith, Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go and Julian Barnes’ The Sense of an Ending.Key Features: An original discussion of the relation of time and narrativeAn important intervention in narratologyA striking general argument about the workings of the mindProvides an overview of the question of surprise in philosophy and literature<br>

  Abstract: The first study of Deleuze's critical and clinical projectAidan Tynan addresses Deleuze's assertion that 'literature is an enterprise of health' and shows how a concern of health and illness was a characteristic of his philosophy as a whole, from his earliest works to his groundbreaking collaborations with Guattari, to his final, enigmatic statements on 'life'.He explains why alcoholism, anorexia, manic depression and schizophrenia are key concepts in Deleuze's literary theory, and shows how, with the turn to schizoanalysis, literature takes on a crucial political and ethical role in helping us to diagnose our present pathologies and articulate the possibilities of a health to come.Key FeaturesThe first book length study of Deleuze's critical and clinical project and the conceptualisations of health and illness he developed over the course of his careerUses the idea of the literary clinic to unify Deleuze's literary theory with the political critique he developed with Guattari, and argues in this way for a distinctively Deleuzian critical practiceDraws on Deleuze conceptualisations of health and illness to reassess his relationship to key thinkers such as Spinoza, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud and Melanie Klein and literary figures such as Melville F.

This unsettled, unsettling status has recently induced the philosopher Alain Badiou to characterise psychoanalysis as an ‘antiphilosophy’, that is, as a practice that issues the strongest possible challenges to thought. Justin Clemens takes up the challenge of this denomination here, by re-examining a series of crucial psychoanalytic themes: addiction, fanaticism, love, slavery and torture. Drawing from the work of Freud, Lacan, Badiou, Agamben and others, 'Psychoanalysis is an Antiphilosophy' offers a radical reconstruction of the operations and import of key psychoanalytic concepts and a renewed sense of the indispensable powers of psychoanalysis for today.<br>

  Abstract: Because it is an antiphilosophy, psychoanalysis has, from its beginnings, remained indifferent or suspicious towards that most philosophical of themes: ontology. One can see this indifference operating at a number of levels. The practice of psychoanalysis has not necessitated that clinical psychoanalysts intervene directly in ontological questioning, whether implicitly or explicitly. Even in the most volatile moments of its struggles to sustain itself as a singular practice, psychoanalysis has remained relatively unmoved in the face of the counter-claims, concepts and criticisms coming from philosophy – and, a fortiori, from philosophical ontologies. Indeed, the reverse is more the case: it is<br>

  Abstract: If art moves, understanding moves. Schleiermacher and Dilthey showed how within hermeneutics, understanding upholds itself by a constant, irresolvable and inconclusive movement between part and whole. The philosophy of Hans-Georg Gadamer uniquely transfers insights relating to the movement of understanding to the question of aesthetic attentiveness. In his thought, aesthetic contemplation no longer attends to changeless forms but participates in the movement of a work’s constitutive elements. Aesthetic contemplation is no longer passive but an active participant (
                  theoros) in the bringing forth what a work can disclose. Where Dilthey laments the inconclusiveness of understanding, Gadamer celebrates it. The ceaseless movement<br>

  Book Title: Staging Philosophy-Intersections of Theater, Performance, and Philosophy<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Saltz David Z.<br>
  Abstract: The fifteen original essays in
      Staging Philosophymake useful connections between the discipline of philosophy and the fields of theater and performance and use these insights to develop new theories about theater. Each of the contributors-leading scholars in the fields of performance and philosophy-breaks new ground, presents new arguments, and offers new theories that will pave the way for future scholarship.Staging Philosophyraises issues of critical importance by providing case studies of various philosophical movements and schools of thought, including aesthetics, analytic philosophy, phenomenology, deconstruction, critical realism, and cognitive science. The essays, which are organized into three sections-history and method, presence, and reception-take up fundamental issues such as spectatorship, empathy, ethics, theater as literature, and the essence of live performance. While some essays challenge assertions made by critics and historians of theater and performance, others analyze the assumptions of manifestos that prescribe how practitioners should go about creating texts and performances. The first book to bridge the disciplines of theater and philosophy,Staging Philosophywill provoke, stimulate, engage, and ultimately bring theater to the foreground of intellectual inquiry while it inspires further philosophical investigation into theater and performance.David Krasneris Associate Professor of Theater Studies, African American Studies, and English at Yale University.

  Book Title: Traces of the Past-Classics between History and Archaeology<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Bassi Karen<br>
  Abstract: What are we doing when we walk into an archaeological museum or onto an archaeological site? What do the objects and features we encounter in these unique places mean and, more specifically, how do they convey to us something about the beliefs and activities of formerly living humans? In short, how do visible remains and ruins in the present give meaning to the human past? Karen Bassi addresses these questions through detailed close readings of canonical works spanning the archaic to the classical periods of ancient Greek culture, showing how the past is constituted in descriptions of what narrators and characters see in their present context. She introduces the term protoarchaeological to refer to narratives that navigate the gap between linguistic representation and empirical observation-between words and things-in accessing and giving meaning to the past. Such narratives invite readers to view the past as a receding visual field and, in the process, to cross the disciplinary boundaries that divide literature, history, and archaeology.Aimed at classicists, literary scholars, ancient historians, cultural historians, and archaeological theorists, the book combines three areas of research: time as a feature of narrative structure in literary theory; the concept of "the past itself" in the philosophy of history; and the ontological status of material objects in archaeological theory. Each of five central chapters explores how specific protoarchaeological narratives-from the fate of Zeus' stone in Hesiod's Theogony to the contest between words and objects in Aristophanes' Frogs-both expose and attempt to bridge this gap. Throughout, the book serves as a response to Herodotus' task in writing the Histories, namely, to ensure that "the past deeds of men do not fade with time."<br>

  Book Title: The Science of the Soul in Colonial New England-  Publisher: The University of North Carolina Press<br>
  Author(s): RIVETT SARAH<br>
  Abstract: The Science of the Soulchallenges long-standing notions of Puritan provincialism as antithetical to the Enlightenment. Sarah Rivett demonstrates that, instead, empiricism and natural philosophy combined with Puritanism to transform the scope of religious activity in colonial New England from the 1630s to the Great Awakening of the 1740s.In an unprecedented move, Puritan ministers from Thomas Shepard and John Eliot to Cotton Mather and Jonathan Edwards studied the human soul using the same systematic methods that philosophers applied to the study of nature. In particular, they considered the testimonies of tortured adolescent girls at the center of the Salem witch trials, Native American converts, and dying women as a source of material insight into the divine. Conversions and deathbed speeches were thus scrutinized for evidence of grace in a way that bridged the material and the spiritual, the visible and the invisible, the worldly and the divine.In this way, the "science of the soul" was as much a part of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century natural philosophy as it was part of post-Reformation theology. Rivett's account restores the unity of religion and science in the early modern world and highlights the role and importance of both to transatlantic circuits of knowledge formation.<br>

By the late-seventeenth century, Harvard-trained ministers and Royal Society natural philosophers continued to advance their practices, though with renewed caution, aware both of mechanical philosophy’s limitations and the parameters surrounding empirical inquiry—especially interdictions against studying preternatural phenomena. Yet neither New England ministers nor London natural philosophers abandoned efforts to apply empirical methods to advance knowledge of God.

  Abstract: If one wishes to evaluate inequalities in health from the perspective of justice, it is natural to turn to philosophical conceptions of egalitarianism. Such views aim to explain why inequalities (or at least certain inequalities) are morally problematic, and why social and political institutions that engender inequalities are unjust and need repair. There is, however, a vigorous debate within political philosophy as to how egalitarianism should be conceived. In recent years, a broad division has emerged between so-called luck egalitarians, on the one hand, and “relational” egalitarians, on the other. The main aim of this chapter is to explain this<br>

  Book Title: “The Useless Mouths” and Other Literary Writings-  Publisher: University of Illinois Press<br>
  Author(s): Le Bon de Beauvoir Sylvie<br>
  Abstract: "The Useless Mouths" and Other Literary Writings brings to English-language readers literary writings--several previously unknown--by Simone de Beauvoir. Culled from sources including various American university collections, the works span decades of Beauvoir's career. Ranging from dramatic works and literary theory to radio broadcasts, they collectively reveal fresh insights into Beauvoir's writing process, personal life, and the honing of her philosophy. The volume begins with a new translation of the 1945 play The Useless Mouths, written in Paris during the Nazi occupation. Other pieces were discovered after Beauvoir's death in 1986, such as the 1965 short novel "Misunderstanding in Moscow," involving an elderly French couple who confront their fears of aging. Two additional previously unknown texts include the fragmentary "Notes for a Novel," which contains the seed of what she later would call "the problem of the Other," and a lecture on postwar French theater titled Existentialist Theater. The collection notably includes the eagerly awaited translation of Beauvoir's contribution to a 1965 debate among Jean-Paul Sartre and other French writers and intellectuals, "What Can Literature Do?" Prefaces to well-known works such as Bluebeard and Other Fairy Tales, La Bâtarde, and James Joyce in Paris: His Final Years are also available in English for the first time, alongside essays and other short articles. A landmark contribution to Beauvoir studies and French literary studies, the volume includes informative and engaging introductory essays by prominent and rising scholars. Contributors are Meryl Altman, Elizabeth Fallaize, Alison S. Fell, Sarah Gendron, Dennis A. Gilbert, Laura Hengehold, Eleanore Holveck, Terry Keefe, J. Debbie Mann, Frederick M.

  Book Title: Philosophy Beside Itself-On Deconstruction and Modernism<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Marshall Donald<br>
  Abstract: The writings of French philosopher Jacques Derrida have been the single most powerful influence on critical theory and practice in the United States over the past decade. But with few exceptions American philosophers have taken little or no interest in Derrida’s work, and the task of reception, translation, and commentary has been left to literary critics. As a result, Derrida has appeared as a figure already defined by essentially literary critical activities and interests. Stephen Melville’s aim in Philosophy Beside Itself is to insist upon and clarify the distinctions between philosophy and criticism. He argues that until we grasp Derrida’s philosophical project as such, we remain fundamentally unable to see his significance for criticism. In terms derived from Stanley Cavell’s writings on modernism, Melville develops a case for Derrida as a modernist philosopher, working at once within and against that tradition and discipline. Melville first places Derrida in a Hegelian context, the structure of which he explores by examining the work of Heidegger, Lacan, and Bataille. With this foundation, he is able to reappraise the project of deconstructive criticism as developed in Paul de Man’s Blindness and Insight and further articulated by other Yale critics. Central to this critique is the ambivalent relationship between deconstructive criticism and Lacanian psychoanalysis. Criticism—radical self-criticism—is a central means through which the difficult facts of human community come to recognition, and Melville argues for criticism as an activity intimately bound to the ways in which we do and do not belong in time and in community. Derrida’s achievement has been to find a new and necessary way to assert that the task of philosophy is criticism; the task of literary criticism is to assume the burden of that achievement.

  Author(s) Marshall Donald<br>
  Abstract: The burden of the argument to this point has been that philosophy, in response to needs generated within its “own” history, has come to be at necessary odds with its self, its history, and the proprietary self-presence implicit in such notions of self and history. In these straits, philosophy has turned increasingly to criticism for an understanding of its activity, and so has risked also its possible disappearance into literature. Literary criticism and theory thus find themselves in an odd position: a discipline that has a long-established habit of looking elsewhere—primarily to science or philosophy—for models of its<br>

  Abstract: In the nearly twenty years since their publication, Gilles Deleuze’s books about cinema have proven as daunting as they are enticing—a new aesthetics of film, one equally at home with Henri Bergson and Wim Wenders, Friedrich Nietzsche and Orson Welles, that also takes its place in the philosopher’s immense and difficult oeuvre. With this collection, the first to focus solely and extensively on Deleuze’s cinematic work, the nature and reach of that work finally become clear. Composed of a substantial introduction, twelve original essays produced for this volume, and a new English translation of a personal, intriguing, and little-known interview with Deleuze on his cinema books, The Brain Is the Screen is a sustained engagement with Deleuze’s cinematic philosophy that leads to a new view of the larger confrontation of philosophy with cinematic images.

  Abstract: Tucked away in a garden on the edge of Paris is a multimedia archive like no other: Albert Kahn's
      Archives de la Planète(1908-1931). Kahn's vast photo-cinematographic experiment preserved world memory through the privileged lens of everyday life, andCounter-Archivesituates this project in its biographic, intellectual, and cinematic contexts. Tracing the archive's key influences, such as the philosopher Henri Bergson, the geographer Jean Brunhes, and the biologist Jean Comandon, Paula Amad maps an alternative landscape of French cultural modernity in which vitalist philosophy cross-pollinated with early film theory, documentary film with the avant-garde, cinematic models of temporality with the early Annales school of history, and film's appropriation of the planet with human geography and colonial ideology. At the heart of the book is an insightful meditation upon the transformed concept of the archive in the age of cinema and an innovative argument about film's counter-archival challenge to history. The first comprehensive study of Kahn's films,Counter-Archivealso offers a vital historical perspective on debates involving archives, media, and memory.<br>

In historical terms, postmetaphysical thinking belongs to the tradition of the Young Hegelians (Discourse, 53ff.;Postmetaphysical, 124).

  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): HAMMERSCHLAG SARAH<br>
  Abstract: Over a span of thirty years, twentieth-century French philosophers Emmanuel Levinas and Jacques Derrida held a conversation across texts. Sharing a Jewish heritage and a background in phenomenology, both came to situate their work at the margins of philosophy, articulating this placement through religion and literature. Chronicling the interactions between these thinkers, Sarah Hammerschlag argues that the stakes in their respective positions were more than philosophical. They were also political. Levinas's investments were born out in his writings on Judaism and ultimately in an evolving conviction that the young state of Israel held the best possibility for achieving such an ideal. For Derrida, the Jewish question was literary. The stakes of Jewish survival could only be approached through reflections on modern literature's religious legacy, a line of thinking that provided him the means to reconceive democracy. Hammerschlag's reexamination of Derrida and Levinas's textual exchange not only produces a new account of this friendship but also has significant ramifications for debates within Continental philosophy, the study of religion, and political theology.<br>

  Book Title: The Specter of Democracy-What Marx and Marxists Haven't Understood and Why<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Howard Dick<br>
  Abstract: Howard uses a critical rereading of Marx as a theorist of democracy to offer his audience a new way to think about this political ideal. He argues that it is democracy, rather than Marxism, that is radical and revolutionary, and that Marx could have seen this but did not. In Part I, Howard explores the attraction Marxism held for intellectuals, particularly French intellectuals, and he demonstrates how the critique of totalitarianism from a Marxist viewpoint allowed these intellectuals to see the radical nature of democracy. Part II examines two hundred years of democratic political life -- comparing America's experience as a democracy to that of France. Part III offers a rethinking of Marx's contribution to democratic politics. Howard concludes that Marx was attempting a "philosophy by other means," and that paradoxically, just because he was such an astute philosopher, Marx was unable to see the radical political implications of his own analyses. The philosophically justified "revolution" turns out to be the basis of an anti-politics whose end was foreshadowed by the fall of European communism in 1989.<br>

  Abstract: Paradoxically, after 1989 Marx’s political philosophy can be read not only as philosophical but also as political. If Marxism is not (in Sartre’s famous phrase) the “unsurpassable horizon of our times,” it remains a rigorous confrontation with modernity and a challenging attempt to understand its novelty.¹ This is because, despite Marx’s intention to provide a theory

  Abstract: In this book I have argued that the dominant approach to cosmopolitanism in contemporary political philosophy is undermined by what could be described as a lack of realism. That approach proceeds as though, by developing the best moral arguments and normative visions, it will be able to persuade people—presumably those in a position to change things—to bring about a better world. This practical presupposition is seldom defended explicitly; rather, it is taken to be self-evident—simply what one does when one does political philosophy. Occasionally, it is true, cosmopolitan theorists ask whether the ends or schemes they develop<br>

  Book Title: Situating Existentialism-Key Texts in Context<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): BERNASCONI ROBERT<br>
  Abstract: Emphasizing the multidisciplinary and global nature of existential arguments, the chosen texts relate to philosophy, religion, literature, theater, and culture and reflect European, Russian, Latin American, African, and American strains of thought. Readings are grouped into three thematic categories: national contexts, existentialism and religion, and transcultural migrations that explore the reception of existentialism. The volume explains how literary giants such as Dostoevsky and Tolstoy were incorporated into the existentialist fold and how inclusion into the canon recast the work of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, and it describes the roles played by Jaspers and Heidegger in Germany and the Paris School of existentialism in France. Essays address not only frequently assigned works but also underappreciated discoveries, underscoring their vital relevance to contemporary critical debate. Designed to speak to a new generation's concerns, the collection deploys a diverse range of voices to interrogate the fundamental questions of the human condition.<br>

Yet I do this also to articulate the ways that Heidegger’s “Letter on Humanism” led to the demise of “existentialism” as the leading philosophy in France. All three of these readings can be traced to differing French interpretations of Heidegger’s work<br>

  Book Title: Reimagining the Sacred-Richard Kearney Debates God with James Wood, Catherine Keller, Charles Taylor, Julia Kristeva, Gianni Vattimo, Simon Critchley, Jean-Luc Marion, John Caputo, David Tracey, Jens Zimmermann, and Merold Westphal<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Zimmermann Jens<br>
  Abstract: Richard Kearney explores these questions with a host of philosophers known for their inclusive, forward-thinking work on the intersection of secularism, politics, and religion. An interreligious dialogue that refuses to paper over religious difference, these conversations locate the sacred within secular society and affirm a positive role for religion in human reflection and action. Drawing on his own philosophical formulations, literary analysis, and personal interreligious experiences, Kearney develops through these engagements a basic gesture of hospitality for approaching the question of God. His work facilitates a fresh encounter with our best-known voices in continental philosophy and their views on issues of importance to all spiritually minded individuals and skeptics: how to reconcile God's goodness with human evil, how to believe in both God and natural science, how to talk about God without indulging in fundamentalist rhetoric, and how to balance God's sovereignty with God's love.<br>

  Abstract: John Caputo is an American philosopher of religion with particular expertise in phenomenology, hermeneutics, and deconstruction. He is widely known for developing Derrida’s deconstruction into “radical hermeneutics,” a philosophy that subverts any essentialist claims and resists arresting the play of interpretation.¹ This radical hermeneutics is closely aligned with Caputo’s interest in theopoetics, a term that is variously defined by practitioners but that entails the notion that both God and life are best described poetically rather than rationalistically. Theopoetics, at least in Caputo’s radical hermeneutics, and also in Kearney’s anatheism, has connotations of

  Abstract: Mandair rethinks the intersection of religion and the secular in discourses such as history of religions, postcolonial theory, and recent continental philosophy. Though seemingly unconnected, these discourses are shown to be linked to a philosophy of "generalized translation" that emerged as a key conceptual matrix in the colonial encounter between India and the West. In this riveting study, Mandair demonstrates how this philosophy of translation continues to influence the repetitions of religion and identity politics in the lives of South Asians, and the way the academy, state, and media have analyzed such phenomena.<br>

  Book Title: The Highway of Despair-Critical Theory After Hegel<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Marasco Robyn<br>
  Abstract: The Highway of Despairfollows Theodor Adorno, Georges Bataille, and Frantz Fanon as they each read, resist, and reconfigure a strand of thought in Hegel'sPhenomenology of Spirit. Confronting the twentieth-century collapse of a certain revolutionary dialectic, these thinkers struggle to revalue critical philosophy and recast Left Hegelianism within the contexts of genocidal racism, world war, and colonial domination. Each thinker also re-centers the role of passion in critique. Arguing against more recent trends in critical theory that promise an escape from despair, Marasco shows how passion frustrates the resolutions of reason and faith. Embracing the extremism of what Marx, in the spirit of Hegel, called the "ruthless critique of everything existing," she affirms the contemporary purchase of radical critical theory, resulting in a passionate approach to political thought.<br>

  Abstract: Onfray attacks Platonic idealism and its manifestation in Judaic, Christian, and Islamic belief. He warns of the lure of attachment to the purportedly eternal, immutable truths of idealism, which detracts from the immediacy of the world and our bodily existence. Insisting that philosophy is a practice that operates in a real, material space, Onfray enlists Epicurus and Democritus to undermine idealist and theological metaphysics; Nietzsche, Bentham, and Mill to dismantle idealist ethics; and Palante and Bourdieu to collapse crypto-fascist neoliberalism. In their place, he constructs a positive, hedonistic ethics that enlarges on the work of the New Atheists to promote a joyful approach to our lives in this, our only, world.<br>

  Abstract: To respond to religion is to ask what religious behaviors and representations mean to us in our individual worlds, and scholars must confront questions of possibility and becoming that arise from testing their beliefs, imperatives, and practices. Roberts refers to the work of Hent de Vries, Eric Santner, and Stanley Cavell, each of whom exemplifies encounter and response in their writings as they traverse philosophy and religion to expose secular thinking to religious thought and practice. This approach highlights the resources religious discourse can offer to a fundamental reorientation of critical thought. In humanistic criticism after secularism, the lines separating the creative, the pious, and the critical themselves become the subject of question and experimentation.<br>

  Book Title: The Death of Philosophy-Reference and Self-reference in Contemporary Thought<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): LYNCH RICHARD A.<br>
  Abstract: Thomas-Fogiel begins with postphilosophical claims such as scientism, which she reveals to be self-refuting, for they subsume philosophy into the branches of the natural sciences. She discovers similar issues in Rorty's skepticism and strands of continental thought. Revisiting the work of late-nineteenth and early-twentieth-century philosophers, when the split between analytical and continental philosophy began, Thomas-Fogiel finds both traditions followed the same path-the road of reference-which ultimately led to self-contradiction. This phenomenon, whether valorized or condemned, has been understood as the death of philosophy. Tracing this pattern from Quine to Rorty, from Heidegger to Levinas and Habermas, Thomas-Fogiel reveals the self-contradiction at the core of their claims while also carving an alternative path through self-reference. Trained under the French philosopher Bernard Bourgeois, she remakes philosophy in exciting new ways for the twenty-first century.<br>

Opened one century ago by Henri Bergson and Maurice Halbwachs, the scholarly debate on memory deeply shaped sociology, historiography, and philosophy without receiving any significant Marxist contribution.

  Book Title: After Christianity-  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): D’Isanto Luca<br>
  Abstract: When Vattimo was asked by a former teacher if he still believed in God, his reply was, "Well, I believe that I believe." This paradoxical declaration of faith serves as the foundation for a brilliant exposition on Christianity in the new millennium -- an age characterized by a deep uncertainty of opinion -- and a personal account of how Vattimo himself recovered his faith through Nietzsche and Heidegger. He first argues that secularization is in fact the fulfillment of the central Christian message, and prepares us for a new mode of Christianity. He then explains that Nietzsche's thesis concerns only the "moral god" and leaves room for the emergence of "new gods." Third, Vattimo claims that the postmodern condition of fragmentation, anti-Eurocentrism, and postcolonialism can be usefully understood in light of Joachim of Fiore's thesis concerning the "Spiritual Age" of history. Finally, Vattimo argues for the idea of "weak thought." Because philosophy in the postmetaphysical age can only acknowledge that "all is interpretation," that the "real" is always relative and not the hard and fast "truth" we once thought it to be, contemporary thought must recognize itself and its claims as "weak" as opposed to "strong" foundationalist claims of the metaphysical past. Vattimo concludes that these factors make it possible for religion and God to become a serious topic for philosophy again, and that philosophy should now formally engage religion.<br>

  Abstract: To take the measure of literary writing,

Sympathetic to recent ventures in form-attentive analysis but resisting an emphasis on so-called surface reading, Stewart explores not some new formalism but the internal pressures of language in formation, registering the verbal infrastructure of literary prose as well as verse. In this mode of "contextual" reading, the context is language itself. Literary phrasing, tapping the speech act's own generative pulse, emerges as a latent philosophy of language in its own right, whereby human subjects, finding no secure place to situate themselves within language, settle for its taking place in, through, and between them.<br>

  Abstract: As he tried to widen the scope and refine the method of his 
                  Kulturwissenschaft, Warburg wrestled with giants whose historiographies had shaped the fields he hoped to map. To begin with, there was J.J. Winckelmann (1717–56), whose neo-Stoic, decidedly aesthetic interpretations of Greek culture and its imitators found “edle Einfalt und stille Größe” not only in the Laocoön statue and Plato’s philosophy, but also in Raphael’s painting.¹ Partly to shake free of Winckelmann’s constricting influence on German art history, Warburg turned to Jacob Burckhardt, whose enormously influential account of Italian Renaissance culture had been increasingly eclipsed increasingly eclipsed in<br>

  Book Title: The Emergency of Being-On Heidegger’s “Contributions to Philosophy”<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): POLT RICHARD<br>
  Abstract: Polt's original reading neither reduces this challenging text to familiar concepts nor refutes it, but engages it in a confrontation-an encounter that respects a way of thinking by struggling with it. He describes this most private work of Heidegger's philosophy as "a dissonant symphony that imperfectly weaves together its moments into a vast fugue, under the leitmotif of appropriation. This fugue is seeded with possibilities that are waiting for us, its listeners, to develop them. Some are dead ends-viruses that can lead only to a monolithic, monotonous misunderstanding of history. Others are embryonic insights that promise to deepen our thought, and perhaps our lives, if we find the right way to make them our own."<br>

  Abstract: The text 
                     Contributions to Philosophy is one of Heidegger’s thought experiments.¹ One does not refute a thought experiment; one pursues it imaginatively and sees where it leads, without giving up one’s critical awareness. It would be inappropriate to treat Heidegger’s inquiry as nothing but a set of claims to be defended or attacked. Instead, we have to follow the paths it opens and decide as best we can which ones are promising, without assuming in advance that any are dead ends.<br>

  Book Title: Paradigms for a Metaphorology-  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Savage Robert<br>
  Abstract: What role do metaphors play in philosophical language? Are they impediments to clear thinking and clear expression, rhetorical flourishes that may well help to make philosophy more accessible to a lay audience, but that ought ideally to be eradicated in the interests of terminological exactness? Or can the images used by philosophers tell us more about the hopes and cares, attitudes and indifferences that regulate an epoch than their carefully elaborated systems of thought?<br>

  Abstract: If we attempt now to elaborate and set out a

In carrying out this task, we should recall that metaphorology—as a subbranch of conceptual history, and like the latter itself considered as a whole—must always be an auxiliary discipline to philosophy as it seeks to understand itself from its history and to bring that history to living presence. Our typology of metaphor histories must accordingly endeavor<br>

  Author(s): Ankersmit Frank<br>
  Abstract: In this book, the noted intellectual historian Frank Ankersmit provides a systematic account of the problems of reference, truth, and meaning in historical writing. He works from the conviction that the historicist account of historical writing, associated primarily with Leopold von Ranke and Wilhelm von Humboldt, is essentially correct but that its original idealist and romanticist idiom needs to be translated into more modern terms. Rehabilitating historicism for the contemporary philosophy of history, he argues, "reveals the basic truths about the nature of the past itself, how we relate to it, and how we make sense of the past in historical writing."<br>

Interpretation is something one does with texts that already exist, and the phrase “interpreting

Due to his vocation as a theologian and Protestant clergyman, Herder was virtually precluded from holding political office or commenting frankly on public affairs, except as mediated by the established church.

  Book Title: Aesthetic Vision and German Romanticism-Writing Images<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Prager Brad<br>
  Abstract: The work of the groundbreaking writers and artists of German Romanticism -- including the writers Tieck, Brentano, and Eichendorff and the artists Caspar David Friedrich and Philipp Otto Runge -- followed from the philosophical arguments of the German Idealists, who placed emphasis on exploring the subjective space of the imagination. The Romantic perspective was a form of engagement with Idealist discourses, especially Kant's Critique of Pure Reason and Fichte's Science of Knowledge. Through an aggressive, speculative reading of Kant, the Romantics abandoned the binary distinction between the palpable outer world and the ungraspable space of the mind's eye and were therefore compelled to develop new terms for understanding the distinction between "internal" and "external." In this light, Brad Prager urges a reassessment of some of Romanticism's major oppositional tropes, contending that binaries such as "self and other," "symbol and allegory," and "light and dark," should be understood as alternatives to Lessing's distinction between interior and exterior worlds. Prager thus crosses the boundaries between philosophy, literature, and art history to explore German Romantic writing about visual experience, examining the interplay of text and image in the formulation of Romantic epistemology. Brad Prager is Associate Professor of German at the University of Missouri, Columbia.<br>

  Abstract: These words, written by Novalis, declare that philosophy begins in an act of self-destruction, or more precisely formulated: all properly philosophical acts aim to destroy the self. This demand is not as mysterious as it might seem. A self, by definition, is differentiated and limited, and thus represents one of the most palpable impediments to that which romantic philosophy seeks, namely, the absolute,
                  das Unbedingte, that which is without condition and without limit. A truly philosophical act must efface the horizon of limitations and differences that constitutes selfhood:Selbsttödtung, self-annihilation. The proper name for this act is not suicide,<br>

  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Marx Wolfgang<br>
  Abstract: Rethinking Hanslick: Music, Formalism, and Expression' is the first extensive English-language study devoted to Eduard Hanslick--a seminal figure in nineteenth-century musical life. Bringing together eminent scholars from several disciplines, this volume examines Hanslick's contribution to the aesthetics and philosophy of music and looks anew at his literary interests. The essays embrace ways of thinking about Hanslick's writings that go beyond the polarities that have long marked discussion of his work such as form/expression, absolute/program music, objectivity/subjectivity, and formalist/hermeneutic criticism. This approach takes into consideration both Hanslick's important 'On the Musically Beautiful' and his critical and autobiographical writings, demonstrating Hanslick's rich insights into the context in which a musical work is composed, performed, and received. 'Rethinking Hanslick' serves as an invaluable companion to Hanslick's prodigious scholarship and criticism, deepening our understanding of the major themes and ideas of one of the most influential music critics of the nineteenth century.

  Book Title: Narratives of Identity in Alban Berg's "Lulu"-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): dos Santos Silvio J.<br>
  Abstract: Exploring the crossroads between autobiographical narrative and musical composition, this book examines Berg's transformation of Frank Wedekind's Erdgeist (1895) and Die Büchse der Pandora/ (1904) -- the plays used in the formation of the libretto for Lulu -- according to notions of gender identity, social customs, and the aesthetics of modernity in Vienna of the 1920s and 1930s. While Berg modernized several aspects of the plays by Wedekind and incorporated serial techniques of composition from Arnold Schoenberg, he never let go of the idealistic Wagnerian perspectives of his youth. In fact, he went as far as reconfiguring aspects of Richard Wagner's life as an ideal identity to be played out in the compositional process. In the process of composing the opera, Berg also reflected on the most important cultural figures in fin-de-siècle Vienna that affected his worldview, including Karl Kraus, Emil Lucka, Otto Weininger, and others. Adopting an approach that combines a systematic analysis of Berg's numerous sketches for Lulu, correspondence, and the finished work with interpretive models drawn from cultural studies and philosophy, this book elucidates the ways in which Berg grappled with his self-image as an "incorrigible romantic" (unverbesserliche Romantiker) at the end of his life, explaining aspects of his musical language that have been considered strange or anomalous in the scholarship.

  Book Title: Modern German Thought from Kant to Habermas-An Annotated German-Language Reader<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Large Duncan<br>
  Abstract: German-language thinkers such as Kant, Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud are central to modernity. Yet their reception in the English-speaking world has largely depended on translations, a situation that has often hampered full engagement with the rhetorical and philosophical complexity of the German history of ideas. The present volume, the first of its kind, is a response to this situation. After an introduction charting the remarkable flowering of German-language thought since the eighteenth century, it offers extracts -- in the original German -- from sixteen major philosophical texts, with extensive introductions and annotations in English. All extracts are carefully chosen to introduce the individual thinkers while allowing the reader to pursue broader themes such as the fate of reason or the history of modern selfhood. The book offers students and scholars of German a complement to linguistic, historical, and literary study by giving them access to the wealth of German-language philosophy. It represents a new way into the work of a succession of thinkers who have defined modern philosophy and thus remain of crucial relevance today. The philosophers: Immanuel Kant, G. W. F. Hegel, Ludwig Feuerbach, Karl Marx, Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, Martin Heidegger, Walter Benjamin, Georg Lukács, Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno, Jürgen Habermas.

  Book Title: Tragedy and the Tragic in German Literature, Art, and Thought-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Quinn Thomas P.<br>
  Abstract: The many catastrophes of German history have often been described as tragic. Consequently, German literature, music, philosophy, painting, and even architecture are rich in tragic connotations. Yet exactly what "tragedy" and "the tragic" may mean requires clarification. The poet creates a certain artful shape and trajectory for raw experience by "putting it into words"; but does putting such experience into words (or paintings or music or any other form) betray suffering by turning it into mere art? Or is it art that first turns mere suffering into tragic experience by revealing and clarifying its deepest dimension? What are we talking about, exactly, when we talk about tragic experience and tragic art, especially in an age in which, according to Hannah Arendt, evil has become banal? Does banality muffle or even annul the tragic? Does tragedy take suffering and transform it into beauty, as Schiller thought? Is it in the interest of truth for suffering to be "beautiful"? Is it possible that poetry, music, and art are important because they in fact create the meaning of suffering? Or is suffering only suffering and not accessible to meaning, tragic or otherwise? This book comprises essays that seek to clarify the meaning of tragedy and the tragic in its many German contexts, art forms, and disciplines, from literature and philosophy to music, painting, and history.

  Book Title: A Companion to Friedrich Nietzsche-Life and Works<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Bishop Paul<br>
  Abstract: Nietzsche looms over modern literature and thought; according to Gottfried Benn, "everything my generation discussed, thought through innerly; one could say: suffered; or one could even say: took to the point of exhaustion - all of it had already been said . . . by Nietzsche; all the rest was just exegesis." Nietzsche's influence on intellectual life today is arguably as great; witness the various societies, journals, and websites and the steady stream of papers, collections, and monographs. This ‘Companion’ offers new essays from the best Nietzsche scholars, emphasizing the interrelatedness of his life and thought, eschewing a superficial biographical method but taking seriously his claim that great philosophy is “the self-confession of its author and a kind of unintended and unremarked ‘memoir’.” Each essay examines a major work by Nietzsche; together, they offer an advanced introduction for students of German Studies, philosophy, and comparative literature as well as for the lay reader. Re-establishing the links between Nietzsche's philosophical texts and their biographical background, the volume alerts Nietzsche scholars and intellectual historians to the internal development of his thought and the aesthetic construction of his identity as a philosopher.

  Abstract: Today, friendship, love and sexuality are mostly viewed as private, personal and informal relations. In the mediaeval and early modern period, just like in ancient times, this was different. The classical philosophy of friendship (Aristotle) included both friendship and love in the concept of philia. It was also linked to an argument about the virtues needed to become an excellent member of the city state. Thus, close relations were not only thought to be a matter of pleasant gatherings in privacy, but just as much a matter of ethics and politics. What, then, happened to the classical ideas of close relations when they were transmitted to philosophers, clerical and monastic thinkers, state officials or other people in the medieval and early modern period? To what extent did friendship transcend the distinctions between private and public that then existed? How were close relations shaped in practice? Did dialogues with close friends help to contribute to the process of subject-formation in the Renaissance and Enlightenment? To what degree did institutions of power or individual thinkers find it necessary to caution against friendship or love and sexuality?<br>

  Book Title: Hybrid Renaissance-Culture, Language, Architecture<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burke Peter<br>
  Abstract: Hybrid Renaissance presents the Renaissance in Italy, elsewhere in Europe and in the world beyond Europe as an example of cultural hybridization. It is impossible to give a clear definition of either of the two key concepts used in this book, “hybridization" and “Renaissance". Roughly speaking, hybridity refers to something new that emerges from the combination of diverse older elements. The term “hybridization" is preferable to “hybridity" because it refers to a process rather than to a state, and also because it encourages the writer and the readers alike to think in terms of more or less rather than of presence versus absence. The book begins with a discussion of the concept of cultural hybridity and a cluster of other concepts related to it. Then comes a geography of hybridity, focusing on three locales: courts, major cities (whether ports or capitals) and frontiers. There follow six chapters about the hybrid Renaissance in different fields: architecture, painting and sculpture, languages, literatures, music, philosophy and law and finally religion. The essay concludes with a brief account of attempts to resist hybridization or to purify cultures or domains from what was already hybridized<br>

  Abstract: The problem of the compatibility or incompatibility of ancient Greek philosophy with Christianity, acute in the fourth century, resurfaced in the thirteenth, the time of the rediscovery of Aristotle in Western Europe. Thomas Aquinas might be said to have translated Christianity into the language of Aristotle in his famous
                  Summaeof philosophy and theology. Other medieval philosophers went even further than Aquinas in appropriating the ideas of Aristotle. They were described as “Averroists” (Averroistae) in other words followers of the twelfth-century Muslim polymath and commentator on Aristotle Ibn Rushd, known in the medieval West as Averroes. Aquinas criticized the Averroists<br>

  Book Title: Given World and Time-Temporalities in Context<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Miller Tyrus<br>
  Abstract: The interconnections of time with historical thought and knowledge have come powerfully to the fore since the 1970s. An international group of scholars, from a range of fields including literary theory, history of ideas, cultural anthropology, philosophy, intellectual history and theology, philology, and musicology, address the matter of time and temporalities. The volume’s essays, divided into four main topical groups question critically the key problem of context, connecting it to the problem of time. Contexts, the essays suggest, are not timeless. Time and its contexts are only partly “given” to us: to the primordial donations of time and world correspond our epistemic, moral, and practical modes of receiving what has been granted. The notion of context may have radically different parameters in different historical, cultural, and disciplinary situations. Topics include the deep antiquity, and the timeless time of eternity, as well as formal philosophies of history and the forms of histories implicit in individual and community experience. The medium specific use of time and history are examined with regard to song, image, film, oral narration, and legal discourse.<br>

Author(s): Young, Jeffrey T.<br>
Abstract: Young’s new book on Adam Smith provides a careful textual analysis of Smith’s two major works:
      The Theory of Moral SentimentsandThe Wealth of Nations. Young argues, with good textual evidence, that Smith did not divide economics from moral theory and that, indeed, Smith thought of economics as a moral science. Young traces Smith’s economic and moral philosophy to Aristotle and Hume, and he points out, correctly, that “self‐interest itself had a significant moral dimension in Smith” (p. 173). Thus Smith’s alleged focus on self‐interest inThe Wealth of Nationshas normative dimensions not always recognized by all Smith scholars. Young uses Smith’s notions of the impartial spectator and benevolence as well as his theory of justice to link the two texts. This is a controversial conclusion since neither the impartial spectator nor benevolence is evident as an important concept inThe Wealth of Nations. Young also argues that Smith divides the economic sphere from the political sphere (see his matrix on p. 158), a questionable conclusion in light of Smith’s focus on political economy inThe Wealth of Nations. Young’s book also suffers from his apparently not having read Amartya Sen’s or my works on Smith, both of which make many of the same arguments Young develops. Still, Young has added further to the growing literature that reads Smith as a serious moral philosopher whose theory of self‐interest is far from libertarian and who neither divided economics from ethics nor politics from either.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: The third of the lectures that compose
      The Justindicates the cultural distance that separates Paul Ricoeur’s reflections on justice from Anglo‐American normative theory. Ricoeur asks, “How do I justify choosing John Rawls’s book for an inquiry into the theory of justice?” (p. 36). A more relevant question for Anglo‐American philosophers would be, How do I justifynotchoosingA Theory of Justicefor the inquiry? Indeed, Ricoeur’s preface to his lectures begins by regretting what he regards as a neglect of questions of justice, legitimacy, the “juridical arena,” and the constitutional state in favor of a focus on “the drama of war” (p. viii) and “a philosophy of history haunted in turn by the pitiless torment arising from and sustained by the aporia of political evil” (p. ix). While Anglo‐American theorists have been interested in multicultural societies and political conflict, they have usually discussed such issues precisely in the context of the issues Ricoeur thinks are ignored. Yet this distance between French and Anglo‐American approaches gives Ricoeur’s lectures their interest. In essays on Rawls, Michael Walzer, and Ronald Dworkin, among American philosophers, and Hannah Arendt and Luc Boltanski among European theorists, Ricoeur sketches a distinctive position on questions of justice that straddles the liberal/communitarian divide common in the Anglo‐American world.<br>

Abstract: For Immanuel Kant, a foundational figure of liberal Protestantism, the immortality of the soul is a postulate of pure practical reason, and the resurrection of Jesus, a legend in which Saint Paul would not have believed had it not served as a morally necessary proof of a future life. From the moral point of view (to which Kant reduces religion), it is irrelevant whether the terrestrial body is necessary for personal identity in the afterlife or even whether our bodies will be resurrected. See Immanuel Kant,
            The Conflict of the Faculties(1798), trans. Mary J. Gregor (Lincoln, Nebr., 1992), where Kant formulates principles of scriptural exegesis aimed at solving the conflict between the faculties of philosophy and theology.<br>

Abstract: However, what was an oppositional paradigm has now become a dominant one both in anthropology and in much of discourse studies. As was earlier the case for structuralism in linguistics and anthropology, such domination usually brings its own forms of inclusion and exclusion. Thus, the virtually exclusive interest in spontaneous talk unfortunately relegated the study of text to the study of literature, semiotics, postmodern philosophy, mass communication studies, or the psychology of text processingas if writing and reading were less interesting aspects of language, communication, and culture than conversations. Besides everyday talk, we have everyday newspaper reading, among a host of other communicative practices, and both need our explicit attention in anthropology and discourse studies.<br>

Author(s): Robbins,  Jeffrey W.<br>
Abstract: While sharing the aim of relating philosophy and theology, I do not think the project is best accomplished by thinking ontotheologically (at least, not in its Heideggerian sense). What is needed is to insist on a sharper distinction between ontotheological philosophy and religious theology so that we can better understand how they might relate. And here again, I agree with Robbins for different reasons: Ricoeur, Lévinas, and Marion are key sources in this project, for their work maintains the distinction that it calls into question.<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: The reader will find Bourgeois’s treatment of specific topics useful and insightful, topics such as Martin Heidegger on the relation of limit, death, and the “end of philosophy” (chap. 2) or Ricoeur’s engagement with Lévinas on ethics as the face‐to‐face relation to the other (chap. 8). However, the primary argument of the book as a whole sometimes devolves into a Procrustean bed, cutting away the complexity of Heideggerian and post‐Heideggerian thought to make it fit an overreaching, insufficiently qualified thesis regarding the trajectory of twentieth‐century philosophy. Unfortunately, the reader may find it difficult to disentangle the valuable contributions of the book from the more ambitious but problematic agenda driving it. The thrust of this overarching argument is that, at a pivotal juncture in continental intellectual history, a colossal error in construing Kant’s concept of the “boundary of reason” took hold, preventing a proper understanding of the relation of the enterprise of critique to its grounding in reason and leading (apparently inexorably) to the aporias of “philosophy in the twentieth century” (p. xiv). All the trouble about the closure of meaning in recent continental thought could have been averted, the author argues, if Heidegger and post‐Heideggerian philosophers (e.g., Jacques Derrida, John Caputo, Jean François Lyotard, Emmanuel Lévinas) merely had paid more careful attention to a critical conceptual distinction Kant took pains to make between a “boundary” (
      Grenze) and a “limit” (Schranke) in theProlegomena to Any Future Metaphysics(sec. 57).<br>

Author(s): Mandry,  Christof<br>
Abstract: Mandry offers a relatively concise and convincing reading of Ricoeur on the ethical self and its relation to ethical aims for the good life and the moral demand for justice. Mandry’s concern is to clarify what is meant by “ethical identity” and how this idea might aid theological ethics. The principle contribution is to show the place of religious conviction (
      Überzeugung) in relation to ethical aims, moral duties, and practical reasoning. Mandry’s contention is that philosophy and theology offer different perspectives on the ethical subject which can fruitfully engage each other. The question then becomes, of course, whether or not the question that provoked the discussion in the first case has simply been pushed back one further step in reflection. What provides the warrant for multiple perspectives on the ethical subject? Is it a philosophical warrant or a theological one?<br>

Abstract: While the phenomenological description of mutual recognition found in the
            Encyclopediabelongs to the philosophy of subjective spirit and is therefore about individuals within a community, the account in thePhenomenologycould be read as referring to either singular subjectivity or universal subjectivity. Also, as Hegel argues in hisPhilosophy of Right, the sovereignty of a nation‐state as an individual becomes actual only in being recognized by other nation‐states (Elements of the Philosophy of Right, ed. Allen W. Wood, trans. H. B. Nisbet [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991], §§331–36). But unlike interpersonal recognition, international recognition is predicated not on the mere existence of nation‐states but on the level of internal sovereignty and freedom they have attained, as reflected in their constitutions (or “internal principles of legitimacy,” to quote Williams [Hegel's Ethics, 350]). Nation‐states with constitutions based on “natural” forms of ethical life, such as those that have patriarchal social structures, practice slavery, and regard their social order as sanctioned by nature or some arbitrary divine power, have not attained the internal level of freedom and autonomy necessary for them to be recognized as free individuals. In other words, international recognition for Hegel presupposes comparable levels of cultural development and convergence of values, especially freedom, as R. R. Williams points out (349–54). This gives rise to the problem of cross‐cultural recognition, especially one between peoples with fundamentally different convictions concerning freedom. What if a culture or nation subordinates freedom to “natural” or divinely ordained inequalities, i.e., to master‐slave relations, both in its internal organization and in its external relations? According to Williams, Hegel adopts a historical approach to mediate the differences between cultures via a concept of developmental stages in the consciousness of freedom, which ~<br>

Abstract: Frei highlights several crucial features of Phillips’s views: first, the meaning of religious language is grounded in the way of life and practice of the believer—the language therefore takes on a meaning incommensurable with the ways that a philosopher (or a believer in a different faith tradition) would understand it. Second, because of this incommensurability, the work of philosophy can only be to clarify the distinction between different uses of language; it is only from within the terms and practices of a community that one can judge one use of language to be “better” than another, and this judgment is made solely through practice. In Frei’s view, Phillips effectively effaces the possibility of Christian self‐description that would explain why one formulation of doctrine is better than another, by “absolutizing and rigidifying the warranted, indeed essential, distinction between religious statements and statements about religion.”
         32This effaces the possibility of self‐description because the best way to understand—perhaps, really, the only way to understand—is through deeper practice. It is, in a sense, as if upon expressing incomprehension regarding the incarnation, one were told to simply pray harder. The hard and fast distinction between religious utterances and statements about religion leads, on Frei’s view, to the collapse of the distinction between second‐order and first‐order religious statements. There is no logic that could explain the statements—not even to the community itself. Theology is reduced to “parroting” traditional statements: “I wanted to raise the question whether this procedure and this conviction didn’t mean that the theologian could do no more than repeat without conceptually redescribing the words of doctrines or scriptural statements that had doctrinal overtones and aftereffects.”33Frei’s fear is not that explanations come to an end, but rather that Phillips’s radically Wittgensteinian position means that explanations never~<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: In a first reading of the book, I was critical of this emphasis on moral motivations, since it seemed to be overburdened by a psychological approach. But, on a second reading, I had to refrain from my critique. Ricoeur makes the point that he has no intention to “take the place of a resolution for the perplexities raised by the very concept of a struggle, still less of a resolution of the conflicts” (218). In other words, Ricoeur is proposing a well‐needed complement to the institutional design trend that has invaded contemporary political philosophy. Contrary to many, he stands before the most perplexing issue of recognition with eyes wide open: indeed, demands of recognition may never end and take the form of an “unhappy consciousness” (218). One can try to resolve this potential inflation of claims by sorting out political and substantive issues. But a solution that takes only this path could create vast areas of frustration that canny elites have learned to fuel, or come to neglect recognition claims on the grounds that they hide a Pandora's box waiting to be opened. I suspect that this neglect mechanism is one of the reasons why so many legitimate recognition claims still languish in limbo as we speak. The course taken by Ricoeur may be difficult to square with the mainstream approach in contemporary political philosophy—political liberalism, to name it—but it nonetheless deserves careful attention.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: lq.2006.76.issue-3<br>
Date: 07 2006<br>
Author(s): Budd John M.<br>
Abstract: The foregoing recognizes that the practical side of ethics is vital to work in librarianship. The essential character of ethics in librarianship includes recognition that, as a profession, the concern is for the public life of participants and their public actions. As Alisdair MacIntyre emphasizes (and as the epigraph by Adriaan T. Peperzak affirms), the political and the moral do not have separate histories (or presents, for that matter). Theorizing and belief are both political and moral actions. “Every action is the bearer and expression of more or less theory‐laden beliefs and concepts; every piece of theorizing and every expression of belief is a political and moral action” [
      5, p. 61]. MacIntyre’s point is extremely important; history is integral to any understanding of ethics and moral philosophy. History, as is ethics, is human and social; it is an essential component to any understanding of our places in society. The challenge is to create an institutional ethos that achieves a very explicit set of goals. In order to achieve the goals, some principles of rights and obligations have to be recognized and upheld. The easiest of these rights and obligations to accept, and the least controversial, are those grounded in law. Individuals must not be harassed, physically attacked, and so on. These fundamental principles are referred to by John Rawls (who stresses that political philosophy is not a comprehensive ethical or moral theory) as a system of social cooperation:
            
      The central organizing idea of social cooperation has at least three essential features:
         
                  
            
                     
                  
                        
                     a) Social cooperation is distinct from merely socially coordinated activity. … Rather, social cooperation is guided by publicly recognized rules and procedures that those cooperating accept as appropriate to regulate their conduct.

Abstract: Moral Creativityis also a book about Paul Ricoeur. Throughout, Wall turns to Ricoeur’s philosophical and religious thought for theoretical support, using a wide range of primary and secondary literature. Wall works from a Ricoeurian idea that the self is a synthesis of activity and passivity, freedom and finitude. He finds in this ontology of selfhood a basis for conceiving of creativity as the activity of inventing free action amid the limitations of finitude. This anthropology is then tied to Ricoeur’s work on narrative identity, love, ideology, and other topics. Wall’s exegesis of Ricoeur is accurate and astute, succinctly connecting the thinker’s early and late writings on selfhood. The book faults Ricoeur for having an insufficient sense for the entrenchment of social/cultural injustice and for the radical otherness of other people. The discussion of Ricoeur and Emmanuel Levinas on otherness is one of the most interesting parts of the book but also an argument that might need expansion. Wall laments Ricoeur’s decision to separate philosophy from religious discourse, claiming this was a purely pragmatic decision whereby “Ricoeur ultimately does himself a disservice” (181). This may be so, but regardless of intent, wouldn’t we have to say that such a separation is part of the thought world projected by Ricoeur’s writings? Patching over this separation may bring Ricoeur closer to writers of the current “theological turn” of postmodernism but possibly at the price of losing one of Ricoeur’s great virtues—his usefulness in mediating between postmodernism and the modernity that insists on dividing religion and reason.<br>

Note that Hegel’s critique of the concept ofmāyāeasily accommodates an acknowledgment of the substantial identity between the world and the absolute. The presence of the divine being in all finite things still “does not secure them in their finite individuality, nor is the finite a real factor in or for the infinite. On the contrary, the abstract self‐identity of the finite existences, which identifies them with the abstract absolute, is incompatible with their concrete individual identity” (Halbfass,India and Europe, 90).<br>

Article Title: The Philosophical Problem of Truth in Librarianship<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 527832<br>
Date: 01 2008<br>
Author(s): Scimeca Ross<br>
Abstract: This unique notion of truth for librarianship that we are proposing is derived from what has been called historicism. Historicism is not really a theory of truth as much as it is a theory of knowledge in which the question of objective truth is eliminated. This elimination of objective truth implicit in historicism has been attacked from many quarters. The origin of this theory is J. G. Herder’s
         Reflections on the Philosophy of the History of Man[71]. With regard to the question of truth, historicism interprets both human consciousness and the propositions expressing the nature of humans themselves and all of reality as historically conditioned, even current knowledge [71, pp. 96–104]. Herder looked at the supposed teleological progression of reason and found it often wanting. Nevertheless, he believed that reason and goodness would eventually triumph over irrationalism and human folly [71, pp. 115–18]. Consider the following example that illustrates the difference between historicism and the three theories of truth discussed above. For the historicist, the proposition that the world is the center of the universe was true for the medieval mind. For the correspondence theorist, that proposition is simply false, although the additional fact that the medieval mind accepted this proposition to be true would be conceded. The coherence theorist would say that, although the medieval mind accepted the Aristotelian‐Ptolemaic view of the universe, which in itself is a coherent system of propositions, this coherent system would eventually be supplanted by Copernicus’s view. This revolutionary change in knowledge is often expressed as a paradigm by Thomas Kuhn and other philosophers of science. The historicist would point out that such paradigms of knowledge usually have a localized point of origin and gradually expand to the other areas of scholarship, finally entering the public consciousness, where they are accepted or rejected [67, pp. 160–73]. The historicist ackn~<br>

Author(s): Elbourne Elizabeth<br>
Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Author(s): Reynolds,  Thomas E.<br>
Abstract: This book will be read from cover to cover by very few people. It can be considered required reading for even fewer. Scholars interested in Continental philosophy and postmodern theology will appreciate Reynolds’s treatment of key themes and thinkers, although few of his arguments are novel. The strengths of the book are chiefly expository and topical. Reynolds does a good job of “teaching” his favorite thinkers to the uninitiated. His explanation of Richard Rorty’s concept of irony, for example, is quite useful. Furthermore, the issues that drive Reynolds’s argument (presumably, the possibility of peaceful coexistence in a world of profound difference) have genuine urgency.<br>

Abstract: In providing clarification of previous works,
   Reflections on the Justis exceptionally helpful. Of particular interest in this volume is the paradoxical nature of authority—What is authority? How is it legitimated? Is it claimed or granted?—the existence of vulnerability and passivity within autonomy and initiative, and the relationship between moral ideals and historical manifestation, questions that exist more on the margins ofOneself as Another. Those interested in Ricoeur’s religious thought will find little of direct interest here. Those who see a deep connection between his moral philosophy and his philosophy of religion will find some confirmation, but there are other places where the connections are more explicitly manifest.Reflections on the Justis best approached as a companion volume to earlier philosophical works, certainlyThe Justbut perhaps more importantlyOneself as Another. As such, it holds an important place in Ricoeur’s oeuvre.<br>

Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: Dupré's descriptions adhere better to Kant's philosophy of the subject, which declared that the self's knowledge always depends on its own perspective, without the assurance of divine fiat that what seems to be actually is. It is precisely this egocentric orientation that leads Dupré to argue that Enlightenment thinking about the self suffered from a persistent failure to resolve the problem of otherness. To be sure, both Sepinwall and Sutcliffe have explored this problem at length, especially as it pertains to religious, ethnic, and gender diversity. As for Dupré's study, the main significance of the problem of difference stems from the incomplete solutions put to it in Enlightenment-era aesthetics, moral philosophy, and political thought. In all these domains, the delegitimation of traditional identities, institutions, and other intermediaries entailed the estrangement of the human person, which became a universal, abstract entity separated from its particular, embodied existence (Dupré, 47–48, 75–186).<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 651999<br>
Date: 10 2010<br>
Author(s): Walter Gregory<br>
Abstract: In engaging the aporias Agamben articulates, a theologian laboring to consider the political and the theological together should pay heed to Horace’s playwriting advice: do not bring a god into the narrative unless the plot’s problem merits the god’s entrance. The theologian must avoid the temptation to absorb the sphere of the political into the theological and to first consider how forces and agents immanent to the political can attend to the problems facing it. This should not avoid the important insights of Schmitt and others that find that modern political philosophy often has drawn its breath from secularized theological and ecclesiological concepts. Nevertheless, it would do considerable violence to political thought to demand that it depend in its entirety upon prophetic criticism and the form‐without‐form of divine judgment. Instead, we must look for the way that prophetic judgment and its concept of promise has immanent effect and the way that promise itself mediates between the divine gift and the immanent reciprocal gift. This way will articulate a relationship between the theological and the political that continues in the correlational tradition.

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 655202<br>
Date: 8 2010<br>
Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: Blanchot's response to the inadequacy he recognizes in Lévinas's philosophy is to rewrite it through the production of commentary. In the prefatory note to
         The Infinite ConversationBlanchot suggests that the volume should itself be understood as participating in thedésoeuvrementthat characterizes writing. This is a writing that “is called upon to undo the discourse in which, however unhappy we believe ourselves to be, we who have it at our disposal remain comfortably installed” (EI, p. viii;IC, p. xii). Insofar as Blanchot's essays on Lévinas also participate in the activity of writing, these essays deform Lévinas's thought by doubling it through commentary. Commentary, as Blanchot understands it, participates in literature by repeating the work. Blanchot describes his method as one that leaves the text empty by “translating it in its ambiguity through an interrogation henceforth still more ambiguous since it bears this ambiguity, bears upon it, and ends by becoming dissipated in it” (EI, p. 571;IC, p. 390).<br>

Abstract: It is a truism to state that there are as many Augustines as there are interpreters or, in any case, schools of interpretation.
      
            His work could be called an1
         opera aperta, albeit in quite a different sense from the way this expression was meant by its inventor, Umberto Eco.
            Eco's use of this phrase mainly concerned modernist works, such as Joyce's2
         Ulysses, whose very structure allows the reader to find his way in the labyrinth of the artwork without ever arriving at—or, for that matter, departing from—one single, fixed level of meaning. The metaphor of theopera apertaopened up a peculiar combination of structure and randomness, the latter made even more mysterious by modernism's emphasis on austerity of form. While it cannot be denied that for Joyce the fact that every line and every word were meticulously planned and put in their proper place was the precondition for the emergence of riddles and clues, thus widening up the scope of language and meaning, for Augustine things seem to be quite different inasmuch as the flow and width of his discourse is in place right from the beginning. In his case, randomness seems to be part of the structure of the discourse itself, to the extent of beguiling Henri-Irénée Marrou—still the most prominent historian of Augustinian rhetoric—into accusing Augustine of a lack of rhetorical skills: “Saint Augustin compose mal.”
            Fortunately, Marrou retracted this accusation in a later edition of his book:3
         
            One wonders whether this new appreciation of Augustine's style, being part of aI took for incapacity or indifference what was in fact conscious discretion, calculated flexibility, expressive deformation, brought about by adroit maneuvering. I took for barbarism or decadence what was in fact the supreme sophistication of an art that was completely in control of its own techniques and in search of subtle effects. To blame the rhetorician Augustine for “not k~<br>

Author(s): Thistleton Anthony C.<br>
Abstract: The first two chapters of the book are introductory in nature. In the first chapter, Thistleton sets out to justify the enterprise of hermeneutics by delineating its aim and scope and by distinguishing it from the enterprise of philosophy in general. In the second chapter, he contextualizes and integrates contemporary hermeneutics, through the most recent insights and developments, within biblical studies and literary theory. He concludes this chapter by arguing that a proper understanding of hermeneutics requires a multi- and interdisciplinary approach; such an approach is the impetus for chapter 3, which employs the parables of Jesus as a case study in how a multi-perspectival approach casts different shades and light on a given text. With this more general understanding of hermeneutics in hand, it is to the history and development of hermeneutics that he next turns. In the remaining fourteen chapters, he outlines that history beginning with classical Jewish and ancient Greek thought, tracing it through developments in early, medieval, and modern Christianity and following it on up to contemporary continental philosophy. He concludes this narrative arc by looking at some current approaches to hermeneutics, notably liberation and postcolonialist, feminist and womanist, and postmodernist. Clearly, the scope of the work is vast and the breadth of Thistleton's knowledge is encyclopedic, for it not only spans the history of hermeneutics as such but also engages interdisciplinary approaches in contemporary hermeneutics.<br>

Abstract: Astonishingly, Gregory E.

For Ganssle, the fact that Susan becomes a drug addict and porn star is sufficiently explained by her yearning to share the passion of an orchid hunter: “it is no surprise,” he writes, “that she returns to Laroche and enters the world of drugs and pornography” (Gregory E.

Author(s): Bowman Sharon<br>
Abstract: In sum, this is one of the most important books on selves or the practical side of personhood in the last decade. It is also well written; the particular arguments are virtually always clear, and it is not too hard to keep track of their role within in the larger argument of the book. Some portions rise to an almost literary style and provide a rich survey of key ideas in twentieth-century French philosophy, while others engage quite originally with scholarship in moral psychology and theories of self-knowledge that will be more familiar to analytic readers. This work also complements the more detailed ethical theory on Larmore’s other books. Despite its relative inattention to volitional aspects of practical identity, and some questionable moves in the critique of authenticity, then, this work is still highly recommended.<br>

Author(s): Csordas Thomas<br>
Abstract: Among the multiple dimensions of social and cultural imagination, morality occupies a blurred place across social domains, being Religion, on the one hand, and Law, on the other, the traditional loci of the moral in classical anthropology. Tom Csordas’s article helps us think beyond tradition, pointing out a little addressed topic in the emerging subfield of the anthropology of morality: the notion of
         evil, which, by the way, was and still is of central concern in shamanic and witchcraft studies, and also in certain currents of contemporary philosophy. This article interrogates us about the possibility of defining morality “as a cultural system,” in Clifford Geertz’s sense. In doing so, the author seems to discard finally the idea of morality as a “cultural system” for a less systematic, dispersed set of moral meanings that traverse social life. In this undertaking he does not leave the central Geertzian concern on symbols and meaning. Ultimately, human action is mediated by symbols that condense and produce meaning. Here, meaning seems to be the master concept related to the anthropological study of morality. Among the cultural meanings that shape moralities, Csordas finds appropriate introducing cross-cultural notions of evil to enrich any anthropological approach to morality. In the multifarious realms of morality, evil appears as a complex idiom or code through which moral notions are expressed. And among cultural practices, witchcraft and sorcery are of central concern to understand how many societies build their moral frameworks. Regarded both as a human and a cosmological (or nonhuman) phenomenon, evil in Csordas’s view as a cross-cultural analytical category, might enlighten studies about what I may call the “moral installation in the world.” The latter is related with the existential approach to morality proposed in this article. But I consider that, in conceptual terms, morality is always hierarchically included in ontology (what is the nature of ~<br>

Author(s): Fisher Cass<br>
Abstract: Despite these caveats,
   Contemplative Nationis highly recommended for scholars of Jewish studies, religious studies, philosophy, and theology. The book is an excellent example of how to apply hermeneutical theories to the study of Judaism, how to bridge the gap between continental philosophy and analytic philosophy, and how to expand the scope of Jewish studies by appreciating the nature of theological discourse. While Judaica scholars could use the book in university-level courses, and rabbis could apply its approach to synagogue life, the claim that “Israel” is a “contemplative nation” will hardly resonate with most Jews today. It is very doubtful that the book could “guide the way for [the] future” of the Jewish people’s survival (226), precisely because Jews today are overwhelmingly secular, and the culture in which Jews live, both in Israel and in the Diaspora, is anti-intellectual and antitheological. Furthermore, if Fisher is so keen on Philo, he should have also reminded his readers of the fate of Philo’s enterprise: it was no coincidence that Philo became one of the Church Fathers and that his exegetical/hermeneutical project was not adopted by the tradition that became normative Judaism. When “Israel” denotes a nation of divine contemplators, “carnal Israel” (namely “Israel” as a historical, cultural, and ethnic entity) is marginalized, denigrated, and persecuted. It is true that Jewish religious life is theological, but being Jewish cannot be reduced to contemplating God.<br>

Abstract: The meaning of
         catharsisin Aristotle’sPoeticsis heavily debated, with most interpretations clustering around three key translations: purgation, purification, and clarification. In his 1599 treatise on tragicomedy, Giambattista Guarini likened catharsis to the medical procedure of purging, as neither seeks eradication of the target element but instead restoration of balance (The Compendium of Tragicomic Poetry (1599), inLiterary Criticism: Plato to Dryden, ed. Allan H. Gilbert [Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1962], 517–20; see also O. B. Hardison Jr., “Three Types of Renaissance Catharsis,” inPoetics and Praxis, Understanding and Imagination: The Collected Essays of O. B. Hardison, Jr.[Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1997], 78–94). Martha C. Nussbaum has characterized catharsis as a “clearing up” or “cleaning up” of emotions (“Tragedy and Self-Sufficiency: Plato and Aristotle on Fear and Pity,” inEssays on Aristotle’sPoetics, ed. Amélie Oksenberg Rorty [Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1992], 280), and Gerald F. Else has argued that catharsis is a purification of the act of the character rather than a purgation of the emotions of the audience (Aristotle’s Poetics: The Argument[Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1963], 230–31, 422–40). John P. Anton, critiquing Nietzsche’s reading of Aristotle’sPoetics, argues that Nietzsche was incorrect in construing catharsis as a purge of emotions, also claiming that it is a clarification of events (“Nietzsche’s Critique of Aristotle’s Theory of Tragic Emotions,” inTragedy and Philosophy, ed. N. Georgopoulos [New York: St. Martin’s, 1993], 19–38). In light of this ongoing debate about the meaning of a single Greek word, several critics have suggested other language and models through which to examine the phenomenon of audience response to tragedy—a useful critical strategy for discussing how modern audiences might conceptualize their own reaction to what they see on stage.

Author(s): Peperzak Adriaan T.<br>
Abstract: Peperzak in this book also offers continental thinkers an appealing alternative to the theological turn of phenomenology as practiced by Jean-Luc Marion and others. While Peperzak takes seriously the idea that “God cannot be investigated or explained … because God is not given as a describable phenomenon,” this realization does not turn his phenomenology away from the investigation of rational thinking because for Peperzak reason itself has to be rethought in terms of the intersubjective encounters between nonthematizable—human and divine—sayers (121). Consequently, much more than some of the thinkers of the theological turn, Peperzak’s work maintains a broadly humanist sensibility and a conviction that theological thinking and philosophy can be integrated quite well, provided the latter does not close itself off in autarky. In his humanism, Peperzak echoes the best elements in the philosophical style both of his teacher Paul Ricoeur and the philosophical tradition of his own Catholic faith, although he implicitly critiques the former for insisting too vehemently on the autonomy of philosophy (128) and calls out the latter for separating “natural reason” from faith (182–86). For his own part, Peperzak hopes to maintain an open space between faith and reason: “I do not see any valid argument against the integration of philosophical insights into a faith-inspired theology … neither would I protest if an integrated reflection of the Christian community about its faith would call itself
   philosophia” (160). For the many who share similar sentiments today,Thinking about Thinkingwill make a valuable guide to the conversation of philosophy.<br>

Abstract: The Ionian cosmogonies of the sixth century b.c.e. explained how an ordered world evolved out of an undifferentiated initial state of “things.” In the fifth century, science became more particularly an inquiry into the ultimate constitution of material substance: the uniform and permanent “nature of things.” The notion of substance derives from tactile sensation. The belief in substantial things outside us reverts to the original detachment of self from the object. With Heraclitus of Ephesus, philosophy focused on knowing the thing, not on that which is known. Thought controls the phenomena as it constitutes the thinker. The problem of understanding nature was taken to a new level. The Milesian school of philosophers had moved it to the realm of the intellect in that they claimed the universe to be an intelligible whole. The manifold was to be understood as deriving from a sustaining principle or first cause, but was to be perceived in the phenomena.<br>

Abstract: A number of Maybeck scholars emphasize his dedication to the truthful representation of construction materials, often in the context of their discussion of his debt to Viollet-le-Duc's theory. See Cardwell,
               Bernard Maybeck, 58, 73. Woodbridge quotes Charles Keeler, who embraced young architect's design philosophy because "Maybeck detested 'sham, veneers, and things done for sheer effect. If the material used was wood, it should look like wood, not stone'" (Woodbridge,Bernard Maybeck, 24). In fact, the relatively cool reception of the palace was partially due to perception that in this project—a pastiche over light wood and metal frame—Maybeck moved away from the ideal of structural honesty. In this respect, an interesting insight could be found in McCoy's analysis. She also admired Maybeck's honest treatment of wood (McCoy,Five California Architects, 11, 15). However, she also noticed that Maybeck developed a similar approach to plaster. She mentioned Maybeck's experimentations with this material as an attempt to use it in an innovative and honest way, not merely as a cheap substitute for stone (ibid., 13, 18).<br>

Abstract: Abstract: Vico's theory of metaphor is best understood as a monster in the tradition of classical rhetorical invention. It is the mutant offspring of metaphor characterized as "necessary" (an "ear" of com, for example) and metaphor characterized in terms of analogy. From the perspective of his method. Vico marries these apparently incompatible forms inherited from Aristotle and thereby identifies a third type of linguistic metaphor. I argue that the metaphor identifies a stipulatory definition taken out of context. In order to situate this claim, I outline Vico's genetic analysis and elaborate in general terms what metaphor and definition share. Most importantly. Vico insists that beings, actions, and events are linguistically identifiedin some particular diseursive context. Indeed, in many cases that context alone determines whether the expression can be called a definition or a metaphor. Like Cicero's ideal jurist, Vico's hero employs motivated words and realizes possibilities available to common sense. Henee Vico's theory of metaphor is both "constructivist"—language has the power to makes things—and "humartist"—it must do so in a form appropriate to history and culture. Vico's theory is consequently important to us because it challenges the proper/figurative distinction championed in the philosophy of language and adds a pragmatic dimension to contemporary views of metaphor at work in literary theory.<br>

Abstract: The numerous changes and improvements which have been wrought in teacher education courses in the last two decades have not, apparently, satisfied the critics. Ironically, the reverse seems to have occurred, as recent events on both sides of the Atlantic testify. This essay argues that the developments of the last two decades in educational research and teacher education, which have yielded a wealth of new ideas and procedures, have also yielded a confusing proliferation of educational ideologies. In short, it suggests that the ascendancy of a diffuse, unselfcritical, and often combative discourse within educational studies has effectively eclipsed the more important question which must first be tackled if educational studies are to have a coherent, robust focus. This question, which is pursued in the second section of the paper, asks: is the educational enterprise, properly conceived, a distinctive, autonomous or sui generis enterprise with purposes of its own which are universal, or is it essentially a subservient enterprise, a vehicle for one or other currently prevailing ideology (cultural, technological, political, religious, etc.)? In exploring this question the essay puts to work some enduring insights from contemporary European philosophy, arguing that education as a 'practical hermeneutic discipline' holds a singular promise. Some important consequences of this promise for educational studies and teacher education are then considered.<br>

Article Title: Evocative Images<br>
Publisher: National Art Education Association<br>
Issue: i256677<br>
Date: 1 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Schwaller De Lubicz William<br>
Abstract: This paper follows two purposes: the first to unpack some of the artistic cargo of symbols as distinct from the more conventional aspects of them (e. g., their ability to refer to other things or events, and their ability to communicate ideas), and the second to show, by means of contrasts, the actual workings of Interpretation Theory as it could be applied to the analysis of art-making and art-viewing. For the first purpose, the author draws material from philosophy, dramatic writings, linguistic theory, and statements of artists in an analytic search for the often intractable character of the artistic image. For the second purpose, the author demonstrates, through the use of logic and the poetic metaphor, how a particular form of hermeneutic inquiry can be applied to assist an understanding of the assumptions upon which research is often built.<br>

Author(s): Needham Arran E.<br>
Abstract: If the arguments of Edward Said's "Orientalism" are valid, Joseph Needham's "Science and Civilisation in China" stands condemned. The opposition between Foucault, Said's main source of inspiration, and both Marxism and hermeneutics is highlighted. Utilizing the work of MacIntyre, recent hermeneutic philosophy is defended against Foucault, and through this, Needham's work is defended as a form of Marxist hermeneutics.<br>

Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
Issue: i260915<br>
Date: 10 1, 1979<br>
Author(s): VetterAbstract: Arguments by Utpaladeva and Abhinavagupta for evidence of a Self that is one and the same as the Great Lord Śiva are interpreted. The views of these authors are clarified and the contradictory relationship between the limited individual subject and the recognition of the true Self is shown. With the help of Utpaladeva's distinction between "seeing" and "noticing," a further interpretation is attempted. Some remarks are made concerning practical meditation and the theoretical presuppositions of this way of thinking in order to find starting points for a comparison with Western philosophy.<br>

Journal Title: Journal of Architectural Education (1984-)<br>
Article Title: The World in Front of the Work<br>
Publisher: Butterworth-Heinemann<br>
Issue: i262163<br>
Date: 5 1, 1981<br>
Author(s): Gadamer Stephen<br>
Abstract: The title of this essay comes from contemporary hermeneutics, a branch of philosophy devoted to interpretation. It refers to the domain between a human artifact and a beholder. Brought to architecture, this worldly concept implicitly questions the conventional role of the individual amidst historical works. It also offers a common ground on which products of architectural interpretation (performances or fictions) may begin to engage our normally independent territories of history and design. This essay examines the concept of the world in front of the work and speculates on its implications for architectural education. The illustrations portray interpretive projects by the author's students.<br>

Article Title: Hegel and Schleiermacher at Berlin: A Many-Sided Debate<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263719<br>
Date: 3 1, 1974<br>
Author(s): Weiss Richard<br>
Abstract: Anyone who wishes to understand the debate between Hegel and Schleiermacher is forced to confront not only the staggering complexity of their thought but also the disparate nature of the key texts which are available and the fact that many philosophers and theologians approach Hegel and Schleiermacher with misleading preconceptions. This article attempts to illuminate the conflict between the two thinkers by exploring the biographical and historical context in which it arose. The author argues that, while neither thinker depended upon the other in forming his own position, each man kept the other's position constantly in view as a foil for his own. After a consideration of some early indications of conflict, the debate between Hegel and Schleiermacher is traced through a series of events which begins with Hegel's call to Berlin. While Schleiermacher was apparently quite willing to have Hegel come to Berlin, differences in political philosophy soon led to conflict, with the student movement providing a concrete focus for their disagreement. Schleiermacher's role in excluding Hegel from the Berlin Academy of Sciences is shown to have heightened the tensions. The article concludes with an exploration of Hegel's critique of Schleiermacher's dogmatics. It is argued that the intellectual core of the conflict between the two men centers upon the problem of immediate knowledge.<br>

Abstract: In recent years personal construct theory has become increasingly used to underpin research into teachers' thinking, and a number of researchers have opted to give methodological prominence to the repertory grid. This paper points to the limitations of the theory in respect of research outside the domain of psychotherapy and to some of the problems associated with repertory grid studies. It is argued that repertory grids are inherently positivistic and are thus in philosophical tension with the theory on which they are based, a tension that is not removed by researching in a 'conversation paradigm'. The importance of events in personal construct theory is discussed, and it is suggested that an emphasis on events requires the researcher to adopt an approach that is informed by phenomenology and the philosophy of history. Finally, a return is made to the level of research practice,i and a methodological approach is outlined which is-to a greater extent than the repertory grid-consistent with the main thrust of personal construct theory. Stress is given to the importance of the quality of the relationships between constructs, since these have implications for connections between construing and action-an issue which is of crucial importance is the study of teachers' thinking.<br>

Publisher: Philosophy of Science Association<br>
Issue: i209985<br>
Date: 1 1, 1975<br>
Author(s): Rabinow Richard J.<br>
Abstract: Against the background of disputes about modernity and post-modernity in philosophy, this paper probes the differences among Gadamer, Habermas, and Rorty. Focusing on the themes of praxis, phronesis, and practical discourse, it is argued that what initially appear to be hard and fast cleavages and irreconcilable differences turn out to be differences of emphasis. The common ground that emerges is adumbrated as "non-foundational pragmatic humanism". Although there are important differences among these three thinkers each of their voices contributes to a coherent conversation in developing "moral-political vision".<br>

Abstract: Taylor, it has to be noted, would presumably quarrel
with this "either/or" formulation, either interpret the
classics or interpret the world. His Hegel book obvi-
ously falls within the genre of commentary on the tradi-
tion. Furthermore, in the preface to its condensation as
Hegel and Modern Society, he emphasizes the relevance
of Hegel's political philosophy to our time (1979, pp. xi-
xii)

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i20008321<br>
Date: 3 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Jantzen Grace M.<br>
Abstract: Paul Helm's discussion of my book is a clear illustration of some of my central claims about Anglo-American philosophy of religion: he instantiates its undue preoccupation with beliefs, and its erasure of gender. In my reply I show how Helm conflates my objection to such preoccupation with the absurd claim that beliefs are unnecessary, and how he conflates philosophy of religion -- even rationality itself -- with its Anglo-American variants. He refuses to engage with the masculinism implicit both in his selectivity and in the boundaries he seeks to maintain around the discipline; boundaries which, I argue, need to be opened up for philosophy of religion to flourish.<br>

Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishing<br>
Issue: i20010333<br>
Date: 1 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Johnson Greg<br>
Abstract: This essay takes up the claim made recently by Simon Critchley in The Companion to Continental Philosophy that a "feature common to many philosophers in the Continental tradition" is the "utopian demand that things be otherwise." The general question I pursue has to do with whether or not such a claim includes movements within Continental philosophy that do not self-identify with the utopian (like critical theory). The particular question has to do with whether or not the movement of phenomenology is utopian or does it, because of its other commitments, view the utopian as the antithesis to its orientation, which makes that claim that phenomenology is utopian seem strange. My thesis is that phenomenology can be seen as a utopian tradition but that some account must be given that demonstrates this connection to the utopian. In particular, I argue that Maurice Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology provides an understanding of the utopian, which I call a non-conventional view, that is vastly different from the one assumed by most when they see or hear the word "utopian," which I lable conventional. I show that such a non-conventional understanding can be developed in a way that neither requires us to view the utopian solely as opposed to finitude and contingency, nor a form of thought and action from which we necessarily need to dissociate ourselves. It is this non-conventional view of the utopian that in the end enables us to understand how Continental philosophy in general and phenomenology in particular are important bearers of the utopian demand that things be otherwise.<br>

Article Title: Meaning and Method in the Social Sciences<br>
Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishing<br>
Issue: i20010381<br>
Date: 1 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Fisher William P.<br>
Abstract: Academia's mathematical metaphysics are briefly explored en route to an elaboration of the qualitatively rigorous requirements underpinning the calibration and unambiguous interpretation of quantitative instrumentation in any science. Of particular interest are Gadamer's emphases on number as the paradigm of the noetic, on the role of play in interpretation, and on Hegel's sense of method as the activity of the thing itself that thought experiences. These point toward and overlap with (1) Latour's study of the metrological social networks through which technological phenomena are brought into language as modes of being that can be understood, and (2) the way that Rasch's models for measurement comprise a potential beginning for metaphysically astute, qualitatively and quantitatively integrated, mathematical methods in the social sciences. The paper closes with observations on the general problem that is philosophy, the need to remain open to multiplicities of meaning even as clear understandings are sought and obtained.<br>

Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i20099867<br>
Date: 6 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Bird Robert<br>
Abstract: Aleksej Losev's definition of myth centres on the concept of detachment. In modern times detachment has most often figured in the context of philosophical aesthetics, where it is a cognitive category akin to Kant's "disinterestedness" or the Russian formalists' "estrangement." However Losev's usage also makes reference to the ontological sense of detachment as contemplative ascent (cf. Meister Eckhardt's "Abgeschiedenheit"). Thus, Losev's concept of myth combines both senses of detachment, binding perceptual attitude and being together in a double movement of resignation from the world and union with meaning; this movement literally makes sense out of reality. It therefore bears comparison to the treatment of distanciation in contemporary hermeneutics, where detachment is a key condition of understanding. By investigating Losev's connections to other Russian thinkers, the author makes a case for a distinct Russian tradition of hermeneutic philosophy (V. Ivanov, G. Shpet, A. Bakshy, A. Losev).<br>

Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
Issue: i20109441<br>
Date: 1 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Baek Jin<br>
Abstract: In his philosophy of nothingness, Kitarō Nishida illuminates the matrix of transformation of the world "from the Created to the Creating" (tsukuru mono kara tsukurareta mono e) through shintai, or the body. In this matrix, shintai enters into the stage of an action-sensation continuum and emerges as the immaculate iconic tool of nothingness to create new figures as extended self. This idea of shintai has resonance with the development of postwar art in Japan. The "Space of Transparency" put forth by Ufan Lee, the leader of Monoha, is the principal example. This essay investigates Nishida's notion of shintai and its influence on Lee's theory of art.<br>

Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i20118056<br>
Date: 6 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): Schulkin Jay<br>
Abstract: Two philosophical traditions with much in common, (classical) pragmatism and (Heidegger's) hermeneutic philosophy, are here compared with respect to their approach to the philosophy of science. Both emphasize action as a mode of interpreting experience. Both have developed important categories -- inquiry, meaning, theory, praxis, coping, historicity, life-world -- and each has offered an alternative to the more traditional philosophies of science stemming from Descartes, Hume, and Comte. Pragmatism's "abduction" works with the dual perspectives of theory (as explanation) and praxis (as culture). The hermeneutical circle depends in addition on the lifeworld as background source of ontological meaning and resource for strategies of inquiry. Thus a hermeneutical philosophy of research involves three components: lifeworld (as ontological and strategic), theory (as explanatory), and praxis (as constitutive of culture).<br>

Publisher: The Association for Asian Studies, Inc.<br>
Issue: i309659<br>
Date: 2 1, 1979<br>
Author(s): Wei-ming Tu<br>
Abstract: This reflection on Errington's thought-provoking paper, by an intellectual historian and a student of Chinese philosophy, does not dispute her interpretive position on classical Malay literature in general and on hikayat in particular. Rather, it attempts to challenge three salient points of her argument: that the distinction between "oral" and "written" is a hazy one in the paratactic style of the hikayat; that the "images" in this type of literature are flat, repetitive and without content; and that the Malay art of story-telling is diametrically opposed to the rhetorical style of history characteristic of the post-Renaissance West. It is hoped that such a discussion will bring about fruitful encounters between scholars in different fields and disciplines in Asian studies.<br>

Article Title: Tempo e ragione: Il Settecento di Arthur O. Lovejoy<br>
Publisher: Edizioni Dedalo<br>
Issue: i20565615<br>
Date: 6 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): Festa Roberto<br>
Abstract: Dopo un periodo, negli anni Sessanta e Settanta, in cui la fortuna di Lovejoy sembrò
declinare, lo studioso è tornato d'attualità negli anni Ottanta, con la ripresa della di-
scussione teorica intorno alia storia intellettuale. Nel 1987 il «Journal of the History of
Ideas» dedicò un numero per celebrare il mezzo secolo della Great Chain of Being, con
articoli di D.J. Wilson, G. Gordon-Bournique, E.P. Mahoney, F. Oakley e Melvin Ri-
chter (cfr. Lovejoy, «The Great Chain of Being» and the History of Ideas, in «Journal of
the History of Ideas», 48, 2, 1987). Contributi importanti sono inoltre venuti da Donald
R. Kelley, Tattuale editor del «Journal». Tra questi citiamo D.R. Kelley, Horizons of In-
tellectual History: Retrospect, Circumspect, Prospect, in «Journal of the History of Ideas»,
48, 1, 1987, pp. 143-169; e, sempre di Kelley, What is happening to the History of Ideas?,
in «Journal of the History of Ideas», 51, 1990, pp. 3-25. Proprio quest'ultimo articolo
rappresenta a tutt'oggi uno dei piú equilibrad tentativi di bilancio della history of ideas,
e al tempo stesso una meditazione sui futuro della disciplina da parte di uno degli «ere-
di» di Lovejoy. Significativamente Kelley propone di utilizzare Tespressione intellectual
history, e non piú history of ideas, proprio a voler allontanare i «fantasmi» di idealismo
impliciti nella scelta di fare della storia della filosofia il referente privilegiato della di-
sciplina (un'attitudine che era certamente di Lovejoy). Intellectual history è secondo Kel-
ley «doing a kind, or several kinds, of historical interpretation, in which philosophy and
literature figure not as controlling methods but as human creations suggesting the con-
ditions of historical understanding» [What is happening, cit., p. 18). L'approccio inter-
disciplinare, che era stato uno dei punti centrali del programma lovejoyano, rimane an-
cor oggi secondo Kelley valido, anche se ciò non deve significare Tadozione di strumenti
critici «alla moda» propri~<br>

Publisher: Society for Utopian Studies<br>
Issue: i20719896<br>

Author(s): Jenson Michael<br>
Abstract: A recurrent misconception about the concept of utopia fails to realize fully that its essential endeavor constitutes a speculative act involving the distribution of power and resources. Consequently, utopian desire is closely linked to structures of power and can be manipulated by interests in positions of influence within these structures. It is these connections to the machinations of power that bring utopian visions their potential for social/political influence. However, these same types of links also provide avenues for these conceptions to be cynically influenced in ways that can usurp individual autonomy. The role of power and utopia can be analyzed in the formative process of a specific social structure as well as in their contribution to the conception of a common heritage or history. The "historical perspective" often serves as the foundation for the production of propaganda seeking to capture the imagination of a populace either to instigate positive social change or to legitimize an oppressive regime. Through the lens of Collingwood's philosophy of history, this article investigates the connection that the "historical consciousness" has to the attributes of power and utopia as well as the role that this relationship plays in the formation of a collective mentality. In short, it studies the essential characteristics of the bond between individuals that allows a community or collective to perpetuate itself. It also explores how the attributes of power and utopia can use latent historical perceptions to strengthen the process of ideological integration that underlies any social action or formal structure of authority.<br>

Article Title: The Making of a Social Theory: Anthony Giddens' Theory of Structuration<br>
Publisher: North Central Sociological Association<br>
Issue: i20831390<br>
Date: 4 1, 1986<br>
Author(s): Dickie-Clark Hamish F.<br>
Abstract: In this paper I try to show what kind of theory Giddens' theory of structuration is. I do so by first listing what Giddens accepts and what he rejects in his assessments of functionalism, hermeneutics, structuralism, and the writings of Marx. For what I think are good reasons, most of this part is given over to the use Giddens makes of Gadamer's hermeneutic philosophy. Next I set out my understanding of Giddens' view of theory as primarily concerned "with reworking conceptions of human being and human doing, social reproduction and social transformation" (Giddens 1984:xx). I seek to show the crucial implications of this for the way that theory enters directly into and helps to consitute social life. Taken together, these two steps lead to the conclusion that Giddens' theory is neither an attempt at an over-arching "Grand Theory," nor an imposition of new orthodoxy in place of the old. Instead I suggest that his avowed eclecticism is closely akin to the hermeneutic goal contained in Gadamer's concept of the "fusion of horizons." This notion recognizes the never-to-be-completed, but basic, human activity of creatively questioning what has been handed down from the past. It is questioned so that it may be applied — incomplete as it is — to the changed situation of the present with its different interests and problems. That those who can and do question it are themselves the products of past tradition, calls for a kind of social theory that is in some ways different from that modeled on the explanatory "laws" of natural science. I contend that Giddens' theory of structuration is such a theory. (For an introductory overview of the theory itself, see Dickie-Clark, 1984).<br>

Author(s): Chenavier Robert<br>
Abstract: Au cours d'une période qui voit Husserl livrer son testament philosophique, la Krisis, l'étudiante Simone Weil ouvre son Diplôme d'études supérieures, en 1930, par le constat du désarroi dans lequel se trouve l'époque et de l'incertitude dans laquelle nous laisse la science. Il faut opérer un retour à Descartes, dans une automéditation proche de celle que recommandait Husserl. Cependant Simone Weil ne s'oriente pas vers une phénoménologie. Loin d'explorer la sphère d'être du cogito, elle cherche à en sortir, plus rapidement encore que Descartes, pour rencontrer la réalité du monde, et inventer une sagesse pour notre condition d'être percevant, ce qui signifie, avant tout, d'être qui travaille. Seul le travail permet d'éprouver la nécessité réelle, et de retrouver « l'union de l'âme et du monde », dans les conditions créées par l'industrie. C'est dans la ligne de la vocation mondaine de la philosophie de Descartes, que Simone Weil amorce sa réflexion sur le rôle du travail comme fondement d'une sagesse, dans ces nouvelles conditions d'existence déterminées par la forme collective de la production. À partir de 1935, elle verra dans la crise un signe de la « faillite de Descartes ». During the period that Husserl was declaring his philosophical testament, Die Krisis, Simone Weil was a student starting her Diplôme d'études supérieures in 1930, mindful of the utter confusion of the times and of the atmosphere of uncertainty generated by science. One must return to Descartes, in a self-meditation similar to the one recommended by Husserl. But Simone Weil did not move toward a phenomenology. Far from exploring the sphere of being through the cogito principle, she sought to escape from that sphere, even more rapidly than did Descartes, in order to confront the reality of the world and to invent a wisdom for the condition of a conscious being, which means, above all, a being who works. Only work makes it possible to experience real necessity and to reestablish « the union of~<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i211059<br>
Date: 11 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Verheggen Theo<br>
Abstract: By studying Durkheim through a Schopenhauerian lens, the one-sidedly cognitivist and functionalist reception of his social theory can be balanced. Durkheim explicitly rejected such monistic interpretations. His dialectical approach was always aimed at an essentially dualistic perception of man and society, wherein the lower pole, the individual, is central. In Durkheim's symbol theory, this position leads to two kinds of symbols: those that are bound to the human body, here called "this and that" symbols, and those people can choose freely, here called "this for that" symbols. This twofold symbol theory can already be found in medieval philosophy (e.g. Dante Alighieri) as well as in the work of Paul Ricoeur. For Durkheim the human person is the symbol par excellence. By implication the rituals in which the person is (re)constructed, that is the rites of passage, should be central. The interpretation here opens up new perspectives for a more psychological interpretation of Durkheim's sociology.<br>

Abstract: The article analyses the meaning of tattooing as a form of narration. Introducing the body as a text that can convey different forms of thought (derived both from philosophy and from sociology), the author maintains that the body modification is today as an open and living work whose interpretation has an influence on the individual identity and can be changed by means of the interaction with others. A thumbnail sketch of the history of the practice among traditional communities up to contemporary society is drawn to provide a series of fundamental usages for the inscription of the body. The concern here is to show tattooing as an expression of the whole individual (no longer divided into mind vs. body) and of his own perceived identity, underlying the relation of the chosen symbols (and of the symbolic ritual) with society, which remains the main source offering forms of representation and the main stage for the construction of identity. So that the whole final text can be read as the result of a process where the authorship is shattered among the society itself.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i23257667<br>
Date: 10 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Arrigo Bruce A.<br>
Abstract: The ultramodern condition represents the "third wave" in postmodernist-inspired philosophy and cultural practice. Two of ultramodernism's critical theoretical components are the human/social forces, flows, and assemblages that sustain transgression; and the human/social intensities, fluctuations, and thresholds that make transcendence possible as both will and way. In the ultramodern age, then, transcendence is about overcoming and transforming the conditions (i.e., forces, flows, and assemblages) that co-produce harm-generating (i.e., transgressive) tendencies. This manuscript problematizes transgression by way of ultramodern theory. This critical investigation represents "the phenomenology of the shadow," or the ultramodern philosophy of harm. To contextualize this phenomenology and philosophy, the intellectual history of ultramodern thought is recounted. This includes a review of the shadow construct by way of its prominent socio-cultural, psychoanalytic, and political-economic currents; and a chronicling of the reification process (regarding risk, captivity, and harm) since the modernist era (i.e., the industrial revolution). The article concludes with some very speculative observations concerning "the phenomenology of the stranger," or the ultramodern philosophy of transcendence as both will and way.<br>

Publisher: Humboldt State University<br>
Issue: i23261550<br>
Date: 1 1, 1982<br>
Author(s): Jacobs Anton K.<br>
Abstract: This essay suggests Friedrich Nietzsche has a contribution to make to the theoretical enterprise of social science. Contemporary theorizing, reflecting an increased attention to language, has been focusing on the dialogical mode of production and, of course, on hermeneutics. This has led to a renewal of interest in Friedrich Nietzsche. In this essay, two alternative models of the hermeneutic circle are examined: one arising out of the work of the school of Konstanz; the other associated primarily with the work of Juergen Habermas. The former presents a circular image of the "conversational" situation; the latter portrays a time schedule of the process based on the psychoanalytic process of therapy. Nietzsche's contributions are suggested to be significant, in the first model, in regard to the mode of production and, in the second, the stage of the quasi-naturalistic turn. Nietzsche's way to truth is through constant and relentless criticizing. In contrast to the rationalistic practices of Western philosophy, Nietzsche exercised an art of interpreting based on the use of metaphor and aphorism. This practice seems to reflect Nietzsche's concern to communicate truth in a world he saw as inherently ambiguous and dynamic, thus, rendering propositional truth impossible. Nietzsche radically challenges the rational foundations on which we stand. Thus he presents us with a mode of knowledge production that reclaims traditions lost to science. In addition, Nietzsche shows, by word and example, that his existential approach offers a way to see life as a text and source for quasi-naturalistic forays toward understanding. In this way Nietzsche shows that the traditional concept of knowledge is a pseudo-concept by revealing the intimate and inseparable connection between life and knowledge. Knowledge is rooted in life; it is a manifestation of concrete psychological and political realities. Consequently, it makes sense not to ignore life as a source for explanation when examining~<br>

Author(s): Shalin Dmitri N.<br>
Abstract: This paper presents an historical outlook on the macro-micro distinction in modern sociology. It links the genesis of social interactionism and microsociology to the rise of Romantic philosophy and attempts to elaborate methodological principles dividing macro- and microscopic perspectives in sociology. Six ideal-typical distinctions are considered: natural vs. social universality, emergent properties vs. emergent processes, morphological structuralism vs. genetical interactionism, choice among socially structured alternatives vs. structuring appearance into reality, structural vs. emergent directionality, operational vs. hermeneutical analysis. The complementarity of the languages of macro- and microsociological theories is advocated as a foundation for the further elaboration of conceptual links between the two levels of analysis.<br>

Abstract: Dans le sillage de la critique heideggérienne de Husserl, une telle carac-
térisation a été proposée, entre autres, par Friedrich-Wilhelm von Hermann dans
Hermeneutik und Reflexion (Francfort, Klostermann, 2000), qui oppose la phé-
noménologie heideggérienne — phénoménologie herméneutique ou phénoméno-
logie du Dasein — à la phénoménologie husserlienne — phénoménologie de la
conscience ou phénoménologie réflexive. Pour une mise à l'épreuve assez précoce
de cette image de la philosophie de Husserl, nous renvoyons à l'étude de Thomas
M. Seebohm, « Reflexion and Totality in the Philosophy of E. Husserl », Journal
of the British Society for Phenomenology, 1/1973, pp. 20-30, p. 26 en particulier.

Publisher: Giannini Editore<br>
Issue: i23335068<br>

Author(s): Wolfe Charles T.<br>
Abstract: The category "organism" has an ambiguous status: is it scientific or is it philosophical? Or, if one looks at it from within the relatively recent field or sub-field of philosophy of biology, is it a central, or at least legitimate category therein, or should it be dispensed with? In any case, it has long served as a kind of scientific bolstering for a philosophical train of argument which seeks to refute the mechanistic or reductionist trend, which has been perceived as dominant since the 17th century, whether in the case of Stahlian animism, Leibnizian monadology, the neo-vitalism of Hans Driesch, or, lastly, of the "phenomenology of organic life" in the 20th century, with authors such as Kurt Goldstein, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Georges Canguilhem. In this paper I try to reconstruct some of the main interpretive stages or layers of the concept of organism in order to evaluate it critically. How might organism be a useful concept if one rules out the excesses of organismic biology and metaphysics? Varieties of instrumentalism and what I call the projective concept of organism are appealing, but perhaps ultimately unsatisfying.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur has initiated a new direction in the field of hermeneutics by applying the phenomenological method to the interpretation of texts. By this he has effected a transition from description to hermeneutic phenomenology. In order to explicate his position the paper deals with this transformation: In developing hermeneutics Ricoeur tends to eliminate Husserl's transcendental idealism, to retain some central phenomenological motifs, and to add new elements. These elements were eclectically picked up by him from analytic and linguistic philosophy and from the current linguistic and structural theories. Since the deepest and most genuine roots of Ricoeur's thought lie in the phenomenology of Husserl, the paper concentrates on the explication of his phenomenological presuppositions and attempts to show how they were reformulated within the new science of interpretation. Thus, the first part of the paper is mainly an exposition of the transition from phenomenology to hermeneutics. The second part points to some difficulties inherent in such a move. The paper ends with a discussion of the problem of "the hermeneutic circle", which is an immanent part of hermeneutics.<br>

Abstract: To claim that Hayden White has yet to be read seriously as a philosopher of history might seem false on the face of it. But do tropes and the rest provide any epistemic rationale for differing representations of historical events found in histories? As an explanation of White's influence on philosophy of history, such a proffered emphasis only generates a puzzle with regard to taking White seriously, and not an answer to the question of why his efforts should be worthy of any philosophical attention at all. For what makes his emphasis on narrative structure and its associated tropes of philosophical relevance? What, it may well be asked, did (or could) any theory that draws its categories from a stock provided by literary criticism contribute to explicating problems with regard to the warranting of claims about knowledge, explanation, or causation that represent those concerns that philosophy typically brings to this field? Robert Doran's anthologizing of previously uncollected pieces, ranging as they do over a literal half-century of White's published work, offers an opportunity to identify explicitly those philosophical themes and arguments that regularly and prominently feature there. Moreover, White's essays in this volume demonstrate a credible knowledge of and interest in mainstream analytic philosophers of his era and also reveal White as deeply influenced by or well acquainted with other important philosophers of history. White thus invites a reading of his work as philosophy, and this volume presents the opportunity for accepting it as such.<br>

Article Title: La précaution comme souci<br>
Publisher: Presses Universitaires de France<br>
Issue: i23353270<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Guery François<br>
Abstract: La précaution a été critiquée non en elle-même, mais comme « principe », à la fois sur le plan juridique et scientifique. Les formulations du principe prêtaient à confusion, à cause du jargon « scientifique » utilisé (cf. absence de preuves, de « certitudes scientifiques »). Liée à l'urgence, la précaution ressortit à une philosophie de l'agir, qui comporte menace, vulnérabilité, anticipation, appréhension, et c'est de ce côté qu'il faut chercher la logique de la précaution. En premier lieu, une « déduction sémantique a priori » (Derrida) permet de mettre en évidence les caractéristiques de la peur, qui justifie la précaution. En second lieu, un rappel de la tradition philosophique confirme cette déduction, rappel qui va d'Aristote (Rhétorique : ce qu'est la peur et comment on est quand on l'éprouve; Éthique à Nicomaque : le courage, l'intrépidité, la disposition acquise) à Heidegger (Être et Temps : la peur comme disposition insigne, esquisse de l'angoisse, du souci, de la responsabilité, de la résolution), en passant par des étapes essentielles : Augustin (la cura, la curiosité), Kant (derniers écrits), Nietzsche (Seconde Inactuelle). Enfin, et en conclusion, la précaution apparaît non comme une démission de la connaissance, mais comme une incitation à mieux scénariser, à mieux gérer l'avenir, en cultivant une imagination anticipative, complémentaire de l'innovation. If Precaution has been criticized, on both a legal and a scientific level, it is not as an approach in itself but as a Principle. The way the Precautionary Principle has been formulated was confusing, jargonistic : lack of proof, of scientific certainty. Linked as it is to the notion of Emergency, Precaution is part of an Acting Philosophy which includes Threat, Vulnerability, Anticipation and Apprehension; its logic is to be found therein. Firstly, a « semantic deduction a priori » (Derrida) will help to define the characteristics of Fear, which justifies Precaution. Secondly, we shall confirm this d~<br>

Author(s): GOLOMB JACOB<br>
Abstract: Nietzsche's impact on educational thought has always been surprisingly neglected, possibly because it is hard to divorce his educational views from his philosophical endeavour, as a whole which has given rise to considerable scholarly polemics during the last few decades. Recently several articles propagating various interpretations of Nietzsche's educational teaching have been published Their main weakness lies in the fact that Nietzsche's central educational theses are discussed quite apart from his "psychological" philosophy, while it is the philosophy that serves as the necessary background for understanding those theses. The present paper, mainly analyzing nietzsche's essay "Schopenhauer as Educator", will attempt to provide a better insight into Nietzsche's early psychological and pedagogic thought. It will also demonsrate those basic criteria implicit in his method of psychologization, which at the very outset had served Nietzsche as an educational means of testing the integrity of certain examplary personalities. Nietzsche's Educational Thought is established in the service of authenticity — a central and influential Existentialist concept, the main ideas of which are explicated in the paper. Another Nietzschean concept, much negleted yet significant, that of the "Higher-Self", is elaborated and compared to Freud's parallel notion of the "Super-Ego".<br>

Publisher: BRILL<br>
Issue: i23548454<br>

Author(s): GEERTZ CLIFFORD<br>
Abstract: I had the honor of interviewing Clifford Geertz at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, USA, on October 18, 2000. The interview focused on Geertz's theoretical conceptions, the tradition on which he draws, the critique he has encountered, and on interpretive anthropology's future development. Of particular interest was the clarification of his much-debated method, his definition of symbol and his famous definition of religion as a cultural system. Geertz emphasizes his attempt to exercise an applied pragmatic phenomenological and hermeneutical method without any general theory (or philosophy) of meaning, phenomenology, or culture. He maintains that he only has a conceptual framework inspired by different scholars, which nevertheless has consistent focus and perspective, i.e., meaning and symbol. In relationship to this, Geertz defines his symbol within the Peircean semiotic tradition. Therefore, the term symbol is understood as a sign (an index for example), which becomes a symbol via a cultural interpretation. Furthermore, his definition of religion as a cultural system is, in his view, a non-essentialistic definition and therefore is not—as Talal Asad claims—ethnocentric. Although it is Geertz's opinion that interpretive anthropology has been influenced by postmodernism, he predicts that interpretive anthropology's future development will be in reasonable continuity with its past. In my closing comments I tentatively suggest that Geertz may have a theory of interpretation because of his definition of the symbol, his unavoidable assumptions, and his unique method, which has the capacity of grasping the cultural specific in a general way.<br>

Abstract: This article summarizes the claims of Owen Flanagan that psychology can make important criticisms of and viable contributions to both religious and philosophical ethics. Flanagan insists that both fields of ethics should pass the test of what he calls the Principle of Minimal Psychological Realism (PMPR). However, in order for Flanagan to escape naïve naturalism, his PMPR test should be used within a hermeneutic philosophy such as that of Paul Ricoeur. Ricoeur's concepts of "diagnosis" and "distanciation" can help the moral theologian find a limited but important role for PMPR.<br>

Author(s): Schmidinger Heinrich M.<br>
Abstract: The relationship between Sören Kierkegaard and Johann Gottlieb Fichte has been a desideratum of philosophical inquiry for a considerable time. And this for two reasons: firstly, we do not know enough about Kierkegaard's relationship to German idealism, as long as we limit ourselves to the relationship of Kierkegaard-Hegel or Kierkegaard-Schelling. Secondly, there are quite a number of publications, which see in Fichte the most noteworthly intellectual relationship to Kierkegaard within the framework of idealism. It is necessary therefore to raise the following questions: what can we determine from the texts and historical material, which we possess, about Kierkegaard's relationship to Fichte? Is the opinion justified that Fichte is intellectually related to Kierkegaard? The present article's research gives the following answers to these questions: historically speaking there are again and again texts in which Kierkegaard relates to Fichte. Particulary for the early years, a certain occupation with him cannot be denied. As a matter of fact a whole series of formal agreements cannot be overlooked. Nevertheless there can be no question of a real meeting of minds. Fichte was merely an occasion for Kierkegaard to form his own philosophy, in no way however an intellectual partner. This historical result in no way excludes the possibility of comparing Kierkegaard and Fichte on the same intellectual level. Seen from this point of view there is actually a certain reason in establishing an intellectual relationship in the secondary literature. But nevertheless the differences outweigh the agreements. This can not only be ascertained fundamentally insofar as both come from a completely different understanding of reality, but also as regards their concept of subjectivity. Especially, as far as the structures, which ascertain the self-realization of the subjectivity, are concerned, the differences are particulary noticeable. With this result one does not however intend to say, t~<br>

Author(s): Gilbert Paul<br>
Abstract: Jean Ladrière, professeur à l'Université Catholique de Louvain, a développé une réflexion consacrée à la distinction et aux relations de la science et de la philosophie au point de vue épistémologique et ontologique, c'est-à-dire de la vérité. L'article parcourt trois de ses textes, écrits au long d'un demi siècle. La phénoménologie anime de plus en plus la réflexion, lui permettant de recentrer la dynamique de la science en un projet fondamental. Les vérités scientifiques et leur relativité historique sont à comprendre intérieurement à la pratique de la science, dont le philosophe médite le sens en prenant la responsabilité d'en révéler la vérité. L'évolution de la pensée de Ladrière illustre l'évolution de l'université de Louvain qui, fleuron du thomisme restauré par Léon XIII, s'est orienté de plus en plus vers la phénoménologie à l'époque de l'enseignement de notre auteur. Jean Ladrière, professor at the Catholic University of Louvain, developed a reflection on the distinction and relations between science and philosophy from the point of view of epistemology and ontology, i. e. from the point of view of truth. The article considers three of his texts, which span a 50-year period. The increasing influence of phenomenology on his reflection allows Ladrière to re-locate the dynamic of science in a fundamental project. The truths of science, and their historic relativity, are to be understood as belonging within the practice of science, while it is the task of philosophy to reflect on its meaning, by revealing its truth. The evolution of Ladrière's thought illustrates the evolution of the university of Louvain, which, from being a centre of the Thomism which was reinstated under Leo XIII, adopted a progressively more phenomenological orientation during our author's time as a teacher there.<br>

Abstract: Il est souvent refusé à la philosophie de tenir un discours d'affirmation de Dieu. Face à des objections d'hier et d'aujourd'hui aussi diverses que contradictoires, on veut montrer ici la légitimité d'un tel discours. Celui-ci suppose une double rupture: rupture avec une conception minimal ou formaliste de la raison qui refuse de se prononcer sur le principe de la vie; rupture avec une métaphysique intemporelle qui manque le nécessaire enracinement anthropologique de la question de Dieu. Philosophy is often denied discourse regarding the affirmation of God. Confronting the diverse and contradictory objections of the past and today, an attempt is made to show the legitimacy of such discourse. It supposes a double rupture: with the minimal or formalist conception of reason that refuses to pronounce on the principle of life; and with an untemporal metaphysic that lacks the necessary anthropological roots in the question of God.<br>

Abstract: L'article porte sur les recherches que Husserl entreprend sur la géométrie dans les années 1892-1894. Dans une première partie, nous dégageons une méthode épistémologique originale, qui n'apparaît ni dans la Philosophie de l'arithmétique, ni dans les Recherches logiques. Dans une seconde partie, nous reprenons l'analyse logique que Husserl tente sur la géométrie de son temps, et les analyses réflexives, qui retracent la formation de la représentation de l'espace. This paper is based on the researches that Husserl carries out on geometry in 1892-1894. In the first part, we bring out an epistemogical method, which appears neither in the Philosophy of arithmetic nor in the Logical Investigations. In the second part, we study the logical analysis that Husserl tries on geometry, and the reflexive analysis, that explains the formation of the representation of space.<br>

Article Title: Globalization, Democracy and the Aesthetic Ecology of Emergent Publics for a Sustainable World: Working from John Dewey<br>
Publisher: BRILL<br>
Issue: i23653923<br>
Date: 1 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Taylor Betsy<br>
Abstract: The global justice movement reveals a diverse array of emergent publics striving politically for a sustainable world. Working partly from John Dewey, we try to illuminate democratic grounds for knowledge and action in these endeavors. We begin by situating Dewey's ideas in the politics of American history, especially historian John Diggins' countervailing approach to issues of authority, knowledge and opinion. Diggins, against Robert Westbrook and others, contends that Dewey's philosophy of politics chased radical democratic illusions, whereas he might have learned from Charles S. Peirce to uphold the boundary between professional communities and other entities including democratic publics. Dewey saw no democratic alternative to harness the political energy of ordinary people. We argue that Dewey had come to understand that a corporate state system of political economy had come to engulf both the liberal democratic polity and the professions. Dewey's political challenge to the professions and his illumination of the aesthetic ecology of democratic publics prefigure a democratic republican alternative that opens up a new basis for participation in the global justice movement confronting, among other obstacles, a transnational corporate state based in the USA. A Marxist-progressivist notion of the ongoing socialization of markets by corporate capitalism too often reinforces an anti-Populist intellectual sensibility that is coupled with, whether wittingly or not, either a social-democratic elitism or a revolutionary vanguardism. Globalization struggles need, on the contrary, a pragmatic vision of democratic publics instituting a true diversity of policies assuring a world-in-common. The fight for public spaces in the treacherous politics of civil society and global consumerism is a struggle against subjectivization. The fact that corporate state elitism, in the U.S. context, feeds on a rightist version of nationaism does not mean we can junk the history of democratic s~<br>

Author(s): Escudier Alexandre<br>
Abstract: Le lien entre pensée philosophique et pensée juive chez Hermann Cohen se confond avec son concept de raison ou de rationalité. Dès ses premiers travaux, il s'attache à éprouver la dimension universaliste de la tradition juive. Or la rationalit/e du judaïsme réside, selon lui, dans l'idée d'une morale universelle, qui se manifeste avant tout dans la pensée messianique. Ce lien apparaît le plus clairement dans les écrits qui font converger le judaïsme et la philosophie kantienne dans l'horizon de la raison. Sous l'aspect de la philosophie pratique, cette convergence rejoint le projet politique de l'assimilation du judaïsme et de la culture allemande. The link between philosophical reflexion an Jewish thought in Hermann Cohen is thoroughly determined by his concept of reason or rationality. Since his earlier works Cohen tries to show the universalistic dimension of Jewish tradition. Now the rationality of Judaism lies in its universal morality, which is inherent to the perspective of messianism. This appears clearly in those works where Cohen brings together Judaism and Kantian philosophy with regard to the idea of reason. In the field of practical philosophy such a convergency is part of the political project of assimilation between Judaism and German culture.<br>

Article Title: Jean Paul Sartres existentielle Psychoanalyse: Korrektur der Metapsychologie und narzißmustheoretische Antizipationen<br>
Publisher: Franz Steiner Verlag GmbH<br>
Issue: i23676219<br>
Date: 1 1, 1976<br>
Author(s): HEINZ RUDOLF<br>
Abstract: On démontrera en particulier que le caractère strictement phénoménologique de la psychanalyse existentielle permet non seulement de dépasser la forme traditionnelle de la métapsychologie psychanalytique et le caractère reificateur de ses concepts, mais encore que celle ci a même anticipé la problématique specifiquement narcissique de Kohut. Le fait que cette psychanalyse existentielle puisse formuler les problèmes de manière plus adèquate en raison de son approche phénomenologique n'exclut pas que, inversement, la théorie narcissique puisse à son tour crtiquer la psychanalyse existentielle, là où celle ci tend à poser les états psychopathologiques comme structures d'être. Cet article se termine par une considération critique sur le manque de place que la théorie narcissique accorde à la sexualité et sur l'apolitisme radical de celle ci qui la démarque de la théorie sartrienne et de son évolution philosophique. First it is demonstrated that the strictly phenomenological approach of existential psychoanalysis is able to overcome the traditional form of the Freudian psychoanalytical metapsychology by means of its concretizing terms. Then it is pointed out that existential psychoanalysis has been anticipating problems, especially in the field of Kohut's theory of narcissism. The fact that it can illustrate these problems more adequately because of its phenomenological approach does not mean that the other way round the theory of narcissism cannot criticize the existential psychoanalysis — that is to say in its tendency towards attributing a psychopathological state to patterns of being. Lastly critical remarks are made regarding the diminution of sexuality in the theory of narcissism as well as its apolitical sealing — off — the latter being in contrast to the further development of Sartre's philosophy.<br>

Author(s): Sabete Wagdi<br>
Abstract: This article aims at explaining, on the one hand, the inadequacy of the formalist positivist method in answering the essential questions of constitutional Law, such as the validity of the constitutional norm, the sovereignty of the people which comes before the original constitutional act and the effects of a theory of values on the limitation of the revision power. On the other hand, it proposes an onto-axiological approach, which refers to the Philosophy of Law. A relevant methodology of constitutional science of Liberty helps the specialists to follow the progress of knowledge. It puts forward means for approaching the subject matter of science (the norm), the constitutional environment and the theoretical basis of the norm. Following this proposed method would help not only in describing the norms but also in checking their validity, their justification and their imperfection when compared with their aims. These thought processes are a never ending search, that is to say a characteristic of science itself.<br>

Publisher: Franz Steiner Verlag<br>
Issue: i23676311<br>
Date: 1 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Dédeyan Daniel<br>
Abstract: Departing from the disconcerting tact that the only passage where Kant mentions court practice is in a chapter on art, the essay undertakes a reconstruction of Kant's esthetics. As to beauty, the judgment of taste appears as a judgment on the ability to judge, and it is universally valid not because it is true, but because it is communicable. Kant's notion of art turns out to be the autonomous discourse of taste as his notion of morality stands for autonomy of man and his notion of law for autonomy of civil society. However, Kant's esthetical experience of the sublime as appearance of what neither mind nor senses grasp breaks up harmony and autonomy and unjudges judgment. At this point, the essay uncovers an intrinsically destabilizing force of Kant's ‚reason‘, traces the consequences for the judicial judgment and gives a perspective to philosophy of law within a differentiated society.<br>

Abstract: The main end of this article is to offer a critical analysis of autonomy conceived as a basic idea in modern educational philosophy. After the tragic experience and dramatic consequences of totalitarianism, is not possible to defend a kantian concept of autonomy as a unique source of moral responsibility and ethical action. After holocaust, we need to defend, on the contrary, the principle of previous value of heteronomy, conceived as the practice of otherness, in its levinasian perspective. So, the authors explore the thesis of the prior value of heteronomy on autonomy, as a source and foundation of moral responsibility in educational relationship, and to reflect the general educational implications of the jewish philosophical tradition of otherness in philosophical educational discourse.<br>

Abstract: O filme Diamante de Sangue [Blood Diamond] de Edward Zwick oferece a possibilidade de uma reflexão à volta de três aspetos da noção de testemunho no âmbito da Filosofia da Religião: 1) a ideia de que o testemunho (absoluto), enquanto matriz das culturas humanas, sustenta a atividade jornalística e a sociedade da informação possibilitando não apenas a sua desconstrução como também a (re-)atualização de uma dimensão testemunhal do jornalismo; 2) as condições de possibilidade da conversão da consciência, isto é, da rutura com o estado de má-fé (auto-engano) necessária à consciência testemunhal e religiosa; 3) a indissociabilidade da experiência testemunhal e da doação, correlativas da experiência religiosa entendida como "fundação mútua" do divino e da testemunha (constituinte), experiência religiosa da qual surge o testemunho. Acrescentaremos ainda a ideia de que a experiência testemunhal ganha sentido à luz da metafísica do tempo do projeto. The film Blood Diamond from Edward Zwick offers the possibility of a reflection concerning three aspects of the concept of testimony within the Philosophy of Religion: 1) the idea that the testimony (absolute), while source of human cultures, supports the journalistic activity and gives information to the society; not only in its deconstruction but also in (re-)updating the testimonial dimension of journalism, 2) the conditions of possibility of the consciousness conversion, meaning, the rupture with the state of bad faith (self-deception) will required to the testimonial and religious consciousness, 3) the inseparability of the testimonial experience and donation, correlates in the religious experience, understood as “mutual foundation” of the divine and the witness (constituent), religious experience from which comes the testimony. We add further the idea that the testimonial experience makes sense in light of the metaphysics of time of project.<br>

Abstract: In order to manage our daily lives, we make many decisions based on empirical evidence derived from instrumental action. At the other extreme, we are often attracted by a so-called postmodern solution that invites us to make arbitrary choices. In the education system, the pressing dilemma should not be a choice between standards of competence or unthinking relativism, but how to take action towards intercultural tolerance. Establishing a small teacher training course for a group of British Muslims has shown that communicative action informed by understanding can be disabled by the instrumentality of positivist frameworks, such as those used by government inspectors. In philosophy, Ricoeur offers a provisional dialectic of hope that can be used to show why neither positivist methods, rational analytic philosophy, postmodernity nor any one belief system for interpreting the world should be allowed to exert hegemonic control. The ethicopractical philosophy of Ricoeur also offers a reconstructive view of reality that helps us to rehabilitate belief in human nature and encourages us to seek solutions to conflicts of interpretation in understanding others. It is applied, in this instance, to project work with Muslim women in the UK, in which an ontology of action shows the power of working collaboratively towards an understanding of oneself as another.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur's book Oneself as Another, represents a major achievement in the development of a philosophy of selfhood. By dialectically linking the self to otherness, others, and the Other, Ricoeur makes a substantial move beyond Modern philosophical theories of identity and selfhood. However, contrary to Ricoeur's own intentions, his unique formulation of selfhood defined in terms of the power-to-do, or conatus, ultimately inscribes the other within the circle of the self-same, and thereby fails to let the other be other.<br>

Abstract: The article of M. Lilla marks the political position of Derrida in the context of French philosophy since Sartre. Presenting him as an engaged opponent of existentialism and structuralism Lilla shows that Derrida's vehement philosophical fight is directed fundamentally against what he calls the logocentrism of all western philosophy. Derrida's only remedy against this disease: deconstruction of the language. In applying this recipe himself, Derrida ends at a somewhat mysterious one and only notion, the concept of justice, which according to him is not destructible and should not be destructed. The provocative explanation Lilla gives for the surprising fact, that Derrida's most fervent adherents live in the United States is the unlimited self-confidence and good nature of the Americans.<br>

Author(s): Ophir Natan<br>
Abstract: Rav H̱isday Crescas (1340-1410/11), Rabbi of Aragonese Jewry in Christian Spain and a major figure in medieval Jewish philosophy, is unique in positing an all-embracing thesis of Love. This thesis permeates his theories of cosmogony, metaphysics and theology and generates far-reaching didactic implications. This article examines Crescas' rather bold description of Love as a positive Divine attribute, an anthropopathism meant to convey ontological meaning about the Divine Nature via an analogous construct. Themes such as Infinite Goodness, Joy and Kindness enable Rav H̱isday to structure a new conception of the Creator and Providence. After postulating Divine Love as the Cosmic Force sustaining creation, Crescas explains the purpose of Torah and mitzvot in terms of evoking love for God thus drawing the soul to link up to the Divine Overflow of Love. Even spiritual existence after death is explicated in terms of the soul's love for its Divine Source. To understand Crescas' unique theory of Love, we compare it with the views of his predecessors and analyze his use of philosophic sources such as the 5th century BCE pre-Socratic scientist-mystic Empedocles. We examine educational aspects of Crescas' teachings on love and view them in context of the mass conversions to Christianity resulting from the 1391 riots. Finally, Crescas' ideas are read as pedagogical messages relevant to both Jews and conversos in the twenty traumatic years after 1391 when he served as chief rabbi and political leader in Saragossa.<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24049943<br>
Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Bell Allan<br>
Abstract: This article questions the aptness of 'discourse analysis' as a label for our field, and prefers the less reductionist concept of 'Discourse Interpretation'. It does this through drawing on ideas from the field of philosophical hermeneutics – the theory and practice of interpreting texts. It operationalizes and adapts the construct of the Interpretive Arc from the philosophy of Paul Ricoeur in order to address issues that are central to discourse work, including that of how we warrant the validity of our textual interpretations. The Interpretive Arc consists of six interlinked phases, which the article presents and exemplifies through discussion of a single text – the story of Babel. Phase I of the arc defines readers as being in a state of Estrangement before the text because of the distancing created by its written or technological form. Phase 2 is that of Pre-view, the state of opinion or knowledge that readers bring to a text. At phase 3, a first reading forms readers' Proto-understanding, their initial 'guess' at what the text means. Then processes of Analysis (phase 4) test and evidence the validity of alternative readings, limiting the interpretations which can plausibly be taken from a text. Three byways of interpretive analysis are challenged and discarded: the dominance of author intention, structuralist analysis and limitless polysemy. Analysis then leads into 5, the phase of informed Understanding of the matter or injunction of the text, of what is disclosed or unfolded before the text. The Interpretive Arc is completed in phase 6, Ownership. Here, through processes of critique of their own and the text's ideologies and of fresh listening, readers are led to a new self formed by the matter of the text. There is a dialectic amongst Analysis, Understanding and Ownership, with each informing and modifying the other. The approach emphasizes interpretation as the heart of discourse work. The 3000-year-old narrative of Babel is a subject as well as an object h~<br>

Author(s): Pellauer David<br>
Abstract: I offer some comments from the perspective of someone familiar with the work of Paul Ricoeur on Allan Bell's proposal that discourse studies take a hermeneutic turn drawing on Ricoeur's idea of an arc of interpretation. I suggest that such a hermeneutic turn would need to be more radical than Bell proposes in that he limits it largely to questions of method, without really addressing how it might affect our understanding of either the object of discourse studies or the goal of such studies. This does raise the question, however, whether discourse studies should be considered a subdiscipline of hermeneutical philosophy.<br>

Abstract: In this article, Levinas' ethical metaphysics is analyzed and his contribution to present-day philosophy is described. In his philosophy, ethics is not something that originates in the autonomous will, as Kant would have premised. It is, rather, the result of the traumatic rupturing of the I by the Other, a heteronomous event. The I's passivity in being opened by the Other is highlighted by Levinas in the words "substitution," "obsession," and "being elected." The I, in the critical Others' eyes, is guilty. The infinity in the Other's demand, regarding the I, is divine. It would be a fatal misunderstanding of Levinas to think that, with the insertion of the word "God," he becomes a theologian. In this article the relation between ethics and politics is discussed and their relation to God is pointed to. In this way, Levinas' discourse on God is demonstrated as being fitting for our time, after the crisis of humanism during the Holocaust. In the course of the article, the question of whether there "is" a God in the eyes of Levinas, and if man "needs" Him is answered. In other words, the logical status of the word "God" in Levinas' philosophy is defined.<br>

Article Title: The Development of the Category of "the Other" and the Implications of its Effect on the Dialoguic Philosophy of Buber / התפתחות הקטגוריה של ה"אחר" והשלכותיה על התפיסה הדיאלוגית של מ' בובר<br>

Abstract: The purpose of this article is to examine the development of the notion of "The Other" and to trace the implications of its effect on the dialoguic Philosophy. In "I and Thou" this category was not developed, at best it was suggested only vaguely, for in this text Buber does not carry out any ontological explication of this category. But such an explication was necessary and was later formulated gradualy by Buber. The clearer the ontological explication, the sharper the category of "the Other" is delineated. It is this category which establishes the I-Thou relationship. This development is expressed in Buber's writings with great tension, and we analyze it in detail, for the category of "the Other" and the central position which it occupies undermine the significance of the I-Thou relationship as it is presented in the book "I and Thou". Together with an acceptance of the primacy of "the Other" in this relationship, we must also assert the primacy of the "I" as the subject of reflective action, of the recognition of the other in his otherness. In this situation it is not the relationship which comes first but the detachment and the aloneness which exist between the I and Thou. We now have to rewise the notion of the dialogue from that purety of an event without content to that of an action of mutual assertion between I and the Other, where each one asserts the other in his otherness, where at the same time each is conscious of being asserted by the Other.<br>

Abstract: The article deals with the problem of revelation in Levinas' writings. The first part of the article analizes Levinas' ideas on the Same and the Other, more particularly the topics of the face and of discourse, as these come to the fore in the first section of Totality and Infinity. Investigating the non-totalising relationship between the Same and the Other presents us with the suitable framework for understanding the relation between the finite and the Infinite. Leaving out any ontotheological speech, Levinas shows how Metaphysics is enacted in the ethical relation. The second part cootinues with a description of Levinas' position on revelation in the Jewish tradition. The active Interpretation of Biblical texts "beyond the verse" represents an opportunity of hearing the divine word today and to enter into a more primordial Order than the Order of the Same. In the course of the article, we point to affinities and striking similarities between E. Levinas' and F. Rosenzweig's view on revelation. We also demonstrate how Levinas Orients his Jewish writings to his philosophy of the Other and vice versa. In writing on revelation, Levinas' main concern seems to be the description of the possibility of a fracture in the immanent order of totality and in the self-sufficiency of reason which is its correlative. This fraction is produced by the command "thou shalt not kill", calling the Same to open itself to the Other.<br>

Abstract: L'œuvre de Francis Jacques est innovante. Du « dialogisme transcendantal » à la « philosophie de l'interrogation », deux jalons sont posés; ils commandent une alliance inédite du formel et du transcendantal. Par la reprise radicalisante des schèmes criticistes, l'activité symbolique devient le miroir où se reflète l'originarité a priori des structures érotétiques de la pensée et du texte. Avec une effectivité peu commune nourrie par la logique de l'interrogation, F. Jacques montre que l'interrogativité est constitutive de l'acte de penser. In the work of Francis Jacques, the innovation is remarkable : his heuristic model goes from his transcendantal dialogism to his erotetical philosophy. Along this itinerary, the critical schemes become converted; in consequence, on the new path of a formal and transcendantal logic revisited, the language appears as a miror where is strongly expressed the a priori originarity which is specific to the interrogative structures of text and thought.<br>

Publisher: Carfax Publishing Company<br>

Date: 1 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): FREEMAN MICHAEL<br>
Abstract: Genocide is a political catastrophe. Yet it has not received much academic attention. A few social scientists have studied it. Philosophers have largely ignored it. There is a large literature on the Holocaust, but there is little agreement as to how this should be related to other genocides. Some have argued that the Holocaust represented a crisis of Western culture, but that Western culture has not responded adequately for the lack of the appropriate self-understanding. This crisis has been attributed to the predominance of scientistic models of rationality in our culture. Social-scientific approaches to genocide have been criticised because of their commitment to logical empiricism, which is held to be epistemologically and ethically inadequate. Ethical approaches based on liberal humanism have been criticised by post-Nietzschean philosophers for their attachment to allegedly outworn metaphysical assumptions. However, the deconstruction of social science and liberal ethics leads in the direction of relativism and nihilism, which are either useless or dangerous in the face of evils such as genocide. The arguments against conventional social science and ethics are examined, and a counter-critique made of post-modern philosophy in order to clear the ground for constructive thinking about genocide.<br>

Abstract: Concerning the modern discussion about the relation between event and narration and "Time and Narration" (Paul Ricœur) the author asks about the relation between entanglement and narration in Wilhelm Schapps philosophy of stories. The philosophy of stories does not approve a systematisation of the topic but does allow its discussion under various aspects. Among those, the author chooses the existence of narrations in the stories of the entangled, the silent speaking, the entanglement in a positive world and the relation between the story of one's life and poetry. The essay also is a contribution to basic questions of narrative ethics.<br>

Author(s): Bonnemann Jens<br>
Abstract: In ethics, when discussing problems of justice and a just social existence one question arises obviously: What is the normal case of the relation between I and you we start from? In moral philosophy, each position includes basic socio–anthropological convictions in that we understand the other, for example, primarily as competitor in the fight for essential resources or as a partner in communication. Thus, it is not the human being as isolated individual, or as specimen of the human species or socialised member of a historical society what needs to be understood. Instead, the individual in its relation to the other or others has been studied in phenomenology and the philosophy of dialogue of the twentieth century. In the following essay I focus on Martin Buber's and Jean–Paul Sartre's theories of intersubjectivity which I use in order to explore the meaning of recognition and disrespect for an individual. They offer a valuable contribution to questions of practical philosophy and the socio–philosophical diagnosis of our time.<br>

Author(s): Kowalewicz Michel Henri<br>
Abstract: Few of the German word creations of modern times were assimilated into other European languages to such an extent as the concept of >Weltanschauung<. The historical reception of the concept in France confirms the principle formulated by Paul Ricœur that asserts the existence of »untranslatable« terms and recommends that we dispense with their translation, and that we make use of such expressions in the original language so as not to distort their content. Why should the notion of >Weltanschauung< have exerted such a strong influence, especially on the French language? The question arises naturally. The translation of >Weltanschauung< into the Polish »światopogląd« is too strongly associated with the tradition of Marxist-Leninist doctrine. It is worth taking stock and systematically working through such issues surrounding the translation of such philosophically important terms. This will help ensure that those key concepts of German philosophy that continue to be important in the Humanities as studied in various European languages, obtain a more uniform and binding form.<br>

Abstract: Vgl. dazu den § 17 von Sein und Zeit (Tübingen 151975), wo HEIDEGGER die Spur in den
Zusammenhang mit Denkmalen und Zeugnissen stellt, die Vergangenes zugänglich machen (78).
Im § 37 dagegen wertet Heidegger das einer Sache Auf-der-Spur-Sein als Form des Geredes ab
(173). Der § 58 wiederum spricht davon, wie man die Spur findet, die zur Enthüllung der Phäno-
mene führen kann (281). Auf die über den normalen Sprachgebrauch hinausgehende Bedeutung
der Spur bei Heidegger hat zuerst Otto PöGGELER verwiesen, dessen Aufsatz: Passing-by and
the Trace: Hölderlin and Celan (in: Hegel and Hölderlin. Spéculative Philosophy and Hermeneu-

Abstract: Der Horizont der Vergangenheit bildet nicht den Horizont an sich, wie das historische Be-
wußtsein ihn meint, sondern den vom Interpreten entworfenen Horizont. Gadamer anerkennt
die Bemühung um den Entwurf des historischen Horizontes. Der Interpret ist jedoch geschicht-
lich, so daß der Horizont derselben historischen Zeit, je nach dem Zeitalter des Interpreten, an-
ders entworfen werden muß. In Wirklichkeit gibt es allerdings viele hermeneutische Literatur, die
vom historischen Horizont spricht, als ob es ein objektiv und eindeutig zu bestimmender Hori-
zont wäre. So ζ. B. Wolfgang Pannenberg: Hermeneutik und Universalgeschichte. In: Zeit-
schrift für Theologie und Kirche. Bd. 60 (1963) S. 90—121, hier S. 116. Yoshio Hirako: Gadamä
to Gendai-shi [Gadamer und gegenwärtige Gedichte]. In: Doitsu Bungaku [Deutsche Literatur]

Jr: Validity in Interpretation (New Häven 1967) p. 254. - Hirschs Hermeneutik, die im oben ge-
nannten Buch entfaltet wird, ist das genaue Gegenbild zu Gadamers Hermeneutik. Hirsch sagt,
daß der mit dem Gegenwartshorizont zu verschmelzende historische Horizont im voraus be-
stimmt werden müsse, damit die Horizontverschmelzung möglich sei. Der Textsinn selbst müsse
zunächst aufgefaßt und dann die Bedeutung zur Sprache gebracht werden, die der Textsinn für
den Leser hat. Dagegen lehnt Gadamer vom Standpunkt der geschichtlichen Endlichkeit des
Menschen aus den Dogmatismus von „Sinn an sich" ab (477) und stellt die Unterscheidung von
Sinn und Bedeutung in Frage. Hirsch versteht wegen seiner eigenen hermeneutischen Stellung
nicht, daß der historische Horizont es ist, der in der Erweiterung des Gegenwartshorizonts provi-
sorisch entworfen und am Ende des Verstehens aufgegeben wird. Vgl. Joseph J. Kockelmans:

Abstract: Attached for a long time to the illusion of its national "singularity", French philosophy has remained, for a good part of this century, closed to any foreign influence (with the exception of German phenomenology and existentialism). This situation started to change, however, in the early 1980's. From that moment on, the tendency to translate foreign philosophy has strongly increased among French publishers, allowing France to take a more active part in the international philosophical conversation. The French-American dialogue, in particular, is currently experiencing an expanding phase – but this recent trend must continue to be encouraged from both sides of the Atlantic.<br>

Abstract: There is an obvious parallel between foundationalism, which ignores history in working out the conditions of knowledge, and radical relativism, which contends that by virtue of its own historical character there is no way to choose among different interpretations, all of which are "equally good." Might it not be, rather, that the recent historicist attack on the very idea of rationality is as damaging as foundationalist objections against the plurality of conceptual schemes or frameworks? Can philosophy maintain the traditional distinction between the form and content of knowledge, between rationality and historicity between doxa and episteme?<br>

Article Title: NARRATIVE UNITY AS A CONDITION OF PERSONHOOD<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd<br>
Issue: i24439507<br>
Date: 10 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): CHRISTMAN JOHN<br>
Abstract: In this article I critically discuss a claim made by several writers in philosophy and the social sciences that for an individual to count as a person, a single personality, or the subject of a life, the experiences of the subject in question must take a narrative form. I argue that narrativity is a misleading and, in some ways of understanding it, implausible condition of what it is that adds unity to personhood and personality. I pursue this critique by considering canonical accounts of narrativity in philosophy and literary studies. I consider those connections between events that must hold for the sequence to be considered a narrative: causal, teleological, and thematic connections. I argue that for each of these, the condition that experiential sequences (for a given subject) must have this structure is empty: any life sequence that is reflected upon in an interpretive spirit can meet it. What the condition of narrativity amounts to, then, is the more basic requirement that the person must be able to look upon the factors and events of her life with a certain interpretive reflection, whether or not those factors and events have any particular narrative unity in a traditional sense.<br>

Author(s): HEDERMAN MARK PATRICK<br>
Abstract: Is it possible to connect with the God-who-may-be without paying attention to the tapping on the wall from the other side? Kearney remains within the orbit and the idiom of so-called postmodern philosophy while he expresses phenomenologically the relationship with God as ultimate other. If we are to remain within the confines of postmodern philosophy to articulate such presence, access to what Rilke calls "heart-work" as opposed to "work of sight" might best be glimpsed through excavation of "decisiveness" in the musings of the later Heidegger.<br>

Article Title: THE QUESTION OF VOICE AND THE LIMITS OF PRAGMATISM: EMERSON, DEWEY, AND CAVELL<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishing<br>
Issue: i24439785<br>
Date: 1 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): COLAPIETRO VINCENT<br>
Abstract: One criticism of pragmatism, forcefully articulated by Stanley Cavell, is that pragmatism fails to deal with mourning, understood in the psychoanalytic sense as grief-work (Trauerarbeit). Such work would seemingly be as pertinent to philosophical investigations (especially ones conducted by pragmatists) as to psychoanalytic explorations. Finding such themes as mourning and loss in R. W. Emerson's writings, Cavell warns against assimilating Emerson's voice to that of American pragmatism, especially Dewey's instrumentalism, for such assimilation risks the loss or repression of Emerson's voice in not only professional philosophy but also American culture. While granting Emerson's distinctive voice, this essay argues that the way Cavell insists on differences problematically represses recognition of the Emersonian strains in Dewey's own philosophical voice. In doing so, Cavell falsely flattens the resounding depth of Dewey's philosophical voice and narrows the expansive range of pragmatic intelligence. But Dewey all too often lends himself to such a misreading, for his writings at once repress and embody the strains of a distinctively Emersonian voice.<br>

Abstract: In this article, principally through autobiographical remarks, some observations concerning philosophical temperament are made, the example of Gerd Buchdahl as a textual interpreter of classic philosophical texts is invoked, and the position of philosophy in relation to history of science is explored, in particular in the work of Kuhn and Foucault. The article concludes with a reminder of the overall history of philosophy at Cambridge through a discussion of the history of the moral sciences.<br>

Author(s): SEIGNAN Gérard<br>
Abstract: Au début du XIXe siècle, la philosophie de l'âme fournit des arguments aux psychologues qui, à la fin de ce siècle, réfléchissent sur les faits de conscience. Ils mettent alors en évidence les caractéristiques psychophysiologiques de l' « effort volontaire », force psychique qu'ils insèrent dans une phénoménologie de l'agir. Dans la première moitié du XXe siècle, de nouveaux discours reformulent la trame conceptuelle élaborée au siècle précédent et les psychologues, attentifs aux procédures adaptatives de l'énergétique humaine, livrent un autre mode de lisibilité de l'effort quand celui-ci représente, avant tout, un combat pour (sur)vivre. Early 19th-century philosophy of the mind or soul would provide arguments for psychologists who, at the end of this century, inquired into the facts of consciousness. They in turn highlighted the psychophysiologic characteristics of « voluntary effort », a psychic force that they placed within a phenomenology of the act. In the first half of the 20th century new discourses reformulated the elaborate conceptual framework of the previous century, and the psychologists attentive to the adaptive procedure of human energetics, offered a different reading of what effort means when it represents above all a struggle for survival.<br>

Abstract: Sven Arntzen arrive, par une analyse détaillée, à une conclusion qui n'est
pas loin de l'idée de J. Patocka : « Duty to oneself requires that one resist
political authority under certain circumstances and thus is a basis for
permissible resistance. ».Kant on duty to oneself and resistance to political
authority, in Journal of the History of Philosophy, juilllet 1996, vol. 34, n°3,
pp. 409 sq. Il faut ajouter que la parole kantienne « Ne devenez point esclaves
des hommes. Ne souffrez pas que votre droit soit impunément foulé aux pieds
par les autres » a dans le texte de Kant une portée limitée. Elle avertit contre la
perte de l'indépendance économique de l'individu (car les dettes peuvent
mener à ce qu'on devienne mendiant), contre la génuflexion devant les images
et contre un comportement trop révérencieux par rapport aux hommes
(lorsqu'il exprime par exemple la différence des états, la courtoisie mutuelle
entre égaux étant en revanche compatible avec l'estime de soi-même). Ces
formes d'estime n'ont aucune dimension politique et Kant ne provoque pas à
une résistance dans le cadre de la défense contre l'injustice. Et pourtant, les
analyses de Patoika et Arntzen peuvent s'appuyer sur l'œuvre de Kant dans
son ensemble. Du point de vue d'ensemble, le droit à la résistance chez Kant
n'est pas seulement une question de légalité, mais de moralité.<br>

Article Title: GADAMER, AESTHETIC MODERNISM, AND THE REHABILITATION OF ALLEGORY: THE RELEVANCE OF PAUL KLEE<br>
Publisher: Brill Academic Publishers, Inc.<br>
Issue: i24649492<br>
Date: 1 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): WATSON STEPHEN H.<br>
Abstract: Paul Klee's art found broad impact upon philosophers of varying commitments, including Hans-Georg Gadamer. Moreover, Klee himself was not only one of the most important artists of aesthetic modernism but one of its leading theoreticians, and much in his work, as in Gadamer's, originated in post-Kantian literary theory's explications of symbol and allegory. Indeed at one point in Truth and Method, Gadamer associates his project for a general "theory of hermeneutic experience" not only with Goethe's metaphysical account of the symbolic but equally with a "rehabilitation" of allegory. In this paper, I examine this position and Gadamer's own use of it in his analysis of Klee's work, contrasting it with that of Walter Benjamin's account of allegory, equally indebted to Goethe and this archive. Finally, I contrast the resulting interpretations of Klee, discussing the implications that evolve for understanding both Gadamer and Benjamin—but equally for understanding Klee's work and, provisionally, the work of art, thus construed, for philosophy.<br>

Publisher: Brill Academic Publishers, Inc.<br>
Issue: i24657854<br>

Author(s): FRODEMAN ROBERT<br>
Abstract: Environmentally we seem to be both the victims and the perpetrators of a type of bait and switch: lured into the discussion by one set of intuitions, our interests become redescribed in terms that are intellectually more respectable. Our deepest concerns with the environment are converted into foreign discourses, as we strain to make the languages of science, economics, and interest group politics express our intuitions. The circumscription of environmental philosophy within environmental ethics is one manifestation of this process of bait and switch. 'Corrosive Effects' critiques this process through a case study of acid mine drainage-water pollution resulting from mining activities. An analysis of acid mine drainage reveals the metaphysical and theological roots of many of our environmental problems.<br>

Abstract: The article comprises three parts. Part I contains an overview of the areas in the analysis of modern French philosophy that have been of the greatest relevance to Russian researchers over the last years. We conclude that numerous aspects of the French philosophical thought of the twentieth century are well represented in the research of Russian authors, who also point out the emerging trends in its development. Part II deals with the development of analytic philosophy in Russia within the framework of such areas as "critique of bourgeois philosophy", a purely ideological stand only nominally related to philosophy, logic, and the history of philosophy and theoretical research. Part III contains a periodization of the history of phenomenology in Russia, pointing out the most important achievements of the contemporary Russian scholars of phenomenology as well as their understanding of the essence, the problems, and the aims of phenomenological philosophy. We also indicate the tendencies within the development of the discipline in the Russian Federation.<br>

still evaluate Gadamer's solution as 'mainly positive' escapes me (unless one has a dialectical

Abstract: For Dooyeweerd's Western oriented, sometimes even nationalistically tinted and yet, in
its intention, normative view of culture, see A New Critique, vol. 2, pp. 266-68, etc. In his
Roots in particular, the Occident' is very central (ch. 1, §§ 3,17-25), as the following passage
illustrates: Ά truly scriptural view of history... knows that the great antithesis between the
ground motive of the divine revelation of the Word and the ground motive of the apostate
spirit operates [in history] in the power struggle for the future of western civilization' (p.
108). Yes, Dooyeweerd at one point even calls the Dutch national character, in view of its
calvinistic bent, its humaneness, its sober life-style, and the like, a 'normative type' of histor-
ical disclosure and differentiation (p. 82). See also the striking analysis by C. T. Mclntire in
'Dooyeweerd's Philosophy of History', especially pp. 104-5, together with the nuanced criti-
cism of S. Griffioen in 'De betekenis van Dooyeweerd's ontwikkelingsidee', pp. 105-7.<br>

Mcleary [Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1964], p. 64). Karl Jaspers gives voice to
the same paradox: "He comes to himself like a gift... I am responsible for myself because I will
myself in the certainty of this original self-being - and yet I am only given to myself because
this self-willing needs something more" (Philosophy Vol VII, trans. E.B. Ashton [Chicago: The

Abstract: Steen, despite noting Dooyeweerd's development of "a unique aversion towards citing

and despite noting Dooyeweerd's consequent failure to appreciate the rich discovery of
Scripture in recent developments within the exegetical branches of theology, and despite
noting that this may be (ironically) part of the reason for a residuum of nature-grace
influence in his philosophy, nevertheless speaks of "the rich biblical emphasis... always
present in Dooyeweerd." (Structure, pp. 20, 272; cf. p. 127, n. 2)<br>

activity related to the practice of Connecting? (b) is ethics about what is good or about what is
right (cf. the contribution of John Hare in this volume)? and (c) is ethics concerned with all
sorts of normativity, or only with a particular 'ethical' kind of normativity? and if so, (d) how to
define this ethical normativity? I realize that in a full account of the position I defend, these
questions have to be addressed. For now, I don't want to bother too much about these more or
less technical preliminary issues, because it would distract too much from the main thesis of
this article.<br>

Abstract: Because they escape precise modal qualification, Troost suggests that insight into disposi-
tions can only be gained in an idea-ruled (idee-matig) understanding, in an idea-regulated 'on
the way' in the transcendental direction of time. For reformational philosophy this raises an
old and prima facie purely theoretical problem: Do the modalities 'continue' right into the
heart? One could paraphrase Troost's view for example such that for him the heart should
primarily be sought 'below' or 'behind' the act structure, and that the dispositions — relative
to this vertical axis — constitute a horizontal layer in which the lower substructures are
interwoven with the act structure. In that case the integration of the lower structures in the act
structure would take place via the dispositions rather than through a direct relationship with
the heart. This notion — for which hints can be found in Dooyeweerd — would in any case
lead to an appreciably more nuanced picture of the 'binding' and 'releasing' of substructures.
If I understand Troost correctly, he would allow this interpretation for the substructures,
though not for the modalities. His caution concerning the 'continuing' of the modalities 'into
the' heart is epistemological: the cosmological concentration of the modal functions in the
heart is a transcendental idea; at best we see dots (the idea-regulated 'on the way' in the
transcendental direction of time), but we should not turn them into lines.<br>

Abstract: See the Diltheyan vein in which Peter Winch (1977, 103) states the purpose of a philoso-
phy of the social sciences:...the investigation of a human society, whose very nature is to
consist in different and competing ways of life, each offering a different account of the
intelligibility of things. To take an uncommitted view of such competing conceptions is
peculiarly the task of philosophy; it is not its business to award prizes to science, religion, or
anything else. It is not its business to advocate any Weltanschauung.'<br>

Abstract: Auch wenn vielerorts von der Vernachlässigung der Kirchengeschichte im Religionsunterricht gesprochen und ein mangelndes Geschichtsbewusstsein beklagt wird, sind Schülerinnen und Schüler durchaus für Geschichte und auch Kirchengeschichte ansprechbar. Die Herausforderung besteht heute jedoch darin, sie dazu zu befähigen, mit dem Wissen über Geschichte umzugehen, ihr Leben mit Geschichte sinnbringend und verantwortungsvoll zu gestalten. Gerade hierfür stellt die jüdisch-christliche Tradition wertvolle Ressourcen bereit. Ausgehend von der jüdisch-christlichen Tradition und im Diskurs mit der Geschichtsphilosophie möchte ich dazu anregen, mit Schülerinnen und Schülern im Religionsunterricht eine Form des Eingedenkens in der Perspektive der Hoffung zu entwickeln. Hierbei wird eine Gedächtnishaltung intendiert, die nicht in der Idee einer reinen Fortschrittsgeschichte aufgeht, sondern zurückblickt, sich den Tiefen und Ambivalenzen vergangenen Leids stellt und die Toten in die Vision einer besseren Gesellschaft einbezieht. Dabei bleibt das Gedächtnis stets dem Leben und der Zukunft zugewandt und gibt ethische Impulse für die Gegenwart. Gerade im Religionsunterricht können Schülerinnen und Schüler befähigt werden, zu „Redenden und Handelnden“ der Geschichte zu werden, auch indem der Frage Raum gegeben wird, woraus Kraft für Erinnerungsarbeit geschöpft werden kann und welche Hoffnungsperspektiven bestehen. Even if neglect of Church History in Religious Education is widely criticised and complaints are heard about a lack of historical consciousness, pupils -female and male – are often found to be quite open to history and church history. The challenge today consists in helping them to deal with their knowledge of history, to create a relationship, or life, with history in a way that makes sense and is actually responsible. For this purpose the Jewish-Christian tradition offers valuable resources. Based on the Jewish-Christian tradition, and in discourse with the philosophy of~<br>

Abstract: La métaphore kantienne du « grand jeu de la vie », dont nous sommes tous partie prenante en tant que nous sommes citoyens du monde, obligés d'affronter les quatre questions fondamentales : « Que puis-je savoir? Que dois-je faire? Que m'est-il permis d'espérer? » et : « Qu'est-ce que l'homme? » qui, d'après Kant, récapitulent les grands intérêts de la raison humaine dans une optique cosmopolitique, cette métaphore nous offre un excellent fil conducteur pour analyser les rapports complexes entre religion et raison philosophique. Contrairement à ce que prétend la vulgate contemporaine, nous n'avons pas encore fini d'explorer la « fonction méta » en ses quatre dimensions essentielles de la « trans-ascendance », de la « trans-descendance », de la « trans-passibilité » et de la « trans-possibilité » qui, même si elles trouvent une expression différente dans le champ religieux et dans le champ de la réflexion philosophique, donnent infiniment à penser à la religion comme à la philosophie. Kant's metaphor of the "big game of life", to which all humans partake insofar as they are citizens of the world confronted with the four fundamental questions: "What can I know?, What ought I do?, What may I hope for?" and, last but not least: "What is man?", which according to Kant summarize the major interests of Human reason in a cosmo-political perspective, offers an excellent thread for analyzing the complex relationships between Religion and Philosophy. As opposed to what many contemporary thinkers pretend, we have not yet finished pondering the "metafunction" in its fourfold dimensions: "trans-ascendance", "transdescendance", "trans-passibility" and "trans-possibility" which, although they find a different expressions in the religious field and in the field of philosophical thought, invites to rethink both religion and philosophy.

Abstract: On a souvent décrit la modernité en la rapportant à l'idée de sécularisation du politique : à la faveur de la « grande séparation » hobbesienne, le pouvoir serait devenu un lieu vide, dissocié de toute attache à la transcendance, privé même de tout contenu substantiel. Cette étude entend rappeler que la philosophie politique contemporaine ne s'est nullement accommodée de ce processus de déthéologisation : au cours des dernières décennies, son propre a bien été, en s'appuyant sur le constat des « déraillements » de la modernité, de vouloir reconstituer une forme de lien entre le politique et le religieux. Cette intention partagée s'est incarnée dans trois grandes architectures de sens. La première tient dans le paradigme du recouvrement : il s'agit ici, tout en adhérant le plus souvent aux institutions démo-libérales, de replacer le droit politique sous dépendance de la norme religieuse. La deuxième position s'agence, quant à elle, autour du paradigme de la substitution : on saisit le politique alors comme un objet d'investissement religieux. La troisième figure relève du paradigme de la délibération : attachée au principe d'indétermination démocratique, à distance donc de toute primauté du spirituel comme de toute religion du politique, elle se construit, quant à elle, autour du dessein d'articuler, dans l'espace de la discussion civique, les convictions séculières et les croyances religieuses. Dans son ordre propre, la philosophie politique confirme l'hypothèse de l'inscription de nos sociétés dans une forme de post-sécularité. Modernity has been often described via the idea of a secularization of the Political: by way of the hobsian "great separation", power would have become an empty space, dissociated from all attachment to transcendence, deprived even of all substantial content. This study whishes to remind that contemporary Political Philosophy hasn't accommodated with this process of de-theologization: along the last decades, what characterized it has been, f~<br>

Publisher: Franz Steiner Verlag<br>
Issue: i24768971<br>

Author(s): Sala Jorge Francisco Aguirre<br>
Abstract: The citizenship of the Hermeneutic Philosophy surpasses multicultural proposals. It detects the lack of pre-philosophic solutions: cosmopolitan, republican citizenship, communitarian and liberal. As a consequence, it assumes and fuses equalities and differences in a project. It establishes the merging of four key horizons: the sense of belonging to a community; an agreement in rights and obligations of an identifier project; the right to take part in politics (to be co-legislators), and the validation of a right according to interests. In consequence, it gives the right of opportunity over the right of possession; making the strange our own. This citizenship reaches, by hermeneutic empathy, each one to grant him the subsidiary of a categorical right. It is an invitation to treat others as you would yourself.<br>

Abstract: By inquiring into the translatability of Judaism and philosophy, we reawaken an ancient problem that asks after philosophy’s relation with religion:
         What has Athens to do with Jerusalem?Translation is a rejuvenated means of wrestling with this irksome question, which seeks to understand how multiple approaches to meaning and being can exist concurrently or whether any interaction forfeits multiplicity for the primacy of one form over all others. The specific issue that linguistic versions of the problem address is whether or not the languages that Judaism and philosophy speak are separate and distinct and if those distinctions are established on deeper, non-linguistic ground. For this reason, translation not only raises the problem of articulacy and context in interlingual translations, it also alludes to an ontological or metaphysical separation that speaks of different, non-shared worlds. Whether or not a translation theory addresses, repairs or upholds the opposition between religion and philosophy is in question, and translation becomes a vehicle for discussing what Jerusalem has to offer Athens and what Athens has for Jerusalem. In this essay, I examine the translation problem as an attempt to repair or re-gloss the relation between Judaism and philosophy by way of Michael Fagenblat’s recovery of Emmanuel Levinas’ thought in his work,A Covenant of Creatures: Levinas’s Philosophy of Judaism(2010).<br>

Issue: i25611611<br>

Author(s): Abascàl-Hildebrand Mary<br>
Abstract: The philosophy of Paul Ricoeur is offered as an argument for civic education to overcome intense preoccupation with economic activity, because of the need to properly relate politics to economics via ethics. Persons too concerned with economics will ignore their obligations to engage with one another politically. They become disabled from viewing one another as resources for both political and even for economic activity. Furthermore, they tend to regard one another's varying viewpoints as challenges to vibrant economic activity, so that diversity of viewpoints or diversity of experience is regarded as divisive, not as rich variations that come from commonalties and can contribute to a cohesive community. The problem is morphological: suspicions about diversity make conflict resolution difficult and they also make civic education difficult because suspicions about diversities endanger the equitable allocation of resources needed for widespread civic engagement.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i25652834<br>
Date: 12 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Bird Gregory<br>
Abstract: In this paper, I seek to caution the increasing number of contemporary sociologists who are engaging with continental phenomenological sociology without looking at the Anglo-American tradition. I look at a particular debate that took place during the formative period in the Anglo-American tradition. My focus is on the way participants sought to negotiate the disciplinary division between philosophy and sociology. I outline various ways that these disciplinary exigencies, especially the institutional struggles with the sociological establishment, shaped how participants defined phenomenological sociology. I argue that despite the supposed theoretical, methodological, and substantial differences between these waves of phenomenological sociology, the contemporary wave could benefit from some of the lessons that were learned by their predecessors.<br>

Publisher: International Research Center for Japanese Studies<br>
Issue: i25791338<br>
Date: 1 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Dalissier Michel<br>
Abstract: This paper is the second part of a general study on the relationship between Nishida and Chinese philosophy. In the first, I explored the extent to which Nishida's philosophy was influenced, directly and indirectly, explicitly and implicitly, historically and conceptually, by materials coming from the intellectual horizon of Chinese thought. I concentrate here on Nishida's own position toward what he understood by "Chinese philosophy." Is this philosophy, so suggestive for Nishida, promoted to a central place in his work or not, and if so, in what sense might we take this idea of "centrality" as specifically Chinese? In setting forth several archetypes of Chinese thought present in Nishida's philosophy, the focus of this article falls on the methodological, logical and metaphysical contrasts we can identify between the Japanese philosopher and Chinese philosophy as his underground intellectual sources. 本稿は、筆者による西田幾多郎と中国哲学との関係を考察した研究論文の続編にあたる。前編の “Nishida Kitarō and Chinese Philosophy”は、西田哲学がどれだけの直接的もしくは間接的、明示的もしくは暗示的、歴史的もしくは概念的な影響を中国思想の知的土壊を基盤とする史料や人物から受けたかを考究したものである。続編である本稿では、西田が理解するところの中国哲学に対する西田自身の姿勢に焦点を絞る。この中国哲学なるものが西田の著作のなかで中心的な位置を占めているのかどうか、そうであるとするならば、この「中心」なる慨念を我々はどう理解すれば良いのか。本稿では、西田哲学に現れる中国思想の複数の原型を提示するとともに、西田という日本の哲学者と彼の知的背景としての中国哲学との間に認識できる、方法論的、論理的、形而上学的な対照に光を当てるものである。<br>

Abstract: The issue of contingency in narratives has long been of interest to the disciplines of philosophy, theoretical history and literary sciences. More recently, the question of how societies conceptualize and try to come to grips with the occurrence of the "expected unexpected" has gained an increasing importance both in anthropology and cultural studies generally. Built around a narrative—a more or less "classic" example of a "fighting story", well known in Northern Aboriginal Australia—the article demonstrates how the oft-repeated tale reflects not only an experience of the social but also a (desired) potential for transformation. Using insights drawn from theories that emphasize the presentational (as opposed to the representational) qualities of the symbolic, the paper shows how the immanent capacity for conflict is thematized in an "olden time story". The narrative may not resolve the problems it addresses; however, through its symbolic presentations it nevertheless serves as a multi-faceted means to confront and even to make sense—if only temporarily—of the incongruities and the paradoxes of daily life.<br>

Article Title: International Relations and the Search for Thinking Space: Another View of the Third Debate<br>
Publisher: Butterworth Publishers<br>
Issue: i324420<br>
Date: 9 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): George Jim<br>
Abstract: Recent debates in International Relations have seen some of the characteristic dichotomies of the discipline under severe and sophisticated challenge. The proposition, for example, that the study of International Relations, is somehow "independent" of mainstream debates on theory and practice in the social sciences is now widely rejected. The disciplines change in attitude on this issue owes much, in the 1980s, to the influences of an as yet small group of scholars who have infused the "third debate" in International Relations with an appreciation for previously "alien" approaches to knowledge and society, drawn from interdisciplinary sources, which repudiate (meta) theoretical dualism in all its forms. Utilizing the sponge term "postpositivism" Yosef Lapid has concentrated on an important aspect of the "third debate," one which has seen positivist based perspectives repudiated in favor of critical perspectives derived, primarily, from debates on the philosophy of science. This paper takes a broader view of the "third debate" in focusing on some of the broader patterns of dissent in social theory that are now evident in its literature. It argues that for all the differences associated with the new critical social theory approaches, theirs is critique with common purpose. Its purpose: to help us understand more about contemporary global life by opening up for questioning dimensions of inquiry which have been previously closed off and supressed; by listening closely to voices previously unheard; by examining "realities" excluded from consideration under a traditional (realist) regime of unity and singularity. Its purpose, reiterated: the search for "thinking space" within an International Relations discipline produced by and articulated through Western modernist discourse.<br>

Abstract: Heidegger's characterization of Dasein as Being-in-the-world suggests a natural relation to environmental philosophy. Among environmentalists, however, closer inspection must raise alarm, both since Heidegger's approach is in some senses inescapably anthropocentric and since Dasein discovers its environment through its usability, serviceability, and accessibility. Yet Heidegger does not simply adopt a traditionally modern, instrumental view. The conditions under which the environment appears imply neither that the environment consists only of tools, nor that what is true of the parts is also true of the whole, nor that an orientation to use—where appropriate—precludes any other orientation. Heidegger's anthropocentric commitments thus do not rule out the possibility of a non-instrumental perspective on the natural world.<br>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to analyse some questions proposed by the debate on the issue of modernity and post-modernity in the context of the philosophy of Leonardo Coimbra, from the reflection on these issues made by Jürgen Habermas in the work
         The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity. Thus, the critique to modern reason, the reflection on the metaphysics, the issues about the relationship between reason and faith, the religious phenomenon, the process of secularization, are our starting point for the questioning and the philosophical understanding that postmodernity makes of these problems The inauguration of this new rationality allows a new questioning about the reason and the world, manifesting the sublime character of its nature, allowing a new reflection, a critique of self-sufficient and self-reflexive reason and recovering another discursive and cooperative form of reason.<br>

Abstract: L'œuvre de Max Weber commence à être mieux connue du public français grâce à la traduction d'un nombre croissant de ses écrits et à la parution d'un grand nombre d'ouvrages le concernant. L'examen de ces publications récentes montre que les polémiques opposant sociologues et philosophes à propos du «vrai» Weber, polémiques qui se sont intensifiées au cours des années 1960, polarisent aujourd'hui encore le débat sur cet auteur. Néanmoins, les nouveaux éclairages concernant «l'épistémologie» wébérienne permettent de mieux cerner le dilemme auquel Weber a été confronté, dilemme qui reste le nôtre: comment un chercheur en sciences sociales peut-il justifier et défendre sa pratique empirique, sans abandonner le terrain des sciences sociales au profit d'une argumentation sur les fondements de la connaissance empruntée aux philosophes néokantiens? Max Weber's work is beginning to enjoy a wider audience in France due to the translation of a growing number of his writings and the publication of many works devoted to him. An examination of these recent publications shows that the polemics opposing sociologists and philosophers with regard to the "real" Weber – arguments that intensified during the 1960s – are still alive today. Nevertheless, the new perspectives on Weberian "epistemology" allow us gain a sharper view of the dilemma that once confronted Weber and continues to confront us: how can a researcher in the social sciences justify and defend his or her empirical practice without abandoning the terrain of the social sciences and shifting to an argument on the foundations of knowledge borrowed from neo-Kantian philosophy?<br>

Abstract: The search for better, not wholly instrumental, readings of reason has recently become
more popular, even among analytical theorists, for example Jon Elster. See, amongst many
other works, Jon Elster, The Cement of Society (Cambridge, 1984). Onora O'Neill is
perhaps the philosopher who has done most to explore these issues. See O. O'Neill,
Constructions of Reason: Explorations in Kantian Practical Philosophy (Cambridge,
1989).<br>

Abstract: David Carrithers argues that crimes are 'matters of conscious choice' for
Montesquieu, and adduces passages from Letter 83 as evidence. See David W.
Carrithers, 'Montesquieu's Philosophy of Punishment', History of Political Thought,
XIX ( 1998), pp. 213^10, p. 219. Carrithers acknowledges Montesquieu' s statement that
self-interest is always a 'determining cause' of unjust actions; but Montesquieu's
position in the Persian Letters seems to be that self-interested actions are not always
chosen with a range of options clearly in view. See also Mason, Montesquieu's Idea of
Justice, p. 150; Montesquieu, The Spirit of the Laws, Part 1, Bk. 1.<br>

Publisher: Leo S. Olschki<br>
Issue: e26230922<br>
Date: 8 1, 2008<br>
Abstract: In 2008, as a follow-up to the initiative taken the previous year, ISRE – Istituto Superiore Regionale Etnografico
         [Superior Regional Ethnographic Institute]organized the seminarGramsci ritrovato, tra Cirese e i Cultural Studies(Nuoro, October 24th- 25th, 2008)[Gramsci rediscovered: between Cirese and the Cultural Studies]. The seminar focused on another ‘find’: the readings of Gramsci’s works on folklore that Cirese had elaborated thirty-eight years before. The idea came from Giorgio Baratta, who – in hisGramsci in contrappunto [Gramsci in counterpoint](Carocci 2008) – has given special attention to an analysis of Cirese’s essayConcezioni del mondo, filosofia spontanea e istinto di classe nelle “Osservazioni sul folklore” di Antonio Gramsci [World Views, Spontaneous Philosophy and Class Instinct in the “Observations On Folklore” by Antonio Gramsci](1970). Giulio Angioni’s and Pietro Clemente’s contributions – coming, in part, from an intellectual autobiography standpoint (they both have been Cirese’s students at first, and his colleagues later) – helped elucidate the method and the contents of Cirese’s work. They also dealt with Gramsci, in order to theoretically reconstruct the foundations of Italian folklore studies between the Sixties and the Seventies of XX Century. Baratta’s renewed reading, a part of which we here republish, together with Brigitte Wagner’s contribution (dedicated to the issue of the feasibility of translations of languages and cultures), give evidence to the prospect of a vitality of Cirese’s critical work outside the usual context of Italian folklore studies. Prospect and vitality that have been demonstrated by Cirese himself, who, during the 2008 seminar in Nuoro, was a protagonist of the dialogue with other scholars as well as with the public that intervened in the debate. He was a generous testimony of the large spectrum of his interests, mostly methodological, and he very carefully underlined, with respect to Gramsci, two aspect~<br>

Author(s): Vidler Ken<br>
Abstract: I focus on Nietzsche's architectural metaphor of self-construction in arguing for the claim that postmodern readings of Nietzsche misunderstand his various attacks on dogmatic philosophy as paving the way for acceptance of a self characterized by fundamental disunity. Nietzsche's attack on essentialist dogmatic metaphysics is a call to engage in a purposive self-creation under a unifying will, a will that possesses the strength to reinterpret history as a pathway to "the problem that we are". Nietzsche agrees with the postmodernists that unity is not a pre-given, however he would disavow their rejection of unity as a goal. Where the postmodernists celebrate "the death of the subject" Nietzsche rejects this valorization of disunity as a form of Nihilism and prescribes the creation of a genuine unified subjectivity to those few capable of such a goal. Postmodernists are nearer Nietzsche's idea of the Last Man than his idea of the Overman.<br>

Article Title: David Carr on History, Time, and Place<br>
Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i27642764<br>
Date: 12 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Casey Edward<br>
Abstract: This essay begins by situating the work of David Carr in relation to the reception of phenomenology in the United States. It addresses Carr's early (and continuing) contributions to the philosophy of history, especially as this topic emerges in Husserl's middle and later writings. The idea of point of view as this emerges in Carr's own writings on history is examined, with special attention to differences between its spatial and temporal instantiations. Carr's emphasis on the primacy of temporality in human experience is contrasted with an approach that is more appreciative of the role of place in this experience. It is suggested that place offers an important alternative to time as a basis for the understanding of history and narrative.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i27642781<br>
Date: 1 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Vasterling Veronica<br>
Abstract: In this essay I compare Nussbaum's and Arendt's approach to narrativity. The point of the comparison is to find out which approach is more adequate for practical philosophy: the approach influenced by cognitive theory (Nussbaum) or the one influenced by hermeneutic phenomenology (Arendt). I conclude that Nussbaum's approach is flawed by methodological solipsism, which is due to her application of cognitive theory.<br>

Author(s): Lopes Helena<br>
Abstract: This article begins by presenting experimental evidence that remains unexplained by standard and utility-extended economic models: experimental subjects tend to honor their promises even on occasions when an assessment of consequences asks them to defect; subjects voluntarily contribute to collective goods, and this contribution is highly conditional on others contributing as well; subjects evaluate and value the intentions behind actions as well as the consequences of actions. Arguments are sought for in moral philosophy that would more plainly explain the collected experimental evidence and that would help economists revise their explanatory frames. The hypothesis advanced is that the observed behavior may be interpreted as resulting from the moral strength of indignation and justice norms.<br>

Author(s): Wei Wang<br>
Abstract: Cogito, as the first principle of Descartes' metaphysical system, initiated the modern philosophy of consciousness, becoming both the source and subject of modern Western philosophical discourse. The philosophies of Maine de Biran, Kant, Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, and others developed by answering the following questions? Is consciousness substantial or not? Does consciousness require the guarantee of a transcendental subject? Is Cogito epistemological or ontological? Am I a being-for-myself or a being-for-others? Outlining the developmental history of the idea of Cogito from Descartes to Sartre is important for totally comprehending the evolution and development of Western philosophy.<br>

Abstract: « The future is virtually absent because events which lie in it have not
taken place, they have not been realised and cannot therefore constitute
time. If, however, future events are certain to occur, or if they fall within
the inevitable rythm of nature, they at best constitute only potential time,
not actual time » (117), John S. Mbiti, African religions and philosophy,

Author(s): Sobel Richard<br>
Abstract: Quels rapports peuvent se nouer entre travail et liberté, dès lors que le travail n'est plus essentiellement vécu comme la marque sociale de l'aliénation de la liberté dans l'économie? C'est Marx qui élabore pour la première fois et avec beaucoup de rigueur cette question, en formulant la théorie des deux règnes, celui de la nécessité et celui de la liberté dans le cadre de l'utopie communiste. Pour autant, sa position du problème n'est pas sans maintenir toute une série d'ambiguïtés. En nous appuyant sur les analyses contrastées de Simone Weil et d'André Gorz, nous montrons la dépendance de toute pensée de l'émancipation vis-à-vis d'une philosophie de la liberté qui assume (Gorz) ou qui n'assume pas (Weil) une certaine épaisseur irréductible de tout collectif humain, c'est-à-dire une indépassable hétéronomie de la condition humaine. What sort of connections can be formed between work and freedom, since the work is not essentially lived any more as the social mark of the alienation of the freedom in the economy? It is Marx who elaborates for the first time this problem by formulating the theory of both reigns, the reign of the necessity and the reign of the freedom, within the framework of the communist utopia. For all that, his position of the problem is not without maintaining a whole series of ambiguities. By pressing us on the analyses of Simone Weil and André Gorz, we show the dependence of any thought of emancipation towards a philosophy of the freedom which assumes (Gorz) or which does not assume (Weil) a certain inflexible thickness of any human collective.<br>

Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i212746<br>
Date: 7 1, 1996<br>
Author(s): Spitzer Lloyd<br>
Abstract: Gerard Noiriel's recent book, Sur la "crise" de l'histoire (Paris, 1996), describes a social and intellectual crisis of fragmentation among contemporary professional historians and then proposes to restore professional unities through a disciplinary commitment to pragmatic ideas and methods. According to Noiriel, social inequalities within the profession and a recent turn toward postmodern, philosophical skepticism have undermined professional unity and the traditional paradigm of historical knowledge. In response to these perceived threats, Noiriel advocates a pragmatic philosophy that will help historians recognize the practices and language they share. Yet Noiriel's pragmatic quest for a professional paradigm offers few solutions for the profession's social stratifications, and his pragmatism remains as dependent on philosophy as the historical theories he condemns. There are nevertheless intriguing ironies in Noiriel's use of an American philosophy to criticize recent American uses of French theories.<br>

Abstract: Before World War II the intellectual climate of American sociology was congenial to the growth of a sociology of knowledge akin to Mannheim's. Yet in the postwar period American sociologists committed themselves to ahistorical theory, positivist methodology, and team research; their "scientistic" sociology did not permit the historicism, relativism, and holism necessary to Mannheimian analysis. Currently, however, convergent trends in a number of disciplines--not only sociology but also philosophy, anthropology, literary criticism, and the histories of ideas, science, and art--favor a revival of the Mannheimian program. Analysts of culture now seek to integrate the sociological goals of "explanation" and "understanding"--the formulation of quasi-laws of behavior, based on identification of the social structural elements of culture production, and the interpretation of the subjective meaning of culture, based on recovery of actors' intentions. Their research program requires investigation of the peculiar sociohistorical circumstances that condition actors' perceptions, necessitating attention to the cognitive content of culture. This article surveys both the theoretical justifications for such a research program and recent exemplifications of it, focusing on anlyses of what Mannheim termed "objective culture"--such symbolic vehicles for conceptions as religion, the arts, science, and political thought that acquire independent existence, becoming subject to diverse interpretations.<br>

Abstract: The article explores somatic metaphors related to explosion, outburst and eruption in diverse media. This inquiry lies in the intersection among philosophy, literary criticism and history of art and its conclusions are relevant to musi-cology. It is argued that there are various basic orientations, persuasions and biases underlying specific uses of metaphors of somatic eruption. The article endeavours to propose an alternative reading of body fluids as metaphoric sites of festive critique in subversively humorous discourse and art, which differs from more prevalent psychoanalytic interpretations. A text by Hélène Cixous, as well as visual material by Jenny Saville, Cindy Sherman, Bruce Nauman and Pieter Brueghel the Elder is scrutinized. The most appropriate musical example in this context is probably (especially the introduction to) the Háry János Suite by Zoltán Kodály.* By grouping male and female artists together, an underlying picaresque or subversively humorous, non-binary and geneticist match is suggested in their work. Yet, at the same time it is argued that female body fluids present women with metaphoric vantage points that facilitate understandings beyond the borders of patriarchal culture. /// Članak se temelji na većem istraživačkom projektu koji pokušava sagledati griješnu i komičnu ili feminističku likovnu umjetnost unutar šire pikareskne tradicije vizualne kulture. Termin 'pikareskno' (koji se rabi u širem smislu nego što je to uobičajeno u literarnim krugovima) služi da bi se opisalo specifične ideološke iskaze. Povratne pikareskne metafore pomno se ispituju zbog njihova potencijala da priopće takve iskaze, i to ne samo u umjetničkim djelima muških i ženskih umjetnika i u predstavljanjima muških i ženskih tijela, nego i medu umjetnicima i teoretičarima. Analizira se tekst Helene Cixous, kao i vizualni materijal Jenny Saville, Cindy Sherman, Brucea Naumana i Pietera Brueghela st.

Author(s): Weidler Markus<br>
Abstract: While the Dialectic of Enlightenment (1944; 1947) is often judged to be too limited a cultural critique, it is still widely accepted as pioneering cultural criticism, a mix of critical discourse analysis, hermeneutics, and semiotics. This article contests this reputation by turning to a source that Horkheimer and Adorno are at pains to occlude: Ernst Cassirer's Philosophy of Symbolic Forms (1923-29). Drawing on the tradition of eighteenth-century German Christology revived by the Young Hegelians in general and F.W.J. Schelling in particular, Cassirer evolves a critical strategy broader than that in the Dialectic, yet clearly implied by it. Most particularly, Cassirer's Schelling analysis discriminates philosophy, art, and religion as forms of knowledge and forms of epistemological critique, where Horkheimer and Adorno recast the art of the Bildungsbürger to occlude Cassirer's innovation, a new materialist semiotics that offers cultural critique in the broader terms that the Dialectic's critics would favor.<br>

Publisher: Wilfrid Laurier University Press<br>
Issue: i362068<br>
Date: 6 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Lefort Dominique<br>
Abstract: Nous tentons de clarifier la place de la normativité dans une approche phénoménologique du politique en analysant l'opposition de la philosophie des droits de l'homme d'inspiration kantienne de Luc Ferry et Alain Renaut à la réflexion de type phénoménologique de Claude Lefort. Le projet de Lefort consiste d'abord en une tentative d'élucidation du réel et non de justification de principes. Mais la dimension normative n'en demeure pas absente puisque Lefort conçoit les droits de l'homme tant comme un phénomène du politique que comme signes de la liberté qu'il recherche dans la démocratie. Y a-t-il là nécessairement incohérence? /// Can a phenomenological analysis of political reality tackle the issue of norms? We try to answer this question through an analysis of the opposition between Luc Ferry and Alain Renaut's Kantian philosophy of human rights and the phenomenological approach of Claude Lefort. Lefort's project is an attempt to elucidate reality and not to justify principles. But the normative dimension is not entirely absent from his thought. Lefort conceives of human rights not only as a political phenomenon but also as a sign of liberty, which he supports. Is this inconsistent with the nature of his phenomenological project?<br>

Article Title: Varying the Self: Bacon's Versions of van Gogh<br>
Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i282749<br>
Date: 1 1, 1947<br>
Author(s): Sund Brendan<br>
Abstract: In 1957, Francis Bacon rapidly painted a series of five numbered paintings after van Gogh's "Self-Portrait on the Road to Tarason," to fill an exhibition. They are exceptional in his work, both as to subject and in the way they are painted. A painter who regularly took reproduced images as his sources, he chose in this unique case the self-portrait of another artist, and used -- also uniquely -- methods evidently akin to those of 'action painting'. So selfhood and the practice of painting come into unusual conjunction in these works. Paul Ricoeur's attempt, in "Oneself as Another," to overcome the perennial self--other opposition, and his account of a constitutionally unstable self, lacking a 'core', are suggestive for discussion of the relationship between viewer and painting, specifically with reference to portraiture. He presents an alternative to the antinomial theories of the self which have long dominated criticism of visual art, theories according to which visual images mirror, and so crucially help to construct, an ego enclosed against the other; such a model is presumed in Ernst van Alphen's "Francis Bacon and the Loss of Self." Admittedly, this series of paintings is itself bound to invoke what Ricoeur terms 'hyperbolic' concepts of selfhood: van, Gogh, through his biographers, became the type of artist-as-genius; Minelli's biopic "Lust for Life," which Bacon probably saw, came out in 1956, and in the same year Jackson Pollock, prototypical 'action painter' died in a way that contributed to a comparable mythology. Against that, it is important to consider what Bacon does, and to notice the kinds of action, or interaction, tended to us as viewers. In context, the link with cinema assumes a different importance. Also crucial is Bacon's process of variation. Unlike philosophy, as Ricoeur shows, art can engage in play, freely varying all terms without a view to conclusion -- art experiments with the self. Bacon takes selfhood apart, recombines its elements; he~<br>

Abstract: Las políticas a través de las cuales los gobiernos democráticos trataron de poner fin a los debates sobre la represión de las dictaduras, en el Cono Sur de América Latina y en Sudáfrica, han fracasado. Esos intentos, representados por el modelo de "la comisión de verdad y reconciliación" -hoy en día activamente promovido en el nivel internacional- no permitieron la reconciliación deseada. La retórica del perdón empleada por los gobiernos fue estéril, confirmando el veredicto de la filosofía moral: no es posible un "perdón político". Sin embargo, este artículo defiende la conveniencia de un análisis de esa retórica. En primer lugar, tomar en cuenta esa retórica ayuda a discutir las explicaciones propuestas por las ciencias sociales y por los juristas de los procesos de transición a la democracia. En segundo lugar, la retórica del perdón produjo efectos políticos en cierto modo contradictorios. Impulsada por los gobiernos para poner un "punto final" a los debates sobre la violación de los derechos humanos, en los hechos impidió su clausura. Pero, por otro lado, esa retórica condujo a la escritura de una historia pacificadora. /// The policies through which democratic governments in the Southern Cone of Latin America and South Africa tried to put an end to the debates on repression during previous dictatorships have failed. Those attempts, embodied in the "Commission for Truth and Reconciliation" model actively promoted today at the international level, did not enable the reconciliation sought after. The rhetoric of forgiveness used by governments was futile, confirming the verdict by moral philosophy: "political forgiveness" is not possible. However, this article contends there are benefits in analyzing that rhetoric. First, taking that rhetoric into account contributes to discussing the explanations of the processes of transition to democracy proposed by social sciences and jurists. Second, the rhetoric of forgiveness produced somewhat contradictory political effects~<br>

Author(s): Gauchet Eric<br>
Abstract: N'y aurait-il que les philosophes à s'interroger sur le temps? Les historiens resteraient-ils positivistes au point de bouder toute réflexion sur cette catégorie qui gît pourtant au cœur de leur discipline? "L'ordre du temps," de K. Pomian, qui vient de paraître chez Gallimard, montre combien le temps des historiens a varié et à quels dangers ils s'exposent en n'y prenant pas garde. /// Should time be a philosophical question? In general, French historians seem to have neglected this essential problem concerning reflection on time. Both because of a positivist tradition which seeks the linearity of the event and of a mistrust of the philosophy of history, they have not wanted to come to grips with the question of temporality. And yet the very nature of history comes from this question. K. Pomian's recent book, "L'ordre du temps" (Gallimard) illustrates the richness of the philosophic thinking on the variation of the notion of time and its importance in understanding the various historical schools.<br>

Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
Issue: i290911<br>
Date: 4 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Young Camilla R.<br>
Abstract: One of the most fundamental premises of feminist philosophy is the assumption of an invidious asymmetry between the genders that has to be overcome. Parallel to this negative account of asymmetry we also find a positive account, developed in particular within the context of so-called feminist philosophies of difference. I explore both notions of gender asymmetry. The goal is a clarification of the notion of asymmetry as it can presently be found in feminist philosophy. Drawing upon phenomenology (Merleau-Ponty, Levinas) as well as feminist difference theory (Irigaray), I argue that a gender asymmetry does exist that cannot-as in the first assumption-be transformed into symmetry.<br>

Publisher: University of Notre Dame Press<br>

Author(s): Jung Patricia B.<br>
Abstract: An account of character is developed on the basis of Ricoeur's philosophy of the will. Particular attention is paid to the role of the bodily involuntary in the process of character-formation. This augments the interpretation of the moral meaning of sanctification developed by Hauerwas. When interpreted in light of corporeality, sanctification entails not only a perceptual transformation but also an affective change in the agent's value orientation, the competent retraining of the agent's emotions, and the gracious triggering of an adoptive disposition toward the agent's incarnate situation. Finally, the rootedness of character in embodiment, with the attendant problem of automatism, indicates the limits of the usefulness of an "ethics of character" for moral theology.<br>

Abstract: The field or object of study in religious ethics is presented as the moral elements of a religious ethos. Its methodology or discipline is interpreted as a combination of moral philosophy and religious thought- supplemented by socio-scientific and historical studies-which takes the form of three interrelated endeavors: descriptive ethics, meta-ethics, and normative ethics.<br>

Author(s): Benoît Gerald<br>
Abstract: The field of library and information science (LIS) has built its practice and research perspective on a logico-analytic philosophy, which has generated useful, tangible technologies. Lately there is interest in nonempirical philosophies, such as hermeneutics and critical theory, to fulfill better LIS' service-oriented mission of providing "information" to user populations. One dimension of critical theory, Jürgen Habermas' theory of communicative action, can expand LIS' conception of information and supplement logico-empirical research methods and research practices. This article examines how LIS, particularly research into librarian-patron interaction and information system design, favors an empiricist view of language and, as a consequence, may be limiting its effectiveness. It proposes how the field might expand to include communicative action in fulfilling its mission and research agenda.<br>

Abstract: El artículo trata de resaltar tanto la especificidad como las dificultades en la comprensión de la comunicación política. Concebida ésta, desde Aristóteles, como singular combinación de racionalidad y emotividad, ha sido blanco de variados ataques. Estos abarcan desde la habitual desconfianza, intelectual y popular, hacia las prácticas políticas hasta la búsqueda, en filosofía y lógica, de un lenguaje puramente referencial o denotativo. Sin embargo, se argumenta aquí, entender el lenguaje político requiere conjugar otros enfoques sobre significado (antropología del lenguaje, pragmática de Austin y continuadores, teoría habermasiana de la acción comunicativa), diferentes entre sí, pero coincidentes en recuperar aspectos clave de la retórica clásica. También se apunta a algunas inevitables carencias de esos enfoques en materias tan complejas como las que tienen que ver con el lenguaje. /// This paper sets out to highlight both the specifíc nature and the difficulties of understanding political communication. Conceived since Aristotle's day as a singular combination of rationality and emotion, it has been the target of varied attacks. These range from the habitual distrust, intellectual and popular, of politics, to the quest, in philosophy and logic, of a purely referential or denotative language. However, the author contends that in order to understand political language, other approaches to its meaning must be taken into account (linguistic anthropology, the pragmatics of Austin and those who followed him, Habermas' theory of commuhicative action), which, while different in themselves, retrieve key aspects of classical rhetoric. The author also singles out certain inevitable shortfalls vis-à-vis these approaches in such complex fíelds as those related to language.<br>

Publisher: Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia<br>
Issue: i40012947<br>
Date: 6 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Caffarena José Gómez<br>
Abstract: A filosofia prática de Kant, ou seja, o nuclear da sua ética, juntamente com o "primado da razão prática sobre a especulativa" e a "religião nos limites da simples razão", com seu acento no "mal radical", têm inegáveis afinidades com a - e em certos casos influxo da - tradição cristã. O próprio Kant terá em alguns momentos reconhecido isso mesmo. Segundo o autor do presente texto, subsistem, contudo, inegáveis divergências. O artigo, escrito a partir de uma declarada 'simpatia metódica, pretende precisar no possível o alcance de umas e de outras, fazendo sobre o tema um balanço positivo. O autor propõe ainda uma hipótese de leitura do Opus Postumum, reconhecendo aqui uma tentativa por parte de Kant no sentido de purificar o seu "teísmo moral" numa direcção que tão pouco é alheia a importantes intuições cristãs. /// Aim of the article is to show that the practical philosophy of Kant, or, in other terms, the core of his ethics, as is the case with the "primacy of the practical reason over the speculative one" and the "religion within the limits of pure reason", with its accent set upon the idea of "radical evil", have undeniable affinities with -and in certain cases influxes from - the Christian tradition. Kant himself seems to have recognized that much at certain moments. For the author of the article, however, there are a few divergences to be reckoned with. In fact, the article, which is clearly written from the standpoint of a declared methodic sympathy, does whatever is possible in order to determine the reach of the ones and of the others, but in the end concludes that the result is a positive one. The author also suggests a reading hypothesis for the Opus Postumum, acknowledging here an attempt on the part of Kant directed towards a purification of his "moral theism" in a direction that as such is no less close to some very important Christian intuitions.<br>

Author(s): Henriques Fernanda<br>
Abstract: O presente artigo pretende dar sentido à afirmação feita, mais do que uma vez, por Paul Ricoeur, de que a sua filosofia poderia ser vista como um kantismo pós-hege-liano. Nesse contexto, o artigo procura abordar o pensar ricoeuriano mostrando de que modo ele se instaura e se desenvolve no horizonte kantiano de uma filosofia dos limites do saber. Essa abordagem é desenvolvida em dois momentos. O primeiro dirige-se à leitura que Paul Ricoeur faz da Crítica da Razão Pura de Kant. O segundo centrar-se-à em três momentos fulcrais da Filosofia de Paul Ricoeur - a definição do seu projecto Filosofia da Vontade, a figura própria da sua Hermenêutica e o filosofema inovação semântica - evidenciando em cada um deles a ressonância da herança kantiana. /// Aim of this article is to to explore the meaning of Paul Ricoeur's persistent characterization of his own work as a post-Hegelian Kantism. In view of this end, the article demonstrates that Ricoeur's thinking is at once rooted and developed within the horizon of Kant's critical philosophy of limits in regard to knowledge. This can be shown by first considering Ricoeur's reading of the first Critique, and then centering on three decisive moments of Ricoeur's philosophy, to wit, the formulation of the project developed in the Philosophy of Will, the shape of his theory of hermeneutics, and his notion of semantic innovation that can be conceived as a philosophema. The Kantian influence can be seen to resonate in all three instances.<br>

Issue: i40013929<br>
Date: 4 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Fink-Jensen Kirsten<br>
Abstract: In this paper Kirsten Fink-Jensen suggests how a phenomenological-hermeneutic perspective can contribute to the knowledge of learning and teaching processes in music education in school The philosophical frame is Danish philosophy of life, represented by Knud Ejler Løgstrup, and Merleau-Ponty's philosophy of body, both pointing to the wholeness of mind and body in all kinds of actions. Within this framework interpretation is an epistemological, practical-hermeneutic activity based on different analytical methods. Phenomenologically, experiences of music are constituted in an intertwinement of personal, cultural, and local meaning. The challenge facing the teacher is then to understand what becomes meaningful to persons in a given situation. 'Bodily dialogue' is a metaphor of a hermeneutic process of understanding that highlights the importance of bodily aspects in the teacher's answer to a child's musical attuned articulations. This focus can facilitate children's learning processes and change and qualify the teacher's didactic reflections on the impact and progression of music lessons.<br>

Abstract: Este estudo dedica-se à teoria da verdade tal como se apresenta nas obras de Ricoeur entre 1947 e 1960. Procura-se sublinhar o vaivém entre uma compreensão ontológica da verdade, marcada antes de mais pelo pensamento de Karl Jaspers (1947), e uma compreensão fenomenológica da verdade centrada na teoria do juízo (1960). Contudo a análise da tensão entre a unidade do verdadeiro e a multiplicidade das filosofias permite elaborar o conceito de verdade como comunicação e de verdade como objecto de esperança. Procura-se então mostrar o fundamento desta esperança bem como a dimensão pela qual ela ultrapassa o universo da filsosofia. A conclusão sublinha que os desenvolvimentos ulteriores de Ricoeur (1960-1989) sobre a hermenêutica do símbolo, da metáfora e da narrativa ganham em serem relidos no horizonte das tensões do problema da verdade. /// Cette étude est consacrée à la théorie de la vérité telle qu'elle se présente dans l'oeuvre de Ricoeur entre 1947 et 1960. On cherche à souligner le va-et-vient entre une compréhension ontologique de la vérité initielement influencée par la pensée de Karl Jaspers 1947, et une compréhension phénoménologique de la vérité centrée sur la théorie du jugement (1960). L'analyse de la tension entre l'unité du vrai et la multiplicité des philosophies débouche cependant sur le concept de vérité comme communication et comme object d'espérence. On cherche alors à montrer le fondement de cette espérance ainsi que la dimension par laquelle elle dépasse l'univers de la philosophie. La conclusion souligne que les développements ultérieurs de Ricoeur (1960-1989) sur l'herméneutique du symbole, de la métaphore et du récit ont tout à gagner à être replacés et relus à l'horizon des tensions du problème de la vérité. /// This study pays special attention to the theory of truth elaborated in Ricoeur's work from 1947 to 1960.

Abstract: Partindo de alguns pressupostos que explicitam a questão nuclear da "instância do sujeito" na obra de Ricoeur (anteriores ou contemporâneos ao debate com o estruturalismo), e que tipificam a via filosófica ricoeuriana, e partindo também da articulação axial do pensamento de Lévi-Strauss (relacionada com esse debate), são depois propostos os tópicos dessa controvérsia. Tais tópicos, que se desenvolvem em torno dos elementos já considerados, gravitam à volta da inteligibilidade do sentido e do sentido da inteligibilidade, da complementaridade dos métodos, e dos níveis semiológico e semântico, este último estabelecido mediante a pregnância da frase na linguagem, e da palavra (mot) como operador entre a estrutura e o acontecimento. /// La présente analyse commence par mettre en relief quelques présupposés qui explicitent la question nucléaire de "l'instance du sajet" dans l'oeuvre de Ricoeur (présupposés antérieurs ou contemporains du débat avec le structuralisme) et qui caractérisent le chemin philosophique de celui-ci; on prend également pour point de départ l'articulation centrale de la pensée de Lévi-Strauss relative à ce débat, afin de proposer ensuite les lignes mai-tresses de cette controverse. Ces lignes maitresses, qui se développent autour des éléments déjà mentionnés, gravitent autour de l'intelligibilité du sens et du sens de l'intelligibilité, de la complémentarité des méthodes et des niveaux sémiologique et sémantique, en établissant ce dernier niveau par le biais de la prégnance de la phrase dans le langage, et du mot comme opérateur entre la structure et l'événement. /// After presenting the presuppositions which underlie a question which is central to Ricoeur's work, "the subject as act, as instance", and which exemplify Ricoeur's way of doing philosophy, as well as presenting Lévi-Strauss' thought concerning this question, the article proposes the fundamental topics which define the controversy.

Abstract: Este artigo apresenta o pensamento mais recente de P. Ricoeur sob a perspectiva de uma lógica da produção de sentido, discutindo criticamente as possibilidades e os limites do círculo hermenêutico. Tomando como ponto de partida os pressupostos fenomenológicos e ontológicos da sua filosofia, são sucessivamente abordadas as questões relativas à interpretação textual, imaginação e criatividade, acção, tempo e narrativa, ideologia e utopia. Reconhecido um certo logocentrismo - uma mistura de Logos e de suposto real - implicado na solução destas questões que nos é proposta pelo autor, procura-se repensar a ligação entre o sentido e o consensus, a coerência e a própria questão da violéncia. Estabelece-se para isso, na última secção, um confronto entre as posições defendidas por Ricoeur e a hipótese de R. Girard sobre o desejo mimético e a violência. /// Cet article présente la pensée la plus récente de P. Ricoeur sous la perspective d'une logique de la production du sens, en discutant de façon critique les possibilités et les limites du cercle herméneutique.

Abstract: Um filósofo com quem Paul Ricoeur manteve um interessante e fecundo relacionamento, durante mais de trinta anos, foi Gabriel Mareei, pensador de que se celebrou em 1989 o Centenário (7.121889 - 7.121989). Esta exposição procura evidenciar alguns aspectos filosóficos que Paul Ricoeur colhe na lição marceliana. Nesse sentido, a obra que serviu de fio condutor a esta reflexão foi publicada com o título "Entretiens Paul Ricoeur-Gabriel Marcel, que se constituiu como um diálogo discípulo-mestre, e isto a partir de algumas problemáticas que numa espécie de marceliano regard en arrière, surgem como correspondendo aos nós da filosofia de Gabriel Marcel. /// Un philosophe avec lequel Paul Ricoeur a maintenu durant plus de trente ans des rapports intéressants aussi bien que féconds est Gabriel Marcel, penseur dont on vient de célébrer en 1989 le Centenaire (7.121889–7.121989). Le présent exposé se fait dans le but de mettre en évidence certains aspects philosophiques que Paul Ricoeur emprunte de la leçon marcélienne. L'ouvrage servant de fil conducteur pour ces réflexions, qui a été publié sous le titre Entretiens Paul Ricoeur-Gabriel Marcel, assume la forme d'un dialogue disciple-maître, en partant de certaines problématiques qui, par une espèce de marcélien regard en arrière, correspondent à vrai dire aux noeuds de la philosophie de Gabriel Marcel. /// Gabriel Marcel is a philosopher with whom Paul Ricoeur and mantained one interesting relationship for more than thirty years. This article seeks to present those aspects of Ricoeur's philosophy which have Marcel as their source. The work that serves as a base for understanding this relationship is Entretiens Paul Rtcoeur-Gabriel Marcel in essence a dialogue between a disciple and his mentor. At the same time, this dialogue reveals the fundamental future of Gabriel Marcel's philosophy.<br>

Abstract: Vale a pena voltar a analisar a relação entre o mal e a religião em Kant. Mas este artigo aborda a problemática prévia a esta questão, isto é, a própria questão do mal tal como Kant a apresenta na primeira parte do livro de 1793, A religião nos limites da simples razão. Depois da introdução que elucida o espanto dos primeiros leitores deste livro, procura-se, na base da análise hermenêutica dos textos, verificar a articulação entre a disposição originária para o bem e a propensão para o mal. Encontra-se em seguida a aporia da relação entre o desejo e a realidade do mal: de onde provém o desejo do mal moral? Será preciso, no itinerário desta resposta, elucidar o conceito de natureza, bem como a relação com a interpretação kantiana do pecado original. A conclusão volta a introduzir a questão da liberdade na compreensão do mal, numa espécie de tensão pós-kantiana entre moral e metafísica. ///Il convient de réanalyser la relation entre le mal et la religion chez Kant. Le présent article aborde cependant une problématique préalable á celle-ci, á savoir la question meme du mal telle que Kant la présente dans la première partie du livre de 1793, La religion dans les limites de la simple raison. Après l'ntroduction qui rappelle 1'étonnement des premiers lecteurs de ce livre, on essaie, sur la base d'une analyse herméneutique des textes. de discerner l'articulation entre la disposition originaire pour le bien et la propension au mal. On rencontre ensuite l'aporie entre le désir et la rélité du mal: d'où vient le mal? Sur l'itinéraire de cette réponse il faudra éclaircir le concept de nature, ainsi que l'interprétation kantienne du péché originel. La conclusion réintroduit la question de la liberté dans la compréhension du mal, en une sorte de tension post-kantienne entre morale et metaphysique. /// The relation between evil and religion in the philosophy of Kant deserves e renewed analysis.

Author(s): Renaud Michel<br>
Abstract: O tema principal deste artigo incide na relação entre a metafísica de Deus e a abordagem de Deus na filosofia da religião. Três modelos são apresentados, respectivamente sob os títulos seguintes: 1) o caminho da filosofia para a fé; 2) a filosofia e a fé no mesmo caminho; 3) o caminho da fé para a filosofia. Os modelos apoiam-se sobre: 1) Tomás de Aquino, na primeira parte; 2) Hegel, na segunda e 3) a hermenêutica contemporânea, na terceira. Não se trata de repetir esses autores, mas de tentar decifrar o momento especulativo próprio de cada um no que diz respeito à articulação do Deus da metafísica com o Deus da fé. /// Le thème principal de cet article concerne la relation entre la métaphysique de Dieu et l'approche de Dieu en philosophie de la religion. Trois modèles sont proposés, respectivement: 1) le chemin de la philosophie vers la foi; 2) la philosophie et la foi sur le même chemin; 3) le chemin de la foi vers la philosophie. Ces modèles s'appuient sur les auteurs ou courants philosophiques suivants: Thomas d'Aquin dans la première partie; Hegel, dans la seconde; l'herméneutique contemporaine dans la troisième. Il ne s'agit pas de répéter ces auteurs, mais de dégager le moment spéculatif de chacun quant à l'articulation du Dieu de la métaphysique avec le Dieu de la foi. /// The principal them of this article has to do with the religion that can be established between the God of metaphysics and that which can be discerned in the philosophy of religion. Three models are presented: 1) the path from philosophy to faith; 2) philosophy and faith on this very path; 3) the path from fait to philosophy. These three models are based respectively on the following: 1) Thomas Aquinas; 2) Hegel; and 3) contemporary hermeneutics. It is not a matter of repeating these others, but rather to capture the speculative moment that can be found in each and that contribute to the articulation of he God of metaphysics with the God of faith.<br>

Abstract: O estruturalismo levistraussiano tern urn vasto alcance critico em relação ao conceitochave da filosofia do conhecimento que é a razão. Alicerçando a racionalidade num inconsciente universal, num sistema formal categórico, e postulando urn isomorfismo entre a natureza e a cultura, Lévi-Strauss faz uma critica nova da razão humana. Esta não pode ser concebida como consciência, como representação, tão ao gosto do racionalismo moderno e de algumas filosofias contemporàneas, nem perspectivada dialectica e temporalmente, como o fazem o positivismo e o hegelianismo. /// Levi-Strauss' structuralism strongly criticizes "reason", a key-concept in the philosophy of knowledge. Grounding rationality upon a universal unconscious and upon a categorical formal system, and postulating an isomorphism between nature and culture, Strauss produces a new criticism of human reason. Reason can no longer be conceived as it is both in modern rationalism and in some contemporary philosophical trends, as consciousness, as representation. Nor can it be thought of from either a temporal or a dialectical point of view, as it is in positivism and in hegelianism.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo tem por tema a relação entre a Filosofia da História e a problemática epistemólogica da complexidade. A teoria do conhecimento histórico ou epistemologia da História nao pode ser vista de modo linear ou unívoco porque tem sofrido mutações nos seus quadros conceptuais compáraveis às revoluções cientificas concebidas pelo filosofo e historiador das ciências Thomas Kuhn, destacando-se quatro paradigmas (continuando a usar a terminologia deste autor) do conhecimento histórico: o paradigma "omnicompreensivo", que visa compreender o sentido global da História e tem como representante máximo Hegel, retomado no contexto actual por Francis Fukuyama com a sua tese sobre o tlm da Historia: o paradigma positivista guiado por uma ideia de objectividade do conhecimento histórico hoje considerada redutora: o relativismo emergente com o "fim das grandes narrativas de legitimação do saber" e a fragmentação do sentido no pensamento pós-modemo; e a "História aberta" ao misterio do tempo, problematizadora, que constrói o seu objecto na complexidade da relação interdisciplinar com outros saberes, limitada aos instrumentos conceptuais ou técnicos do historiador e excedendo qualquer sistema conceptual fechado mas mantendo uma inquietacao metodologica orientada pela busca interminável de sentido. É este último paradigma -epistemológico, hermenêutico e histórico - que é defendido neste estudo. /// This essay deals with the relation between the philosophy of history and the epistemological problem of complexity. The theory of historical Knowlege or epistemology of history can't be seen in a linear one dimensional way because it has suffered mutations on its conceptual pictures, like the scientific revolutions conceived by the philosopher and historian of sciences.

Abstract: Este artigo reflecte sobre o significado critico dos conceitos de tradição e preconceito, noções fundamentias da filosofia hermeneutica de Hans-Georg Gadamer. Visa de forma particular a contestação que o autor faz da moderna redução do sentido da filosofia. Filosofia ou teoria da ciência, eis os termos de uma questão que atravessa o pensamento de Gadamer, desde Verdade e Método, até aos últimos textos. Para o filosofo, na raiz originária do sentido está um modo ôntico de ser, caracterizado pela memória, pelo efeito histórico da tradição e pela necessidade de formação. A razão, que se sabe hoje historica e finita, parte sempre de pressupostos, que marcam a sua basilar inserção na comunidade da palavra já sempre partilhada e nos lembram como é ilusório o sonho iluminista de uma transparência total. /// This article is a reflexion about the critical meaning of the concept of tradition and prejudice in the hermeneutical philosopphy of H.-G. Gadamer. It focuses on Gadamer's protest against the modern reduction of the meaning of philosophy. Philosophy or theory of science are the terms of the question that crosses all of Gadamer's thought, from Wahrheit und Methode until the later works. At the root of meaning is for Gadamer an ontological way of being characterized by memory, the historic effect of tradition and the need of formation. Reason, which we now know as historical and finite, is grounded on presuposed ideas which mark its fundamental insertion in the comunity of the world, already shared, and remind us of how deceptive the iluminist dream of a total transparency actually is.<br>

Abstract: Objectivo dopresente artigo é estabelecer a relação entre a filosofia hermenêutica de Hans-Georg Gadamer e a teologia, a partir do estudo da referênda mútua que existe entre ambas. Analisa, por um lado, a influência da questão hermenêutica, em tor no a Bultmann, à "Teologia da Palavra" e ao próprio Heidegger, sobre a formulção filosofica de Gadamer; por outro, analisa a influencia exercida pela filosofia hermenêutica de Gadamer sobre a discussão teológica posterior, sobretudo ao nível da Teologia Fundamental, ou seja, de uma reflexão sobre os pressupostos hermenêuticos da própria teologia. Chega-se, desta forma, a uma tematização da metafisica, na confluência entre filosofia e teologia. O artigo salienta também a importância das reflexões de Gadamer sobre a arte e o tempo, pelas possibilidades que, para além da hermenêutica restrita, abrem ao estabelecimento de outrospontos de ligação entre a filosofia e a teologia. /// Ojective of the present article is to establish a relation between Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics and theology on the basis of an overlapping thematics. On the one hand, there is the influence of the hermeneutical question, centered around Bultmann's "Theology of the Word" and Heidegger's work, on Gadamer's philosophical discourse. On the other hand, Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics excercised an influence on fundamental theology, particularly in relation to the hermeneutical presuppositions operative in the theological enterprise. Metaphysical thematics can be thus found at the point where philosophy and theology converge. The article seeks, in addition, to bring out the importance of Gadamer's reflexions on art and time as especially useful in establishing other common concerns shared by philosophy and theology.<br>

Abstract: O artigo parte de uma constatação fundamental: a cultura secular mudou radicalmente o problema do mal, libertando-o do imediatismo religioso, exigindo uma resposta nova para um problema novo. Procede segundo dois momentos fundamentais. Primeiro, a ponerología, prévia a toda a adscrição religiosa ou ateia, mostra como a finitude torna o mal algo inevitável: omnis determinatio est negatio (Spinoza, Leibniz, Hegel); mostra também até que ponto a ideia de um mundo-finito-sem-mal é algo contraditório, um verdadeiro "círculo-qua-drado". Quebra-se assim o "dilema de Epicuro", pois a alternativa já não é: mundo bom / mundo mau, mas sim: mundo / mundo finito-com-mal (não mundo mau); e instaura-se uma "lógica do apesar de", sem contaminação teleológica. A pisteodicea - o segundo passo - estuda as respostas ("fés" em sentido filosófico ou teológico, crente ou ateu). A teodiceia clássica converte-se, desta forma, em "pisteodiceia cristã", filosoficamente coerente (graças à ponerologia, Deus aparece, apesar do mal, como omnipotente e bom) e teologicamente responsável: a cruz, inevitável, preserva a bondade divina; a ressurreição, transcendente, preserva a omnipotência, respeitando a legalidade mundana. Filosofia e teologia mantêm assim a união na diferença. /// At the outset of this paper is the fundamental realization that the secular culture has radically changed the problem of evil, exempting it from the religious elementariness but rather demanding a new answer to a new problem. It sets two steps. First, the ponerology, previous to any religious or atheistic addition, shows that finitude makes evil inevitable: omnis determinatio est negatio (Spinoza, Leibniz, Hegel); a finite-world-without-evil is contradictory, a "square-circle". It breaks, thus, the "Epicurean dilemma", since the alternative is not: good world vs. evil world, but rather world vs. finite-world-with-evil (not evil world): and it establishes a "logic of the in spite of, without the teleological contamination.~<br>

Abstract: A quebra no que se refere às certezas da fé, a ênfase da própria experiência e os horrores do século XX levaram ao surgimento de uma vaga de (anti-)teodiceias. Aos ataques por parte do ateísmo correspondem do lado dos teólogos ou um certo resentimento em relação a Deus ou a sua desculpa mediante um pôr-em-questão da sua omnipotência. Surgiram desta forma propostas de carácter ora dualistico ora monístico que fizeram com que a resposta clássica ao problema tivesse progressivamente ficado quase reduzida ao âmbito do ininteligível (veja-se o caso da incompreensão das teses ontológicas referentes ao carácter deficitário do mal). Foi sobretudo em confronto com a tonalidade afectiva desta discussão que surgiu a "free-will-defense" da racionalidade, muito embora a questão seja aqui a de saber até que ponto não têve ela por isso de pagar um preço demasiado alto. Em referência à dupla questão de Boécio na obra "Consolação da Filosofia", o autor do presente artigo defende, por um lado, a não solubilidade do problema da teodiceia: "Si Deus est, unde mala?" - Néscio! Por outro lado, no entanto, o autor constata também que a reflexão sobre a experiência de si não só justifica, como até exige, uma abertura à esperança da fé: "Si vero Deus non est, unde bona?" Seio quod nonl Facto é que desta forma, diz o autor, nos confrontamos com a realidade do bem seja isso a propósito da exigência moral que experimentamos ou do protesto que levantamos contra a realidade do mal. Ora é esta auto-revelação do poder da realidade do santo e do bem que não só nos permite, mas também de nós exige a Esperança da sua manifestação final. /// Breakdown in what concerns faith certainties, emphasis on experience of the self, and the horrors of the XX century led to a wave of (anti)-theodicies. To the attacks on the atheist's side correspond, according to the theologian's side, either some resentement related to God or their excuse by means of calling in question God's omnipotence. Thus, some proposals of ~<br>

Abstract: O artigo pretende mostrar os termos na base dos quais se desenvolve na primeira produção piciana (Sonetos - Oratio e, em parte, o Heptaplus) uma forte concepção da autoconsciência humana, e de que modo esta a partir da certeza do próprio limite se torna positivamente consciência do criado. O desenvolvimento necessário de uma tal posição será o forte acento colocado por Giovanni Pico sobre a dignidade ontológica e criatural do ser humano: esta será elaborada primeiro nos termos de uma verdadeira filosofia da liberdade, mostrando-se depois até que ponto a autoconsciência e a própria dignidade humana levam o Conde da Concórdia a esboçar uma verdadeira e autêntica filosofia da responsabilidade, cuja primeira concretização mais forte se encontra no convite a recuperar a a dignidade originária do ser humano com vista à construção da paz. /// The article aims at showing the extent to which in his first writings (Sonetti -Oratio and incidentally Heptaplus,) Giovanni Pico della Mirandola develops a strong conception of human selfconsciousness, which at the same time represents an awareness of the human limits and of the created world. The necessary development of such a conception consists in Pico's underlining of the high, ontologic, dignity of the human being. The article shows how this takes the shape of a philosophy of freedom and, then, on the background of human selfconsciuosness and dignity, how the Count of Concordia outlines something like a philosophy of responsibility realizing itself in a strong invitation for people to rediscover the originary dignity of the human being in order to build peace.<br>

Abstract: Arguing that the times of scientistic criticism of psychoanalysis are past and that psychoanalysis is now open to new intellectual and scientific horizons, the article aims at showing how the recent developments of neurobiology, cognitive psychology, as well as new theories of therapeutic change in psychoanalysis support a reformulation of the psychoanalytic unconscious. The author defends that the obvious terminological confusion between the neurobiological and cognitive non-conscious on the one hand and the dynamic unconscious, on the other, require clear definitions of differences and of commonalities. Furthermore, the author also develops the idea that the dimensions of awareness and of selfascription (avowal/disavowal) help to determine what is the core of the dynamic unconscious, even though the cognitive non-conscious and the psychoanalytic unconscious overlap to a great extent. The article shows, finally, how a new interdisciplinary consensus offers now a chance for us to recognize the shortcomings of a rationalistic philosophy of mind. /// Argumentando que os tempos de uma crítica da psicanálise a partir do cientismo já passaram e que a psicanálise está agora aberta a novos horizontes intelectuais e científicos, o artigo pretende mostrar até que ponto os desenvolvimentos mais recentes da neurobiologia, da psicologia cognitiva bem como das novas teorias da mudança terapêutica em psicanálise suportam uma reformulação do inconsciente psicanalítico. O autor defende que a óbvia confusão terminológica entre o não-consciente neurobiológico e cognitivo por um lado e o inconsciente dinâmico por outro requerem definições claras das diferenças e dos aspectos comuns. Além disso, o autor desenvolve também a ideia de que as dimensões de conhecimento e de auto-atribuição (reconhecimento/nãoreconhecimento) ajudam a determinar aquilo que constitui o cerne do inconsciente dinâmico, mesmo que o não-consciente cognitivo e o inconsciente psicanalítico se sobreponham em grande m~<br>

Abstract: O presente artigo procura apresentar algumas das principais características do diálogo de Paul Ricoeur com a psicanálise freudiana no contexto da sua hermenêutica filosófica. Num primeiro momento, o artigo começa por se referir ao contacto inicial de Ricoeur com a problemática da psicanálise na obra La symbolique du mal. Num segundo momento, considerando a obra Essai sur Freud, o artigo procura situar a psicanálise como uma arqueologia do sujeito a ser conjugada com as instâncias teleológica (Hegel) e escatológica (filosofia da religião). A cumplicidade das três instâncias representa o terceiro ponto do presente ensaio: o desejo transforma-se na instância comum entre elas. O quarto ponto explicita a articulação entre o arqueo-lógico/pulsional e o teleológico/espiritual no domínio da arte: o passado pulsional é subsumido nas dimensões teleológica e escatológica do sentido. O quinto ponto trata da figura do pai presente na imagem de Deus que se encontra na Bíblia: ele regressa de um modo que está para além do mero antropomorfismo, assinalado como está pela realização de promessas futuras. Uma tal figura provoca um repensar dos afectos arcaicos referentes ao medo da punição. Um sexto ponto oferece uma apreciação geral da hermenêutica filosófica de Ricoeur e da resistência que ela propõe a todas as formas de subjectivismo. Finalmente, o artigo refere-se ainda ao modo como fé e filosofia se encontram e se afectam mutuamente ao mesmo tempo que uma e outra mantêm as suas características distintas. /// The present article seeks to present some of the main features of Paul Ricoeur's dialogue with Freudian psychoanalysis in the context of his philosophical hermeneutics.

Abstract: "Mystic Maybe's": the title comes from Augustine Birrill's words on the death of Matthew Arnold. Is it true that Richard Kearney's philosophy of religion, like Arnold's reflections on the Bible, are "mystic maybe's," mere flirtations with possibility? In order to answer this question I seek to understand Kearney's expression "the God who may be" and to see if it fits into a non-metaphysical philosophy of religion. The expression is clarified by way of comparisons with Wolfhart Pannenberg's eschatological understanding of God and Eberhard Jungel's theology of possibility. One weak point in Kearney's philosophy of religion, it is argued, is its avoidance of theology in the name of the philosophy of religion. A sound philosophy of religion needs to engage with theology. /// "Mystic Maybe's" (Possibilidades místicas): Este titulo deriva das palavras de Augustine Birrill acerca da morte de Mathew Arnold. O autor do artigo pergunta até que ponto a filosofia da religião de Richard Kearney não será, tal como as reflexões de Arnold acerca da Bíblia, um mew "místico talvez", um simples namoro com a possibilidaãe. Em ordem a responder à questão, o autor procura compreender o sentido da expressão de Richard Kearney acerca do "Deus que pode ser" de modo a avaliar até que ponto a expressão se adequa a uma filosofia não-metafísica da religião. O artigo clarifica a expressão de Kearney mediante uma comparação quer com a compreensão escatológica de Deus de Wolfhart Pannenberg quer com a teologia da possibilidade de Eberhard Jüngel. Mostra-se, desta forma, que um dospontos maisfracos na filosofia da religião de Richard Kearney consiste na sua tentativa de escapar à teologia em nome da filosofia da religião. Com efeito, argumenta o autor do artigo, uma autêntica filosofia da religião não pode deixar de estar num diálogo eficaz com a teologia.<br>

Author(s): Dachun Yang<br>
Abstract: The view of language is greatly changed from early modern philosophy to later modern philosophy and to postmodern philosophy. The linguistic question in early modern philosophy, which is characterized by rationalism and empiricism, is discussed in this paper. Linguistic phenomena are not at the center of philosophical reflections in early modern philosophy. The subject of consciousness is at the center of the philosophy, which makes language serve purely as an instrument for representing thoughts. Locke, Leibniz and Descartes consider language from a representationalist point of view. To them, language itself is idealized and represents thought as if it were thought representing itself. Like the structural linguist Saussure, the founders of phenomenology and analytical philosophy give much attention to the logical or static structure of language, and stick up for the representationalism of early modern philosophy. However, their successors refuse to accept this attitude, meaning the final collapse of representationalism. /// 从早期现代哲学到后期现代哲学再到后现代哲学，在语言观上产生了重大的 变化。早期现代哲学以唯理论和经验论为典型形式。语言现象没有成为该时期哲学 反思的中心问题; 意识主体处于哲学的中心，这使得语言仅仅充当着表象思想的工 具。洛克、莱布尼茨和笛卡尔都从表象论的角度看待语言，在他们那里，语言本身 被观念化了，它们表象思想，就像思想在表象它自身。正像结构语言学家索绪尔一 样，现象学和分析哲学的创始人关注的都是语言的逻辑结构或静态结构，他们延续 了早期现代哲学的表象论，但他们的后继者拒绝接受这种态度，而这意味着最终突 破表象论。<br>

Abstract: De part et d'autre de l'Atlantique, l'œuvre de Michel Foucault a été reçue de manière très différente par les anthropologues. Si l'anthropologie américaine a accueilli avec enthousiasme les réflexions du philosophe sur les rapports entre pouvoir et savoir, sur sa conceptualisations du biopolitique, les anthropologues français se sont montrés plus réticents et ont manifesté longtemps une certaine méfiance à l'égard de ce penseur. Chez Foucault luimême, on ne trouve que de rares références à l'anthropologie, et son point de vue sur l'anthropologie structurale est extrêmement critique. Cet article est centré sur la question du pouvoir, car c'est là que l'influence foucaldienne sur la nouvelle anthropologie est particulièrement manifeste, et il s'inscrit dans le cadre d'une interrogation plus large sur les rapports entre philosophie et anthropologie. /// On both sides of the Atlantic, anthropologists have received Michel Foucault's work quite differently. Whereas American anthropology has enthusiastically accepted the philosopher's thoughts about the relations between power and knowledge, and his conceptualization of "biopolitics", French anthropologists have, for a long time now, been more reluctant, even wary of this thinker. Foucault's work contains very few references to anthropology, and his point of view about structural anthropology was extremely critical. This article, which focuses on the question of power, where Foucault's influence on new trends in anthropology is especially evident, is part of a broader inquiry into the relations between philosophy and anthropology.<br>

Abstract: Périodiquement, une voix philosophique ou une autre s'élève pour promouvoir Wittgenstein figure tutélaire des sciences sociales. Concrètement, bien que son nom soit attaché à quelques épisodes célèbres, les usages de Wittgenstein, en anthropologie notamment, restent cependant assez modestes. Mais, philosophe à la fois viennois et anglais, susceptible ainsi de se charger des effets de prestige et de disqualification associés à la philosophie analytique ou continentale, il n'en est pas moins un révélateur intéressant des échanges intellectuels dans l'anthropologie entre les États-Unis et la France. Si les effets de censure semblent à présent l'emporter en France, aux États-Unis, le travail récent et original de Veena Das, autour de la lecture par Stanley Cavell de Wittgenstein, trouve de nouvelles pistes d'inspiration dans cette œuvre apparemment austère. /// Periodically, a philosophical voice is raised to tout Wittgenstein as an outstanding figure in the social sciences. Although his name is associated with a few famous episodes, his ideas have been put to little use, at least in anthropology. Although the figure of this philosopher, both Viennese and English, is apt to take on the traits of prestige and disqualification associated with analytical or continental philosophy, it is a telling example of intellectual exchanges in anthropology between the United States and France. While censure seems to have carried the day in France, Veena Das's recent, original work in the United States on Stanley Cavell's interpretation of Wittgenstein opens new sources of inspiration in this apparently austere work.<br>

Abstract: No centro do presente artigo está a problemática kierkegaardiana do possível e do impossível, ou seja, a coexistência dos opostos como explicitação do paradoxo, uma das figuras matriciais do Absurdo. Para Kierkegaard, o homem singular vê-se confrontado com o Paradoxo precisamente na medida em que a sua existência não cai sob o domínio da metafísica e do estético. Por outras palavras, o paradoxo invade a existência humana no momento em que se trata do paradoxo absoluto, escândalo para o Judeu, loucura para o Grego, absurdo para a Razão. O artigo mostra, contudo, que antes de se confrontar com o Paradoxo, o existente precisa de aprender a esperar, malgrado o absurdo, na certeza de que tudo é possível a Deus. Porém, a experiência do Paradoxo implica percorrer um caminho prévio. Por outras palavras, é necessário aprender a experimentar a "condensação do possível", seja sob a forma de melancolia seja sob a forma do escrúpulo, de modo a poder desesperar da ideia do possível. Mostra-se assim a capacidade inovadora de Kierkegaard, mesmo sabendo nós que o desespero constitui um tema filosófico clássico já deste a Antiguidade. O que Kierkegaard faz, porém, é colocar em movimento uma dialéctica em que o jogo dos opostos se organiza em diversas figuras precárias, sempre incertas e fluentes e que se escalonam segundo degraus múltiplos de intensidade. Ora é precisamente graças a este jogo de oposições que no pensamento do Solitário de Copenhaga se articulam, ainda que de forma frágil, o finito e o infinito, o temporal e o eterno, a possibilidade e a necessidade. /// At the center of the present article is the kierhegaardian approach to the dialectic of the possible and the impossible, whose co-existence gives evidence to the Paradox, one of the figures of the Absurd. For Kierkegaard, the singular human being finds herself confronted with the Paradox precisely in the measure in which her existence does not fall under the dominion of metaphysics and of the aesthetical.

Author(s): Rieff Ann Clark<br>
Abstract: In his 1987 bestseller The Closing of the American Mind, when Allan Bloom cites German ideas-or the "German connection"-as the utlimate source of a radical deterioration in American higher education, his attention focuses on Nietzsche's relativism, which he sees as nihilism. Tracing the terms "relativism" and "nihilism" in European philosophy and criticism, this article locates Bloom along a spectrum of positions ranging from absolutism to radical relativism. Examining links between Bloom's rejection of relativism, his praise of the Great Books tradition, and his hostility toward feminist scholarship, the writer shows how Bloom's advocacy of the literary canon represents a defense of white male privilege in the name of the "true" and the "natural."<br>

Publisher: Lynne Rienner Publishers<br>
Issue: i40027896<br>
Date: 3 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Parker Noel<br>
Abstract: While concepts of a postinternational politics properly highlight the constant variance of entities in play in international relations, the approach lacks an ontology that shows how such an unstable variety of types of players can coexist in a common field in the first place. This article draws upon Deleuze's philosophy to set out an ontology in which the continual reformulation of entities in play in "postinternational" society can be grasped.This entails a strategic shift from speaking about the "borders" between sovereign states to referring instead to the "margins" between a plethora of entities that are ever open to modifications of identity. The concept of the margin possesses a much wider reach than borders, and focuses continual attention on the meetings and interactions between a range of indeterminate entities whose interactions may determine both themselves and the types of entity that are in play.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i40027959<br>
Date: 3 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Augustyn Leszek<br>
Abstract: The article deals with the philosophy of Nikolai Berdjaev (1874-1948), which he formulated between The Philosophy of Inequality (written in 1918, but published in 1923) and The New Middle-Ages (1924). Berdjaev's philosophy is analyzed in the context of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and its aftermath. The other point of reference is the crisis of culture and civilisation, which affected the West in the inter-war period. Berdjaev's position has been interpreted in view of the archetypal myth of the struggle of the two principles, the principle of order (cosmos) and the forces of destruction (chaos). This myth is tied to the millenialist world view. Berdjaev took an anti-utopian stance. He juxtaposed the utopianrevolutionary principle with the hierarchical-creative one. From this position he criticized among others democracy, liberalism and socialism. In the midst of the crisis of the 1920s he remarked the possibility of spiritual rejuvenation putting forward the concept of the New Middle-Ages. One can say that at that time Berdjaev's philosophy evolved within the conservative-creative framework, from the utopia of conservatism to the utopia of 'free creativity'.<br>

Author(s): Carbine Rosemary P.<br>
Abstract: Framed in the introduction and conclusion by an analysis of U. S. Congressional hearings about Hurricane Katrina and its socio-political aftermath, this article explores the theo-political significance of narrative in order to give a feminist theological interpretation of political participation and personhood. It attends to and expands on the role of narrative at the intersections of moral philosophy, feminist theory, sociology, and public and women's liberation theologies, retrieving key insights from these sources to highlight some of the heretofore neglected implications of subaltern narratives as an alternative form of political engagement in U. S. public life. Especially when viewed through a richly textured feminist, womanist, and mujerista theological lens, this article provides a theological perspective on narrative as one rhetorical practice of public engagement utilized by marginalized groups for prophetic justice. It concludes by showing how a feminist<br>

Abstract: The history of literary studies is especially important today as Germanistik takes account of its institutionalization in the university and redefines its disciplinary boundaries. By analyzing the two best-known reform universities, Berlin in 1809/10 and Constance in 1966/67, I show their strikingly similar commitments to notions of scholarship/research, learning, and pedagogy. That these common concerns are based on the influence of hermeneutics is not surprising; the philosophy of Bildung and Wissenschaft central to educational theory for Humboldt in Berlin, as well as for Jauß's and Iser's Rezeptionsästhetik in Constance, is metacritical and encourages reflection on understanding and interpretation.<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Abstract: To see, to speak, to think : these are the three main topics of Merleau-Ponty's philosophy, tragically interrupted in 1961. He intended to write two works on The Origin of Truth. To understand the relationship between Merleau-Ponty I and Merleau-Ponty II it is a good lead to pay attention to the relationship between seeing, speaking and thinking. In a central passage of Phenomenology of Perception (p. 451) this relationship is called Fundierung. Merleau-Ponty conceives it as a two way relationship, which excludes every possibility of reducing one term (thinking, reason) to another (perception, language). Yet, at that time he is not able to point out clearly the originality of thinking. L'Oeil et l'Esprit and Le Visible et l'Invisible provide a first outline of l'Origine de la Vérité. The 'second' Merleau-Ponty wants to 'reassume' his whole philosophy in what he calls : fundamental thinking. Painting opens the way to the mystery of seeing : something visible begins to see. Subject and object are no longer opposed to one another ; not even related by intentionality. The new key-word is Ineinander (interrelatedness, to be in one another, chiasm). 'La chair' (the flesh) is a new notion, broader and more fundamental than the body. The sensible reflects upon itself. This 're-flection' (reflexivity or reversibility) is a work of Being. The visible can be seen in principle. Philosophy should accompany the coming-to-see of the visible. In this perspective the transition to thinking (or ideality) must be seen as a new case of 'reversibilité'. The generality of the visible opens up to the 'invisible', that which in principle cannot be seen, but is 'the other side' of the visible. The basic phenomenon of expression is central here. Language is not an absolute starting point. Language is rather a new and more subtile form of coporeity, a new instance of the same basic reversibility, which already contains the seeds of ideality (logos endiathetor). The idea is of the word (logos ~<br>

Abstract: Hermeneutical philosophy as developed by Heidegger and Gadamer is not compatible with the classical phenomenological programme elaborated by Husserl. The hermeneutical stress on historicity as a necessary condition for understanding is unfamiliar to Husserl's strictly theoretical approach. However, this does not mean that a hermeneutical philosophy as such cannot be conceived in a phenomenological sense. Whether or not hermeneutical philosophy is phenomenological depends on the paradigm chosen for hermeneutical explanation. A hermeneutics referring to the interpretation of texts may elucidate constitutional elements of phenomenology, e.g. phenomenological reduction and reflection. In this way it even can initiate a modification of phenomenology which, instead of being caught up in its subjective foundation, now appears as elucidating the openness of the correlation between intentional attitudes and their 'objects'. For this correlation the interpretation is a paradigm, whereas the openness of the correlation can be explained in respect of freedom, language, and time.<br>

Abstract: Cassirer faisait de la connaissance le point culminant du « processus d'objectivation de l'esprit » se révélant ainsi progressivement à soi-même à travers la spécificité de ses diverses configurations symboliques. Nous nous proposons d'élucider ici la loi de constitution propre aux sciences exactes à partir des principales figures de la physique moderne pour nous élever à une philosophie de la culture scientifique et dégager les principaux problèmes que pose sa réalisation comme « Weltbegriff ». Cassirer considered Knowledge as the terminating point of the « process of objectification » of human spirit that leads progressively to its self-consciousness through the differential specificity of symbolic forms. We are mainly concerned here with trying to clear up the constitutive law proper to exact sciences. Our analysis starts from the main figures of modern physics as its starting point in order to set our thought on a philosophy of scientifical culture and to draw the main problems related to its achievement as « Weltbegriff ».<br>

Author(s): Ricœur Paul<br>
Abstract: Cet article s'interroge sur le statut à la fois épistémologique et ontologique d'un passé qui « a été » et dont les individus comme les sociétés retiennent le souvenir, mais qui, comme le langage ordinaire l'exprime, « n'est plus » . Toute une tradition de réflexion sur la conservation du passé par la mémoire depuis Platon et Aristote a voulu ramener la mémoire à la métaphore de l'empreinte. En revanche, cet article tente de montrer que la mémoire à plusieurs dont dépend la connaissance historique n'est pas simplement assimilable à ce topos traditionnel. Ce qui caractérise la mémoire plurielle et publique qui alimente le travail de l'historien, c'est le statut privilégié du témoignage, la possibilité de confronter différents témoignages les uns aux autres, dont dépend la crédibilité du récit historique. C'est ainsi moins la problématique d'une ressemblance entre récit et événements racontés — problématique de la trace, héritée d'une tendance traditionnelle à identifier la mémoire avec l'empreinte — que la confrontation de témoignages dans leurs différents degrés de fiabilité qui nous fait assister à l'événement raconté. Cette réflexion sur le décalage entre mémoire et histoire ouvre, dans la deuxième partie de cet article, à une analyse approfondie de la temporalité propre au passé qui fait l'objet du souvenir et conduit à une confrontation avec privilège accordé, dans la synthèse des trois modes du temps, chez saint Augustin au présent et, chez Heidegger, au futur. De cette manière, l'article tente de rééquilibrer la synthèse des temps en lui restituant un autre rapport au passé, que l'on ne saurait atteindre à partir d'Augustin ou de Heidegger. Libérer l'histoire du paradigme de la trace, de la métaphore de la mémoire comme empreinte, revient précisément à la restitution de ce mode de temporalisation du passé jusqu'ici esquivé : cet autre rapport au passé vise, conjointement à la mise en évidence du témoignage propre au travail de l'historien, à souligner la dette~<br>

Publisher: Presses Universitaires de France<br>
Issue: i40040351<br>
Date: 6 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Benoist Jocelyn<br>
Abstract: L'auteur met en évidence l'ambiguïté de la théorie phénoménologique de la négation telle qu'elle est soutenue par Husserl. Husserl hésite entre une conception de la négation comme acte et l'incorporation de la négation au sens lui-même : entre une conception illocutionnaire et une conception propositionnelle de la négation. En définitive, il choisit la seconde conception, mais en l'étendant au niveau infrapropositionnel (à la perception). L'auteur traite ce problème comme révélateur de l'ambiguïté de la philosophie phénoménologique, suspendue entre acte et sens, langage et perception. The author shows the ambiguity of the phenomenological theory of negation, such as it is held by Husserl. Husserl hesitates between a conception of negation as an act and of negation belonging to the meaning itself : that is, between an illocutionary and a propositional view of negation. Eventually, he chooses the later, but by extending it to the subpropositional level (i.e. to perception). The author takes this problem to be revealing of the ambiguity of phenomenological philosophy, standing between act and meaning, and between language and perception.<br>

Publisher: Presses Universitaires de France<br>
Issue: i40040354<br>
Date: 12 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Villani A.<br>
Abstract: On essaie dans ces pages d'appliquer à la philosophie de Kant et de Dilthey certains concepts en vue d'une perspective critique de l'histoire. La distinction diltheyenne entre explication et compréhension est mise en rapport avec celle qu'opère Kant entre jugement déterminant et jugement réfléchissant. Puisque la majeure partie de la complexité historique ne peut trouver son explication dans des lois générales, on propose une compréhension réfléchissante du récit historique. Mettre en relation le jugement réfléchissant et la compréhension revient à souligner la dimension normative de l'interprétation historique. La perspective anthropologique de Kant fait également place aux jugements préréflexifs, préliminaires sur l'histoire, tandis que l'approche diltheyenne par les Geisteswissenschaften ramène à une conscience reflexive ou autoréférée qui replace l'individu en son temps et en son lieu. D'autres aspects peuvent encore conduire à notre rapport critique à l'histoire : le modèle kantien d'une orientation réfléchissante de la communauté humaine, les limites qu'ilpose à l'interprétation authentique, la conception heideggerienne de l'authenticité historique, l'analyse diltheyenne des systèmes d'influence réciproque comme cadre de l'idée d'une imputation causale singulière chez Paul Ricœur. This essay is an attempt at applying certain concepts to the philosophy of Kant and Dilthey, so as to develop a critical perspective on history. Dilthey's explanation-understanding distinction is related to Kant's distinction between determinant and reflective judgment. Since much of the complexity of history cannot be determinantly explained by general laws, a reflective understanding of the meaning of historical narrative is suggested. To relate judgment and understanding is to highlight the evaluative dimension of historical interpretation. Kant's anthropological perpective also makes room for pre-reflective, preliminary judgments about history, whereas Dilthey's human science app~<br>

Abstract: La définition kantienne du Gewissen associe deux schèmes interprétatifs anciens, celui de la voix et celui du tribunal, pour produire une invention dont le présent article essaie de mesurer la portée en même temps qu'il fait de cette réélaboration critique un vecteur de lecture des interprétations contemporaines. De manière presque inaperçue, c'est-à-dire sous l'apparence d'un héritage passivement transmis, Kant nous lègue un des problèmes les plus difficiles pour la philosophie pratique, celui de conférer du sens à la conscience morale. The kantian definition of Gewissen establishes a link between two lines of interpretation, one which draws on the simile of voice and the other on the metaphor of court. Through discussions of contemporary commentators, this article shows that the kantian definition deeply transforms the notion of Gewissen. In very discrete manner, in the guise of inheritance, Kant bequeathes us one of the most difficult problem of moral philosophy that is how to give meaning to moral consciousness.<br>

Abstract: Penser la nature du procédé de genèse du sens au moyen de l'analogie devient possible lorsque cette notion est envisagée dans la perspective critique modelée par la philosophie kantienne. Saisir comment s'effectue le passage de l'aspect formel à celui, événementiel, du sens, sur le mode du comme si, permet plus précisément d'envisager les enjeux du problème posé par les conditions d'élaboration, mais aussi de mise en œuvre d'un sens commun qui renvoie jusqu'aux perspectives propres au domaine de l'esthétique et du politique. Thinking the nature of the process of genesis of meaning through analogy becomes liable when the latter notion is understood within the critical perspective shapened through Kantian philosophy. Grasping how the passage from the formal to the eventful aspect of meaning on the as if mode enables one to understand more precisely the stakes of the problem set by the conditions of elaboration but also the erection of a common sense referring all the way to the specific perspectives of the aesthetic and political field.<br>

Abstract: L'auteur analyse les deux figures du dépassement de la métaphysique qui ont existé au XXe siècle : la phénoménologie, après être partie d'une vigoureuse critique de la métaphysique, d'inspiration positiviste, a tendu à devenir une nouvelle sorte de métaphysique, puis, comme telle, a subi la critique de la philosophie analytique naissante. La question est posée de savoir ce qui pourrait être conservé aujourd'hui des deux traditions, phénoménologique et analytique, en termes de critique de la métaphysique. The author analyses both the figures of the overcoming of metaphysics that existed in the XXth century : after starting from a strong criticism against metaphysics, of a positivist inspiration, phenomenology has tended to become a new kind of metaphysics, and then, as such, suffered the criticism of the newborn Analytic philosophy. The question is : what can be preserved now from both traditions, i.e. the phenomenological and the Analytic, in terms of a criticism of metaphysics ?<br>

Abstract: Windelband, réputé comme chef de l'école néokantienne de Bade, s'oppose comme Bergson au relativisme et au positivisme. Pour lui, comprendre Kant, c'est le dépasser, et ce, dans la direction de Hegel ; lire Bergson, c'est retrouver le sens de l'événement dans une métaphysique de l'irrépétable, qui, en montrant l'insuffisance du criticisme, ouvre la porte aux sciences historiques. Cela est l'interprétation positive de Bergson. Mais la critique est qu'il faut séparer totalement la psychologie de la philosophie, contrairement à la tradition philosophique française, encore observée par Bergson. Mais le volontarisme bergsonien apparaît comme représentatif de l'esprit de la philosophie du tournant du XIXe au XXe siècle. Mieux encore, avec Bergson, la philosophie retrouve l'ambition (hégélienne) d'être une vision globale du monde. Windelband, well-known for being the leader of the Neo-Kantian School of Bade, together with Bergson, is opposed to both relativism and positivism. According to him, understanding Kant means going further than the latter and, more, in Hegel's direction. Reading Bergson means finding again the meaning of event within metaphysics of what may not be repeated which, by showing the insufficiency of criticism, opens a new way towards historical sciences. Such is the positivie interpretation of Bergson. But the criticism is such as one should imperatively separate psychology from philosophy, contrary to the French philosophical tradition, still observed by Bergson. But Bergsonian voluntarism appears as some kind of representative of the spirit of philosophy at the turn of the 19th-20th century. Better further, with Bergson philosophy recaptures its (Hegelian) ambition to become a global vision of the world.<br>

Publisher: Presses Universitaires de France<br>
Issue: i40048293<br>

Author(s): Vieillard-Baron Jean-Louis<br>
Abstract: Divers ouvrages sur saint Augustin conduisent à reposer la question du temps et celle du sujet qui ont alors été réunies pour la première fois comme un unique problème : memoria, conscience et conscience de soi, sont pensées selon le temps comme un sentir primordial. Celui-ci suppose un lieu, le ciel des ciels, qui est le lieu temporel de l'homme auprès de Dieu. L'intériorité augustinienne a des antécédents dans la pensée antique ; elle a influencé la philosophie récente ; Heidegger interprète l'ego de Descartes d'une façon augustinienne dans son herméneutique de la facticité. Les questions suscitées par ces ouvrages viennent du manque actuel d'une histoire spéculative de l'ego, en même temps que d'une résurgence évidente de celui-ci dans le champ de la philosophie contemporaine. Several books about Augustine lead to question once more the topic of time and of the subject which then were united for the first time as a single problem : memoria, conscionsness and self conscionsness are thought according to time as a prime feeling. The latter supposes a place, heaven in heaven, which is the temporal seat of man next to God. Augustinian interiority has its antecedents within classical thought. It influenced recent philosophy. Heidegger interprets Descartes' ego in an Augustinian way within his hermeneutics of facticity. The topics at stake from these books surge from the present lack of a speculative history of the ego, together with an obvious resurgence of the latter within the field of contemporary philosophy.<br>

Author(s): Aubry Gwenaëlle<br>
Abstract: Les études ici réunies visent à explorer la résurgence, dans la philosophie et la théologie contemporaines, du motif de l'impuissance de Dieu. La question n'est plus seulement celle, comme dans la pensée médiévale, de la limitation de la toute-puissance divine, mais bien de son complet abandon. Elle est étroitement liée à l'interrogation sur ce que peut être une théologie d'après la Shoah, et elle préside aussi, chez des penseurs comme Hans Jonas, Gianni Vattimo, ou Giorgio Agamben, au redéploiement des problèmes du mal et de la création, des concepts théologiques de kénose et d'incarnation, ou encore des catégories aristotéliciennes de la puissance. The contributions assembled here explore the resurgence in contemporary philosophy and theology of the notion of a powerless God. What is at stake here is no longer the medieval question of limitations of divine omnipotence, but its radical abandonment. This is closely linked to the question of a new post-Shoah theology. Among thinkers such as Hans Jonas, Gianni Vattimo, or Giorgio Agamben, it presides over a re-examination of the problems of evil and creation, of the theological concepts of kenosis and incarnation or even the Aristotelian categories of potency.<br>

Publisher: Presses Universitaires de France<br>
Issue: i40048317<br>

Author(s): Boyer Alain<br>
Abstract: En 1950, Paul Ricœur publia une imposante Philosophie de la volonté, vite brocardée par la vague structuraliste et les critiques de toute « philosophie de la conscience ». On y trouve notamment une analyse du phénomène de l'hésitation qui contient bien des éléments encore pertinents. Phénomène bien connu, l'hésitation n'a pas été vraiment thématisée en tant que telle, même si, comme le montre Ricœur, l'histoire de la philosophie est susceptible d'aider à le faire. Mais le doute cartésien, par exemple, n'est guère hésitant. Ce chapitre fourmille d'analyses denses mais claires, d'allusions qu'il faut expliciter, de métaphores « vives » très riches, qui permettent de concevoir un sujet se cherchant dans l'hésitation avant de se choisir dans la décision. Il y a là un concept indispensable à toute théorie de l'action. Philosophie de la volonté (Philosophy of Will), a major work published by Ricœur in 1950, was quickly derided by members of the structuralist trend and by those critical of every single « philosophy of consciousness ». The book includes notably an analysis of the phenomenon of hesitation, many elements of which are still relevant. Although a well known phenomenon, hesitation has never been fully analyzed in itself, even though the history of philosophy, as Ricœur shows, might be helpful in such an endeavor. Cartesian doubt, for instance, shows hardly any hesitation. This chapter is replete with dense yet clear discussions, with allusions that require elucidation, and with a wealth of vivid metaphors which help us to envisage a subject in search of himself through hesitation, before choosing himself through decision. Such a concept is indispensable for any theory of action.<br>

Abstract: Cet article (1) présente une réflexion théorique sur la notion de genre, de ses définitions et ses usages en sciences sociales. S'opposant à l'approche dominante qui conçoit le genre comme identité ou attribut socialement construits des personnes, conception qu'elle considère comme essentialisante ou substantialisante, l'auteur argumente en faveur d'une approche relationnelle du genre conçu comme modalité des relations sociales. Elle se fonde pour cela sur des travaux d'anthropologie comparative et historique qui contraignent à reconsidérer le dualisme du moi et du corps constitutif de l'idéologie individualiste de la personne, et critique I'hypostase du Moi comme homoncule constitué à partir d'une absolutisation de la première personne. Analysant le système sexué des trois personnes grammaticales, elle soutient que, n'étant pas référentiel, « le je de l'interlocution n'a ni sexe, ni genre ». Les apports croisés de l'anthropologie et de la philosophie analytique la conduisent à revoir la notion de personne pour mieux penser la capacité proprement humaine de se reconnaître comme d'un sexe sans être jamais assigné à celui-ci. This article presents a theoretical work on the idea of gender, its definitions and uses in social science. The author objects to the mainstream approach that sees gender as an identity or an attribute that some people socially construct. She sees that idea as essentializing or substantializing. She argues in favor of a relational approach of gender conceived as mode of social interactions. Her approach is based on comparative and historical works of anthropologists that lead to consider the dualism of the ego and the body which make the individualistic ideology of a persona, and she criticizes the hypostasis of the ego as homunculus made up from absolutizing the id. Analyzing the gender system of the three grammatical persons, she asserts that, as it is not a reference, the other person's "I" does not have a sex nor a gender. The contributions f~<br>

Abstract: O artigo pretende apresentar um novo modelo de distribuição das ajudas sociais na França, modelo esse entretanto conhecido pelo nome de "alocação personalizada". Trata-se de um mecanismo que, em seu mesmo funcionamento e nas suas justificações éticas, se opõe seja ao sistema actual dominante, herdeiro do Estado-Provi-dência, seja ao projecto alternativo de alocação universal, ou basic income, entretanto amplamente debatido. Objectivo principal do artigo, porém, é explorar os fundamentos filosóficos subjacentes à proposta em causa. Tal como o próprio nome indica, o princípio da "alocação personalizada" apoia-se sobre o contributo de uma filosofia social específica, o personalismo. Assim, evocando principalmente os escritos de Emmanuel Mounier e de Max Scheler, os autores pretendem mostrar até que ponto esta filosofia social suporta uma concepção original da solidariedade, ela própria fundada sobre uma relação específica aos outros. Neste sentido, a proposta que aqui se faz em favor de uma "alocação personalizada" pode ser lida e interpretada como uma aplicação directa da perspectiva personalista a um problema preciso de economia política, a saber, o da organização da assistência social. This paper intends to present a new model for distribution of social assistance in France, a model which has been known by the name of "personalized allocation". It is a mechanism which opposes itself, in its own functioning and in its ethical justifications, both to the present dominant system, heir to the Welfare State, and to the alternative project of universal allocation, or basic income, which in the mean-while has been largely debated. The main aim of this paper, then, is to explore the philosophical fundaments underlying the proposal of the model in question. Like the very name indicates, the principle of "personalized allocation" is based on the contribution of a specific social philosophy, namely personalism. Thus, chiefly calling forth the writings of Emmanuel Mounier and M~<br>

Abstract: The title of the essay refers to the famous statement in Foucaults introduction to his History of Madness where he writes that "we have to do justice to Freud". The problem, however, is that Foucault's philosophy does not seem to do justice to Freud. Foucault's use of Freud is ambiguous: sometimes he uses him for purely instrumental purposes (when reconstructing the history of madness and sexuality), but sometimes—for anthropological purposes signaling Freud's role in redefining our common humanity and particularly our relation to language, life and work. The author confronts Foucault's ambiguous reading of Freud with the equally ambiguous reading of Foucault by Derrida. Derrida discusses Foucault twice. Once in the essay Cogito and The History of Madness in which Derrida takes on Foucault's understanding of Descartes and his role in the exclusion of madness from the realm of reason. The second time—in his essay To Do Justice to Freud. Here Derrida disagrees with Foucault whether Freud managed to reestablish the body's communication with reason which Descartes destroyed.<br>

Author(s): Jaume Lucien<br>
Abstract: Lucien Jaume presenta en este trabajo su propio discurso del método en historia intelectual, distinguiendo entre lo que llama «textos de intervención política» o ideopraxies, por un lado, y textos propiamente teóricos, por otro. El autor, que parte de una nítida distinción entre «conceptos filosóficos» y «conceptos políticos», va desgranando diversas consideraciones sobre el lenguaje y la política, y describe el uso de la palabra en el ámbito público como un tipo especial de «acción que incita a la acción». Tras efectuar un examen detenido de diversas propuestas de construir una historicidad del pensamiento, el autor plantea algunas objeciones críticas a la metodología de la llamada escuela de Cambridge, y en particular a ciertos postulados skinnerianos, para manifestarse finalmente en pro de «una pluralidad sin dogmatismos» que haga posible la coexistencia y complementariedad de la filosofía política con una renovada historia de las ideas. Lucien Jaume presents in this text his own «discourse on method» in intellectual history, distinguishing between what it is called «texts of political intervention» or ideopraxies, on the one hand, and properly theoretical texts, on the other hand. The author, who departs from a clear distinction between «philosophical concepts» and «political concepts», exposes various considerations on language and politics, and describes the public use of the word as a special type of «action that incites to action». After carrying out a thorough examination of diverse proposals to construct a historicity of the thought, the author raises some critical objections to the methodology of the so-called «school of Cambridge», in particular to certain skinnerian postulates. Finally he expresses his preference to «a plurality without dogmatisms» that there should make possible the coexistence and complementarity of the political philosophy with a renewed history of the ideas.<br>

Publisher: Philosophy Documentation Center<br>
Issue: i40063571<br>
Date: 1 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Casler Kenneth<br>
Abstract: By deliberately placing ethics under the category of communication, Kierkegaard intended to show that it is like no other science. He distinguished between direct communication and indirect communication. Direct communication concerns objectivity and knowledge; indirect communication, on the other hand, has to do with subjectivity ("becoming-subject"). In this paper, the author presents Kierkegaard's philosophy of communication and ethics with special emphasis on his irony and pseudonymous authorship. He also examines the possibility of a discourse in business ethics, focusing on the educational perspective. He discusses Kierkegaard's aspects of communication—the communicator, the receiver, and the object—with particular reference to applied ethics. He argues that the Kierkegaardian notion of indirect communication can contribute to renewing business ethics teaching—which in his view is more art than science—in two important ways: (1) when the ethics teacher changes his position in the teacher/learner relationship; and (2) when the relationship between communicator/receiver is strengthened at the expense of the object.<br>

Article Title: THE DIALECTICS OF JAMESON'S DIALECTICS<br>
Publisher: Wiley Subscription Services<br>
Issue: i40063720<br>
Date: 2 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Jameson Fredric<br>
Abstract: This review essay attempts to understand the book under review against the background of Jameson's previous writings. Failing to do so would invite misunderstanding since there are few contemporary theorists whose writing forms so much of a unity. Jameson's book can be divided into three parts. The first and most important part deals with dialectics, the second with politics, and the third with philosophy of history. In the first part Jameson argues that dialectics best captures our relationship to the sociocultural and historical world we are living in. The second part makes clear that Jameson is not prepared to water down his own Marxist politics in order to spare the liberal sensibilities of his political opponents. In the third part Jameson develops his own philosophy of history, mainly in a dialogue with Ricoeur. Dialectics is his main weapon in his discussion with Ricoeur, and it becomes clear that the Spinozism of dialectics allows for a better understanding of history and of historical writing than does Ricoeur's phenomenological approach. The book is an impressive testimony to the powers of dialectical thought and to its indispensability for a proper grasp of historical writing.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i40069706<br>
Date: 12 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Fernández Germán Darío<br>
Abstract: I propose a few epistemological and methodological reflexions to account for intercultural daily communication. These reflexions emerged during a sociological research in Mendoza, Argentina, with Huarpes Indigenous students at the University of Cuyo. I observed that Indigenous people became quasi "ethnographers" of diverse environments. To make intelligible their classmates' behavior, and to account for their own behavior, Huarpes follow, in diverse environments and interactions, public rules of meaning. The objective of this paper is twofold: (a) to stress the methodological scope of ordinary communication and ordinary reasoning in order to study understanding between people from different groups and categories, and (b) to contest a kind of "pessimist" standpoint in social sciences and philosophy according to which the use of ordinary language reduces possibilities for understanding. Interviews, participant observation in natural situations, and a review of literature about language and understanding are the basis of this paper.<br>

Abstract: Littérature et philosophie entretiennent des rapports évidents, du fait que certains philosophes sont poètes, comme Lucrèce, ou écrivains, comme Montaigne. On examine deux cas, Martha Nussbaum, qui soutient que la littérature, en particulier le roman, peut induire des analyses morales bien supérieures à celles des philosophes, et Maria Zambrano, philosophe et poète, qui soutient que c'est le même Logos qui est à l'oeuvre dans les deux domaines. Par le style, et par le souci conjoint de la signification, la poésie a un sens philosophique. L'histoire de la pensée ne peut pas négliger le rôle eminent de la poésie philosophique à travers l'histoire : Chateaubriand, Paul Valéry, Paul Claudel ont accompli une œuvre littéraire d'une grande portée philosophique. Literature and philosophy keep obvious relationships since a few philosophers are poets too, such as Lucretius, or writers, as Montaigne. Here we examine two cases: on the one hand that of Martha Nussbaum, who supports that only literature, in particular the novel, can lead to moral analyses much superior to those of the philosophers, and, on the other hand, that of Maria Zambrano, both a philosopher and a poet, who supports that it is the same Logos which is at stake in both fields. By the style, and through the joint concern of meaning, the poetry has a philosophical meaning. The history of thought cannot neglect the prominent part played by philosophical poetry throughout history: Chateaubriand, Paul Valéry, Paul Claudel carried out a literary work of a long lasting philosophical range.<br>

Abstract: Singing songs in service (kirtan seva) constitutes the primary expression of devotion in the Pushti Marg (Path of Grace) tradition of India. This liturgical practice is singular amongst South Asian, Hindu traditions in its extensive use of rag set to classical poetry. I consider the meaning of this sung liturgy using the ideas of hermeneutic philosophy that concern understanding. I suggest that performing song in service is similar to the act of understanding a work, one in which a self is disclosed in the mode of play. Critically, such continual self-unveilings over a lifetime of service to Krishna afford the practitioner the possibility of the lived liberation promised by founder, Vallabhacharya.<br>

Abstract: Kant's progressive philosophy of history is an integral aspect of his critical system, yet it is often ignored or even treated as an embarrassment by contemporary scholars. In this article, I defend Kant and argue for the continuing relevance of his regulative assumption of historical progress. I suggest, furthermore, that the first-person stance of practical belief exemplified in Kant's conception of hope offers new resources for thinking about the relationship between the ideal and the real in political theory.<br>

Abstract: Contemporary poetry, since Rimbaud and Mallarmé, invests issues which used to be the preserve of rational philosophy, while philosophy since Nietzsche makes greater use of poetic expressivity. The convergence is towards the sensory focus of perception, rational thought, and expression, the body; but, except at the limits, philosophy establishes concepts, poetry speaks from within.<br>

Abstract: Postmodern is both a concept and a period in time. Dating from May 1968 in France, postmodernism rejects legitimizing discourse and both formalist and marxist rationalism, undermining them through deconstruction. With the gradual discrediting of structuralist linguistics and a new interest in history, philosophy and biology, the postmodernist adopts a stance that is neither archaic nor modern but which exists in an historic context. Through « renarrativisation », subjects are « reinvented » using techniques such as ironic rewriting (Echenoz, Toussaint, « historical » novels, Ransmayr, Härtling) or dissimulation (Manganelli, Perec, Pavic, Temesi).<br>

Abstract: Depois de apresentar a inseparável relação entre religião e cultura, com base numa abordagem hermenêutica da filosofia da religião, focaliza-se a questão no topos da relação entre religião e violência, com recurso às leitura de Girard, Ricœur e Marquard. Ao contrário do que muitas propostas defendem, considera-se o potencial do monoteísmo como superador de violência. Nesse contexto, o conceito cristão de Deus, baseado na originária articulação da identidade com a relação, é considerado como caminho religioso para a superação da violência - também no âmbito da relação inter-cultural. After presenting the inseparable relation between religion and culture from the perspective of a hermeneutics of the philosophy of religion, the article centres its attention on the relation between religion and violence, with special recourse made to Girard, Ricœur, and Marquard. Contrary to what has been often proposed, the essay advances the idea that monotheism has the potential of overcoming violence. In this context, the Christian concept of God, based on an original articulation of identity and relation, is conceived as the religious path to the overcoming of violence - also in the ambit of intercultural relation.<br>

Abstract: Cette réflexion s'inscrit dans l'héritage de Paul Ricœur, à la recherche d'une philosophie de la traduction. Langage, langues, traduction entrant dans le jeu du processus de la constitution du sens, la traduction devient le moment privilégié d'une reconstruction de l'unité plurielle du discours humain et ouvre la voie à une éthique de l'hospitalité langagière et de la convivialité. Le don de la langue et des langues introduit un élément de gratuité qui corrige l'obsession contemporaine pour la marchandisation généralisée des mondes vitaux et laisse entrevoir un possible fondement non violent du lien social dans une perspective de solidarité et de sollicitude pour les personnes concrètes. Je propose d'établir une relation entre le don des langues en tant qu'élément constitutif de la communauté des parlants et la dette de l'hospitalité langagière impliquant une forme de responsabilité envers les autres à la fois spécifique et exemplaire. Au don gratuit de la langue et des langues qui nous permet d'accéder au monde et de nous rencontrer avec autrui, en réalisant entièrement nous-mêmes, correspond la dette d'exercer et de développer notre humanité dans le langage et à travers le langage. This study reflects on the philosophy of translation in light of the heritage of Paul Ricœur. Language, languages and translation all belong to the process of constitution of sense and here translation is of particular importance for the reconstitution of the plurality of human discourse in its unity and opens the way to an ethics of linguistic hospitality and sociability. The gift of language and of languages introduces an element of gratuity to correct the contemporary obsession with the general commercialization of the life world and suggests a possible non-violent foundation for the social bond in the perspective of solidarity and sollicitude for concrete persons. I propose to establish a relation between the gift of languages as a constitutive element of the community of speakers a~<br>

Abstract: This article explores the influences of developments in philosophy on psychotherapy beginning with philosophers of the ancient Greek world. Psychotherapy owes much to ways of thinking employed by Greek philosophers attempting to understand the nature of the world and the relationships between humans, each other, and the world. The questions these philosophers asked, the answers they provided, and the methods they devised to address their questions remain pertinent to psychotherapists today. Greek philosophers engaged in dialectics and used reason to overcome the unreliability of the senses. Reason was deemed able to determine truth until philosophers, Nietzsche prominent among them, unseated reason from its throne. The article concludes with a discussion of themes and observations important to Nietzsche and postmodern philosophy, toward which Nietzsche's work pointed, and discusses their relevance to group psychotherapy.<br>

Publisher: Sage Publications<br>

Author(s): Wilson Henrik<br>
Abstract: A theory of the embodiment of action is proposed. Reflections on relations between human intentions, the human body and the notion of agency lead us to argue that phenomenological analysis is not sufficient for such a theory. Our consideration, that the most fundamental level of embodied agency is that of life itself, brings us to the philosophy of biology and the theory of the organism: briefly, certain parts of the natural environment are intrinsic to the constitution of organisms and, in their more sophisticated configuration, as agents. Action is embodied in the sense that certain physiological processes are internal in relation to it and play a constitutive role in its performance. The way in which environment, context and consciousness affect and constitute the nature of agency at personal and sub-personal levels is elaborated. We see that human agents perceive and act upon their world through a complex shifting between those levels. A summary of the ways in which the social sciences can be enriched by this more comprehensive view of human agency provides the basis of justification for claiming Actor-Network Theory (ANT), originally developed by sociologists studying science and technology, as a promising framework for the continuation of this reasoning.<br>

Abstract: In the twentieth century the phenomenon of the subjective body was integrated into ontology in philosophy, moving from Phenomenology to Existentialism. The rediscovery of the body and affect as a way of thinking also led contemporary cognitive science to the topic of the relationship between emotion and cognition, to the necessity of expanding the model of the mind and of experiencing emotions and physical sensation. The extension of the explanatory possibilities of a scholarly metalanguage into the area of the emotions and physical sensation is also important for the analysis of the acoustic aspect of lyric verse. In the acoustic flow of verse, the sounds of language have, apart from a phonemic function, their own sensuous (emotional) effect of the articulating body. In literary studies so far the acoustic flow has been interpreted only at the segmental level as a sequence of phonemes or sounds (for example in constructs of acoustic succession, phonetic instrumentation, or phonetic composition). At the suprasegmental level the acoustic flow must be conceived of as a sequence of syllables, a sequence of articulated phonations, the semantic movement of the phonemic flow. A syllable has no semantic value, but does have an experiential form, which influences motivation, behaviour, and experience. In addition to sonic and tonal modulation at the suprasegmental level, qualitative modulation, modulation of timbre, and the sequences of tones and of noise are also employed. In modelling the semantic movement of syllables in a phonemic flow the methodological approaches of experimental psychosemantics have been used. Connotational objectivization took place in three dimensions that were polarized on the basis of domestic and alien, light and darkness, activity and passivity, and research was conducted with a sample of 2,800 respondents. The analysis of the acoustic side of lyric verse would be incomplete if in addition to accentual rhythm and melody we did not also consider ~<br>

Abstract: The central point is that Schutz's idealization of reciprocity, the matching of subjective intentions in the public world of interactive behaviour, necessarily involves agents in an ironic process. This is largely because, since they are taking so much for granted, they cannot be aware of what is latent in the intentional perspectives of their social partners. In bringing out the pattern of the irony of inter subjective dialectic, the argument makes plain the importance of pretence as a vital concept in philosophy, sociology and hermeneutics. The article closes with a criticism of naive optimism among purveyors of dialectic, recommending a proper concern with the irreconcilables of tragedy.<br>

Author(s): BARTLETT Steven<br>
Abstract: An attempt is made to suggest an alternative approach to certain of the problems central to transcendental philosophy. In particular, it seems that the present understanding of pre-reflective awareness, of reflection, and of their interrelation can acquire a greater degree of rigour and clarity. To this end, attention is paid to preconditions of reference that are entailed by the phenomenological distinction between implicit experience and explicit reflection. L'auteur propose un accès alternatif à certains problèmes centraux de la philosophie transcendentale. En particulier, il paraît que la compréhension des idées de conscience préréflexive, de réflexion, et de Jeurs relations mutuelles, peut être précisée et élucidée. A cet effet, l'attention est attirée sur les préconditions de référence qui sont impliquées par la distinction phénoménologique entre l'expérience implicite et la réflexion explicite. Der Autor versucht, eine alternative Untersuchungsmethode zu bestimmten Hauptproblemen der transzendentalen Philosophie darzustellen. Insbesondere könnte das gegenwärtige Verständnis der vorreflexiven Bewusstheit, der Reflexion, und ihres Zusammenhangs strenger aufgeklärt werden. Zu diesem Zweck wird Aufmerksamkeit auf die Beziehungsvorbedingungen gerichtet, die in der phänomenologischen Unterscheidung zwischen impliziter Erfahrung und expliziter Reflexion miteinbegriffen sind.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell-Wiley Publishing<br>
Issue: i40115211<br>
Date: 1 1, 1985<br>
Author(s): Ricoeur Paul<br>
Abstract: Beginning with the paradoxical fact of the plurality of philosophical systems, the irrationality of this situation is examined, first, from the point of view of two solutions — the Hegelian solution and that which dissolves the paradox by denying that systems are exclusive of one another — judged to be inadequate; and then from the viewpoint of the contrast between the claims of genuine philosophy and its actual historical practice. The idea of system is examined from the perspective of Spinoza's Ethics and, finally, M. Gueroult's idéalisme intégral serves as a guide in exploring the result of subordinating the historical features of philosophical activity to its systematic features. Partant du fait paradoxal de la pluralité des systèmes philosophiques, l'auteur examine l'irrationalité de cette situation d'abord du point de vue de deux solutions — celle de Hegel et celle qui résoud le paradoxe en niant que les systèmes s'excluent mutuellement — solutions qui sont jugées inadéquates; puis du point de vue du contraste entre la véritable philosophie et sa pratique historique effective. L'idée de système est examinée dans la perspective de l'éthique de Spinoza et, enfin, l'idéalisme intégral de M. Gueroult sert de guide pour explorer les conséquences d'une subordination des aspects historiques de l'activité philosophique à ses aspects systématiques. Angesichts der paradoxen Situation der Pluralität von philosophischen Systemen wird die Irrationalität dieser Situation untersucht: zunächst vom Gesichtspunkt zweier Lösungen — nämlich der Lösung Hegels und derjenigen die darin besteht, die Unvereinbarkeit der Systeme zu leugnen —, die beide als inadäquat verworfen werden; dann von einem Standpunkt aus, der zwischen den Ansprüchen echter Philosophie und deren tatsächlicher historischer Praxis unterscheidet. Der Begriff des Systems wird aus der Perspektive von Spinozas Ethik untersucht und schliesslich wird M. Gueroults integraler Idealismus als Führer verwendet, um das Ergeb~<br>

Abstract: Le revival, qui se développa parmi les premiers disciples de Husserl, est un fait saisissant. Des documents, dont quelques uns sont encore inédits, servent à l'illustrer. Ce qui le fonde, c'est une étrange correspondance entre le projet de la première phénoménologie et les démarches subjectives de la conscience religieuse. La vraie philosophie, sainteté de la raison, n'est-elle pas aussi rectitude de la conscience jusqu'aux racines d'une expérience du sacré ou du divin ? The revival, which appeared among the first disciples of Ed. Husserl, is a well known fact. New documents are dedicated to illustrate such an event. They make clearer the existence of some mysterious bond linking the first phenomenological method and the basic disposition of natural religion. Genuine philosophy is indeed rightness of thought but also practical truth down to the very sources of a renovating feeling of the holy or the divine.<br>

Abstract: Dans le prolongement de la philosophie de Wittgenstein, les contributions récentes de Quine et de Searle invitent à modifier la manière de poser la question de la signification des termes théoriques : ne faudrait-il pas substituer à une préoccupation principalement ontologique (que désignent les termes théoriques ?) un souci plus praxéologique (quel rôle les termes théoriques tiennent-ils dans l'articulation des discours et des pratiques scientifiques ?). C'est ce renversement qu'il s'agit d'opérer ici. Starting from the philosophy of Wittgenstein, more recent works of Quine and Searle are presented. This reflexion leads to a modification of the way of considering the meaning of theoretical terms. It is suggested that, in place of a mainly ontological point of view (what is the reference of theoretical terms), a more praxeological point of view is more appropriate (which is the use of theoretical terms for the building of sciences and for scientific work). The goal of this article is to consider this change of perspective.<br>

Author(s): BOUILLARD Henri<br>
Abstract: En suivant le mouvement circulaire que dessine l'ouvrage fondamental d'Éric Weil, la « Logique de la Philosophie », on relève d'un même coup le penser qui s'y déploie et le rôle qu'y tiennent l'idée de Dieu, la foi biblique et le christianisme. On analyse d'abord la catégorie de Dieu, introduite dans le monde par l'attitude de la foi biblique. On note ensuite ce que devient l'idée de Dieu dans les catégories ultérieures. L'examen des catégories du sens et de la sagesse, constitutives de la philosophie, permet de voir comment le logicien recueille à sa manière le sur-être indicible de la tradition philosophique occidentale, sous la forme du sens présent, de l'éternité de la présence dans le temps de l'histoire. On manifeste enfin, à travers l'écart, quelques convergences entre cette philosophie séculière et la pensée d'un croyant. In the circular movement of the main work of Eric Weil, the « Logique de la Philosophie », we may notice both the development of the thought and the part played by the idea of God, the biblical faith and Christianity. The category of God, introduced by the behaviour of biblical faith, is analysed, and also how the idea of God appears in further categories. By examining categories of meaning and wisdom, proper to philosophy, we may see what means, for the logician, the ineffable over-being of the Western philosophical tradition, as a present meaning, as an eternal presence in historical time. At last appears, through the difference, some convergence between this secular philosophy and the thought of a believer.<br>

Author(s): CRAMPE-CASNABET Michèle<br>
Abstract: Ce double souci s'illustre, semble-t-il, dans la préoccupation constante de Kant de conjuguer les méthodes apagogique et ostensive, d'articuler les textes des Critiques et les écrits sur l'histoire. L'unification d'une genèse idéale et d'une genèse empirique estelle possible ? N'est-elle que le signe d'une exigence théorique impossible à remplir, d'un des derniers rêves de la métaphysique ou d'une conception autre qui s'annoncerait d'une systématique en philosophie ? Even before the « Copernician Revolution » Kant's philosophy aimed at building a system, an architechtonic which would both provide a structural analysis of mental powers and describe their genesis. Is such unification of an ideal genesis and an empirical one possible ? If not, are we faced with the last dream of metaphysics or with a new systematical era in philosophy ?<br>

Author(s): GRONDIN Jean<br>
Abstract: La pensée de Hans-Georg Gadamer veut jeter un pont entre les deux périodes de la philosophie heideggérienne en développant les conséquences herméneutiques de l'expérience du destin de l'être. Ce destin en vient à se réfléchir dans une « conscience du travail de l'histoire ». Par cette expression il est possible de donner une traduction adéquate du « wirkungsgeschichtliches Bewußtsein ». Le problème herméneutique de la vérité peut donc être posé sur le fondement de la finitude et de l'histoiricité de la compréhension. L'expérience de la vérité est maintenant comprise comme un πάθος qui s'inscrit dans la ποίησις, la créativité poétisante du travail de l'histoire. L'aspect créateur d'une vérité qui affirme sa finitude permet d'établir un lien entre les philosophies herméneutiques de Gadamer et de Paul Ricœur. Hans-Georg Gadamer's thinking aims at bridging the gap between the two stages of Heidegger's philosophy by developing the hermeneutical consequences entailed in the experience of the destiny of being. This destiny comes to a reflection of itself in a « consciousness of the work of history ». By this expression it is possible to give an adequate translation of the « wirkungsgeschichtliches Bewusstsein ». The hermeneutical problem of truth can thus be posed on the basis of the finitude and historicity of undersstanding. The experience of truth is now understood as a πάθος inscribed in the ποίησις, the « poetizing » creativity of the « work of history ». The creative aspect of a truth that affirms its own finitude enables one to establish a link between the hermeneutical philosophies of Gadamer and Paul Ricœur.<br>

Author(s): GREISCH JEAN<br>
Abstract: L'article dessine une ellipse à deux foyers que toute tentative dépenser la religion avec les moyens de la philosophie devra parcourir. Le premier pôle est occupé par le concept de « religion », le second par la pluralité irréductible des religions historiques. Selon qu'on se place dans l'optique de la « religion naturelle », ou dans celle de la « philosophie de la religion », cette ellipse revêtira une allure différente. Publiés il y a deux siècles, les Discours sur la religion de Friedrich Schleiermacher sont une des premières tentatives d'aborder cette ellipse dans l'optique d'une philosophie de la religion. L'originalité de cette approche prend encore plus de relief si on la compare avec la tentative kantienne de déployer les représentations, les croyances et les institutions religieuses sous l'égide de la question : « Que m'est-il permis d'espérer ? ». Autant les thèses que Schleiermacher défend dans le deuxième et le cinquième Discours gardent une grande actualité, autant son analyse du judaïsme atteste la difficulté de conjuguer un éloge de la pluralité avec une pensée de l'altérité. The article sketches a bifocal model which any attempt to give a philosophical meaning to the difference of religions must keep in mind. The first focus expresses the necessity of a concept of religion as such, the second deals with the irreducible difference and plurality of positive religions. This tension has a different shape if it is analysed through the pattern of « natural religion » or the pattern of philosophy of religion. Two centuries ago, Friedrich Schleiermacher's Reden über die Religion give us an excellent example of the second approach. Its originality can be higlightened, if we compare Schleiermacher's thesis in the second and the fith discourse, with Kant's attempt to develop a philosophical understanding of religious representations, beliefs and institutions in the light of the question : « What may hope ? ». Even if Schleiermacher's « breviary of romantic reli~<br>

Abstract: La rencontre entre la philosophie de Lukacs et la pensée ontologique de Nicolai Hartmann est un sujet rarement abordé dans Vhistoriographiephilosophique. Le contact avec les grands travaux ontologiques de Hartmann a joué pourtant un rôle décisif dans la genèse de l'Ontologie de l'être social, l'ouvrage qui a couronné le long parcours intellectuel et politique de Lukacs. Le texte se propose d'èclaircir l'affinité profonde qui se fait jour entre deux pensées que tout semblait séparer. Hartmann cultivait la philosophia perennis, élevée au-dessus des contingences socio-historiques, Lukacs, philosophe engagé dans les batailles du siècle, bâtissait une oeuvre saturée dépensée marxienne. Il existe néanmoins de significatifs traits d'union : la critique de la phénoménologie de Husserl, la critique des courants néo-positivistes et surtout de fortes réserves à l'égard de Heidegger. The encounter between Lukacs'philosophy and ontological thought of Nicolai Hartmann is a seldom tackled topic in philosophical historiography. The contact with Hartmann's great ontological works played a key role in the genesis of Ontology of Social Being, the work which has crowned the intellectual and political course of Lukacs. This paper aims to clear up the deep affinity between two historical thoughts that all seemed to separate. Hartmann cultivated a philosophia perennis above socio-historical contingences, while Lukacs, an engaged philosopher in the battles of the century, built a work which was saturated with Marxian thought. There are nevertheless significant links between them : a critique of Husserlian phenomenology, a critique of neo-positivist currents and, above all, strong rervation with regard to Heidegger.<br>

Abstract: Depuis le célèbre article de Merleau-Ponty, « De Mauss à Claude Lévi-Strauss », la manière dont on évalue le rapport entre ces deux auteurs détermine ou exprime autant d'interprétations historiques du structuralisme et de choix théoriques ou philosophiques quant aux sciences sociales. Cette filiation se voulait une critique: être fidèle à la découverte de Mauss, celle du caractère central de la réciprocité dans la vie sociale, imposait de dépasser la sociologie vers une sémiologie générale. Cet article s'efforce de montrer qu'il ne s'agit pas là, contrairement à l'interprétation subtile qu'en fit Merleau-Ponty, défaire de la réalité sociale un système de points de vue substituables ou de mouvements córreles de subjectivation, mais de montrer que ce sont les « valeurs » qui, du fait de leur nature, de leur ontologie, doivent nécessairement circuler entre plusieurs points de vue exclusifs et complémentaires. Il revisite la célèbre critique de Lévi-Strauss à Mauss sur l'explication de l'obligation de donner par une « force des choses », et replace l'apport de l'anthropologie structurale dans la philosophie de l'esprit contemporaine, là où elle se confronte aux questions ouvertes par la physique sur l'ontologie des objets quantiques. Since Merleau-Ponty's famous paper « De Mauss à Claude Lévi-Strauss », the way the link between these two authors has been construed determine or reveal as many historical interpretations of structuralism as philosophical and theoretical choices about social sciences. We know that this vindicated kinship was supposed to be critical: being faithful to Mauss's discovery, that of the centrality of reciprocity in social life, compelled us to overcome sociology in the direction of a general semiology. This paper, in opposition at Merleau-Ponty's subtle interpretation of this move, tries to show that it was not aimed at a redefinition of social reality as a system of substitutablepoints of view and correlated movements of subjectivation, but at t~<br>

Abstract: L'épistémologie d'Émile Meyerson vise à expliquer le réalisme spontané des physiciens en termes anthropologiques. À cette fin, le philosophe met à contribution les ressources des sciences humaines naissantes. Cependant, nous montrons qu'une telle philosophie des sciences y gagnerait à considérer d'autres aspects de l'expérience psychologique et sociale. Eugène Minkowski Arnaud Dandieu et Jacques Lacan — qui se réclament tous des travaux de Meyerson — nous permettent de percevoir une dimension insoupçonnée du principe épistémo logique d'identité, car l'identification des objets, décrite avec tant de précision par Meyerson, est toujours compliquée par l'identification du sujet de la science avec d'autres sujets au sein d'une culture donnée. Emile Meyerson's epistemology aims at explaining the spontaneous physicists' realism in anthropological terms. Consequently, the philosopher uses the resources of the newly born human sciences. Yet, we argue that such a philosophy of sciences would gain at considering other aspects of social and psychological experience. Eugène Minkowski, Arnaud Dandieu et Jacques Lacan — all indebted with Meyerson's work — enable us to perceive an unseen dimension of the epistemological principle of identity : for the identification of objects, so precisely described by Meyerson, is always complicated by the identification of the subject of science with other subjects inside a peculiar culture.<br>

Abstract: L'ontologie heideggérienne de l'être-pour-la-mort a souvent servi de référence négative à Paul Ricoeur. Il lui a très tôt opposé trois thèses qu'il n'aurait peut-être pas formulées s'il n'avait pas croisé la philosophie de Jaspers: a) « La naissance signifie plus que la mort » ; b) « la rencontre décisive avec la mort est la mort de l'être aimé » ; c) « la mortalité elle-même doit être pensée sub specie vitae et non sub specie mortis ». La première thèse conditionne les deux suivantes. Elle introduit une phénoménologie de l' « être-envie » qui en appelle de la vie reçue à la vie transmise. On objectera peut-être que la phénoménologie de l'être-en-vie suppose l'ontologie de l'être-pour-la-mort. Mais, même si c'était le cas, elle n'en transformerait pas moins profondément la signification. La compréhension de l'existence est affectée elle-même par les phénomènes de la vie reçue et transmise. C'est ce que veut dire cette expression: « exister vivant ». L'angoisse de la fin n'annule pas la joie des commencements. Peut-être même reçoit-elle de celle-ci son sens. Paul Ricoeur has often referred to Heidegger's ontology of being-towards-death to oppose it. He early set against it three thesis that he might have formulated differently had he not studied Jasper's philosophy : a) « birth means more than death » ; b) « the decisive encounter with death is the death of the loved one » ; c) « mortality itself must be thought sub specie vitae, not sub specie mortis ». From the first thesis, can be inferred the two others. It brings in a phenomenology of being-alive. One may raise the objection that the phenomenology of being-alive presupposes the ontology of being-towards-death. But even so it would be necessarily transform its meaning. The understanding of existence is itself affected by the phenomena of life as given and received. Such is the meaning of the phrase: « existing alive ». The distress of the end never cancels the joy of the beginnings. It may even get its sense from~<br>

Abstract: La critique phénoménologique de la métaphysique a opposé « l'intuition » à la « représentation », et le débat philosophique contemporain une phénoménologie « minimaliste » à une phénoménologie « maximaliste ». Face à ces alternatives, l'approfondissement weilien de l'expérience n'oppose ni la présence et l'absence, ni le fini et l'absolu, mais cherche à éprouver et penser le lien qui les unit, à partir de la structure trinitaire du don de l'être. À distance d'une médiation extériorisante comme d'une immanence pure, le processus de révélation n'est jamais négateur du mystère, mais en manifeste au contraire la profondeur. Ainsi, depuis la perception jusqu'à l'amour surnaturel, « évidence » et « mystère » vont toujours de pair, ce qui permet de ne rejeter aucun des niveaux de l'être et de l'expérience. The phenomenological critique of metaphysics opposed intuition and representation as contemporary debates in philosophy opposed minimalist and maximalist phenomenologies. Confronted with these alternatives the Weilean thought of experience neither opposes presence and absence, nor finite and absolute, but it tries to verify and think what unites them - based on the Trinitarian structure of the giving of being. Standing apart from exteriorizing mediation as from pure immanence, the revelation process never makes ineffective the mystery but expresses its depth. Thus, from perception to supernatural love, 'obviousness' and 'mystery' go together, which allows not to reject any levels of being and experience.<br>

Abstract: Le langage de la poésie appelle une attention particulière, car son ètrangetè même témoigne d'un rapport au réel fort différent des pratiques de la langue, dans la vie quotidienne ou dans le travail scientifique. En s'aidant de la référence au Vide et aux perspectives puisées dans la tradition chinoise, Maldiney développe cette philosophie propre à la poésie à partir des oeuvres d'André du Bouchet et de Francis Ponge. Son analyse donne ainsi à l'art poétique une responsabilité rarement mise en valeur par rapport au réel: un rapport à la fois d'intimité et de proximité. The language of poetry calls for special attention, since its strangeness itself verifies a very different way to relate to real for the practices of language — in everyday life or in the scientific work. With the help of reference to Emptiness and to perspectives from Chinese tradition, Maldiney develops that philosophy peculiar to poetry from the works of André du Bouchet and Francis Ponge. Thus, his analysis gives a rarely highlighted responsibility to poetic art regarding the real: both an intimate and a close relationship.<br>

Abstract: On associe généralement la figure de Satan à une signification indigente ou mesquine. Dans la Philosophie de la révélation, Schelling tente au contraire d'en donner une interprétation différente, selon laquelle la « mauvaiseté positive » de Satan n'est pas seulement assumée, mais également revalorisée. Cependant, le rôle de Satan demeure ambigu, incarnant à la fois le tentateur universel et le maillon nécessaire à la révélation de Dieu lui-même. Dans cette étude, il s'agit donc de montrer à la fois la nature amphibolique du Diable, et de rendre compte des multiples endossements qu'il recouvre. Une tâche qui implique précisément la mise en évidence du rôle incontournable de Satan dans la victoire finale du bien, et qui se manifeste, en termes schellingiens, par l'incompatibilité de l'homme avec le feu dévorant du principe de lumière, laquelle nécessite un principe obscur qui hâte la séparation, pressent le mal et le provoque. One usually associates the figure of Satan with an impoverished, insufficient signification. On the contrary, in the Philosophy of Revelation Schelling tries to give a different interpretation, according to which Satan's potential for evil is not only accepted but embraced and given a positive valence, postulating a sort of "positivity of evil". However, Satan's role remains ambiguous, since he represents both the universal tempter and a necessary link in the process that reveals God's presence in the world. In this paper, I want to emphasize the Devil's twofold nature and to explore his multiple forms. This highlights Satan's necessary role in the final triumph of good, and how this role appears, in Schellingian terms, through the human inability to sound the depths of the consuming fire of divine light, which necessitates the existence of a dark principle that entails a separation, foreknows evil and thereby creates it.<br>

Abstract: Le rapport de l'œuvre de Paul Ricœur à la modernité ne va pas de soi. Imprégnée profondément par le testament judéo-chrétien, méfiante à l'égard des ruptures brutales, soucieuse d'incarner le cogito dans l'existence, sa philosophie pourrait aisément s'inscrire dans une tendance néo-traditionaliste. Cette dimension anti-moderne se renforce en raison de la place majeure que la pensée de Ricœur accorde aux mouvances post-modernes, qu'elles soient d'inspiration vitaliste, structuraliste ou post-structuraliste. Pourtant, jamais le philosophe n'a abandonné ni le projet émancipateur, ni la conquête reflexive du cogito portés par la modernité. La dialectique subtile et originale dans son œuvre de ces trois paradigmes philosophiques se traduit donc sous la forme d'un modernisme paradoxal qui se comprend mieux lorsqu'on le replace dans le cadre d'un réformisme moral et politique, à l'opposé aussi bien d'un éloge de la tradition que des emportements révolutionnaires. The links Paul Ricœur's works maintain with modernity cannot be taken for granted. Being deeply immersed in the Judeo-Christian Legacy, wary of abrupt brenks, concerned about embodying the Cogito in existence, his philosophy could be easily associated with a neo-traditionalist trend. This anti-modern dimension is strengthened because of the chief place that Ricœur attaches in his philosophy to the post-modern ways of thinking, whatever inspiration they come from: vitalist, structuralist or post-structuralist. However, the philosopher abandoned neither the emancipatory project, nor the reflexive practice of the Cogito carried by modernity. Therefore, in his works, the subtle and original dialectics of these three philosophical paradigms expresses itself in the way of a paradoxical modernism which can be better understood when it is considered within a political and ethical reformism. Such a point of view is opposed to a praise of tradition as well as to revolutionary outbursts.<br>

Abstract: Selon la philosophie moderne la pensée est une production de la subjectivité, la volonté est une auto-détermination et le temps est une auto-affection. Kierkegaard offre une autre compréhension de la vie volontaire en envisageant une volonté brisée par le prochain, par le temps et par Dieu. La patience n'est pas pour Kierkegaard un accident de notre caractère, mais la condition pour devenir une personne. Cela suppose de laisser de côté toute compréhension purement psychologique de la patience. La vraie persévérance s'oppose totalement à l'obsession de se blinder par rapport au monde. Entre l'endurance stoïcienne et la patience chrétienne comme patience dans l'espérance il n'y a pas d'essence commune. Kierkegaard montre que la patience de l'amour est une passivité qui est la voie du salut. For modem philosophy meaning is a product of subjectivity, will is a self-determination, and time is a self-affection. Kierkegaard gives us another meaning for a voluntary life by considering desire that is broken by the will of another man, time and God. Patience is not for Kierkegaard an accident of character but is the condition to becoming a person. It is necessary to ignore a purely psychological understanding of patience. True perseverance is radically opposed to an obsessive existence blinded to the world. Between the stoic conception of endurance and Christian patience there is no common essence. For Kierkegaard, the patience of love is a form of passivity that can save Mankind.<br>

Abstract: The thesis of this essay is that historical interpretation of the New Testament is necessary to provide information for setting the parameters of valid readings of the New Testament. Such an interpretation serves the purpose of alienation between reader and text and enables the interpreter to ask critical questions about the communicability and relevance of these texts. The nature of the New Testament necessitates historical interpretation. Current historico-critical interpretation of the New Testament is discussed and evaluated with a view to possibilities and limitations in the light of current developments in literary science, history of philosophy and historiography.<br>

Abstract: Objectivistic philosophy and reductionist theories have contributed to a malaise in society and the church. On the one hand, the fruits of modernity and deconstructive postmodernism have led to a situtation where the observable and the empirical are considered the true index of reality. There is a loss of purpose and meaning in life. The church finds itself in a situation of crisis, and needs to admit its own shortcomings in order to be a leaven for society. At the same time, there is an 'outbreak' of interest in issues of spirituality and mysticism throughout the world as the end of the millennium draws near. Mysticism, particularly scriptural mysticism, is an ecclesial charism, and when understood and appropriated can be a source of renewal for the church and society.<br>

Article Title: LA LÉGITIMITÉ N'EXISTE PAS ÉLÉMENTS POUR UNE THÉORIE DES INSTITUTIONS<br>
Publisher: L'Harmattan<br>
Issue: i40121038<br>
Date: 1 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Lordon Frédéric<br>
Abstract: Ce texte montre combien floues, voire aporétiques, sont en fait les définitions d'une catégorie, la "légitimité", dont les usages ne cessent pourtant de s'élargir. Il montre également (surtout) combien cette imprécision voue la plupart du temps la "légitimité" à fonctionner dans un registre humaniste-théorique et moral. Contre cette dérive de l'analyse des institutions, le texte, en s'appuyant sur la philosophie de Spinoza, propose d'abandonner cette qualité occulte de "légitimité" et que les institutions ne survivent et n'opèrent que parce qu'elles sont soutenues par une configuration adéquate de puissances et d'affects. This text shows how fuzzy and even aporetic the notion of "legitimacy" is, despite its more and more widespread uses. It also shows how the notion mostly pertains to a theoreticalhumanistic and moral tone. Against this drift of institutional analysis, and relying on Spinoza's philosophy, the text suggests to drop down legitimacy as an occult quality, and rather states that institutions only persevere and work because they lean on a convenient configuration of powers and affects.<br>

Article Title: PHENOMENOLOGIE DU TRAVAIL, ONTOLOGIE DE LA VIE ET CRITIQUE RADICALE DU CAPITALISME REFLEXIONS A PROPOS DU STATUT DE L'INTERPRETATION DE MARX PAR MICHEL HENRY<br>
Publisher: L'Harmattan<br>
Issue: i40121041<br>
Date: 1 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Sobel Richard<br>
Abstract: En liant, à partir d'une approche phénoménologique, travail, individu et vie, Michel Henry propose un magistral éclairage de toute l'oeuvre de Marx en tant qu'elle est essentiellement une critique de l'économie et une ontologie sociale. La radicalité d'une telle philosophie économique n'est que très peu soulignée par la pensée marxiste contemporaine, qui n'a sans doute pas donné à l'interprétation Michel Henry l'importance qui est la sienne. Pour autant, sa notion d'individus vivants, ainsi hypostasiés de leurs conditions objectives d'existence, conduit Michel Henry à déformer l'anthropologie de Marx et à en affaiblir la dimension politique. The aim of this article is to show the full critical power of the subjective philosophy of living-labour which Michel Henry develops out of Marx. The radicality of such an economic philosophy was only underlined very little by the contemporary thought Marxist which, one knows it, does not give to the interpretation of Michel Henry the major importance which should be his. For all that, his notion of alive individuals, so taked out from their objective conditions of existence, leads Michel Henry to deform the anthropology of Marx and to weaken the political dimension.<br>

Abstract: Cet article rappelle les ambitions et les enjeux théoriques qui ont conduit Sen à penser une nouvelle conception de l'avantage individuel et des évaluations sociales. Souvent perçue comme relevant de la philosophie morale, l'approche par les capabilités (AC) apparaît comme l'œuvre d'un théoricien du choix social dont l'éclectisme des recherches a permis d'aboutir à une approche du choix social plus ouverte et moins mécanique que celle proposée par Arrow en 1950. Grâce à une concentration nouvelle sur l'espace des potentiels et des capacités individuels et un glissement essentiel du rationnel vers le raisonnable, l'AC offre un cadre renouvelé pour l'économie normative. This article recalls the ambitions and theoretical issues that led Sen to develop a new conception of individual advantage and social evaluation. This Capability Approach (CA) is often regarded as moral philosophy. However, it arose from the work of a social choice theorist, whose eclecticism allowed a social choice approach to be formulated, which is more open and less mechanistic than that proposed by Arrow (1950). Due to its new focus on the scope of individual potential and capacities, and a substantial shift from rationality to reason, Sens CA provides a renewed theoretical framework for normative economics.<br>

Publisher: Presses de la Fondation Nationale des Sciences Politiques<br>
Issue: i40121469<br>
Date: 10 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): DELANNOI GIL<br>
Abstract: Aristote accorde une importance telle à la prudence qu'elle est le véritable lien de la politique et de l'éthique à travers toute sa philosophie de l'action. Pourtant, et à cause de cette importance, il ne peut guère la définir. Il ne la cerne pas par approximation comme une vertu morale ni par classification comme un régime politique. La prudence est la vertu intellectuelle, le concept imposé par le fait que la politique et l'éthique ne sont jamais entièrement liées et jamais entièrement déliées. La prudence machiavélienne radicalise cet enseignement; elle ne le rompt pas : là où la prudence aristotélicienne indique que politique et éthique ne peuvent être très séparées, l'habileté machiavélienne indique qu'elles ne peuvent être très liées. Ce n'est qu'avec Hobbes qu'on est en présence de la construction systématique d'une théorie dans laquelle la politique l'emporte entièrement sur l'éthique. Kant renverse cette priorité au seul profit de l'éthique. La recherche aristotélicienne fait finalement figure de moins mauvaise solution. Elle sort l'éthique du purisme et la politique de la pure force. En tout cas, sans référence à une relation entre la politique et l'éthique, la recherche de la prudence est peu probable. La croyance récente en la toute-puissance de l'histoire l'a montré. The importance which Aristotle sets on prudence makes it the real link between politics and ethics throughout his whole philosophy of action. Nevertheless, and because of this importance, he cannot define it. He does not approach it through approximation, as a moral virtue, nor by classification, as a political regime. Prudence is the intellectual virtue, the concept imposed by the fact that politics and ethics are never either entirely linked or entirely separate. Machiavellian prudence radicalizes this teaching, but does not upset it : whereas Aristotelian prudence indicates that politics and ethics cannot be widely separate, Machiavellian cunning indicates that they cannot be very close~<br>

Abstract: Les apports du « tournant historique de la science politique » (Y. Déloye) en France sont interrogés en fonction des modèles d'historicité sous-jacents à travers dix-huit ouvrages publiés au cours des quinze dernières années. Les acquis de la socio-histoire et de la sociologie historique sont mis en valeur, puis confrontés à l'approche défendue par Y. Schemeil. Le modèle linéaire-évolutionniste attaché à la démarche génétique est questionné depuis les travaux de M. Bloch, de M. Foucault ou de M. Dobry. Un élargissement pluraliste des modèles d'historicité est alors esquissé en puisant dans la philosophie de W. Benjamin comme dans les recherches d'E. P. Thompson, d'A. O. Hirschman ou de J.-C. Kaufmann. Le cadre épistémologique est celui du pluralisme théorique sans relativisme, défendu par J.-C. Passeron. The contributions of the « political science historical turning » (Y. Déloye) in France are questioned from the implicit historicity models through eighteen books published the last fifteen years. The socio-history and the historical sociology winnings are introduced and then confronted with Y. Schemeil's approach. The linear-evolutionist model attached to the genetic approach is questioned since the works of M. Bloch, M. Foucault or M. Dobry. A pluralistic extension of the historicity models is then sketched by taking from the W. Benjamin's philosophy as from the E. P. Thompson's, A. O. Hirschman's or J.-C. Kaufmann's researches. The epistemological frame is the one of the theoretical pluralism without relativism defended by J.-C. Passeron.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo procura alcançar uma reflexão conceptual na qual, a Filosofia Hermenêutica pode ser instituída como fundamento da Filosofía do Direito e do fenómeno jurídico e, consequentemente, como uma base para futuros desenvolvimentos da actual Filosofia Hermenêutica do Direito, de forma a poder ser alternativa ao Direito Natural e ao Positivismo Legal. Por conseguinte, um conceito chave a ser abordado é o de "ser com", visto que a situação do Mundo promove o surgimento do Direito no seu encontro com outro "ser com". Assim, a relação jurídica ficaria sustentada pela hermenêutica, a partir do conceito central de significado, enquanto profundidade e plenitude do ser jurídico, no qual a sua possibilidade de valorização é estabelecida como sentido de justiça. Assim, a Filosofia Hermenêutica do Direito providenciaria um retorno à ética, à luz do que juridicamente lhe diz respeito, de significados abertos à renovação, permitindo uma maneira de mudar a ideia estática de Filosofia do Direito, porque a justificação não assenta nos conteúdos morais, mas no sentido do ser. This article seeks to achieve a conceptual reflection in which Hermeneutical Philosophy can be established as a foundation for Philosophy of Law and the legal phenomenon, and, thus, as a ground for future developments in the current Hermeneutics Philosophy of Law that can be alternative to Natural Law and Legal Positivism, giving answers to common problems. Consequently, a key concept to be addressed in this article is "be with", since the situation in the world fosters the emergence of Law in its encounter with another "be with". Thus, the legal relationship would be sustained by hermeneutics, from the central concept of meaning as deepness and fullness of juridical being, in which m the possibility of its valuation is established as a sense of justice. So, the Hermeneutics Philosophy of Law would provide a return to ethics, in view of what juridically concerns it, with meanings opened to renovation, allowi~<br>

Abstract: Since 1990, two eminent French-speaking sinologists, François Jullien and Jean François Billeter, have been engaged in a debate on the principles of comparative philosophy and sinology. The debate has been developed in several books and articles and attracted the attention of a relatively broad public as well as of a wide range of French intellectuals. The arguments with regard to an older discussion on the difference between philology and philosophy are evaluated here, and conclusions are drawn concerning the present status of comparative philosophy in academia.<br>

Article Title: Fragments of a Poetic of Gardens<br>
Publisher: The University of Wisconsin Press<br>
Issue: i40132217<br>
Date: 1 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Conan Michel<br>
Abstract: The renewal of a dialog between landscape design and garden history demands a renewal of the questions and methods of garden history. This essay studies how garden reception and garden creation interact. It considers three main issues: first, it explores the domain of cultural expectations framing the engagement with a garden shared by users and creators at a given time—the poetical texture of gardens; second, the role of garden creation in exploiting, expanding or subverting this shared frame of expectations; and third, it proposes an approach—garden pragmatic—to study the broader interactions between garden creation and reception on the one hand, and social and cultural change on the other. The question of intersubjectivity—how do we share our sense and experiences of the world with others, and how do we transform them—is at the root of all the little stories—the fragments of a poetic of gardens—that propose new directions for garden history. Many of these stories have been presented during the last 15 years at symposia at Dumbarton Oaks where the author is presently the director of Garden and Landscape Studies. The general philosophy however had never been presented until the Fall 2004 when he published his "Essais de Poétique des Jardins." They were never made explicit at Dumbarton Oaks where each story only played its part in the theme of the symposium. Yet the whole course of ideas presented here results from these many exchanges with other scholars. This is why many footnotes make explicit references to their works. So, following the lead offered by this text or choosing a personal route, each reader may access many different voices that make garden history at present into a lively resource for pondering about the role of landscape creation in a multicultural world. These fragments of history are written to stimulate the designer's imagination, not to outline the course landscape design should follow.<br>

Date: 1 1, 2012<br>

Abstract: This essay is a contribution towards a more systematic consideration of the relation between recognition and autonomy in literary and cultural studies. The readings presented here rest on two premises: First, I assume that literary texts negotiate recognition in ways different from and not completely accessible to philosophy and the social sciences; and second, that the individualistic language of liberalism, which is preoccupied with autonomy and dependence, changes depending on how recognition is negotiated. Both Edward P. Jones's neo-slave narrative The Known World and Richard Powers's novel of ideas The Echo Maker stage historically and socially specific convergences of autonomy and dependence in their depictions of precarious subjectivity. The Known World, situated in the mid-nineteenth-century slave South, shows how the liberal ideal of self-mastery is implicitly linked to the mastery of others as chattel slaves. The Echo Maker, set in the early twenty-first-century Midwest, stages another form of precariousness that in some ways answers the questions of submission and self-mastery raised in the other novel. It suggests an at once more democratic and more literary model of individuality that does not depend on ownership so much as on the logic of storytelling. The novels project distinct diegetic worlds and rely on divergent generic patterns; in exploring the logics of possessive individualism and a more democratic model of storytelling respectively, they offer contingent concepts of agency that are dependent for their private and public stabilizations on very different forms of recognition of the other.<br>

Abstract: Au lieu de soi marque un Haut Lieu du soi. Dans cette perspective, la hauteur du sujet s'acquiert par la verticalité (transcendance), et non pas uniquement par l'horizontalité (immanence). Interrogeant l'ambition d'une approche de saint Augustin du point de vue de saint Augustin lui-même, on montrera d'abord le mérite d'un tel renouvellement dans le cadre de la philosophie comme telle : la question de l'homme, le poids du soi, et le statut de l'èros. Une noble « disputatio théologique et phénoménologique » cependant naîtra dans la confrontation avec d'autres ouvrages (en particulier Dieu, la chair et l'autre. D'Irénée à Duns Scot [PUF, « Épiméthée » , 2008]) : doit-on nécessairement « dépasser » la métaphysique dans un tiers ordre, ou ne convient-il pas plutôt de la « transformer de l'intérieur » dans le geste que semble avoir accompli le Docteur d'Hippone lui-même ? Il en va ici du statut de la philosophie dans son rapport ci la métaphysique et à la théologie, mais aussi de la possibilité d'une « nouvelle pratique phénoménologique de la philosophie médiévale », pour aujourd'hui comme pour demain. In Place of the Self marks what we might call a « high point of the self ». From this exalted perspective the measure of the subject is taken in its verticality (transcendence) and not simply its horizontality (immanence). Jean-Luc Marion approaches St. Augustine from the point of view of St. Augustine himself, and in this article I show first the merit of such an approach within a philosophical framework, its relevance to topics such as the question of man, the burden of the self and the status of eros. A significant « theological and phenomenological disputatio » does, however, arise when In Place of the Self is put up against other works (in particular against God, the Flesh and the Other : from Irenaeus to Duns Scotus [PUF, « Épiméthée » , 2008]).

Author(s): Muscari Paul G.<br>
Abstract: What is the future of the poetic figures in a technological and scientific world where a more restricted view appears to be emerging as to what is adequate and relevant about metaphors? What part should the radical trope play in a script where the figures that are heralded are usually those that are perceived as having practical importance, i. e., those that fill in the gaps of existing knowledge? It will be the intent of this paper to show that the current preoccupation of much of philosophy and psychology with structural explanation and cognitive theory has certainly contributed to establishing a coordinated and unified theory of metaphors, but left unto itself such a concern is severely limited and does not adequately explain the full potential of metaphorical expressions.<br>

Abstract: Se pretende exponer un acercamiento preliminar, mediante las figuras de Aristóteles y Tomás de Aquino, a la metodología que utiliza el crítico literario George Steiner en su lectura asidua de filosofia. Aquino es utilizado como contrapunto del filósofo griego en dos sentidos. Por un lado, se actualiza el potencial estético de su teología bajo el influjo, entre otros, de Gilson y Maritain; mientras que, por otro, el fundamento tomista de la epifania joyceana remite a una conexión entre el Doctor Angélico y Dante Alighieri. El alcance epistemológico de la imitación tomista y las condiciones del acto de la creación poética, incluyendo la relación entre potencia y acto y la procesión entre no-ser y ser, hacen difïcil definir adecuadamente los conceptos en Steiner. El «realismo» steineriano, asociado a su apuesta por la trascendencia del significado, debe ser repensado, desde su dimensión estética, en conflictiva sintonia con una postmodernidad considerada como época epilogal. A preliminary approach to George Steiner's methodology of reading philosophy is attempted through the figures of Aristotle and Thomas of Aquinas. Aquinas is used as the counterpoint of the Greek philosopher in a double way. On the one hand, the aesthetic force of his theology is raised under the influence of Gilson and Maritain, among others; on the other hand, the James Joyces's epiphany is referred to a connection between the Doctor Angelico and Dante Alighieri. The epistemological reach of thomistic imitation and the conditions of the act of the poetical creation, make the concepts in Steiner difficult to be defined accurately. The steinerian «realism», based on the wager on the transcendence of meaning, must be rethought aesthetically, as attuned to a postmodernist epoch of the epilogue.<br>

Abstract: L'auteur examine la thèse du théologien Bernard Hort, « Contingence et intériorité », consacrée à l'œuvre philosophique de Pierre Thévenaz. Après avoir reconnu la légitimité d'une interprétation théologique de la philosophie thévenazienne, D. Müller s'interroge sur l'hypothèse des deux Thévenaz, sur le durcissement hénologique imputé au deuxième Thévenaz et sur la compréhension du protestantisme que B. Hort lui oppose. The article examines the thesis of Bernard Hort, "Contingency and inferiority"', given over to the philosophy of P. Thévenaz. While recognizing the legitimacy of a theological interpretation of Thévenaz, Müller questions the hypothesis of the two Thévenaz', the henological hardening attributed to the second Thévenaz and the understanding of Protestantism with which Hort opposes Thévenaz.<br>

Abstract: L'idée qu'on se fait généralement, en philosophie de l'action, de la structure physique de l'agir, n'est-elle pas trop schématique? Si l'intentionnalité semble un élément incontournable de la définition de l'agir, n'est-ce pas parce qu'on n'attribue qu'un sens anémique à la notion de mouvement corporel? Il se peut que cette notion, analysée de façon adéquate, se révèle assez vigoureuse pour fonder à elle seule la notion d'agir. Is it not the case that in the philosophy of action we generally have a highly simplified idea of the physical structure of action? Does not defining action in terms of an intention seem unavoidable simply because we give such an anemic meaning to the notion of bodily movement? But if this notion were adequately analyzed, it would perhaps prove sufficient as a basis for the concept of action.<br>

Issue: i40182141<br>

Abstract: Certains travaux récents de Paul Ricœur montrent un déplacement d'accent : au lieu d'une interrogation sur la fragilité humaine comme dans la Philosophie de la volonté, Ricœur se préoccupe davantage aujourd'hui de la vie, de la natalité, du désir d'accomplissement. Cette dette aristotélicienne trahit-elle l'inspiration que le philosophe avait trouvée dans la tradition biblique ? Même si certains thèmes s'articulent de manière inédite, cet article souligne que la thèse reste inchangée : c'est bien le sujet qu'il faut parvenir à saisir, à la fois dans sa capacité et dans sa fragilité. La référence à Aristote invite alors à jeter un nouveau pont entre la philosophie et la théologie. Certain recent works of Paul Ricoeur show a transition: in the place of human frailty, as in the philosophy of will, Ricœur is more and more occupied today by life, birth, and the desire of accomplishment. Does this Aristotelian debt betray an inspiration that the philosopher had found in Biblical tradition? Even if certain themes are articulated in a new way, the article shows that the same thesis remains: it is still the subject which one must grasp, both in its capacity as in its frailty. So the reference to Aristotle is an invitation to see a new bridge between philosophy and theology.<br>

Abstract: En se servant de la métaphore comme fil conducteur, le présent article ambitionne d'explorer l'un ou l'autre rapport que l'on peut déceler entre le discours de la science et celui du philosophe. Mais au lieu d'opérer empiriquement, l'analyse s'efforce de se situer sur un plan méta-conceptuel. Pour cela, elle se fonde sur une présentation des deux perspectives théoriques essentielles suivant lesquelles est conçue la métaphore : la perspective extensionnelle et la perspective intensionnelle. Alors que l'usage conventionnel et référentiel de la métaphore s'accorde avec la première perspective, l'usage innovant s'accorde plutôt avec la seconde. Envisagée comme une connaissance sans objet, la philosophie s'accommode parfaitement du modèle intensionnel de la métaphore. Celui-ci rend compte, en effet, non seulement des métaphores avérées mais aussi des concepts philosophiques eux-mêmes. En revanche, le modèle extensionnel convient apparemment mieux au discours scientifique qui porte en principe sur un objet. Il soulève néanmoins des difficultés importantes qui conduisent à réviser une approche par trop rationnelle de la science. Taking the metaphor as a vital lead, this article explores the various links between scientific and philosophical discourse. But rather than be empirical, this analysis is situated on a meta-conceptual level. As such, it offers two essential theoretical perspectives of the metaphor : the extensional and the intensional. While the usual and referential convention of the metaphor agrees with the first perspective, innovative use agrees rather with the second. As non-objective knowledge, philosophy perfectly accommodates the intensional model of metaphor, which, in effect, takes into account not only proven metaphors but also philosophcial concepts themselves. On the other hand, the extensional model is better suited to scientific discourse, which, in principle, is objective. The article nevertheless points out important difficulties that call for a r~<br>

Abstract: Le projet de Pierre Thévenaz d'une «philosophie sans absolu» est le fruit de la rencontre entre la raison philosophique et l'expérience-choc de l'annonce chrétienne, qui restitue à l'humain sa dimension uniquement et radicalement humaine. Le monde d'ici-bas devient ainsi le lieu de l'homme dans son histori cité. La méthode de cette conversion à l'en deçà est celle d'une radicalisation de la philosophie reflexive. Si désormais «la raison c'est l'homme», la tâche d'une «philosophie sans absolu» devient l'herméneutique de la condition humaine. P. Thévenaz' project for a "philosophy without an absolute" is the fruit of the meeting of philosophical Reason with the shock-experience of the Christian message which restored to humankind its unique and radically human dimension. The earthly world thus becomes the place of humankind in its historicity. The method of converting to this side is a radicalisation of reflexive philosophy. If henceforth "reason is mankind", then the work of a "philosophy without an absolute" becomes the hermeneutics of the human condition.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricœur construit la philosophie comme une hétérotopie, en la soumettant à l'ordre, juridique et théologique, d'un «aveu». En soustrayant la pensée à la compétence première de la philosophie pour l'accorder à l'ordre d'un récit, Ricoeur fait de l'exercice de la philosophie une «empirique de la volonté serve». Ce primat donné à un ordre de médiation, par le biais d'un récit, dépouille ainsi la philosophie de toute tâche inaugurale. Dans ses Valences of the Dialectic, le philosophe américain Jameson est revenu de façon critique sur ce montage, soulignant le paradoxe qui oblige Ricœur à ôter la pensée du temps des tâches premières de la phénoménologie. Cet article vise à en exposer les conséquences (notamment le basculement vers une herméneutique), pour interroger les effets théologico-politiques de ce vaste projet. Paul Ricoeur constructs philosophy as a heterotopia, in subjecting it in the order of a juridical and theological «confession». By subtracting thought from the primordial competency of philosophy in order to link it to a story, Ricoeur displays the primacy of a third party. In his Valences of the Dialectic, the American philosopher Jameson has reviewed this assemblage, underlining the paradox which thus obliges Ricoeur to pull out an idea from the time of the first tasks of phenomenology. This article tries to lay out the consequences (notably the swinging towards hermeneutics), so as to question the theological-political effects of this vast project.<br>

Abstract: Où situer le danger ? Qui court un risque et qui le fait courir à qui ? Il s'agit de présenter deux analyses inverses de la notion de danger. Leur originalité tient au fait qu'il ne semble pas y avoir pour elles d'équité ou de réciprocité dans le danger: la menace vient exclusivement d'un côté de la relation. Pour Hegel, c'est le moi qui est l'objet de menaces. L'auteur de ces menaces est toujours l'autre, celui que je ne suis pas, et c'est précisément son altérité qui en fait une puissance dont je peux craindre la violence. C'est pourquoi la vérité – et la sécurité – se trouve toujours du côté de la réduction de la transcendance de l'autre. Pour cette raison, Levinas affirme qu'il n'y a pas d'autre dans la philosophie de Hegel, absence qu'il analyse justement comme un danger: c'est l'autre qui court un risque, et la menace vient de moi. La menace n'émane plus de l'étrangeté de l'autre, mais au contraire de la suppression de cette étrangeté. Ce qu'il est à craindre est, pour Hegel, que l'autre mette la main sur moi, et, pour Levinas, que je mette la main sur l'autre. Where is the danger? Who is at risk and who is a menace to whom? This article presents two opposite analyses of the notion of danger. Their originality lies in the fact that there seems to be no fairness or reciprocity in danger: the threat comes exclusively from one side of the relationship. For Hegel, oneself is always the object of threats. The source of these threats is always the other person, the one I am not, and it is precisely the other's alterity which is a force whose violence I should fear. That is why truth - and security – are always to be found in reducing the transcendence of the other. For this reason, Levinas claims that there is not an other in the philosophy of Hegel, an absence which he analyses as a danger; it's the other who is at risk, and the threat comes from me. The threat no longer emanates from the strangeness of the other, but, on the contrary, from the suppression of this ~<br>

Abstract: Tout au long de son œuvre, Henri Bergson s'est penché sur le temps du vécu qu'il nomme «durée», une notion qu'il a, des années durant, cherché à cerner. Du point de vue de l'énonciation de sa pensée surgit une difficulté: comment mettre des mots sur une notion qui a pour caractéristique d'échapper aux schèmes de penser habituels, de se soustraire aux filets du logos ? Si, comme il le souligne, «[l] a pensée demeure incommensurable avec le langage», il se doit d'ouvrir une nouvelle voie pour formuler malgré tout sa pensée en faisant appel à des ressources langagières proprement inhabituelles, voire étrangères à la philosophie. Pour dire le temps, le philosophe se doit de briser les cadres de la pensée conceptuelle. Ainsi, l'emploi de la métaphore, habituellement ressource du langage poétique, devient sous la plume du philosophe français un outil privilégié du philosopher, transcendant les concepts pour atteindre qu'il nomme l'intuition de la durée immanente à chacun de nous. In all his writings, Henri Bergson sought to define worked the notion of time lived, which he called duration. In the enunciation of his thought, emerges a difficulty: how to put words to a notion which characteristically escapes habitual schemas of thought and logical traps? If, as he claims, «thought remains immeasurable by language», we need, nevertheless, a new way to formulate his thought by calling upon unusual or even un-philosophical linguistic resources. In order to speak of time, the philosopher must expand the framework of conceptual thought. Thus, the use of metaphor, normally a poetical resource, becomes in the writing of the French philosopher an excellent tool for philosophy, going beyond the concepts in order to reach what he calls the immanent intuition of duration which each one of us has.<br>

Abstract: Trois intentions convergentes traversent cette étude: du point de vue de l'histoire de la philosophie, le monde social est dans un premier temps l'occasion de mesurer un écart entre Heidegger et Gadamer; puis, dans un second temps, il sert de fil conducteur pour explorer les ressources éthiques et sociales de la philosophie herméneutique. Enfin, d'un point de vue phénoménologique, nous montrons à l'aide de ces ressources comment l'anonymat et l'indétermination du monde social constituent des conditions nécessaires de la vie subjective et personnelle. In this study three objectives converge: from the point of view of the history of philosophy, the social world first allows us to measure the distance between Heidegger and Gadamer; secondly, it serves as a guide for exploring the ethical and social resources of hermeneutical philosophy. And in conclusion, from a phenomenological viewpoint, we show how, with the help of these resources, the anonymity and the indeterminateness of the social world form the necessary conditions for subjective and personal life.<br>

Abstract: The claim of this essay is that those who study ritual should make fuller use than has been made so far of the literature in philosophy of art. The relevance of aesthetic theory to several questions currently being addressed in ritual studies will be shown, and a model based on what we call "ritual spaces" will serve as the basis for interpreting certain types of ritual. We apply our theory to the ancient Zoroastrian high liturgy, the Yasna. Implications of this interpretive model will also be explored; they include discussions on the following issues: the role of ritual language, the relationship of the various dimensions of ritual, and the basic functions of liturgical performance. The essay begins with analysis and concludes with synthesis.<br>

Abstract: Par sa notion de « lecture » et de « décréation », Simone Weil ébauche une philosophie critique en tant qu'analyse perceptive du réel que nos jugements font éclater, à tout instant, en une infinité de textes valorisés. Guidée par la méthode reflexive d'Alain et de Lagneau, elle dépasse la problématique phénoménologique des actes interprétatifs dans une herméneutique métaphysique. Le désir constitue alors le fondement de toute métaphorisation du réel à partir d'une conscience gestuelle où les signes, les symboles et les concepts préfigurent une transcendance absente, mais néanmoins réelle. Saisir, à la suite de Kant, cette contradiction en tout objet, c'est fonder la pratique perceptive sur le modèle christologique qui remplit par excellence la fonction d'une « métaphore réelle ». L'exigence proprement philosophique d'une telle synthèse permet de reconnaître une valeur originale à S. Weil dans le débat moderne autour de l'élaboration du signifié. Through her ideas of « lecture » and « décréation », Simone Weil sketches out a critical Philosophy as well as a perspective analysis of that which is real which our judgments, at every moment, split up into an endless number of valued texte. Guided by the reflexive method of Alain and of Lagneau, she goes beyond the phenomenological problematic of interpretative acts into a metaphysical hermeneutic. Desire then constitutes the foundation of every métaphorisation of the real starting with a consciousness in wich signs, symbols and concepts foreshadow an absent, but nevertheless real, transcendence. Taking hold of this contradiction in every object, following upon Kant, is to establish the perceptive practice on the christological model which fulfills belter than any other the function of a "real metaphor". The properly philosophical demand of such a synthesis allows us to recognize an original value in Simone Weil within the modern debate concerning the elaboration of that which is signified.<br>

Abstract: L'affirmation selon laquelle le mariage chrétien est le signe efficace de l'union du Christ et de l'Église est une donnée de la Tradition. Elle n'en soulève pas moins, au regard des sciences humaines (ethnologie, psychanalyse), de la philosophie, de la théologie enfin, un certain nombre de difficultés théoriques dont plusieurs sont examinées ici. L'effort ensuite tenté pour les lever aboutit à une présentation nouvelle de la sacramentanté du mariage. Le couple uni et fécond aurait à prophétiser la réconciliation des sexes et des générations. Ainsi témoignerait-il, dans l'Esprit, de ce qui est déjà et qui sera, mieux encore: de Celui qui est et vient: Dieu tout en tous. L'étude se termine en évoquant les pratiques externes et internes du couple qui dérivent logiquement de cette prophétie. Asserting that Christian marriage is an effectual sign of Christ's union with the Church is a datum of the Tradition. It nevertheless raises, as far as human sciences (ethnology, psychoanalysis), philosophy and in fine theology are concerned, a certain number of theoretical difficulties, several of which are here examined. The subsequent effort to overcome them leads to a new presentation of the sacramental character of marriage. The united and fruitful couple should prophecies the reconciliation of sexes and generations. Thus would it testify in the Spirit, what already is and shall be, better still: from Him who is and comes, God, the whole power in all men. The essay is concluded by evoking the external and internal experiences of the couple logically resulting from this prophecy.<br>

Abstract: A quelles conditions la théologie peut-elle se fonder comme théologie interprétative selon le vœu de Claude Geffré (La théologie au risque de l'interprétation) et d'Eberhard, Jüngel (Dieu mystère du monde) ? Réponse: elle doit demander concepts et méthode à une philosophie de l'interprétation. Pour surmonter la « crise de la métaphysique » (Nietzsche, Heidegger) ; ensuite pour fixer les principes de l'interprétation, garantissant l'historicité, la transcendance personnalisée et l'Amour de Dieu. Si une herméneutique (de Dilthey à Gadamer et à Ricœur) n'y suffit point, l'A. renvoie à sa proposition philosophique de « l'Inlégralisme » (cf. J. Granier, Le discours du monde), avec sa théorie de l'Intégral et du transréel, son analytique de la praxis sociale et son anthropologie « égotiste ». Under what kind of conditions can a theology be founded as an interpretative one, as suggested by Claude Geffré (La Théologie au risque de l'interprétation) and Eberhard Jüngel (Dieu mystère du monde) ? Answer: it is obliged to demand concepts and method from a philosophy of the interpretation. In order to overcome the "crisis of metaphysics" (Nietzsche, Heidegger) ; in order to determine the principles of the interpretation, which are able to guarantee the historicity, the personalized transcendency and the Love of God. If a hermeneutics (from Dilthey to Gadamer and Ricœur) is not enough, the author refers to his philosophical proposition of "integralism" (cf. J. Granier, Le discours du mondes), with its theory of the Integral and of Transreal, its analytics of the social praxis and its "egotistic" anthropology.<br>

Abstract: De François Wahl à Jürgen Habermas, la critique de la cratologie de Foucault a beaucoup évolué. Mais si Foucault n'apparaît plus comme un phénoménologue honteux de la volonté de puissance, trahissant ses prétentions structuralistes, il reste quand même un penseur ambigu qui, à la manière de Heidegger, élabore un discours « empirico - existentiel » à l'aide de catégories « historico-transcendantales ». Pourtant, si la critique habermassienne a le mérite d'attirer l'attention sur un trait central de la modernité que Foucault laisse de côté — la « solidification » des structures collectives —, elle ne nous offre pas, comme la critique de Foucault, les moyens de résister au processus d'intégration et de cristallisation des structures modernes, mais semble plutôt entériner la suprématie du savoir moderne de la contrainte par les structures institutionnelles. Pour notre part, nous pensons qu'une philosophie politique doit répondre, à notre époque, au problème relevé par Habermas avec les méthodes de contestation employées par Foucault. Cette philosophie politique devra même tenir compte, en tant que reflet de la situation actuelle, de l'ignorance de Foucault quant au problème crucial de la logique institutionnelle moderne et du refus par Habermas de toute critique qui vise à produire un conflit avec la logique dominante d'intégration. From François Wahl to Jürgen Habermas, criticisms of Foucault's theory of power have evolved considerably. But although Foucault may no longer be seen as a phenomenologist ashamed of his preoccupation about power, thus undermining his structuralist prétentions, he nevertheless remains an ambiguous thinker who, in the manner of Heidegger, elaborates an empirico-existential argument with the help of historico-transcendental classifications. However, if Habermas's criticism has the merit of drawing attention to a basic feature of modernity which Foucault leaves aside — namely the "solidification" of collective structures — it fails to offer, as~<br>

Abstract: Cette étude propose une approche « textologique » du texte scripturaire, à l'interface de la philosophie de la religion et de la philosophie du texte. Elle repose sur deux hypothèses : 1. penser, c'est interroger; la pensée religieuse est une interrogation sur le salut. 2. le sens se textualise en achevant de saturer les trois dimensions de la signifiance (référence, communicabililé, symbolisme). Trois raisons sont données, après le textual turn en philosophie, pour distinguer « texte » et « discours » : structurelle, « érotétique », clause de clôture du Canon des Écritures. Du même coup, le rôle de l'expérience religieuse est dérivé. La méthode est celle de l'analyse conceptuelle des problématiques. This study proposes a "textological" approach to scriptural text, at the interface of the philosophy of religion with the philosophy of the text. It avances two hypothesis: 1. to think is to question; religious thought raises the question of salvation. 2. the meaning textualizes itself by completely saturating the three dimensions of signification (reference, communicabiliiy, symbolism). Three reasons are given, following the textual turn in philosophy, for distinguishing between "text" and "discourse": structure, "erotetics", and the closing clause of the scriptural Canon. At the same time the role of religious experience is explained. The method used is that of the conceptual analysis of problematics.<br>

Abstract: L'étude se propose de montrer le bien-fondé et la fécondité de l'herméneutique du témoignage en philosophie en interrogeant l'un des problèmes fondamentaux que pose cette pratique, celui du rapport entre singularité et universalité, et ce dans trois champs relevant de la littérature : la littérature au sens large, les mythes littéraires et la Bible. L'étude de la notion de témoignage et de ses déplacements sémantiques dans le témoignage littéraire est inspirée de la philosophie de Paul Ricœur. Les exemples analysés sont ceux du mythe de Faust et de la figure de Job. This study endeavours to show that the hermeneutics of witness in philosophy are indeed well grounded and fecund, by inquiring into one of the essential problems of this practice : that of the relation of the singular to the universal. Three areas relating to literature are broached : literature in a wide sense, myth literature, and the Bible. This study of the idea of witness and its semantic fluctuations in witness literature is inspired by Paul Ricceur's philosophy. The examples analysed here are the Faust myth and the character Job.<br>

Abstract: On donne des exemples de difficultés rencontrées par la théologie classique quand elle se réapproprie certaines catégories d'ordre philosophique. Après avoir étendu la notion de category-mistake à la logique du questionnement, on illustre par une étude de cas certains glissements, dérives, accaparements qui posent des « problèmes catégoriaux ». Une approche interrogative et textologique permet de les analyser selon un partenariat entre théologie fondamentale et une certaine philosophie (critique) de la religion. Les prémisses de cette approche qui inaugure un nouveau type de théologien et de philosophe non retranché, sans ancillarité ni sous-traitance, ont été exposées dans un article antérieur sur « la pensée expressément religieuse » (chère à Balthasar) et sa catégorisation spécifique. On prépare ici un travail ultérieur consacré aux conditions de légitimité de la reprise problématique d'un ordre à l'autre. Examples are given of the difficulties that arise when classical theology apropriates certain categories of a philosophical order. After taking the notion of category-mistake over into the logic of the questioning the study of certain cases illustrates how certain slips, spoliations, or a certain going astray, lead to « categorial problems. » An interrogative and textological approach allows their analysis via a partnership between fundamental theology and a certain (critical) philosophy of Religion. The premises of this approach which heralds a new type of unentrenched theologian and philosopher, free from subordination or belittlement, were the subject of a previous exposé on « expressly religious thought » (dear to Balthasar) and its specific categorisation. This article prepares a further work on the conditions of legitimate transfer of problematic from one order to another.<br>

Abstract: Cette brève contribution propose un repérage sommaire de la philosophie de Jean Nabert par rapport à quelques-uns des courants qui traversent le champ de la philosophie contemporaine. Pour ce faire, elle utilise un article de Nabert paru en 1957 dans l'Encyclopédie Française, dans lequel l'A. se livre à une caractérisation de sa philosophie au sein de la tradition française de la philosophie réflexive. The purpose of this short contribution is to get a summary view of Jean Nabert's philosophy in relation to some of the currents that mark contemporary philosophy. The basis for this contribution is an article that Nabert published in 1957 in the Encyclopédie Française in which the author describes his own philosophy within the frame of French tradition of reflexive philosophy.<br>

Abstract: Le jugement de valeur est étudié par Nabert dans les Éléments pour une éthique. Il se situe à l'articulation de la compréhension de soi, de l'affirmation originaire et de la régénération. Pensé comme expression d'un acte originaire et non comme participation à l'être, il permet de lier réflexion, création et pluralité. Cette perspective métaphysique, soutenue par une philosophie réflexive de la conscience, suscite une perspective critique par rapport aux théories substantialistes (Scheler, Spaemann) ou procédurales (Habermas, Renaut) de la valeur. Si la valeur est promotion d'existence, les prédicats négatifs donnent forme à l'acte de protestation contre le mal, l'injustifiable. Jean Nabert studies the judgment of value in his Éléments pour une éthique. He himself is situated at the crossroads of the comprehension of self, original affirmation, and regeneration. Seen as the expression of an originating act and not as a participation in being, it can tie together reflexion, creation and plurality. This metaphysical perspective sustained by a reflexive philosophy of conscience invites a critical perspective in relation to substantialist (Scheler, Spaemann) or procedural (Habermas, Renaut) theories of value. If value is promotion of existence, then negative predicates give form to the act of protest against evil, the unjustifiable.<br>

Abstract: Relecture de l'inédit de Jean Nahert: « La conscience peut-elle se comprendre? » dans l'optique de la philosophie herméneutique contemporaine. Dès 1934, la philosophie de Nahert opère une percée en direction du concept herméneutique d'autocompréhension, même si sa formulation originale du problème exige de quiconque défend le concept de « raison herméneutique » un très sévère « examen de conscience ». C'est ce que montre une analyse de la formule « l'inquiétude du se comprendre » dont on rencontre de nombreuses occurrences dans le texte. Même si le terme « désir de Dieu » n'apparaît pas dans ce texte de 1934, on peut y discerner l'annonce de la thèse que « ce sont les conditions de possibilité de la conscience de soi qui fondent le désir de Dieu ». Rereading Jean Nabert's unpublished « Can Conscience Understand Itself » through the eyes of contemporary hermeneutical philosophy. As early as 1934, Nabert's philosophy makes a breakthrough in the direction of the hermeneutical concept of autocomprehension even if, in its original formulation, it demands a very severe « examination of conscience » of whomever defends the concept of « hermeneutical reason ». This is shown by an analysis of the expression « the unrest of understanding oneself » repeated several times in the text And even if the expression « desire for God » does not appear in this 1934 text, one can discern there the beginnings of the thesis that « it is the conditions of the possibility of conscience of self that found the desire for God ».<br>

Abstract: Rompant avec la quasi-unanimité de la philosophie occidentale, de Platon à Marx, laquelle a conçu le pouvoir en termes de pouvoir-sur, de domination de l'homme sur l'homme, H. A. propose de le penser autrement, comme expression de l'aptitude d'un groupe à agir en condition de pluralité de façon concertée, et donc comme pouvoir-en-commun. L'A. différencie soigneusement le pouvoir, qui trouve en lui-même sa propre fin, d'avec la violence, d'ordre instrumental, qui n'est jamais légitime, et d'avec l'autorité, qui présuppose la reconnaissance inconditionnelle et le respect. Elle se demande finalement si tout pouvoir peut se passer du facteur de durabilité qu'est l'autorité d'une fondation. In breaking with the near unanimity of Western Philosophy which, from Plato to Marx, had conceived of power in terms of "power over," of a domination of humans over humans, H. A. proposes instead to think of power as an expression of a group's aptitude to act in a pluralistic environment and in concert, thus as power in common. The A. takes care to distinguish power as an end in itself from violence of an instrumental order which is never legitimate, and from Authority which presupposes unconditional recognition and respect, wondering in the end if all power can do without the durability factor that is the authority of a foundation<br>

Abstract: Le témoin n'est ni un spectateur, ni un propriétaire, ni un conservateur, ni un producteur, ni un juge, mais il est celui qui accueille ce qui se donne à lui et se reçoit de cette épreuve d'une altérité irréductible. La force des analyses de Kierkegaard est de montrer que l'élucidation de l'essence du témoignage, qui conduit à la substitution du témoin au je, ne peut être séparée d'une elucidation de l'essence de la vérité. La vérité n'étant pas ce que je produis, mais ce qui me touche et m'éclaire, le témoignage se donne comme une communication directe-indirecte qui consiste à dire la vérité tout en l'existant Exister c'est témoigner en faisant de sa vie une tâche dans la passion essentielle de la vérité. En cela seul le témoignage chrétien révèle véritablement l'essence du témoignage puisque seul il donne vraiment à voir le saut du témoignage, qui conduit à ne pas se contenter de persister dans l'être pour s'ouvrir à la possibilité de devenir tout autre en s'abandonnant à la vérité et en acceptant de souffrir pour elle dans le monde. Dans cette philosophie du témoignage, le témoin devient alors le vrai nom de la personne contre l'abstraction du sujet-substance. A witness is neither a spectator, a proprietor, a preservator, a producer nor a judge, he is the one that receives what is given to him and who, from this test of irreducible alterity, receives himself. The strength of Kierkegaard's analyses is in showing that the elucidation of the essence of witnessing, which leads to the witness being substituted to the "I-myself", is inseparable from the elucidation of the essence of truth. Truth being not what I make but what marks and enlightens me, witnessing is given to be a direct-indirect communication which consists of saying the truth while being it. To be is to give witness by making one's life a task in the essential passion of truth. For this, Christian witness alone truly reveals the essence of witnessing for it alone truly allows one to see the leap of witn~<br>

Abstract: L'auteur se propose de vérifier l'affirmation de Lavelle selon laquelle l'ouvrage de 1937, De l'Acte, se serait progressivement développé comme une synthèse complète de sa philosophie. Or il existe, à l'état dactylographié, une version antérieure de ce livre, qui permet de comprendre combien l'aisance presque trop grande des analyses de 1937 cache en fait une élaboration lente et un effort continu. La version inédite insiste sur l'intemporalité transcendantale de l'acte, et sur l'impersonnalité de l'acte fondateur de toutes les existences personnelles. Ces thèses seront abandonnées en 1937. On analyse ensuite l'article « Être et Acte » et la conférence de la société française de philosophie sur « Acte créateur et acte réflexif », où est discutée la position de Jean Nabert. Les thèses de De l'Acte montrent une progression de l'identité de l'être et de l'acte (dans l'acte d'être) jusqu'à l'acte en sa forme la plus haute, l'acte d'amour. Situer cette œuvre capitale implique qu'on ait bien compris l'interprétation du sensible comme de la donnée matérielle qui doit être spiritualisée. L'expérience extérieure du sensible s'oppose à l'expérience intérieure de l'esprit. Et l'acte est l'œuvre de l'être spirituel. L'ontologie dynamique de Lavelle est une affirmation de la liberté humaine comme participation à l'acte créateur divin. Divin ou humain, l'être est subjectif parce que libre. Ainsi Lavelle s'inscrit dans la tradition platonicienne moderne, celle d'Avicenne d'abord, celle de Hegel ensuite. The author proposes to verify Lavelle's assertion that the 1937 work, De l'Acte, would be progressively developed as a complete synthesis of his philosophy. Now there exists in typewritten state an earlier version of this book, which allows us to see the extent to which the almost excessive facility of analyses of 1937 in fact conceals a slow development and a continuous effort. The unedited version insists upon the transcendental atemporality of act, and upon the impersonality of ~<br>

Abstract: La philosophie herméneutique contemporaine comporte, dans sa démarche fondamentale, une rencontre avec la pensée fondatrice de Descartes que l'on peut nommer son « moment cartésien ». Celle thèse est vérifiée successivement à propos de la « phénoménologie matérielle » de Michel Henry, directement liée à une interprétation du cogito cartésien développée dans la Généalogie de la psychanalyse ; puis en dégageant les motifs herméneutiques impliqués dans la critique du cogito développée par Heidegger; enfin en analysant, dans la phénoménologie herméneutique de Paul Ricœur, la signification du « cogito blessé » , par rapport au conflit des interprétations et dans les perspectives de l'identité narrative pour une nouvelle conception du sujet. In making its fundamental approach, contemporary interpretative philosophy inevitably encounters the basic thinking of Descartes, resulting in what may be called a « Cartesian touch ». Successive examples of this are to be found in (1) Michel Henry's "physical-object phenomenology", which is directly linked with one interpretation of the Cartesian cogito developed in The Genealogy of Psycho-analysis; then in (2) Heidegger's critique of the cogito, if one isolates the interpretative aims which are implied therein; and finally in (3) Paul Ricœur's interpretative phenomenology, if one analyses the meaning of the "wounded cogito", bearing in mind the conflict of interpretation and the possibility that the identical data could give rise to new conclusions on the subject.<br>

Author(s): Wyzewa Rebecca<br>
Abstract: Mallarmé constructs a "crisis of verse" that mimes the circumstances of loss and the moment of lamentation to produce his celebrated poetic purity. Indeed, he constructs this purity out of the materials of ritual and philosophical defilement: not only does his poetic theory valorize death and danger, but his poetic practice largely relies on contact with the foreign, on semantic contagion, and on ambiguity. The significance of this defilement spreads in multiple directions: it is instrumental in producing newness and in mediating Mallarmé's professional rivalry with Wagner, it bears witness to the domestic crisis of the Third Republic, and it functions as a form of resistance to cultural assimilation. Moreover, because defilement is at once material and symbolic and because that "symbolism" is an obstinately obscure mode of referentiality, Mallarmé's cultivation of defilement is a recuperation of the scapegoats that "pure" philosophy necessarily exiles: the material and the hyperessential.<br>

Issue: i226344<br>

Author(s): Zoetmulder J. Joseph<br>
Abstract: Most students of Javanese culture and society have used a few crucial native terms and concepts to analyze aspects of traditional etiquette, statecraft, and mysticism. A unitary approach to priyayi ethics, aesthetics, and power is developed here by synthesizing themes common to earlier treatments. Several points of disagreement with Geertz's (1960, 1973) descriptions are discussed in conclusion as a way of drawing out lexicographic aspects of the methodology of interpretive anthropology. [Java, statecraft, etiquette, language in culture, native philosophy]<br>

Abstract: This essay proposes that sociology can learn from social theory developed in the humanities. In the face of recent challenges to sociological explanations of social outcomes (from rational choice and economic theory, cognitive psychological theories of intelligence, and communitarian social philosophy), social theory should specify the constitutive force of social signification. After identifying a key weakness in theoretical approaches currently available in sociology, the inadequacy of various conceptions of the social, I analyze three significant new works in cultural studies in order to sketch out alternative ways of defining and measuring the force of social signification. The essay concludes with an attempt to establish the basis of a dialogue between cultural studies and sociology.<br>

Abstract: ‘The action turn’ stands over against ‘the linguistic turn’ that was a development in Western philosophy during the 20th century. Its most important characteristic is its focus on philosophy and language. Ludwig Wittgenstein’s influence is strong as the term follows from his claim that philosophical problems arise from a misunderstanding of the logic of language and his later comments on language games. See
         Reason P & Torbert WR (2001) The Action Turn: Toward a Transformational Social Science: a further look at the scientific merits of action research. Concepts and Transformations 6(1), 1–37 (available at http://www.peterreason.eu/Papers/Transformational_Social_Science.pdf). See alsoRorty RM (Ed.)

Abstract: The aim of the article is to present some aspects of Paul Ricœur’s thought, especially his reflection on the servile will. Firstly I present Ricœur’s philosophy of will (in the context of phenomenology of the voluntary and involuntary) and the concept of fallibility. Then I demonstrate the main aspects of Ricœurian rethinking and enlarging of Husserl’s phenomenology what leads to hermeneutic formula: the symbol gives rise to thought. Eventually, I argue that Ricœur’s hermeneutic phenomenology creates a specified anthropological view and understanding of the human condition. This understanding will later become a part of the ‘hermeneutics of the self.’<br>

Author(s): Herzog Annabel<br>
Abstract: For both Levinas and Derrida, the practice of philosophy, understood as commentary by the former and deconstruction by the latter, was founded on borrowing terms from other languages and finding their equivalents in French. This argument is developed through a discussion of two texts, Levinas's early Talmudic reading, “The Temptation of Temptation,” and Derrida's deconstruction of
         The Merchant of Venicein “What Is a ‘Relevant’ Translation?” This essay shows how translated terms are interwoven into these texts. It also shows that translation is essential to Levinas's and Derrida's creative conceptualization, and to the performativity of their philosophies, meaning that Levinas and Derrida open their language to other languages in order to create concepts. It finally argues that in both Derrida and Levinas the question of the limits of translation, namely, of the moment in which translation becomes conversion, is left open.<br>

Abstract: Tropes for poetic relationality proliferate and concatenate. And there is so much more to say. The topic of poetic copia is indeed so abundant as to suggest myriad forking paths of contemplation and investigation. Hidden within the present reflections are dozens of doors leading to other rooms of thought that this article unfortunately does not have the luxury to open. The poets of the Latin American neobaroque—including Argentines Néstor Perlongher, Osvaldo Lamborghini, and Arturo Carrera, Uruguyans Roberto Echavarren and Eduardo Milán, Cuban American José Kozer, and Peruvian Argentine Reynaldo Jimenez—are in deep dialogue with cannibalistic poetics, as De Campos argues in his analysis of “anthropophagous reason” (which he defines as a “ludic space of polyphony and of language in convulsion”).
         
               In the twentieth and twenty-first century there is also a suggestive plethora of poetic frauds, hoaxes, and impersonations—the Ern Malley hoax and Christopher Reid's143
            Katerina Brac, to name just two. Multilingual poetics, with its play on shifting linguistic identities, interlanguage, and polyphony, presents another avenue that would be fruitful for exploration; as does new media poetics that makes use of digital technology. As cultural processes that mingle past and present texts, such cannibalistic poetry participates in a form of cultural philosophy
               that unseats dualistic notions of genius and non-genius, source and derivative, and argues implicitly or explicitly against the metaphysics of origin.144<br>

Abstract: Apter views Continental philosophy itself through a selective lens. Symptomatic is a page-long listing of influential translations of Continental works, inviting “reflection on the full impact of translation on the making of cross-continental philosophy and theory” (247). “In each instance,” Apter notes, “the translator plays a pivotal role in the history of theory in his or her own right” (248). Her examples of these pivotal translations are: Derrida's French translation of Husserl, followed by English-language translations of Derrida, of Lacan, and of Derrida again; then of Foucault, of Derrida again, of Kristeva, of Irigaray, and of Derrida yet again—twice—and then of Deleuze, Agamben, Rancière, Malabou, Badiou, Lacan, and again Badiou, ending with Judith Butler in French (248). Neither here nor anywhere in the book do we find Lukács, or Bakhtin, or Gadamer, or Gramsci, nor even a full range of French theory: no Saussure, no Lévi-Strauss, no Girard, no Ricoeur, no Althusser. In place of any of these figures, we have Derrida six times.<br>

Abstract: Henri Baudet affirms that the basic elements of what came to be defined as Europe had a Greek, or better yet, a Mediterranean origin. It was not until the voyages of the Portuguese southward around the continent of Africa and into the Indian Ocean and the ventures of Columbus into the Atlantic that these distinctive elements became one of the ingredients in the making of Europe as a continent. These voyages and the physical geographical boundary of the Ural Mountains were not enough to demarcate the meaning of Europe as a continent. It needed a philosophical and ideological meaning to justify its continental assertiveness. Baudet tells that for most of the period prior to the ocean voyages, Europe had been an invasion route from the Mediterranean into western Asia.
         
               It is from within this context that we can understand how two of European's most prominent philosophers of the modern period, Immanuel Kant and G. W. F. Hegel, gave a great deal of attention to the meaning of Europe's orientation in space—Kant in his unpublished lecture notes on anthropology and geography, Hegel in his21
            Philosophy of History.

Abstract: But just the other day I got a kind of Rip van Winkle testimony from my friend Dick Howard, of Stony Brook, who apparently hasn't attended SPEP since the twenty-fifth anniversary meeting in Toronto. He's here for a panel tomorrow, and he sent me an e-mail, from which I quote, in part, with permission: “Just have been looking at SPEP program—it's extraordinary how it's grown and the diversity of things going on there. A ‘victory’ that at the same time comes with a diversification that perhaps gives more breath than depth? History will judge.” So there you have it! The judgment of history! SPEP flourishes today, a major force in American philosophy, and its “victory” seems to justify and redeem in retrospect all those early struggles, the slaughter bench of the early days, the courage and prescience of that small band of outsiders and oddballs. It makes a good story, as history always should: the triumph of the little guys over enormous odds. In Hegelian terms, reason exercised its cunning and brought about results unforeseeable, almost unimaginable, in those far-off days of 1962—or was it 1961? In philosophical terms, history has rendered its judgment.<br>

Abstract: Questions like this have shaped much of my own work. Being surrounded by so many enthusiastic but incompatibly articulate spokespersons for neglected lifeworld concerns, I concluded that criticism of tradition is most powerful when offered by those who are already in the midst of trying to be better phenomenologists—not, of course, in the sense that they are trying to be better members of a philosophical school but in the sense that they are motivated by the urge to find better ways to articulate something that tradition distorts or neglects. Why
      shouldaccounts of what matters most in life first be measured against the standards of “clear and distinct” propositional speech? Does anyone reallylive though life, thinking of it as a process going on inside our bodies? Do we reallyexperiencefreedom as an unconceptualizable combination of limitlessness and limit? And why throw the metaphorical wet blanket of a rigorously trained consciousness and its “correlates” over thepretheoretical practices of everyday life? Negative genuflections to philosophy's traditional priorities, privileging the subjective instead of the objective, inner instead of outer, lived body instead of house-for-the-mind—all of these inversions ultimately foster the continuing and undeserved hegemony of a traditionally objectivist understanding of what is Really Real. Kockelmans once told me that Merleau-Ponty eventually decidedPhenomenology of Perception“was not yet a philosophical book.” To be sure, its content and much of its treatment of that content is phenomenological, but its structure is still Cartesian. To start with specificallybodilyperception, however generously reconceived, still implies that other dimensions of presence to the world—linguistic, social, cultural, political, historical—can be added on at a later time, perhaps along with discussions of abstractly identified and timeless “topics” like freedom, the self, and so on.<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Is philosophy, perhaps all philosophy, ultimately founded on the absolute certainty of death, that we are all, in one way or another, sentenced to death? Derrida demonstrates philosophy's bind to death and the death penality. Yet, in his last seminar, while powerfully calling into question the meaning of death and who can die, Derrida also appeals to the fact that every living being dies as perhaps the ultimate ethical bind. Has death, then, as the absolute and only equalizer, replaced the absolute authority of God, whether Kant's rational one or Levinas's Other one? The death penalty as executed in this country makes clear that both ethics and politics demand that we think through our own death drive rather than bank on the fantasy of equality through death, the fantasy of instant death, or the fantasy of death as the final and absolute resting place. To do so covers over the differences between deaths and death penalties—to be blunt, between so many ways of dying and so many ways of being executed, assassinated, or killed.<br>

Abstract: The Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy (SPEP), as a fifty-year-old movement of both phenomenologically and existentially disposed philosophers, may regard Franz Brentano (1838–1917) as at least a grandfather. For many SPEP members, including myself until very recently, Brentano has been known in a rather vague and inauthentic empty intention merely as the teacher of Husserl, foremost in regard to some aspects of the doctrine of intentionality. Upon closer inspection this is pitifully shortsighted, and I have come to believe that the phenomenologist's lineage to the grandfather is not to be forgotten and that retrieving it may bring out not only differences but surprising enrichments that will emerge through wrestling with the differences.
         
                  As merely one example, I want to discuss Brentanian propositions regarding the individuality of the I.1<br>

Abstract: No doubt the rise of religion has not only posed a particular dilemma for critical theory but also provided a curious place to end this reflection. Having started my career doing philosophy of religion it is somewhat surprising to meet religion again as I turn to what surely must be at least a later phase of my career. I am reminded of Antonio's line from the Italian film
            C'eravamo Tanto Amati, translated asWe All Loved Each Other So Much: “We thought we could change the world, but the world changed us.” “Philosophers only interpret the world, the point is to change it,” so said Marx. But in a curious way those who would change the world are changed by it.<br>

Abstract: I believe that in its twenty-fifth year SPEP brought to fruition a movement of incremental postmodern developments and made a full turn out of the modern orientation of its origin. That turn opened a new era for SPEP. Its origin had given SPEP life and vision and played a large role in transforming professional philosophy in the United States as it also transformed into a society that no one could have imagined in 1961.<br>

Abstract: But are there new philosophies of technology? In my narrative I have implied my own style of a “postphenomenology,” which today is practiced by a significant number of younger philosophers—I would include here Peter Paul Verbeek, Evan Selinger, Robert Rosenberger, and many others who have presented and published “empirical turn studies.” Hans Achterhuis describes this concrete turn very well in
                  American Philosophy of Technology: The Empirical Turn(2001). Andrew Feenberg, himself an interpreter and critic of both Heidegger and Marcuse, has done his own analyses of new technologies. And in Europe, a social scientist-philosopher, actually more cited than Derrida, Bruno Latour is known for his distinctive “actor network theory” of analysis. And Donna Haraway must be added for her biology-centered work as well. I mention these movements in passing to show that the field has already changed and all of these are “Continental” in heritage. Indeed, the field is much larger, and “technoscience studies” are engaged in by the new sociologies of science, feminist studies of science, and many emergent cultural studies now proliferating in both Europe and America. Here, however, I did not want to do a field survey but, rather, take note of our own responses to technologies from the SPEP anniversary.<br>

Abstract: We at SPEP have never been modern and have made a good living off the critique of modernism and of its binary oppositions. But I think that the business as usual of Continental philosophy will have to be expanded to include a critique of the opposition of the human and the nonhuman, of
            physisandtechne, and of “Continental philosophy” and “science.” For the truth is that we have been a party to the science wars. That is why I think that the work of Catherine Malabou is exactly the sort of work that SPEP and Continental philosophy generally will have to do in the future.
                  We have yet to admit how deeply inscribed the human is in the nonhuman and the technical. We have yet to appreciate that being-in-the-world is not only historicized, gendered, and incarnate but also both a neural and a galactic event, of both microscopic and macroscopic proportions. Can it be of no interest to “philosophy,” can there be nothing to “wonder” about, that our bodies are literally made of stardust? We have yet to realize how deeply interwoven is the imagination of speculative physics with the wonder of the philosophers. If the best we can do is to protect our turf by saying that science does not think, the sciences will steal our thunder, that is, our wonder, right out from under us. Science does think, and science wonders, because wonder is the piety of thought. That is a matter to which SPEP, and Continental philosophers generally, whether they have taken a theological turn or are running in the opposite direction, should give more thought.36

Abstract: The final section, “The Gift and the Animal: Rethinking Politics and Critical Theory,” brings together two articles in social and political theory. Alan Schrift's article, “Should Philosophers Still Read Mauss? Thoughts on Contemporary American Politics,” revisits Marcel Mauss's 1925
      Essay on the Giftand argues that its significance for thinking about contemporary politics has yet to be fully appreciated. Schrift finds in Mauss's work an approach to left-wing politics that avoids the binary opposition between Marxism and liberal individualism; as a result, Schrift argues, Mauss's political theory offers important resources for defending social democracy in the context of contemporary American politics. Eduardo Mendieta's article, “The Silence of the Sirens: RereadingDialectic of Enlightenmentwith Kafka and Borges,” returns to the ur-text of Critical Theory and rereads it in light of what Mendieta calls “the animal question.” Weaving a trace among Homer'sOdysseus, Plato's allegory of the cave, and Horkheimer and Adorno'sDialectic of Enlightenment, Mendieta argues that the animal question has haunted Western philosophy from the beginning and thus that a critical philosophy must also become an animal philosophy.<br>

Abstract: The second result of this article, as I see it, is more speculative in nature, to the extent that it goes a little further than anything that either Ricoeur or Janicaud has explicitly said. Janicaud gives up the metaphysical ambitions of phenomenology to establish itself as a first philosophy, which leads the phenomenologist to be characterized rightly as a despot, or if taking a theological turn, a priest. But if a minimal phenomenology leads in a new direction, then what transformation of the phenomenologist's role would follow? What figure, in other words, would come to characterize the work of the minimal phenomenologist? Drawing from work that I have developed elsewhere, I can think of no better answer to this question than the figure of the translator, or to be even more precise, the code-switcher.

Abstract: Ricoeur, however, does not view the movement from mimesis
      3to mimesis1as arhetoricalmoment. He employs rhetorical terminology as he discusses the techniques that the actual (as opposed to implied) author of a text utilizes in order to conceal “the violence … in the strategy of persuasion” (1988, 3:162). But he abandons this vocabulary when he approaches the reader, opting instead for the language of phenomenology and aesthetics (1988, 3:166–67). In part, he discards the language of the rhetorical tradition because of his limited view of rhetoric's capacity to produce real change in the world. He privileges poetics and philosophy “ontologically” over rhetoric, as Michael Leff has rightly pointed out (1987, 60). Ricoeur valorizes these intellectual traditions according to their ends: poetry results in a cathartic moment that purges old emotions and makes way for new ones, whereas rhetoric results in a persuasive moment that merely crystallizes the preexisting opinions of the audience. According to Ricoeur, these two ends are starkly opposed to one another: “Catharsis must, finally, be opposed to persuasion.” Unlike “all seduction or flattery” (i.e., rhetoric), catharsis stirs the emotions in order to enable “the creative imitation of human action” (1997, 66; see also 1977, 35). However, in the third volume ofTime and Narrative, Ricoeur also admits that the set of effects attached to catharsis is “complex”: “It designates first of all the effect of the work that is more moral than aesthetic: new evaluations, hitherto unheard of norms, are proposed by the work, confronting or shaking current customs” (1988 3:176). Because catharsis possesses a moral component, Ricoeur reasons, it is capable of instructing. Many rhetorical scholars would likely take issue with his assigning such seemingly “persuasive” effects to the realm of poetics rather than rhetoric. Does not Aristotle say that the stirring of emotions is as essential as logical argument to persuasion and judgm~<br>

Abstract: The two essays that follow situate their gaze on Shaw's cosmology. Jay Tunney's moving, evocative piece, “The Spiritual Shaw,” again affirms the profundity of Shaw's close relationship with his father, Gene. The extraordinary experience on the island of Brioni was a powerful moment in Shaw's ongoing reflection about the intersection of the physical and metaphysical, manifested (among other places) in his keenness for boxing. Witnessing Polly Tunney's painful and near-fatal appendicitis attack, Gene's faith, and the miraculous arrival of two medical saviors, Shaw was deeply affected by what Tunney describes as the “simplicity and enormity of the circumstance,” and thereafter “prayer broadened his definition of the human spirit.” With the reputed interconnection between health and hope as his starting point, Howard Ira Einsohn also explores Shaw's moral and religious philosophy in “Bernard Shaw and Paul Ricoeur: Emissaries of Hope, Faith, and Wellness.” Einsohn's commentary traces convergences in the thinking of both figures to articulate how Shaw's tragic-optimism acts as “his equilibrium, his wellness, in a world wildly out of kilter.”<br>

Abstract: For Ricoeur, Kant's corpus is essentially a philosophy of limits.
         
               In the Kantian universe, apart from limitations on action, there are also dimensions of reality beyond the epistemological reach of the species. Specifically, human knowing is limited to objects conditioned by time and space. We mortals, for example, cannot know a hypothesized God, his purposes and methods—or any other postulated transcendental entity—because the efficacy of speculative reason ends where the border of the unconditioned begins. Stated technically, humans can know phenomena, things that are perceived or interpreted, but not things as they are in themselves independent of the mind (noumena). This means that any notion of totalization, of obtaining absolute knowledge, in the manner articulated by, say, Hegel, is chimerical. For Kant, then, neither the theoretical nor the empirical sphere furnishes adequate grounds to support the contention that a reconciliation of freedom and nature is possible. Now, if nothing in our knowledge or experience indicates that freedom can be rehabilitated, a potentially devastating dilemma arises for Kant: how can he save his ethics, which presupposes that ought implies can, if the will is inexorably impotent in the face of omnipresent evil? How can we do what we must if we are denied autonomy? If we cannot emancipate the will, a major plank in Kant's philosophical edifice will collapse under the weight of an unresolvable aporia. Kant, of course, is well aware of the impasse and in his29
            Critique of Judgmentposits the transformative power of art as the means of mediating between actuality and freedom. Unfortunately, Kant never fully develops the idea of how symbolic expression, a product of the creative imagination, can genuinely resuscitate the vulnerable will, so the question he himself believes religion poses—what may I hope?—remains incompletely answered. However, this lacuna is all the inspiration Ricoeur needs to bui~<br>

Abstract: To provide a context for the essays published here, this introduction to the special issue on metonymy highlights a number of aspects of the cognitive-linguistic discussion of metonymy of the past twenty-five years. It briefly sketches the development of metonymy studies in poetics, linguistics, and philosophy, emphasizing that the cognitive-linguistic approach to metonymy of the past decades represents a return to the semantic views of metonymy advocated in structuralist semantics. This development was triggered by the extensive study of metaphor, but metonymy has now emancipated itself as an autonomous field of study that displays complex and unresolved relations with metaphor. This introduction also attends to the new insights added by cognitive linguistics to such a semantic approach to metonymy, suggesting that metonymy has indeed gone cognitive linguistic.<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: In another of Campbell's explanations in
         The Philosophy of Rhetoric, history becomes the representative empirical data for projecting a prototypical pattern across all of human nature. In this way, the arc of Christian history, including the Crusades and the Reformation, is seen as the archetypal story of social renewal, first through misused rhetoric and then through the utopian rhetorical force that truly civilizes and reforms:
               What follows is a glowing report of the Protestant preacher's role in the Reformation. This version of the rhetorical civilizing myth alters the classical origin model by adding the events of oppression and liberation to the narrative, leading up to a utopian-inspired and rhetorically constructed social contract.At one time you see Europe nearly depopulated at the persuasion of a fanatical monk [Innocent III], its inhabitants rushing armed into Asia, in order to fight for Jesus Christ, as they termed it, but as it proved in fact to disgrace as far as lay in them, the name of Christ and of all Christians among infidels; to butcher those who never injured them, and to whose lands they had at least no better title than those whom they intended, by all possible means, to dispossess; and to give the world a melancholy proof, that there is no pitch of brutality and rapacity to which the passions of avarice and ambition, consecrated and inflamed by religious enthusiasm, will not drive mankind.

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.2.issue-2<br>

Abstract: Louis Althusser once invoked “a new philosophy, one which was no longer an
         interpretation, but rather atransformationof the world.”
               Yet Joyce at times reminds us that texts are merely representational and interpretational—they are not literally or fundamentally transformative; they do not in the end build brave new worlds, try though they may. As Roland Barthes would suggest, dominant meanings are privileged in the generation of such connotative semantic structures as literatures and cultures: this process for the most part represents an act of ideological reinforcement, one contained within Orwell's hegemonic whale. At its most radical, therefore, literature may from this perspective advance a work of subversion or deconstruction rather than one of intentional revolutionary construction—the synthesis of a satirical Laputa rather than of a realizable Utopia.138<br>

Abstract: Flush with the juices of adolescence, American philosophy declared independence from its European parentage in the work of Ralph Waldo Emerson and his generation. In 1837, Emerson addressed the Harvard Phi Beta Kappa Society on the occasion of its inaugural meeting for the year, which he called a "holiday." Emerson began: I greet you on the recommencement of our literary year. Our anniversary is one of hope, and, perhaps, not enough of labor. We do not meet for games of strength or skill, for the recitation of histories, tragedies, and odes, like the ancient Greeks; for parliaments of love and poesy, like the Troubadours; nor for the advancement of science, like our contemporaries in the British and European capitals. Thus far, our holiday has been simply a friendly sign of the survival of the love of letters amongst a people too busy to give letters any more. Perhaps the time is already come when it ought to be, and will be something else; when the sluggard intellect of this continent will look from under its iron lids and fill the postponed expectations of the world with something better than the expectations of mechanical skill. Our day of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close. The millions that around us are rushing into life, cannot always be fed on the sere remains of foreign harvests. Events, actions arise, that must be sung, that will sing themselves.<br>

Journal Title: Cultural Critique<br>
Article Title: “Biopolitics: From Surplus Value to Surplus Life.”<br>
Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
Issue: culturalcritique.86.issue-2014<br>
Date: 1 1, 1996<br>
Abstract: Examining Agamben's reception of Hannah Arendt, and especially
         The Human Condition, in his theorization of biopolitics, this essay argues thatHomo Sacer I, by identifying Arendt with a quasi-Straussian “political philosophy,” fails to acknowledge the complexity of her conception of history. Far from simply affirming the normative force of classical political categories, Arendt regards these as emerging from a living power of distinction that thinking, by showing the historical process that brings about the effacement of these distinctions, seeks to bring into view. Nevertheless, Arendt's conception of history is not without contradiction: while arguing that metaphysics went astray by subordinating praxis to poiesis, her very account of history suggests that this subordination is inevitable, since only a “poetic,” indeed violent, act of making a distinction can distinguish praxis from poiesis. Precisely this problem lies at the center of Agamben's early engagement with Arendt inThe Man without Content.<br>
