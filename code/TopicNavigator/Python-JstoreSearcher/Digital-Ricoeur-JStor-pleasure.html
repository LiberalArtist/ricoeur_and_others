  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1c6v89n">Mourning Animals</a><br>
  Author(s) MCARTHUR JO-ANNE<br>
  Abstract: The debate on animal souls and the problem of theodicy with respect to animal suffering, a discussion that has been a feature of European thought since the seventeenth century, became the perfect pillar for those philosophies that were born in the wake of scientific discoveries and that aimed to assert the unreasonableness of Christianity. Such philosophies questioned how a good and almighty God could let innocent animals undergo all the evils they endure daily. One solution was to deny to animals feelings and reason; for instance, Descartes’s theory of the animal-machine suggested that animals were unable to feel pleasure and<br>

  Book Title: The Thought of Music-  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Kramer Lawrence<br>
  Abstract: What, exactly, is knowledge of music? And what does it tell us about humanistic knowledge in general?
      The Thought of Musicgrapples directly with these fundamental questions-questions especially compelling at a time when humanistic knowledge is enmeshed in debates about its character and future. In this third volume in a trilogy on musical understanding that includesInterpreting MusicandExpression and Truth, Lawrence Kramer seeks answers in both thoughtaboutmusic and thoughtinmusic-thinking in tones. He skillfully assesses musical scholarship in the aftermath of critical musicology and musical hermeneutics and in view of more recent concerns with embodiment, affect, and performance. This authoritative and timely work challenges the prevailing conceptions of every topic it addresses: language, context, and culture; pleasure and performance; and, through music, the foundations of understanding in the humanities.<br>

The post-Napoleonic nineteenth century not only was preoccupied with but also identified with the overwhelming, larger-than-life personalities that impose themselves on us from within the pages of theInferno.Twentieth-century readers, traumatized and chastened by two world wars, were not in a position to gain much pleasure from doomed, heroic personalities, but they did find much to identify with in thePurgatorio,particularly in its mixed condition of sadness and of hope, its remarkable elegiac lyricism and strong personal conviction, its structural polyphonism, and its delicate interweaving of<br>

  Abstract: For kabbalists in the late Middle Ages, in consonance with contemporaneous patterns of Christian and Islamic piety but especially the former, the body was a site of tension, the locus of sensual and erotic pleasure on the one hand, and the earthly pattern of God’s image, the representation of what lies beyond representation, the mirror that renders visible the invisible, on the other. Given the intractable state of human consciousness as embodied—not to be understood, as I will elaborate below, along the lines of Cartesian dualism of mind/body but rather in Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenological sense of the embodied mind/mindful body—<br>

  Book Title: Toward a Theology of Eros: Transfiguring Passion at the Limits of Discipline-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): KELLER CATHERINE<br>
  Abstract: What does theology have to say about the place of eroticism in the salvific transformation of men and women, even of the cosmos itself? How, in turn, does eros infuse theological practice and transfigure doctrinal tropes? Avoiding the well-worn path of sexual moralizing while also departing decisively from Anders Nygren's influential insistence that Christian agape must have nothing to do with worldly eros, this book explores what is still largely uncharted territory in the realm of theological erotics. The ascetic, the mystical, the seductive, the ecstatic-these are the places where the divine and the erotic may be seen to converge and love and desire to commingle.Inviting and performing a mutual seduction of disciplines, the volume brings philosophers, historians, biblical scholars, and theologians into a spirited conversation that traverses the limits of conventional orthodoxies, whether doctrinal or disciplinary. It seeks new openings for the emergence of desire, love, and pleasure, while challenging common understandings of these terms. It engages risk at the point where the hope for salvation paradoxically endangers the safety of subjects-in particular, of theological subjects-by opening them to those transgressions of eros in which boundaries, once exceeded, become places of emerging possibility.The eighteen chapters, arranged in thematic clusters, move fluidly among and between premodern and postmodern textual traditions-from Plato to Emerson, Augustine to Kristeva, Mechthild to Mattoso, the Shulammite to Molly Bloom, the Zohar to the Da Vinci Code. In so doing, they link the sublime reaches of theory with the gritty realities of politics, the boundless transcendence of God with the poignant transience of materiality.<br>

  Abstract: The very notion of seductive ethics is likely to give us pause, to seem more error than paradox. Ethics is more often than not conceived as the very resistance to seduction, if not in fact to any sort of pleasure (or bliss, which seems to undermine the ethical subject).¹ It is dutiful, we think, a little bit ascetic (provided we don’t overly enjoy our asceticism), rule-bound or abstemiously virtuous. And if seduction is about sustaining the possible, then to prescribe, whether character or behavior, seems contradictory to it. But the prescriptions of ethics are not always a matter of foreclosure;<br>

  Book Title: Muscially Sublime: Indeterminacy, Infinity, Irresolvability-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wurth Kiene Brillenburg<br>
  Abstract: Musically Sublime rewrites musically the history and philosophy of the sublime. Music enables us to reconsider the traditional course of sublime feeling on a track from pain to pleasure. Resisting the notion that there is a single format for sublime feeling, Wurth shows how, from the mid eighteenth century onward, sublime feeling is, instead, constantly rearticulated in a complex interaction with musicality. Wurth takes as her point of departure Immanuel Kant's Critique of Judgment and Jean-Francois Lyotard's aesthetic writings of the 1980s and 1990s. Kant framed the sublime narratively as an epic of self-transcendence. By contrast, Lyotard sought to substitute open immanence for Kantian transcendence, yet he failed to deconstruct the Kantian epic. The book performs this deconstruction by juxtaposing eighteenth- and nineteenth-century conceptions of the infinite, Sehnsucht, the divided self, and unconscious drives with contemporary readings of instrumental music. Critically assessing Edmund Burke, James Usher, E.T.A. Hoffmann, Novalis, Friedrich Holderlin, Arthur Schopenhauer, Richard Wagner, and Friedrich Nietzsche, this book re-presents the sublime as a feeling that defers resolution and hangs suspended between pain and pleasure. Musically Sublime rewrites the mathematical sublime as differance, while it redresses the dynamical sublime as trauma: unending, undetermined, unresolved. Whereas most musicological studies in this area have focused on traces of the Kantian sublime in Handel, Haydn, and Beethoven, this book calls on the nineteenth-century theorist Arthur Seidl to analyze the sublime of, rather than in, music. It does so by invoking Seidl's concept of formwidrigkeit ("form-contrariness") in juxtaposition with Romantic piano music, (post)modernist musical minimalisms, and Lyotard's postmodern sublime. It presents a sublime of matter, rather than form-performative rather than representational. In doing so, Musically Sublime shows that the binary distinction ~<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt14brzjk">Muscially Sublime: Indeterminacy, Infinity, Irresolvability</a><br>
  Abstract: The sublime is not only duplicitous in its paradox of pleasure and pain, but also in its “double mode” of a quieter and a more violent sublime: what John Baillie called the sedate sublime and the sublime mixed with pathos—and what Kant, of course, called the mathematical and the dynamical sublime.¹ Usually, critics interpret these two varieties of the Kantian sublime experience as pertaining to theoretical or speculative and practical reason respectively. They can, however, also be elucidated by pointing to the eighteenth-century cult of the sublime as being a cult of empty and vast but also of wild<br>

  Book Title: Science Fiction Double Feature-The Science Fiction Film as Cult Text<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): DUCHOVNAY GERALD<br>
  Abstract: Critical discussion of cult cinema has often noted its tendency to straddle or ignore boundaries, to pull together different sets of conventions, narrative formulas, or character types for the almost surreal pleasure to be found in their sudden juxtapositions or narrative combination. With its own boundary-blurring nature—as both science and fiction, reality and fantasy—science fiction has played a key role in such cinematic cult formation. This volume examines that largely unexplored relationship, looking at how the sf film’s own double nature neatly matches up with a persistent double vision common to the cult film. It does so by bringing together an international array of scholars to address key questions about the intersections of sf and cult cinema: how different genre elements, directors, and stars contribute to cult formation; what role fan activities, including “con" participation, play in cult development; and how the occulted or “bad" sf cult film works. The volume pursues these questions by addressing a variety of such sf cult works, including Robot Monster (1953), Zardoz (1974), A Boy and His Dog (1975), Tetsuo: The Iron Man (1989), Space Truckers (1996), Ghost in the Shell 2 (2004), and Iron Sky (2012). What these essays afford is a revealing vision of both the sf aspects of much cult film activity and the cultish aspects of the whole sf genre.<br>

  Abstract: In the concluding lines of
                  Why We Read Fiction, Lisa Zunshine writes, “I can say that I personally read fiction because it offers a pleasurable and intensive workout for my Theory of Mind” (2006, 164). Zunshine’s argument is well known: we feel attracted to fiction because it affords opportunities for exercising our “theory of mind” (our capacity to attribute mental states to other subjects), thus functioning as some sort of cognitive “weightlifting” (124–25). In discussing this gymnastic metaphor, Zunshine is careful to uncouple the pleasure provided by reading fictional characters’ minds from its real-world consequences, adding that “[just] as<br>

Ehrenburg’s semi-fictional chronicle of the rise of the AUTOMOBILE can help us understand the specific, paradoxical ways that different subjects experience automobility in a world that is increasingly linked through technologies yet profoundly uneven.

  Book Title: Love and its Critics-From the Song of Songs to Shakespeare and Milton’s Eden<br>
  Publisher: Open Book Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Movsesian Arpi<br>
  Abstract: This book is a history of love and the challenge love offers to the laws and customs of its times and places, as told through poetry from the Song of Songs to John Milton’s Paradise Lost. It is also an account of the critical reception afforded to such literature, and the ways in which criticism has attempted to stifle this challenge. Bryson and Movsesian argue that the poetry they explore celebrates and reinvents the love the troubadour poets of the eleventh and twelfth centuries called fin’amor: love as an end in itself, mutual and freely chosen even in the face of social, religious, or political retribution. Neither eros nor agape, neither exclusively of the body, nor solely of the spirit, this love is a middle path. Alongside this tradition has grown a critical movement that employs a 'hermeneutics of suspicion', in Paul Ricoeur’s phrase, to claim that passionate love poetry is not what it seems, and should be properly understood as worship of God, subordination to Empire, or an entanglement with the structures of language itself – in short, the very things it resists. The book engages with some of the seminal literature of the Western canon, including the Bible, the poetry of Ovid, and works by English authors such as William Shakespeare and John Donne, and with criticism that stretches from the earliest readings of the Song of Songs to contemporary academic literature. Lively and enjoyable in its style, it attempts to restore a sense of pleasure to the reading of poetry, and to puncture critical insistence that literature must be outwitted. It will be of value to professional, graduate, and advanced undergraduate scholars of literature, and to the educated general reader interested in treatments of love in poetry throughout history.<br>

Sometimes if one is quick and nimble enough, one can even catch the process of “reconstructing” one’s past in memory on the hop, that is, one can recall the original impression and also the gradual way in which it began to fade, shift, and be transformed. Very occasionally, the original experience is so vivid, one cannot help thinking it is preserved in the mind in a form that excludes serious error or uncertainty<br>

  Abstract: ‘Letters’ (
                  grammata) can mean ‘letters of the alphabet’ and also ‘epistles’ in Greek as in English. Novels contain letters of both kinds, and offer two different perspectives on the blind point of desire. Letters in the broad sense, that is to say the floating ruse of the novel as a written text, provide erotic tension on the level of the reading experience. There is a triangular circuit running from the writer to the reader to the characters in the story; when its circuit-points connect, the difficult pleasure of paradox can be felt like an electrification.

These we realize throughout our lives as we participate in practices, which are but the expression of our goods. More often than not, we carry those practices out prereflectively, habitually, expressing goods that are so closely integrated and harmonious with each other that we are barely aware that they are there.

Freud’s theory of sexuality, therefore, can only be understood when it is confronted with his theory of jokes. Surprisingly, such a simultaneous reading ofJokesandThree Essaysleads us very far away from the classical interpretation of Freud’s theory of sexuality and especially from his later theory centred on the Oedipus complex.

They are questions voiced by the reader who, in pleasure and patience, has read Derrida’s work, but who now, perhaps impatiently, wants to question the demand that is placed on him or her by that work.

                  The Light of Knowledge. In it, Cody brilliantly analyzes the work of the Arivoli Iyakkam, one of the largest literacy movements in the world, which mobilized millions across Tamil Nadu between 1990 and 2009. The Arivoli Iyakkam sought to increase the political participation and leverage of rural women and aspired to help them attain new, enlightened autonomy through literate access to science and knowledge. A range of socialist literacy movements inspired the movement, especially Paulo Freire’s “pedagogy of the oppressed.” Beginning as a volunteer-driven, nongovernmental project, such<br>

  Abstract: The audacity of Solon’s pronouncement is that it imagines a happiness that is possible for finite beings. Solon’s proverb simply requires that we judge a life’s narrative as we find it: is this life happy or unhappy? It does not specify any content to happiness in advance. Nor does it specify any criteria for happiness that would place it out of the reach of a finite being, such as the continuity of pleasure or satisfaction or the optimization of wealth. The hermeneutic of happiness is not a quest for perfection or a pure state, since there is nothing uncontaminated in<br>

  Abstract: My first ever visit to Spain occurred at the age of eighteen, on a school exchange from my sixth form college with a school near Valencia. I remember little of the trip, except that my small amount of Spanish was laughably inadequate for most situations and that, as a vegetarian at the time, eating was usually no pleasure – while my host family enjoyed eating octopus, much to my horror, I was provided with a bowl of boiled cauliflower. My second visit, a year later as an undergraduate languages student, was more successful. I flew out to stay with a<br>

  Book Title: Love and Death in Goethe-`One and Double'<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Dye Ellis<br>
  Abstract: Goethe, in association with his younger Romantic compatriots the Schlegels, Novalis, Fichte, and Schelling, struggled with the subject-object dichotomy, and tried to bridge the gap between self and other, consciousness and nature. His theory and practice prefigured the Romantics' determination to display and interrogate the linguistic and cultural structures informing their own thinking and modes of representation--what Goethe calls one's "Vorstellungsart." His work exploits, subverts, and supplants inherited conventions and signs, demonstrating with virtuosic irony that literature is a system of texts, pre-texts, and pre-established but dynamic conceptual models. 'Love and Death in Goethe:"One and Double"' explores Goethe's use, in a wide range of his poetry and prose, of the theme of 'Liebestod' (love and death) and related embodiments of the paradox of unity in duality. Ellis Dye also examines Goethe's use of other themes related to love and death--the 'femme fatale', the 'vagina dentata, Frau Welt', the Lorelei, venereal disease, the 'Lustmord' --and considers issues of selfhood and individuation as well as the possibility that the love-death theme contains an implicit gender bias toward the existential fact of personal separateness. Poems, plays, and novels are dealt with, nevertheless, as works of art, not only as illustrations of an idea or as points of intersection in a system of rhetorical conventions, and are examined for intellectual cohesiveness, elegance, and integrity of design as well as special meanings and effects. ' Love and Death in Goethe:"One and Double" ' explores the meaning of the central theme of Romantic poetry in the works of the most important Romantic poet of all. Students of literary culture, both the lay reader and the Goethe specialist, will be enlightened by its approach and find pleasure and instruction in its revelations. Robert Ellis Dye is professor of German at Macalester College.<br>

  Abstract: It was a pleasure to read a sober yet hopeful assessment of the condition Europe finds itself at the present. It is both a relevant analysis for European politicians as well as an intellectual challenge so needed in the contemporary, often cynical, often superficial discourse about all things European. A remark from the text could become a motto for the EU in the best of our enlightenment and liberal traditions: “There is no essence of Europe, no fixed list of European values.

  Abstract: That sensual pleasure in this world is praised and, indeed, enjoined in Muslim tradition when it occurs within the bounds of legitimate union, requires no demonstration. Equally evident is the discouragement of serious forms of long-term asceticism and of carnal self-denial, over and above what some Sufis might adopt during periods of initiation and devotional isolation (
                  khalwa). The repudiation of pleasure characteristic of Christian traditions in general¹ is almost entirely absent, and monastic life with its various forms of physical self-immolation was frequently the object of derision by Muslim authors, who often regarded it as something contrary to what God<br>

Historical progress is the domain of rationality, pleasure, and increase, where the supreme law is the law of subordination; details have to become parts of wholes, individuals parts of communities, and the environment and subjectivity must be harmonized for the sake of pleasure and according to the dictates of desire.

Abstract: There has been a need for a volume such as this in courses in applied or practical ethics. It can be paired with
      Animal LiberationorThe Case for Animal Rightsor—if the course has a broader, multi‐issue focus—it can serve as a stand‐alone introduction to the topic of the moral status of nonhuman animals. It might also be used as an intermediary between, say,Animal Liberation(setting out a “pro” position) and Peter Carruthers’sThe Animals Issue(setting out a “con” position). However it is used, the book will give students an appreciation for the power, subtlety, and fairness of philosophical analysis and criticism. The book is meticulously edited and elegantly written. Despite the depressing (and sometimes distressing) subject matter, it is a pleasure to read.<br>

Abstract: Dante Alighieri,

According to Thomas Aquinas, the resurrected body will shine more brightly than the sun, which burns the eye. Yet, because its light will emanate from the soul, it will only give pleasure to the blessed. See Thomas Aquinas,Summa theologica,trans. Fathers of the English Dominican Province, 5 vols. (Westminster, Mar., 1981), suppl. QQ. 85, art. 2, 5:2914. For Dante, virtually the entire experience of paradise is a confrontation with unbearable light—“battaglia de’ debili cigli” (P,bk. 23, l. 78, p. 294). The poet even suffers temporary blindness when he tries to see through the light that emanates from Saint John’s soul in order to see the saint’s body, which according to legend had ascended directly to Paradise; seeP,bk. 25, pp. 314–25.<br>

Abstract: Concerning this split within myself, this
         quaestio, two other texts confirm just how much it renders me alien to myself. Nothing defines me more intimately than my memory (“ipsum me non dicam praeter illam”);8how then can I not only forget, but (and how would I know it otherwise?) remember that I have forgotten that which I have, nonetheless, forgotten? How do I remember that I have forgotten what I no longer remember (“mihi certum est meminisse me oblivionem,” “ipsam oblivionem meminisse me certus sum”)? It would be just as absurd to reply that I have forgotten what I have forgotten in another memory than my own, and have retained memory of oblivion in my memory, as it would be to claim that oblivion remains in my memory so that I do not forget it like I have forgotten what I forgot there. There thus remains for me nothing else but to admit that I have kept in memory the image of the forgotten, but not that which I have forgotten; and I can only conclude from this that my memory, my very inner being, escapes me, and that “factus sum mihi terra difficultatis” (“I have become for myself a soil which is a cause of difficulty”), so that I can only question myself, and question God: “Hoc animus est, et hoc ego ipse sum. Quid ergo sum, Deus meus? Quae natura sum?” (“This is mind, this is I myself. What then am I, my God? What is my nature?”).9Thus if my own memory renders me a stranger to myself, how could I not also become other than myself in the experience of my will? Indeed, in my dreams at night, how can I involuntarily give in to actual pleasure, when in the waking state I am able to push aside erotic images? There is only one answer: “Numquid tunc ego non sum? Et tamen tantum interest inter me ipsum et me ipsum intra momentum” (“During this time of sleep surely it is not my true self, Lord my God? Yet how great a difference between myself and myself in a [single] moment”).10In a single moment I clearly discover myself to be someone other than my self, I a~<br>

Abstract: Lydia Cochrane first told me this story in 1992/93, and reconfirmed it May 31, 2003 (personal communication). She remembers that in the Braudels’ desire to reciprocate the endless round of dinners offered them in April 1968 during their first month in Hyde Park, she accompanied Mme. Braudel around all of Chicago searching for a couscous pan that Mme. Braudel might use for a return dinner to repay the hospitality they had received. The Braudels’ North African dinner was scheduled for Saturday May 4, and this led Braudel to downplay the increasingly urgent telephone calls and news of May 1, 1968 coming from Paris. “What I remember with greatest pleasure,” Lydia Cochrane writes (personal correspondence, November 6, 2003), “is trying to sympathize with M. Braudel in his supposed anxiety and getting the answer. ‘J’en ai vu d’autres,’ with an Olympian shrug of the shoulders.” Finally convinced of the gravity of May 1968, the Braudels decided that as soon as their Hyde Park couscous dinner was completed, they would fly back to Paris and forgo the rest of the spring quarter.<br>

Abstract: What is a cyborg? Haraway provides different descriptions, all of which emphasize the cyborg’s partial, shifting, nontotalizing, and subversive nature:
         
               
            A cyborg is a cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and organism, a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction. (Haraway
            1991, 149)
               
            The cyborg is resolutely committed to partiality, irony, intimacy, and perversity. It is oppositional, utopian, and completely without innocence. (
            1991, 151)
               The cyborg is a resource for two major domains: the new computerized and globalized mode of production and the need for a broad though not totalizing feminist solidarity. The idea of the cyborg, derived from the human‐machine figures of science fiction, provides a resource, Haraway suggests, for combating the information‐based society of late capitalism, which has intensified domination in new ways. She argues that the preponderance of computer technology in creating antilabor household economies and globalization can be significantly challenged by embracing the breaching of the human‐machine border signified by the cyborg. For feminism, the cyborg promises possibilities other than those based on the maternal, the pre‐Oedipal, or the universalizing. The cyborg provides “pleasure in the confusion of boundaries” (Holistic politics depend on metaphors of birth and invariably call on the resources of reproductive sex. I would suggest that cyborgs have more to do with regeneration. … We require regeneration, not rebirth, and the possibility for our reconstitution includes the utopian dream of the hope for a monstrous world without gender. (
            1991, 181)1991, 150) and critiques the imperialism of a common feminist language. Haraway’s aspiration is to provide an image for a politics that can “embrace partial, contradictory, permanently unclosed constructions of personal and collective selves and still be f~<br>

Abstract: Such distinctions have had an enormous influence through the ages over Christianity. Augustine’s
         Confessions, for example, continually signifies wayward human existence through the trope of his early life as a teacher of “rhetoric,” since here, “through clouds of smoke,” he and his companions used the art of poetics to become “deceivers and deceived in all our different aims and ambitions.”6Poetic cleverness is contrasted with his later life after conversion when he is finally and eternally anchored by God’s unchanging moral righteousness, a place beyond mere worldly appearances that brings him to an invisible peace and rest. Augustine exhibits a deep, and to us today rather surprising, antipathy toward the theater, which he accuses of teaching audiences to find pleasure in imaginary pain instead of painfully confessing the awful truth of their sinfulness; only in this way is one opened up to the true enjoyment of God.7He likewise undertakes virulent criticisms inThe City of Godof the made “images” worshipped in Roman idolatry, which he opposes to the Christian worship of the one true invisible Maker beyond any possible human imitation.8<br>

Abstract: “I chose this story above all others because it’s a story I’m struggling to end. … That’s why I write fiction—so that I can keep telling the story. … Always a new beginning, a different end,” Winterson writes toward the close of her narrative (
         2005, 137). Linking the desire for retelling with the inability to formulate a conclusion and the necessity for an open ending, Winterson has Atlas walk away, yet presents this “very particular end not found elsewhere” (xiv) as but one possibility among several, the choice of which is ultimately left to the individual reader’s personal preference: “no one knows its composition,” Winterson observes. “Dark matter could be conventional matter, … or it could even be black holes. Or it could be Atlas holding up the universe. But I think it is Atlas and Laïka walking away” (2005, 151).Weight’s multiperspectival ending underscores its status as inaugural retelling of myth for a twenty‐first century that can only assimilate more pasts into its ever broadening present. In this sense, the Myths seems typical for the contemporary take on re‐vision. Whereas the names of the authors hold the promise of retellings with a critical edge—Achebe having given usThings Fall Apartas a reply to and a thorough undermining of Joseph Conrad’sHeart of Darkness(see Moyers1989; Achebe1990), and neither Atwood nor Winterson is a stranger to rewriting as cultural critique—Winterson’s phrase and its appropriation by the series’ editor make us suspect differently. “We want to tell the story again,” as the series’ editor Jamie Byng puts it on Canongate’s Web site, speaks of the storyteller’s desire for and delight in language; of the pleasure of telling stories, of keeping the stories alive by retelling them. Inevitably also meaning “we want tosellthe story again,” retelling becomes a retailing strategy, promising ever new and improved reading experiences that are as ephemeral as any other consumer experience. Speaking neither of learning from the p~<br>

Abstract: Jean Santeuil, the protagonist of Proust’s eponymous and second aborted novel, may be considered a predecessor of Marcel in
         À la recherche du temps perdu.48The narrator ofJean Santeuilrefers to Jean’s “contemplation” as the practice, superior to “pleasure, thought, and memory,” which, willfully embraced, and fueled by imagination, gives us back our “soul” as an aggregate of the “relics of our life.”49In this novel already, as he will later do inÀ la recherche du temps perdu, Proust postulates imagination as a faculty that, unable to apply itself directly either to present circumstances or to past memories,50“floats” around those past realities that are “captured” (prise) by present experience via the mediation of memory.51Although it adheres to Bergson’s principle of “harmonization” between present impression and analogous recollection,52Jean’s contemplation contradicts Bergson’s advocacy of a constantly transformative, hands‐on intervention on reality. When one talks of contemplation in Proust, in fact, obligatory reference must be made to Schopenhauer, whose influence on the French writer was certainly not inferior to Bergson’s.53<br>

Abstract: Viewing grief and indignation as potentially virtuous seems odd given the tendency to construe virtue in positive terms, as ennobling or self‐enhancing. We typically associate the virtues with a good and genuinely happy life, and surely those positive features characterize the virtues.
         49But that fact should not prevent us from seeing how responses to loss and disconnection can also be expressions of moral excellence. Virtue, Aristotle writes, means feeling pleasure and pain in the right way. Schooled in the virtues, we should feel “at the right times, with reference to the right objects, towards the right people, with the right motive, and in the right way,” as he says of strong and noble character.50Casting similar ideas in Christian terms, Augustine writes, “Citizens of the Holy City of God, as they live by God’s standards in the pilgrimage of this present life, feel fear and desire, pain and gladness in conformity with the holy Scriptures and sound doctrine; and because their love is right, all these feelings are right in them.”51<br>

Author(s): Andrew Dudley<br>
Abstract: It is explicitly cinema's contribution of new concepts that prompts Rodowick, in another state‐of‐the‐field article, to hitch both Deleuze and Stanley Cavell to an enterprise within “philosophy” rather than within “theory,” whose energy he declares to be drained.
         47For theory seems too programmatic and imperious, whether driven by science in Althusser's sense (Grand Theory) or by models taken from natural and cognitive science (posttheory). Defending the latter, in a rebuke to Rodowick, Malcolm Turvey proudly reminds us that once continental film studies had been deracinated from the anglophone field, thanks largely to the relentless analyses of Noël Carroll, room was cleared for specific, targeted, and useful work. Turvey runs through a litany of recent and distinct gains in theories of emotion, editing, perception, imagination, pleasure, music, comprehension, interpretation, character identification, narrative, and suspense.48While those who write books and articles in these areas invariably do so by turning to well‐developed notions in the social sciences or philosophy, they do so, Turvey believes, from the strength of their own discipline. Here he connects to something I have been advocating all along; “most of us are not philosophers, sociologists, or economists butfilmscholars. What this means is that, at the end of the day, we have to use our expertise—gained from watching large numbers of films, observing them and the response of viewers to them carefully, and learning about the contexts in which they were made and exhibited—to evaluate the theories we take from other disciplines in terms of whether they successfully explain (or not) film.”49<br>

Abstract: Susanne Mrozik’s
      Virtuous Bodiesrepresents a significant contribution to this current rethinking of religion and Buddhist studies. The author explicitly locates her approach within the interdisciplinary field of feminist studies while also effectively placing the subject of her analysis, Śāntideva’sCompendium of Training(Śikṣ āsamuccaya), in dialogue with the work of such scholars as Michel Foucault, Elizabeth Grosz, Paul Ricoeur, and Charles Hallisey. In one respect, this study can be seen as quite traditional: the author develops her argument through a close reading of an influential Buddhist text, paying careful attention to the subtleties of its Sanskrit vocabulary and attempting to situate it within the medieval North Indian monastic milieu within which it took shape. This textual analysis provides the basis on which Mrozik advances toward the first stated goal of her work, to correct “the widespread misconception in scholarship on Buddhism and Buddhist ethics that South Asian Buddhists (with the exception of practitioners of Vajrayana or Tantric Buddhism) ascribed little value to bodies” (6). And Mrozik succeeds admirably in this regard, skillfully articulating how diverse and often seemingly contradictory perspectives on human embodiment come together in support of a religious ideal in which the “bodied being” (ātmabhāva) of bodhisattvas, interacting with the bodies of those whom they aim to liberate, plays a foundational role. Having first identified two dominant and contrasting somatic discourses in theCompendium of Training, one “physiomoral” and the other “ascetic,” Mrozik argues that the text presents a coherent ethical perspective, one in which “an ascetic discourse is in service of producing a range of virtuous bodied beings, valued for their physical as well as moral qualities” (116). As she notes, ascetic disciplines are grounded in an implicit assumption that embodiment matters greatly, even if these disciplines or “technologies of the self” ~<br>

Abstract: Rather, the category of literature is troubling for Lévinas. On the one hand, it is clear that a number of Lévinas's most important influences are literary. His recently published
         Carnets de captivitédevotes considerable attention to Proust as a source for his analysis of sociality and even include notes and plans for his own novel.15In later works he quotes Alyosha Karamazov almost as frequently as Descartes.16On the other hand, he is also at times quite damning of literature as an aesthetic pursuit. His most critical statements about literature appear in “Reality and Its Shadow.” Published at the end of 1948, ten months after Blanchot's “Literature and the Right to Death,” this essay is a response to both Blanchot and Sartre's “What Is Literature?” Lévinas condemns literature here as fundamentally escapist. “The poet exiles himself from the city,” he writes. Speaking of artistic pleasure more generally, he adds, “There are times when one could be ashamed of it, as if carousing in a town struck by the plague.”17He does not have much sympathy for catharsis.<br>

Abstract: In saying this, I am not arguing that Marlowe “appropriated” the sacred from its dominant institutional contexts. On the contrary, the rumors of devils appearing on the Faustian stage belie that model of the relationship between the dramatic and the theological in which the theater evacuates the spiritual content from theological forms only to stage those forms within a sphere of rational disenchantment that supposedly frames the experience of a play.
   41Such a model relies on a modern, indeed modernist, understanding of theater as a compartmentalized zone of experience where entertainment has no further end than its own production and consumption, and where aesthetic efficacy, if it exists at all, remains limited to art's ability to contain the contradictions of ideology. Theatrical representation clearly had a certain kind of autonomy in Marlowe's England, produced and consumed as it was in its own institutional space, yet at the same time, as I hope I have been able to show, that very representation could be understood by antitheatrical writers and theatergoers alike as an instrument that had theological ends. Another way to put this claim is to say that theater was not always understood as a disenchanted product of human agency. When the reformers argued that Satan staged theater pieces through the instrumentality of the magician to the end of creating beliefs in the audience that would augment his own power, they were quite capable of imagining that such spectacles were well-crafted illusions without needing to go on to posit that the devil was an ideological fiction. The rumors of the Faustian devils powerfully demonstrate that even representations that announced their own theatricality—even illusions that were institutionally marked out as such—could still be understood as having theological consequences. Those who believed that the devil came when Faustus called him may have been fully invested in their faith, but they were never so gullible as to believe ~<br>

Abstract: All these questions deserve a place on the agenda as we determine the ethnographic and theoretical place of morality in contemporary anthropology. This brings us back finally to the question of whether indeed it is necessary or valuable to understand morality as a “cultural system.” Recall that Geertz’s intent was to identify systems of cultural symbols as distinct from social forces and psychological motives operating in those domains. The cultural systems he mentions include religion, ideology, science, common sense, and art (
         1973,1975,1976), so our question is whether morality can be placed among them. If a religion as a cultural system is “a cluster of sacred symbols, woven into some kind of ordered whole” (1973:129), and ideologies are to be examined “as systems of interacting symbols, as patterns of interworking meanings” (207), can the same be said of a morality? Perhaps on this level a society’s moral system is undergirded by a selection of symbolic oppositions such as good/bad, good/evil, right/wrong, virtue/vice.
               Perhaps these oppositions generate metaphorical equivalents such as white/black, lightness/darkness, above/below; inflect experiential states such as pleasure/pain, love/hate, health/illness; define social categories such as human rights and human trafficking, existential states such as salvation and damnation, and mythical figures such as deity and demon or saint and witch. Before one objects that this formulation appears too dualistic, note that it cannot be dichotomous categories in themselves that are objectionable, since the very idea of moral choice or judgment and ethical decision or dilemma presume at least two options. If good/bad or good/evil seem problematic, are good/better or good/not-as-good more satisfactory? Emphasizing the latter may appear to be opting for a Classical as opposed to a Christian (or Abrahamic) moral sensibility, but it may also be construed as preferring an elitist ethics where one has the ~<br>

Abstract: But perhaps I go too far in giving such ethical weight to a stage play written and presented primarily as an entertainment. In spite of the early moderns’ enthusiasm for poetry’s ability to delight and to instruct, art and ethics are not identical. In fact, the distance between them can be such that we might wonder whether they are ever in alignment, whether art can ever bring about an ethical end. If the ethical is imagined as an encounter with radical alterity, what can be the value of the simulation? On this question, Levinas is equivocal, if not contradictory. On the one hand, he distrusts art as an escape or an evasion. Art can give us selfish pleasure and enable our flight from the real world, thereby offering us false transcendence. In this respect, art is an idol: a lifeless object put in place of the other. On the other hand, Levinas openly acknowledges his philosophical debts to the great authors of Russia and western Europe and frequently refers to their literary works in his own writings. (The most obvious example is the line from
      The Brothers Karamazovthat Levinas adopts as his motto, quoting it no less than twelve times in his published work.)
            The best authors, Levinas will say, not only recognize and resist art’s idolatrous potential but also wrestle with core philosophical questions, such as the meaning of life and the meaning of the human. In this way, the best art can prepare one for authors like Plato and Kant. What is more, it can also model the way out of being. According to Levinas, good art can imitate a form of ethical discourse by continually interrupting itself and calling itself into question.58

Abstract: In the context of the poem’s obsession with manufacturing satanic speech, these seemingly trivial lines may hold the key to understanding the fate of the serpent. Teskey provides another helpful gloss: “Satan emits sound through the serpent either by using the serpent’s tongue or by emitting pulses of air, which make sound by vibrating in the elongated tube of the serpent’s body.”
         
               In pursuing the question of who ultimately speaks the words that seduce Eve, we are led to the perhaps unexpected question—Is the serpent more like a singer or more like a trumpet? If the latter is true, if Satan merely emitted pulses of air through his body, then surely the serpent is innocent (we might imagine two serpentine fangs hanging like quotation marks over his mouth, signifying that the pulses of air that glide through them have their true origin in another). But what if the serpent used his own tongue? What if he was inspired by Satan and took some pleasure in shaping those seductive syllables? What if he experienced the satanic voice uniquely as his own, even for a moment—as we saw comically in the case of Raphael and tragically in the case of Adam? How well, we might ask, did the serpent govern his tongue?38<br>

Abstract: The meaning of
         catharsisin Aristotle’sPoeticsis heavily debated, with most interpretations clustering around three key translations: purgation, purification, and clarification. In his 1599 treatise on tragicomedy, Giambattista Guarini likened catharsis to the medical procedure of purging, as neither seeks eradication of the target element but instead restoration of balance (The Compendium of Tragicomic Poetry (1599), inLiterary Criticism: Plato to Dryden, ed. Allan H. Gilbert [Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1962], 517–20; see also O. B. Hardison Jr., “Three Types of Renaissance Catharsis,” inPoetics and Praxis, Understanding and Imagination: The Collected Essays of O. B. Hardison, Jr.[Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1997], 78–94). Martha C. Nussbaum has characterized catharsis as a “clearing up” or “cleaning up” of emotions (“Tragedy and Self-Sufficiency: Plato and Aristotle on Fear and Pity,” inEssays on Aristotle’sPoetics, ed. Amélie Oksenberg Rorty [Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1992], 280), and Gerald F. Else has argued that catharsis is a purification of the act of the character rather than a purgation of the emotions of the audience (Aristotle’s Poetics: The Argument[Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1963], 230–31, 422–40). John P. Anton, critiquing Nietzsche’s reading of Aristotle’sPoetics, argues that Nietzsche was incorrect in construing catharsis as a purge of emotions, also claiming that it is a clarification of events (“Nietzsche’s Critique of Aristotle’s Theory of Tragic Emotions,” inTragedy and Philosophy, ed. N. Georgopoulos [New York: St. Martin’s, 1993], 19–38). In light of this ongoing debate about the meaning of a single Greek word, several critics have suggested other language and models through which to examine the phenomenon of audience response to tragedy—a useful critical strategy for discussing how modern audiences might conceptualize their own reaction to what they see on stage.

Abstract: The fact that working drawings were portrayed alternately as neutral and purely practical devices and as products of an activity that brought pleasure, pride, and the intimacy of touch succumbs to various interpretations.
         
               Whatever the explanation, "joy in the act of drawing" was known to the authors of these articles—and to the majority of the profession.88
            
               Stories about principals in well-established architectural offices who themselves engaged in the production of working drawings are another recurrent theme in these articles.89
            
               Architects of such different backgrounds and creative philosophies as Swartwout, Henry Bacon, Cass Gilbert, and Louis Sullivan produced working drawings. Surely all of them shared the "pride in [their] skills and the pleasure that comes with the mastery of the craft."90
            
               It was a byproduct of Beaux-Arts education, whose impact on architectural production transcended questions of style.91

Abstract: Caryl Phillips's narrative is painfully concerned with the relationship of Empire, Colony, and the In-between; Europe, Africa, and the Caribbean; slavery, rebellion, and freedom; Men, women and children; absent or useless fathers and damaged, aimless sons. It explores what hold in common while never losing sight of the painful quotidian, the specific. It is a narrative where the picaresque shakes hands with the epic and the linearity is broken, encircled, and put fast forward or in reverse by a mise-en-abîme of sorts: the tale-within-the-tale-within-the-tale even if interrupted by the tapestry of an emergent voice that finally proposes itself as both the identity and the difference of its verbal universe. "Enter your own self and discover the world," Phillips seems to be saying, "but also go out into the world and discover yourself." Once that call is answered, fiction itself becomes another way of questioning truth as we strive for it through the paradox of a lie. That lie can be called the imagination. It can also be seen as a parallel reality. For it may be observed as a critical mirror of what passes for the truth in the world of convention. It certainly sets up a second universe of being, where the narrator, say Cambridge in Cambridge, has a reality greater, though no less important, than the host of hastily met and then forgotten people we deal with on a daily basis. It is in this sense that Phillips brings into light another way of telling in that his narrative gives weight and presence to the virtues and vices—the fugitive personalities—of our daily acquaintance. This is the prerogative of his style, which I try to discuss in this essay. It has the power to render disenchantment and pleasure without resolving the contradiction between them. In fact, what holds them in tension, as equal forces straining in opposite directions, is the artist's mature subjectivity, stripped of hubris, unashamed either of its fallibility or of the modest assurance it has gained ~<br>

Abstract: Drawing attention to the complex reciprocal relationship between commercialized leisure and commercial literature in the so-called "Age of Wit," this essay reconceives of the witty and witless in two important ways. Taking for granted, first of all, that wit is usually analyzed in terms of the efficacy of verbal language, the essay examines how and why debates concerning true and false wit were played out in physical terms—in this case, through the motions, gestures, and attitudes of the dancing body. Second of all, the essay attempts to account for the enduring, if unwitting, attractions of "false wit" by likening it to the tricks and transformations of contemporary English pantomime. Satirists of the 1720s, 1730s, and 1740s frequently invoke the unmeaning motion of Harlequin as a visual way of proscribing the verbal excesses of extravagant language. At the same time, apologists for pantomime associate Harlequin's "dumb Wit" with truth, reason, and the pattern of nature, claiming that the genre's corporeality allowed it to transcend the limitations and equivocations of words. The essay concludes that the popularity of pantomime contextualizes the Augustan reaction against false wit, in that it identifies a source of aesthetic pleasure in the public's eagerness to be duped by apparent sameness in difference. Early eighteenth-century readers enjoy luxuriant, illogical, and mixed metaphors, forced similes, and trifling jibes and quibbles for the same reason that early eighteenth-century spectators delight in the unexpected turns of pantomimic entertainment: in a world under the sway of Harlequin's magical slapstick, audiences derive satisfaction from being deceived.<br>

Abstract: The article tries to combine literature and anthropology by focusing on the >anthropotechnical< implications of the novel. As the most important medium of contemporary literature, the novel in a way >creates< man. Its forms and contents establish a kind of logic (logos) that deeply influences the self-description of individuals and of cultures and societies around the millenium. Considering the literary phenomenon as an experience that is both aesthetic and ethical, it can be called >novelology< (Romanologie). The huge success of novels such as Freedom by Jonathan Franzen and Der Turm by Uwe Tellkamp shows that readers appreciate even long and difficult narratives and finds aesthetic pleasure in complex semantic and literary patterns.<br>

Abstract: Since several well known critics have recently declared that the golden age of literary theory has come to an end, this might be the moment to rethink a theoretical problem that attracted some interest in the academic world from the late 1970s to the early 1990s: the relationship between historiography and literary criticism. Although the histoire des mentalités has given the literary text an unprecedented status in the reconstruction of the collective imaginary and although the discussion of similarities between forms of narrative in historical and fictional texts has undoubtedly intensified the dialogue between historiography and literary criticism, some aspects have been overlooked in the debate of the last twenty to thirty years. First, for both types of texts, fictional as well as historiographic, the wide range of narrative and representational strategies has not been taken into account; second, more recent narratological methods of analysis have not been applied to historiographic texts; third, the interest for the narrative character of historiographic texts can be found almost exclusively among literary critics and philosophers and much less among historians; and fourth, the analysis of narrative structures inside and outside the limits of fictional writing has eclipsed the main characteristic of literary texts, their inherent potential to produce pleasure.<br>

Abstract: Les frontispices des livres de médailles publiés entre la fin du XVIe et le milieu du XVIIIe siècle résument les conceptions et les intentions des numismates, manifestant l'ancien statut de la « science des médailles », non point science auxiliaire, mais quasi égale de l'histoire. Ils font d'abord l'éloge des médailles elles-mêmes, source de connaissance et divertissement : de là ces scènes de théâtre, ces arcs de triomphe, ces guirlandes, ces festons où monnaies et médaillons tiennent une large place. Les allégories de Clio et de Chronos, voisinant avec des monnaies sorties de terre, illustrent le lien entre la numismatique et l'histoire ; mais elles désignent aussi les médailles comme des parcelles d'éternité, échappées à la fuite du temps, objets offerts à la vénération autant qu'à l'étude. L'allégorie de Rome témoigne enfin à quelle époque vont les préférences de numismates tout imprégnés de culture classique : la monnaie de la Rome impériale est pour eux la médaille par excellence et préfigure celles du roi-soleil. Die Frontispizen der zwischen dem ausgehenden 16. Jh. und der Mitte des 18. Jh.s veröffentlichten Münzbücher spiegeln die Grundhaltung der Numismaten wider, für die althergebrachte 'Münzkunde' keine Hilfswissenschaft darstellt, sondern eine eigene Disziplin mit gleicher Dignität wie die Historie. Die Münzen werden als Quelle von Kenntnis und Zerstreuung gefeiert : In Theaterszenen, Triumphbögen, Girlanden und bei Festen werden Münzen und Medaillen an prominenter Stellen eingeführt. Die Allegorien von Clio und Chronos neben Münzen, die aus der Erde heraufsteigen, verbildlichen die Verbindung zwischen Numismatik und Geschichte ; zugleich weisen sie den Medaillen Ewigkeitswert zu : Als Wertstücken, die dem Lauf der Zeit entzogen und der Verehrung wie dem Studium anheimgestellt sind. Die Allegorie von Rom bezeugt schließlich die Hinwendung der Numismatiker zur Schlüsselepoche der für sie alles beherrschenden klassischen Kultur : Die Münzen des römischen ~<br>

Abstract: C'est d'abord s'étonner de la place qu'occupe dans l'œuvre novatrice de Freud la culture antique. Retracer l'itinéraire de la rencontre avec Œdipe, c'est faire comme un état des lieux. L'Interprétation des Rêves, Totem et Tabou, L'Homme Moïse et la religion monothéiste, mais aussi des articles moins connus, des extraits de sa correspondance, contiennent des analyses inattendues, sur l'origine de la tragédie grecque, son évolution, sa fonction, sur la catharsis, le plaisir tragique, etc... Le but n'est pas d'apprécier la pertinence des réponses, mais de dégager l'originalité d'une démarche qui lie fiction et réalité, structure et histoire, passé et présent. And our first response will be to marvel at the importance of the culture of antiquity in Freud’s innovating work. Tracing up the stages of his encounter with Œdipus is tantamount to an inventory of fixtures. The Interpretation of Dreams, Totem and Taboo, The Man Moses and monotheistic religion, but also less known articles and extracts from his correspondence contain unexpected analyses on the origin of Greek tragedy, its evolution, its function, on catharsis, tragic pleasure, etc. Our aim is not to assess the relevance of the answers but to bring out the originality of a procedure that links up fiction and fact, structure and history, past and present<br>

Abstract: Martha Nussbaum furthers the understanding of our connection with the suffering hero in her discussion of empathy as the “imaginative reconstruction of the experience of the sufferer.” Empathy “involves a participatory enactment of the situation of the sufferer, but always combined with the awareness that one is not oneself the sufferer” (327). To be sure, people do not always empathize with others who are in pain. Empathy can be blocked, for example, by the kinds of conditioning that Germans were subjected to during the Nazi regime. However, it is also true that to be human is to reach out in gestures of empathy to others. People can even derive pleasure in feeling the pain of others, as Susan L. Feagin argues in “The Pleasure of Tragedy.” Pleasure from tragedy is a meta-response; and it is gratifying to know that there is “a unity of feeling among members of humanity, that we are not alone, and that these feelings are at the heart of morality itself” (103).<br>

Abstract: Without sovereignty and without ownership, we are responsible for what we cannot and do not control, for our unconscious fears and desires and their effects on others. The fragile hope is that by acknowledging the death drive within ourselves, we can begin to prevent killing and never give up trying to find ways to abolish death penalties in all their forms. The death drive is not the Kantian notion of death as the great equalizer but, rather, the tension in life itself, both destructive and creative, always conjoined with both pleasure and pain, joy and sorrow, and the ambiguities of life that not only exceed but also expose the fantasy of death as an absolute end point or final resting place. Far from the Perpetual Peace of the Dutch innkeeper's sign, with which Kant ironically opens his essay, the death drive is the force that fuels the fantasy of the end of life as everlasting peace.<br>

Abstract: Nonetheless, the cost of what increasingly felt like a quixotic struggle for a mere critic was high. In a November 1897 review titled “On Pleasure Bent,” Shaw views his job as corporeal trauma, concluding that “trials [as a theater critic] have injured my brain.”
      
            He relates that he has lately “suffered … from seeing Shakespeare butchered to make a cockney's holiday” and determined to have a “real experience of some kind, under conditions, especially as regards fresh air, as unlike those of the stalls as possible” (378, 372). To remedy the toxic, stuffy artificiality of the theater, he heads “into the country, [selects] a dangerous hill, and [rides] down it on a bicycle at full speed in the darkest part of the night” (373, 372–73). When the doctor apologizes for the pain attendant upon stitching up the resulting “excessive openness of [his] countenance,” Shaw proclaims that “to him who has endured points made by actors for nearly three years, the point of a surgeon's darning needle comes as delicious relief” (373). In his review, GBS is unable to resist an opportunity to contrast implicitly the modern urban doctor and health system predicated on the profit motive with the care delivered by an Irish rustic physician possessing an “unperverted consciousness of [a] benevolent and sensible life” (375). He also is concerned that his treatment will irrevocably alter his relationship to his job as a critic:13
         
            When the physician refuses to charge for the services rendered (allegedly when he detects the playwright's ethnicity through his accent), Shaw acknowledges that his seat in the theater is also providedI doubt if I shall ever see a play again without longing for the comparative luxury of that quiet country surgery, with the stillness without broken only by the distant song and throbbing drumbeat of some remote Salvation Army corps, and the needle, with its delicate realism, touching my sensibilities, stitch, stitch, stitch, with ~<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: The last twentieth-century utopist I will discuss is perhaps the most influential. Herbert Marcuse, a German immigrant of the Frankfurt school, wrote several books that explore utopian ideas. Although his ideas are Marxist, he draws most of his vocabulary from Freud and is considered a psychological utopian critic. He makes his claim, that capitalism causes dystopia, by using Freudian vocabulary to explain how social happiness would include more pleasure and the drive of
         erosin living, not only the fulfillment of a work ethic for its own sake. As a result, the key to Marcuse's positive utopia is the reeducation of desire: Individuals would then want a new lifestyle focusing on quality of life rather than quantity.

Abstract: The great builder of worlds denounces his own project—and therefore every totalizing, world-building literary or political enterprise, be it historical (epic) or fantastical (Utopian): “you have reared your disunited kingdom on the vacuum of your own most intensely doubtful soul.”
         
               
            134
            Ulyssesdoes not transcend the dystopian paralysis ofDubliners;
               but in the euphoria of Bloomsday it may take135
            Finnegans Waketo remind us of that.Ulyssesis a mock epic in the same way thatA Portrait of the Artist as a Young Manis mock-epiphanic: the young Stephen Dedalus's eager epiphanies—of family, sexuality, religion, romance, and philosophy—ultimately (when confronted with material circumstances) do not quite attain the transcendental climaxes he might have expected of them.Ulysses's Utopian cornucopia might thereby be seen as eventually as anticlimactic asDubliners's exotic dreams—the “Eastern enchantment” of “Araby.”
               But that would be to impose a closure upon136
            Ulysses—or, for that matter, uponFinnegans Wake—that the text stridently resists. It is not that these texts fail to attain their visions; it is just that they have not done so yet. Their endings (if they can be said to have endings) are therefore not so much anticlimactic as affirmingly preclimactic. As such, they seem to represent a mode of that “foreplay” that Jacques Derrida sees as the province of literary pleasures. But while Derrida views such textual pleasure as “null and endless,”
               Joyce's later work might be characterized as endless (which is not to say directionless) and full: an inexhaustible crescendo of Barthesian137
