  Abstract: When our oldest daughter turned two, my husband bought

The children’s books I grew up with definitely did not include tales of overcoming one’s limitations. In the 1980s in GermanyDer Struwwelpeterwas still common reading material. To this day I remember what happens to poor little Suck-A-Thumb: a tailor with a giant pair of scissors storms in, catches him sucking on his thumbs, and cuts both of them off.

  Abstract: In chapter 3 I described how Bram Stoker’s
                  Draculaenlisted global standard time both at the level of plot, with Mina Harker’s and the Count’s competing mastery of timetables, and also as a principle of narrative structure, with discrepant time lines from various media synchronized into a uniform typewritten narrative. For Stoker standard time served a double function: it preserved England’s ontological purity by excising the temporally untranslatable, and it provided a model for a total narrative, able to assimilate various classes, nations, and dialects (spoken by the multinational vampire hunters) as well as various media.

  Abstract: Our exploration of the complex relationship between literature and space began with a legendary account of the origin of Sanskrit literature and a literary-theoretical discourse on Sanskrit styles and their regional dimensions. Both perspectives are conditioned by a conceptual matrix fundamental to Sanskrit thought for ordering and explaining the diverse phenomena of culture and society as elements in a transregional network closely related to Sanskrit’s own nonlocalized mode of existence. But there are other, literary linkages between literature and space. Narrative has an internal spatial logic, a “semiotic domain around which a plot coalesces and self-organizes,” as one scholar puts<br>

  Author(s) Segal Robert A.<br>
  Abstract: The study of hero myths goes back at least to 1871, when the Victorian anthropologist E. B. Tylor argued that many of them follow a uniform plot: the hero is exposed at birth, is saved by other humans or animals, and grows up to become a national hero (see Tylor 1871, 1:254–55).¹ In 1876 the Austrian scholar Johann Georg von Hahn used fourteen cases to argue that all “Aryan” hero tales follow an “exposure and return” formula more comprehensive than Tylor’s (see von Hahn 1876, 340). In each case the hero is born illegitimately, out of the fear of<br>

  Abstract: In his epics Milton attempts to portray decisive identity. By “decisive identity” I mean a conscious guiding of individuation wherein identity and character are created through moral decisions. Decisive identity does not imply creating what we initially are. Rather, it involves consciously deciding what we become, which requires a troublesome but indispensable element, freedom. Milton develops themes, character, and plot by showing the origins and consequences of identity-forming decisions. These decisions are the foci of moral judgment and meaning. In

  Abstract: In her first major speech as United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in 1997, Ireland’s former president Mary Robinson admonished the international body for having abandoned its historical mission of “realising human rights”: “Somewhere along the way many in the United Nations have lost the plot and allowed their work to answer to other imperatives.”¹ Recalling the purposes for which the UN incorporated itself in 1945, Robinson insisted that “almost by definition and certainly according to its Charter, the United Nations exists to promote human rights.” Indeed, the Charter’s preamble rehearses the organization’s statement of purpose, enumerating the common<br>

  Abstract: As with numerous other New Testament writings, Israel’s Scriptures form the foundation on which the narrative of the Gospel of John is written. Ushered in with the opening verses of the prologue, Scripture appears throughout the Gospel and is even identified as one of the “witnesses” for Jesus’s defense (5:31–47), showing up in explicit quotations along with a number of varyingly transparent allusions and references. Indeed, so crucial is Scripture to the Gospel’s plot that the narrator winds the sequence of events tightly to the Jewish festival calendar whose own roots stretch into Israel’s scriptural past.¹ Yet it is<br>

  Book Title: Nowhere in the Middle Ages-  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): LOCHRIE KARMA<br>
  Abstract: Drawing on a range of contemporary scholarship on utopianism and a broad premodern archive, Lochrie charts variant utopian strains in medieval literature and philosophy that diverge from More's work and at the same time plot uncanny connections with it. Examining works such as Macrobius's fifth-century
      Commentary on the Dream of Scipio,Mandeville's Travels, and William Langland'sPiers Plowman, she finds evidence of a number of utopian drives, including the rejection of European centrality, a desire for more egalitarian politics, and a rethinking of the division between animals and humans.Nowhere in the Middle Agesinsists on the relevance and transformative potential of medieval utopias for More's work and positions the sixteenth-century text as one alternative in a broader historical phenomenon of utopian thinking. Tracing medieval utopianisms forward in literary history to reveal their influences on early modern and modern literature and philosophy, Lochrie demonstrates that looking backward, we might extend future horizons of utopian thinking.<br>

This concept, applied to the development act of working together with the other who faces marginalization, fear, famine, and isolation, provides a medium for both the anthropologist and the local to emplot history and fiction into a social reality that brings each to a new place. Far from static, this new place is an emerging plot that enables movement from shame and hunger to selfsustainability on the part of the local, and movement from the confinement of Western individualism to an ontological<br>

However, despite its bloodthirsty female protagonist and despite its evoking what Christopher Frayling inVampyrescalls “haemosexuality” (1991, 388), “The Story of Chugoro” is not a vampire tale, nor does it blend Western and Eastern supernaturalism. “The Story of Chūgōrō” is<br>

  Abstract: In a well-known essay William Bevis put forward a theory of Native American literature by juxtaposing Western and Native American plot structures. “American whites,” he observed, “keep leaving home” in search of better opportunities “in a newer land” (581). These (gendered) stories typically portray an individual striving for success, trying to stand up to the test of unforeseen hardships and conflicts by keeping true to himself. The existential pathos of living in a hostile world is only slightly modified by the hero’s ability to build relationships with others; as Bevis notes, romantic love typically serves as an antidote to isolation,<br>

In contrast to some of her other output,Zai zaotianhas not enjoyed much scholarly or readerly acclaim. This is in part because of its didacticism. The plot, which concerns a struggle over control of the throne during the Yuan dynasty, centers almost exclusively on the lessons to be learned from the good and bad<br>

  Abstract: Within the domain of fairy-tale studies, queer theory has yet to receive the critical attention that it deserves, particularly given the centrality of sexuality in fairy tales.¹ This situation increasingly is changing, evident in the work of Kay Turner and Pauline Greenhill, among others.² Approaching fairy-tale texts and films from the perspective of queer theory can help students understand the ways in which fairy-tale plots can subvert what is often—and problematically—taken for granted in classical tales: the heteronormative plot, upheld by a specific configuration of gender roles.

  Abstract: Like the first law of thermodynamics, literary fiction requires momentum. Fiction relies on propulsive devices: basic units of charge that power action, event, and consciousness, calibrated by laws of narrative motion and physical, material impressions of kinetic and potential energy transference. (These need not involve tales of actual motion or much, if any, movement—consider Beckett’s minimalism or the generic predicates for entropy in naturalist writing.) Fiction requires and is measured through potential—what fuels its psychosocial dynamics, the impetus of plot and character development, and its chronotopic ability to traverse multiple times and spaces.

  Abstract: The Simpsons is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening and broadcasted by FOX Broadcasting Company. The plot revolves around a dysfunctional family of five, living in a fictional town of Springfield. At the beginning, the creators of the show planned the Simpsons to be the protagonists of short episodes shown during The Tracy Ullman Show. That form lasted only for three seasons, between its debut on 19 th April 1987 till 1989, as the popularity of the show made the producers rethink the whole idea, redesign slightly the characters and expand the universe by introducing many supporting characters.<br>

Already in Mark hostility against Jesus is first aroused by his claim to exercise a prerogative—to forgive sins—that is God’s alone (Mark 2:7), and the actual plot against his life springs, as in John, from a Sabbath healing (3:6).

We have also seen that women’s positionalities and unique biographies are also significant in shaping migration choices, decision-making processes and their post-migration lives.

  Book Title: Narrative Concepts in the Study of Eighteenth-Century Literature-  Publisher: Amsterdam University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mäkikalli Aino<br>
  Abstract: This collection of essays studies the encounter between allegedly ahistorical concepts of narratology and eighteenth-century literature. It questions whether the general concepts of narratology are as such applicable to historically specific fields, or whether they need further specification. Furthermore, at issue is the question whether the theoretical concepts actually are, despite their appearance of ahistorical generality, derived from the historical study of a particular period and type of literature. In the essays such concepts as genre, plot, character, event, tellability, perspective, temporality, description, reading, metadiegetic narration, and paratext are scrutinized in the context of eighteenth-century texts. The writers include some of the leading theorists of both narratology and eighteenth-century literature.<br>

  Abstract: The study of the so-called transnational novel has demonstrated the variety of practices of rewriting inside and across linguistic borders in the eighteenth century Europe (see e.g. Montandon, 1999; Stewart, 2009). Original works from the period are hard to distinguish from translations, translations of translations, pseudo-translations, authorial revisions, free adaptations, impostures, crudely abridged editions and other versions (Stewart, 2009, pp. 164-65). According to Coulet (1992), French authors were particularly busy revising their own works. Significant changes in narration and plot were common. Well-known is marquis de Sade’s transposition from first-person narration in

Anthony Newcomb (1984, 1987), for example, has located a certain type of narrative music within a particularly nineteenth-century mode of expression that attaches plot archetypes to nonstandard or unusual compositional designs.

He uses experiments, surveys, and a short story to explore why policymakers, historians, and international relations scholars are so resistant to the contingency and indeterminism inherent in open-ended, nonlinear systems. Most controversially, Lebow argues that the difference between counterfactual and so-called factual arguments is misleading, as both can be evidence-rich and logically persuasive. A must-read for social scientists,Forbidden Fruitalso examines the binary between fact and fiction and the use of counterfactuals in fictional works like Philip Roth'sThe Plot Against Americato understand complex causation and its implications for who we are and what we think makes the social world work.<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter I compare Sinclair Lewis’s
                  It Can’t Happen Here, published in 1935, with Philip Roth’sThe Plot Against America, published in 2004.¹ The former looks ahead to the 1936 presidential election and the victory of the fictional fascist Senator Buzz Windrip over President Franklin Roosevelt. The latter looks back to the 1940 election to imagine Roosevelt’s defeat by aviator Charles A. Lindbergh, whose administration is isolationist abroad and anti-Semitic at home. The two authors conjure up “fascist” regimes for different purposes, and reviewers—and presumably readers—responded to them differently. The two novels only address international relationsen<br>

  Abstract: Among the canonical markers of utopian writing is the ambiguous location of the ideal society in space and time. Thus, a good point of departure for a discussion of meta-utopian fiction will be a definition of it in terms of its treatment of spatial and temporal dimensions. Moreover, the positioning of plot events in a matrix of space and time, what Bakhtin calls “chronotope,” lays the coordinates for a sustained valuative framework.¹ Chronotopes can give a palpable sense of the ideological project central to meta-utopian fiction. This fiction is about liberation from spatial and temporal stasis. It is about the<br>

He inscribes its preoccupations and themes in the very plot of the poem. Just as his text of authority, Luke’s gospel, imitates hymns, so Milton frames the Son’s heroic witness within two angelic songs of praise.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zv117">Eros the Bittersweet</a><br>
  Abstract: Critics of the novel find paradox to be “a principle of the genre” and note the frequency with which the romances speak of situations as “new and strange” (
                  kainos) or “against reason” (paralogos), or “unthought of” (adokētos) (Heiserman 1977, 77 and 226 n. 4). Techniques of paradox enrich these stories at all levels of plot, imagery and wordplay. Paradox is especially essential to their emotional texture. This can surprise no one familiar with the lyric precedents of erotic fiction. “I’m crazy! I’m not crazy! I’m in love! I’m not in love!” said Anakreon in the sixth century b.c. (413PMG).<br>

The precisely described historical settings, the distinct characters with their clearly determined social identities, and the classical third person omniscient narration employed by Dinesen in her tales are cited in evidence. But, as Robert Langbaum observes, this surface traditionalism is principally dedicated not to the unfolding of a conventional diachronic plot, but to the construction of a synchronic thematic structure.

Indeed, if socialist realism can be somewhat simplistically characterized as “boy meets tractor” literature, as I have occasionally done in teaching it, the plot of these fantastic stories might whimsically be summarized as “boy meets self as<br>

  Abstract: The chapters on Dickens and Eliot move, in their respective ways, laterally and downward. They seek to convey the imaginative geography of each writer’s world—its norms of characterization, plot sequence, and setting—as well as to identify within each world, beneath the surface, a cluster of latent confusions. I attend to Dickens and Eliot in the measure that their work reveals an internal resistance to its own premises. Indeed, one formulation of Dickens’ more capacious achievement is that his work manages (as Eliot’s does not) to assimilate—by out-maneuvering, by disguising, by blinking—its own fissures.<br>

Although the plot is marginally predicated on an anecdote familiar to Synge about “a man from Connaught who killed his father with the blow of a spade” and then sought refuge on the Western islands (Aran, Collected2: 95), the drama’s development distinguishes itself more by its departures from this local account than by its faithfulness<br>

  Abstract: One of the most important consequences of the public furore occasioned by revelations of a ‘popish plot’ to assassinate Charles II in 1678, the dissolution of the ‘long’ Cavalier Parliament in January 1679, the subsequent lapse of licensing the press, and a crisis over the succession that pitted some members of Parliament against the Court and its allies, was the explosive growth of popular printed literature.¹ A great many texts invoked the national past as part of their arguments for, among other things, the undesirability of a Roman Catholic successor, the importance of Parliament as a bulwark against Stuart pretensions<br>

Abstract: Yet, having insisted on this, Neal had high praise for Cromwell and many of the policies of successive governments between 1649 and 1658. Though it was unsupported by any other power than that of the army, he says, “it was carried on with the most consummate wisdom, resolution and success.”
      41The wise and liberal religious policies of Cromwell—his commitment to toleration for all Christian sects, his sympathy for the Jews, his support for learning and the universities—are acknowledged. The energy and success of his foreign policy is applauded, especially the ascendancy over such hostile Catholic powers as France and Spain. Neal also praises the general character of the protectorate: “The Judges did their Duty according to Equity, without Covetousness or Bribery; the Laws had their full and free Course without Impediment or Delay; Men’s Manners were wonderfully reformed, and the Protector’s Court was under an exact Discipline. Trade flourished, and the Arts of Peace were cultivated throughout the whole Nation; the publick Money was managed with Frugality, and to the best Advantage; the Army and Navy were well paid, and served accordingly.”42Admittedly Cromwell was a despot, Neal says, but he was “generous and bountiful” to all who submitted to his authority and tolerant of all religious groups, including episcopalians, as long as they did not actively plot against the state.<br>

Abstract: According to Paul Ricoeur, the abolition of the literal interpretation in the metaphorical statement gives rise to a reinterpretation of reality itself.

Abstract: An example of refiguration is the capacity to make a narrative or invent a new plot from the same events but to lead to different actions; for example, a person who reads a book may subsequently refigure important events in her life to achieve a new synthesis involving connections not made before. Ricoeur emphasizes that the spiral of narrative making is endless because we are able to “carry the mediation past the same point a number of times, but at different altitudes” [
         14, p. 72]. Hence, reauthoring involves taking an active part in the authorship of our own lives.<br>

Author(s): Schweber Simone<br>
Abstract: That said, one can make a strong argument that the way that fundamentalist narratives operate is different than the ways their religious but not fundamentalist, or nationalistic and not religious, counterparts do. When I shared with Mr. Zee the results from my study in his classroom, he immediately recognized the ideological rut he had strayed into, and he took steps to shift the patterns of his pedagogy the following year. In other words, Mr. Zee acknowledged that the governing narrative of “progress and freedom” cannot fully account for all of history, much less all of American history, and that there are episodes and events—like the Holocaust and 9/11, like slavery and genocide—that demand plot lines that are neither triumphalist nor endowed with happy endings (Schweber
         2004).19Moreover, and more importantly perhaps, at least for Mr. Zee, the context of public schooling allowed for the possibility of debates over which narrative the community’s collective memories should be constructed to support. By contrast, at Eternal Grace there is no event that could escape the overarching narrative that asserts God’s ultimate control and promises true Christians’ salvation, and certainly no need to debate the legitimacy of that framework. No event could challenge or disrupt Mrs. Barrett’s beliefs.20And that, in short, epitomizes the nature of fundamentalism. Mr. Zee believes that history, integrally, contains multiple narrative possibilities; Mrs. Barrett’s historical sensibility trumpeted a single, unitary truth.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 509555<br>
Date: 10 2007<br>
Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: Many of Smith’s subsequent additions to the KJV plot continue to elaborate by inference on this theology of evil. One more example must suffice: Smith’s version of the contest between Cain and Abel. The JST Cain, the firstborn, is introduced to the readers as a disappointment to his parents’ hopes that he will not “reject” the Lord, in contrast to his younger brother Abel, who “walked in holiness before the Lord.” Cain’s first words in the narrative are “Who is the Lord, that I should know him.” Moreover, Cain’s offering of the first fruits of his field is depicted as a response to Satan’s command, not God’s. When the Lord rejected the offering and accepted Abel’s, Cain was “very wroth,” notes the KJV, and the JST adds: “Now Satan knew this, and it pleased him.”
         59The addition of the character of Satan to this story continues the theme of choice and agency. Indeed, it may be said that the character of Satan is a foil that offers his own and opposite bond in direct imitation of the sacred in each instance in which he appears to Cain. After the KJV warning that “sin lieth at the door,” the JST has the Lord say to Cain: “Satan desireth to have thee, and except thou shalt hearken unto my commandments, I will deliver thee up, and it shall be unto thee according to his desire.”60<br>

Abstract: Librarians must be aware of the fact that many such books and articles have caused revolutions in the sciences and the arts. Without these revolutions the growth of knowledge would be impossible [
         67, pp. 1–9]. When we look at the coherence theory of truth, most people who are not concerned with logic or mathematics still employ this theory in their daily lives. A new book that contradicts established beliefs often leads to increased public interest. Even when a controversial idea is part of the plot of a work of fiction, many people will visit the library to ask where these contradictory ideas are coming from. An example of this phenomenon is the recent popularity of, and discussions concerning,The Da Vinci Codeby Dan Brown [68].<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 589491<br>
2008<br>
Author(s): Stewart Garrett<br>
Abstract: In conjuring up the conceptual field of such effects, we might turn to set theory and picture a Venn diagram by which narratography is defined as exactly the zone of overlap between narratology and stylistics. Narratography would be shaded in there by the very shadings and incremental gradations of prose in the thick and thin of its own action as linguistic incident. Here emerges, in sum, the heuristic value of a so-called
         Story Left Behindin staging by exaggeration the everyday wake of narrativity in verbal process. Any narrative sentence may have its dramatic prehistory. It need not necessarily be distended or suddenly truncated, not by definition brutal or suppressed or moving or any one thing in particular, and not necessarily longer than the plotted tension of the preceding paragraph or even sentence. But narrative prehistory is manifest as a forward pressure nonetheless. That's why this essay's approach is in fact “narratival” rather than strictly stylistic (whatever that might mean)—and often dialectical as such. And why its instinct for intensive reading comes into sync with the impetus of plotted structure rather than just local representation. And why, further, even in imagining an entire shadow plot, the inflated exception developed in the fictional phase of this essay can still prove the rule of the minuscule. Whole lives, of course, don't usually lie battered, absented, and returned by deformation under the tread of suchfrictionin prose. Broad swaths of plot aside, it is rather in the immediate pace of reading that some aspect or facet of an advancing story is often bent noticeably out of shape. Narratography becomes, in this sense, the tracking of syntax and of the words it marshals for the impinging microplots, one after the other, of their own proximate backstories.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 651999<br>
Date: 10 2010<br>
Author(s): Walter Gregory<br>
Abstract: In engaging the aporias Agamben articulates, a theologian laboring to consider the political and the theological together should pay heed to Horace’s playwriting advice: do not bring a god into the narrative unless the plot’s problem merits the god’s entrance. The theologian must avoid the temptation to absorb the sphere of the political into the theological and to first consider how forces and agents immanent to the political can attend to the problems facing it. This should not avoid the important insights of Schmitt and others that find that modern political philosophy often has drawn its breath from secularized theological and ecclesiological concepts. Nevertheless, it would do considerable violence to political thought to demand that it depend in its entirety upon prophetic criticism and the form‐without‐form of divine judgment. Instead, we must look for the way that prophetic judgment and its concept of promise has immanent effect and the way that promise itself mediates between the divine gift and the immanent reciprocal gift. This way will articulate a relationship between the theological and the political that continues in the correlational tradition. Once again, it is promise and its being that will permit these connections; we will rely on the interaction and interruption of the promise.<br>

Abstract: What is left, then, of memory's scope and power? one might ask. How to handle the flow of memory and oblivion, the lengthy stretches of desire, the postponement of fulfillment, of the “tomorrow, tomorrow” versus the instantaneous pressure of the present: “Why not now? Why not now an end to my impure life in this very hour?”?

            Now, there is no denying that this text sounds utterly seducing, expressing longing and desire, falling short and finding fulfillment all at once.

You were with me, and I was not with you. The lovely things kept me far from you, though if they did not have their existence in you, they had no existence at all. You called and cried out loud and shattered my deafness. You were radiant and resplendent, you put to flight my blindness. You were fragrant, and I drew in my breath and now pant after you. I tasted you, and I feel but hunger and thirst for you. You touched me, and I am set on fire to attain the peace which is yours.

Abstract: Without the benefit of physical senses, the characters seem especially eager to nail down the philosophical “sense” of their experience, to get to the meaning of their suffering; thus the play’s series of
      sententiaethat seem to provide the necessary metaphysical interpretation. It is Bosola who provides the metaphor that closely echoes Gloucester’s imagery of tragic helplessness inKing Lear. Though Bosola participates in the torture and murder of the Duchess, the experience changes him; her suffering elicits prosocial feelings of empathy that lead Bosola to vow to help her husband Antonio revenge her death. This choice instigates a traditional revenge plot, but the play rejects Bosola’s attempt to rewrite the script. When he seeks out Antonio, he accidentally kills him in the dark, a turn of events that prompts Bosola to lament: “We are meerely the Starres tennys-balls (strooke, and banded / Which way please them)” (5.4.54–55). This dark image directly parallels Gloucester’s image of men as flies, though Bosola exacerbates the hopelessness of the situation by replacing “gods” with the fatalistic “stars” and casting humans as inanimate objects.The Duchess of Malfi—which includes psychological and physical torture, a severed hand, wax effigies, and a werewolf (“on the In-side” [5.2.18])—in many ways ups the ante ofKing Lear’s pessimism by combining it with horror and depravity so extreme that it could only be the product of blind fate. In these lines, the play provides one of the most bleak metaphysical representations of human life in early modern tragic drama. Later, Bosola describes the accidental death of Antonio as “Such a mistake, as I have often seene / In a play” (5.5.94–95), forging a connection between early modern understanding of the genre and Bosola’s metaphorically developed philosophy.<br>

Date: 03 2011<br>
Author(s): Ortenberg Alexander<br>
Abstract: Among historians "culpable" of a "plot" against Maybeck, Banham mentioned John Ely Burchard and Albert Bush-Brown (
               The Architecture of America[Boston: Little, Brown, 1961]); James Marston Fitch (American Buildings[Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1948]); Leland Roth (A Concise History of American Architecture[New York: Harper & Row, 1979]); Marcus Whiffen and Frederick Koeper (American Architecture, 1607–1976[Cambridge and London: MIT Press, 1981]). Banham never discussed contributions such as Esther Mc Coy,Five California Architects(New York: Reinhold, 1960) or Richard Longstreth,On the Edge of the World: Four Architects in San Francisco at the Turn of the Century(New York: Architectural History Foundation, 1983), which had been published just before his article. Banham also thought that Kenneth Cardwell's analysis in hisBernard Maybeck: Artisan, Architect, Artist(Santa Barbara: Peregrine Smith, 1977) did not do justice to the palace, in spite of Cardwell's overall positive assessment of the project. However, Banham set asides Vincent Scully'sAmerican Architecture and Urbanism(New York: Praeger, 1969), and William Jordy'sAmerican Buildings and Their Architects(Garden City, New York: Doubleday, 1972). Jordy's analysis indeed goes beyond any other attempt to discuss the palace—even if my own research shows that he was mistaken in some of his assumptions.<br>

Author(s): HUTSON LORNA<br>
Abstract: ABSTRACT Current approaches to Renaissance drama, rejecting the older idea of mimesis as likeness to an essential “nature,” have also rejected the assumption that Shakespeare's drama is especially mimetic. This article argues that these approaches neglect the contribution of narrative coherence or plot tomimesis and shows that a judicial conception of narrative underlies the mimesis of neoclassical Renaissance drama, including Shakespeare. Mimetic readings of Shakespeare may thus be appropriately legalistic responses to an evidentially based conception of plot.<br>

Author(s): McAleavey Maia<br>
Abstract: This article traces a single plot—the plot of bigamous return—through a range of genres and texts, including Mary Elizabeth Braddon’s
         Lady Audley’s Secret(1862) and Alfred Tennyson’s “Enoch Arden” (1864), concentrating on Elizabeth Gaskell’sSylvia’s Lovers(1863). Arguing that plot is a more productive heuristic than genre, this article investigates the intersection of literary currents in one historical moment with the long durée of a recurring story, powerfully present in nautical ballads and melodrama.<br>

Abstract: Recent study of the nature of textuality as such opens new insights for the study of the Bible. Although individual parts of the Bible have oral antecedents, the Bible as a whole has existed only as a text, and a unique kind of text, folded back on itself out of communal memory as no other book has been. A text is a monument. Textuality establishes a special relationship between discourse and death. Spoken words are exchanges between living persons. The text presents its message as well if its author is dead as it does if he or she is alive. Print is even more bound to death than writing is. In comparison with oral performance-delivery of an oration, song-a text physically has certain special alliances with past time. All texts come out of the past. Literature as text is psychologically retrospective: its effects typically include an element of nostalgia. Because of its future orientation, culminating in the closing words of Revelation, "Come, Lord Jesus" (as against typical narrative closes such as "They lived happily ever after"), the Bible has an unusual relationship to textuality: it is not literature in the way other texts are. Typical narrative plot structures existence retrospectively: the story is organized back from the conclusion. This retrospective organization is maximized by writing, which tightens plot and makes more of re-cognition, a kind of return to the beginning (the past) and hence a cyclic pattern. In addition to being related intimately to death, writing and print are also limitlessly fecund, the central forces in the evolution of consciousness, once they appear. The fecundity of writing and print, like other fecundity in human existence, is achieved by passage through death. "Unless the grain of wheat dies." The Word of God in the Person of Jesus Christ is conceived of by analogy with the spoken word. The Father speaks the Word, the Son (eo verbum quo filius); he does not write the Word, who would then by biblical attestation be not life but d~<br>

Author(s): White C. Allen<br>
Abstract: Kenneth Burke, like a number of contemporary theorists, believes that we inhabit structures of words and that they inhabit us. But Burke goes on to stress that we constantly shuttle between two very different linguistic modes: logic and narrative. We can translate any set of logical ideas into a corresponding story, replete with plot, characters, and images and framed in time. By such a move we gain the direction of a beginning, the momentum of a crossing, and the goal of an ending-and thus augment the power of our rhetoric. But our narratives may become too rhetorically powerful, as with those scapegoat narratives that lead to the sacrifice of innocent victims. So occasionally, for our own safety and the safety of others, we must translate the drama of a narrative back into its atemporal principles, where contradictions may become more apparent and the rush toward victimage may be checked. Burke illustrates all these doctrines using the first three chapters of Genesis and other classic texts.<br>

Abstract: Although the character of Job's wife has been given very little space in the biblical text of Job, she has been treated by many exegetes as significant. There are two main streams of interpretation in which she has figured prominently. In classical Christian approaches, ranging from Augustine to some modern commentators such as Habel, Job's wife tends to be regarded as a temptress in the mold of Eve and as a collaborator of the Satan. Post-modern, especially feminist, approaches tend to rehabilitate the character of Job's wife, accrediting her with prompting Job's critical reflection and with anticipating the direction in which the plot of the book develops. In the present article, interpretive approaches to Job's wife, including the favorable approach of some Jewish exegesis of antiquity, as well as the somewhat middle road of medieval Jewish exegesis, are surveyed. A critical discussion of feminist treatments of Job's wife deals primarily with the work of Newsom, Pardes and van Wolde. The place of Job's wife in the book is assessed with regard to how her theological views compare to those of the Satan on the one hand, and Job on the other, as well as to her role as a catalyst in the plot.<br>

Abstract: This paper asks, why does the eponymous hero of Joseph Conrad's Lord Jim fail to obtain absolution despite two confessional attempts, and then seek his own death? By using narratological distinctions together with an analysis of the confessional structures of Jim's narratives, we find that his confessions fail for three reasons: he never fulfils his promise to Marlow to plot the 'fundamental why' of his jumping ship, his father's 'easy morality' condemns him even before he abandons the Patna, and Marlow fails to meet his role as confessor.<br>

Abstract: The author argues that Casanova's journey to Venice constitutes not only a physical journey, but also an inner quest that brings significant insights. A close analysis of the dream sequence as a condensed version of the novella's plot reveals the protagonist's disillusionment with the obsolete public persona in which he is trapped, a reluctant recognition of an inner void, and a paralysis in his futile pursuit of a new identity, qualities which capture the fin-desiècle Viennese Weltanschauung.<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur delineates how self-relatedness is implied in domains of speech, action, narra-
tion, and communal (institutional) interaction — in speech by the use of performatives (prom-
ises, assertions, déclarations) which refer to the integrity (tnistworthiness) of the speaker; in
action by the fact that acts are not simply events in the world but présupposé agency and re-
sponsibility; in narration by the subtle dialectics between character and plot, a dialectic in
which the narrating self aims at coherence of the I-self relationship over time; and, at the
communal level, because larger communal wholes (institutions) maintain their moral identity
only in the openness to otherness.<br>

Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: i25010989<br>
Date: 10 1, 1993<br>
Author(s): Louden Bruce<br>
Abstract: Some sixty times in the Iliad and Odyssey, the narrator describes a sequence of events with the climactic phrase, "And now X would have happened, had not Y intervened." Though some recent studies have begun to focus on this narrative technique, a fuller accounting of its properties remains desirable, as many of the passages where it is employed are quite significant to the overall construction of the plots. I have termed the phenomenon pivotal contrafactuals. The present study argues that the composer achieves three general narrative benefits by employing this device. First, it is a method for emphatically changing the direction of the plot (hence the adjective "pivotal"). Second, it allows the narrator to confer added emphases of various kinds upon the events he describes. Third, the narrator often uses the construction to make an editorial comment upon the character on whose behalf the intervention occurs. Intriguingly, Homer appears to link some pivotal contrafactuals together through various means. Some occur as equivalent elements in different multiforms of a common type scene. Some occur in different narratives describing the same event. These latter raise the possibility that divine intervention of which he is unaware occurs in Odysseus's narrative of his wanderings. Finally, I suggest that a passage at the beginning of the Catalogue of Ships, which has attracted various interpretations, is a modified pivotal contrafactual.<br>

Author(s): Harjo Kerwin Lee<br>
Abstract: This article traces the competing meanings of "master narrative" in current theoretical debates over history and culture. The phrase "master or meta narrative" has grown popular for describing stories which seem to assimilate different cultures into a single course of history dominated by the West. Master narrative, like its predecessors Universal History and speculative philosophy of history, has become something to avoid. But our increasingly global situations demand stories that can describe and explain the worldwide interactions of diverse cultures and communities. From this convergence-a growing wariness of global stories coupled with situations which seem to demand them-has emerged a popular new double plot of world history in which cultural differentiation and cultural homogenization go hand in hand. The development has led to some surprising homologies and contrasts among the new histories created by thinkers from Claude Levi-Strauss and Jean-Francois Lyotard to James Clifford and Francis Fukuyama. But our new "postmodern" distinctions between master and local narratives have carried over the venerable antinomy of people with and without history, and the search for timeless formal principles differentiating "historical" and "nonhistorical" modes of discourse and ways of being threatens to create new varieties of essentialism.<br>

Publisher: Armand Colin<br>
Issue: i27582855<br>
Date: 6 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Payen Pascal<br>
Abstract: The article proposes to analyse the fictional aspects in history writing. Indeed, history doesn't borrow from fiction its compositional techniques only; the discursive strategy which consists in narrating a story is in fact part of historical knowledge as such. A study of Cambysis's biography in Herodotus (II,l-III,66) leads us to grant a very specific function to Book II dealing with Egypt—nearly always considered as some sort of useless overgrowth—and to the "secondary remarks" concerning the Greek world (III,38, 39-60). Setting the Egyptian civilization as a foil enables Herodotus to establish a parallel between expansionist ideas and folly and he includes the Greeks in a plot itself critical of helleno-centric ideology. Our methodological approach owes as much to Ricœur's hermeneutics, as to H. R. Jauss's esthetics of reception and to the various streaks of narratology (narrative syntax and "mise en abîme"), with a view to showing that, once replaced in its "Erwarthunghorizonte", the form of the historical narrative makes full sense.<br>

Author(s): Wolseley Ronald N.<br>
Abstract: Narrative methods are used to analyze the cultural dynamics of civil society through a comparison of African-American and "main-stream" newspaper coverage of the Rodney King crisis in Los Angeles. The newspapers' different narrative constructions affected the selection and interpretation of significant crisis events, shaped social expectations about how the crisis would be resolved, and constrained the range of symbolic strategies available to local political elites. Through and application of narrative methods, this case demonstrates how the analysis of plot, character, and genre can help explain the interplay between the analytic and concrete forms of culture and the dynamics of social problems and social change more broadly.<br>

Author(s): McDonald William C.<br>
Abstract: Hartmann's depiction of time in Der arme Heinrich provides a fresh perspective from which to assess the story. Although the plot unfolds diachronically and the number "three" as well as many adverbs of time appear (esp. dô, nû, ê), precise chronology is adumbrated. Hartmann admits scant verifiability of temporal events, manipulating the tempo of the narrative and the indicators of the passage of time. In distorting the dimension of time, he calls attention to the inadequacy of earthly calculations and joins those medieval poets using "dramatic chronology" for the purpose of exploring and exposing human attitudes. Both protagonists are required to come to terms with the temporal world and to live on in time.<br>

Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i277383<br>
Date: 10 1, 1980<br>
Author(s): Wilden Dave<br>
Abstract: This paper examines a theoretical perspective on the ways in which children progress in learning mathematics. It suggests that there is a difficulty in associating teaching discourses with the mathematics they locate. This can result in an incommensurability between alternative perspectives being offered. The paper resists attempts to privilege any particular account but rather demands an analysis of these discourses and their presuppositions. In developing these themes the paper invokes Ricoeur's analysis of time and narrative as an analytical approach to treating notions such as transition, development and progression in mathematical learning. His notion of semantic innovation is introduced. This embraces both the introduction of a new metaphor into a sentence or the creation of a new narrative which reorganises events into a new 'plot'. The notion is utilised in arguing that the shift in the student's mathematical development from arithmetic to first order linear equations with unknowns reconfigures the contextual parameters governing the understanding of these mathematical forms. It is also utilised in showing how alternative approaches to accounting for such transitions suit different and perhaps conflicting outcomes. For example, demonstrating awareness of generality or performing well in a diagnostic test featuring the solution of linear equations.<br>

Author(s): Dhand Arti<br>
Abstract: This article focuses on one key episode of the great Hindu epic, the Mahābhārata: the scene in the first book in which the Bhārata widows Ambikā and Ambālikā are impregnated by their brother-in-law, Vyāsa. The article is composed of two parts. The first examines narratives surrounding the practice of niyoga, or levirate, and reflects on its significance to the construction of the epic plot. The second reflects on the personality and motives of Vyāsa, uncompromising brother-in-law, formidable sage, and near-divine author of the text. The link between the two parts is important for unpacking a key religious orientation of the Mahābhārata. The article argues that Vyāsa's curse of the Bhārata widows is not idiosyncratic but, rather, is a stern example of the author's specific interpretation of virtue, which in turn bespeaks the overarching religious worldview of the text--the karmayogic ideal of equanimity.<br>

Abstract: This essay considers the persistence of collective and corporate models of literary authority within late-Victorian literature and print culture. While modern critics often understand Victorian authorship to be individually centered and governed by a dynamic of secrecy and disclosure, the periodical debates about anonymity that intensified in the fin de siècle suggest that Victorian readers and writers embraced a more flexible, collective notion of authorship. The plot, language, and paratext of Mary Elizabeth Hawker's pseudonymously published Mademoiselle Ixe, as well as the author-publisher correspondence concerning the novel, offer a representation of the corporate and collective interpretive modes that would have been familiar to late-Victorian readers, if not to recent critics. Hawker's text and the archival material it brings to light also suggest that modern readers might productively turn to the Victorian past to expand the definitions of authorship that circulate throughout nineteenth-century scholarship today.<br>

Abstract: A partir des réflexions de Paul Ricœur sur la temporalité et la narrativité, l'auteur envisage les processus discursifs de construction identitaire chez les jeunes gens en fin de scolarité obligatoire. L'identité en construction est appréhendée à travers le récit qu'ils donnent de leurs projets d'avenir et de leur histoire familiale. La présentation de soi, perçue dans cette double dimension, est soumise à un ensemble de schemes ou de modèles narratifs culturellement ancrés et socialement véhiculés. Elle prend forme et se constitue en une totalité cohérente et intelligible par une « mise en intrigue » de la diversité des péripéties vécues ou imaginées. The discursive processes that form young people's identities at the age when they leave school are discussed in reference to Paul Ricœur's notions of temporality and narrativity. The identities in formation are observed through these young people's accounts of their future plans and family histories. The presentation of the self — perceived in this two-dimensional way — fits into a set of schémas or nanative models rooted in culture, conveyed by society and forms a coherent, intelligible whole by « bringing into the plot » the diversity of imagined or actually experienced events.<br>

Abstract: This article argues for a synthesis of George Herbert Mead's conception of the temporal and intersubjective nature of the self with Paul Ricoeur's hermeneutic theory of narrative identity. Combining the insights of Ricoeur's philosophical analysis with Mead's social-psychological orientation provides a subtle, sophisticated, and potent explanation of self-identity. A narrative conception of identity implies that subjectivity is neither a philosophical illusion nor an impermeable substance. Rather, a narrative identity provides a subjective sense of self-continuity as it symbolically integrates the events of lived experience in the plot of the story a person tells about his or her life. The utility of this conception of identity is illustrated through a rereading of Erving Goffman's study of the experience of mental patients. This example underlines the social sources of the self-concept and the role of power and politics in the construction of narrative identities.<br>

Abstract: In an empirical study using five real-world creative teams from an advertising agency, participants were given a strategic brief for a new beverage product and asked to design the layout for a print ad. Think-aloud concurrent protocols obtained from each team's copywriter, art director, and the two working together were analyzed to examine the creative process and its relationship to the created advertisement. Interpretive analyses of the protocols reveal that the teams access culturally available plot patterns but in different ways. In this study and with the particular materials and situational context explored here, four of the five teams chose to pursue a single mythic structure to the apoarent detriment of their final product. Only one team engaged in fully diversified idea generation involving a wide range of alternative scenarios. Not coincidentally, as a tentative conclusion, this more flexible team produced the ad judged most successful by advertising professionals. This still-to-be-tested exploratory finding deserves further investigation in future research that embodies various methodological refinements.<br>

Abstract: The analysis of an opera, understood as a dramatic text on which a plurality of texts converge, each generated by a different expressive code (be it verbal, musical, or visual), must first of all define a pertinent criterion by which the significant "actions" as discrete semantic units can be located in the text itself. Such a criterion can be identified within the principle at the basis of the dramatic genre, the interaction of the characters acting on stage and their changing relationships. On this basis, it is possible to read the action in Le Nozze di Figaro as the evolving system of dominance relationships between Count Almaviva and Figaro, and the various ways in which the other characters participate in this conflict. The same principle makes it possible to analyze a specific segment of the action (act II, scene VII-VIII, the second main section of the second finale), which can be broken down into a number of semantic units, along two hierarchically-organized structural levels. Earlier analyses have segmented this scene according to purely musical criteria, without considering its meaning for the overall unfolding of the drama. This new reading shows how the scene presents an important turning point in the plot, a temporary reversal of the relationship between the Count and the Countess. This turning point belongs specifically to the plot of the opera, which draws heavily on the text of the Beaumarchais comedy, but reformulates the syntax of the events; this shows how the "meaning" of a scene does not lie in the characters' dialogue alone, but that this is merely one of the possible devices by which the action is made to advance. As far as the role of the musical text is concerned, an analysis of its various components (form, motivic materials, tonal relationships, etc.) in the scene under consideration reveals that its role is primarily one of demarcation (it helps one to perceive the unity of a specific set of actions and its difference from the next set) a~<br>

Abstract: L'auteur présente d'abord les diverses hypothèses quant au genre littéraire du livre de Job : épopée, poème didactique, fable philosophique, dialogue sapientiel, dispute judiciaire, tragédie. Elle développe ensuite sa propre hypothèse, celle du drame, qui a l'avantage de tenir compte de tous les paramètres du livre de Job et de remplir toutes les conditions nécessaires au drame : condition de l'histoire ou intrigue, condition de l'action par la parole, statut particulier des interventions narratives. First the author presents the various hypotheses about the literary genre of the Book of Job: an epic, a didactic poem, a philosophical tale, a wisdom dialogue, a lawsuit, a tragedy. Then she presents her own hypothesis, a drama. This has the advantage of doing justice to all the dimensions of the Book of Job and of fulfilling all the necessary conditions of a drama: it is a story and has a plot, it is conducted in words, and narrative interventions have a particular status.<br>

Abstract: Anderson, the possibility for persons to experience themselves as members of
a national community also depended on a shift towards "empty, homogeneous" time, which was in
turn motivated through the growing popularity of the novel as a literary genre. Anderson argues that
the narrative structure of the novel rests on a yardstick of empty, homogeneous time, which is lin-
early progressing, divisible into an infinite number of abstract, equivalent units, and independent
from any particular locale. Disparate characters in a novel, who may be in different locations
and completely unaware of the presence of certain other characters, and their actions in the unfold-
ing plot can be placed in relation to each other by virtue of temporal simultaneity on such an axis of
empty, homogeneous time. This narrative and temporal structuring particular to the literary genre of
the novel provides an analogy to the way in which persons imagine themselves as progressing
through history together in a national community, knowing that they exist together with other
co-nationals in a synchronic cross-section of time (1991: 25-26)<br>

Author(s): Sittler Roy<br>
Abstract: Starting with Raglan's suggestion that Falstaff may be a "holy fool" and with Auden's belief that he is a comic symbol of charity, this essay explores the medieval tradition of wise fool, and especially Falstaff's always canny use of biblical allusion. His various jests, if read in relation to the political action of the main plot, reveal him as characterizing England's time of day and parodying the unchristian behavior of Hotspur, Henry, and Hal. By the time he dies mumbling Psalm xxiii to an uncomprehending Nell Quickly, there have accumulated many hints that he is, in fact, a candle to his age, a professional Fool with the heart of a faithful Lazarus, and destined to join Mowbray in Abraham's bosom. The merriment for which readers have found him lovable amid his masquerades of vice has its mysterious basis in his covertly Christian understanding of England's neo-Roman Caesars.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>

Author(s): Moore Susan<br>
Abstract: Critics have associated Conrad's fiction, above all, with a masculinist tradition of writers and philosophers, neglecting his engagement with popular forms of women's writing. Yet in his later work he aimed to reach a female readership of popular novels. This essay explores Conrad's encounter with the female sensation novel, pioneered by such authors as Mary Elizabeth Braddon. Focusing on Conrad's final, posthumously published novel Suspense, the discussion outlines his sensitive response to the narratological structures of the genre, especially Braddon's Lady Audley's Secret. In Suspense, Conrad draws on Braddon's problematic representation of female identity. His reference to the physical enclosure of the heroine, her potential madness, the suggestion of an incest plot, sexual ambivalence, and the presentation of the heroine as a visionary painting all allude to the earlier form. Furthermore, an examination of the serialization of Suspense in the women's pages of Hutchinson's Magazine shows the extent to which Conrad was indebted to sensationalism while also questioning its conventions.<br>

Abstract: Fitzgerald uses several tools to create
      the nostalgic aesthetic of Gatsby. The plot is fundamentally analeptic in construction (told in flashbacks), while the narration is subsequent (narratedafterthe main story takes place). The narrator, Nick Carraway, fits the definition of a homodiegetic perspective (a narrator who is also part of the story he tells): as countless commentaries have discussed, Nick is a distanced observer, retelling the events of the summer of 1922 in first-person singular, infusing through his commentary value into their importance, a technique that creates a distinct “now” and “then” between the time of the story and the time of the narration. Additionally, theorderof the narration is not chronological but jumps back and forth in time in order to support the emotional experience of inner time instead of clock time.
            Furthermore, the choice of words in2
         The Great Gatsbyis often undeniably romantic, alluding to Keats or simply evoking nostalgic sentiments using romantic conventions: “For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face” (Gatsby14). This essay will not deal with all of Fitzgerald's nostalgic strategies in his most famous novel but will focus on one particular and highly original method: the use of the reader's textual memory in order to create a nostalgic experience within the text as an enhancement of the novel's nostalgic themes.<br>

Abstract: In the same line of argument as House's, Stephen Halliwell states in
         Aristotle's Poeticsthat pity and fear refer specifically to the “capacity to sympathize with the sufferer.” He emphasizes that “Aristotle does not derive this sympathy from an undifferentiated sense of humanity: instead, he takes it to be rooted in a felt or perceived affinity between the subject and the object of the emotion.” In that regard, tragic characters “have to be within the reach of an audience's compassion” (175–79). When we see actors perform on stage, we become direct witnesses to their fate. In narratives, the poet/novelist achieves the same effects by providing us with realistic details that bring the characters to life so that we can begin to know them. In B. L. Ullman's understanding, “pitiful and fearful situations are better produced by the structure of the story than by actual scenes on the stage. But those, who through such scenes produce not fear but mere sensationalism, have nothing to do with tragedy” (26). Stories become relevant to readers or audiences in the totality of their elements, through which the story reflects plausible events to the readers themselves. Paul Ricoeur's understanding of the function of poetry, as indicated in the epigraph, goes to the core of the relation of narrative and ethics. Poetry enables the imagination to piece together, in ways acceptable to human flourishing, bits of human conduct, the elements of our happiness and misfortune. He explains in “Life in Quest of Narrative,” that by “means of poetry we learn how reversals and fortune result from this or that conduct, as this is constructed by the plot in the narrative” (23). Ricoeur differentiates between phronetic (prudential), and theoretical/scientific understanding of human nature. Narratives provide the former, while science provides the latter. In line with Ricoeur, Richard Kearney states in “Narrative and Ethics” that “what is peculiar to the ethical quality of narrative unders~<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur identifies three ways in which the mediating function of mimesis
      2operates in the configuration of narratives. First, configuration mediates between the individual event and the story as a whole by assigning an event a place of significance in the unfolding of a plot. Let us take, for instance, a book from the aforementioned Americans All series. Lillie Patterson's 1970Martin Luther King, Jr.: Man of Peace, which was awarded the first Coretta Scott King Book Award for African American children's literature, begins with an anecdote from King's childhood. This story narrates King's supposed first encounter with the “wall” of racism. When he enters school, his white friends are no longer allowed to play with him. He persists in seeking their company but is rebuffed: “Finally, their mother tried to tell Martin why. ‘You see, you are colored and they are white’” (Patterson 1970, 10). Unsatisfied, Martin goes to his own mother, who explains the history of slavery and its effects on their lives. She concludes by reminding her son that despite this past, “You are as good as anyone” (Patterson 1970, 10–12). As the opening scene, this vignette both introduces King as a child (creating an identificatory link with readers) and frames the remaining story about a confident man who worked to break down that “wall” of racism. Second, configuration joins and relates disparate aspects of the story, including various agents, actions, motivations, and outcomes. Patterson's text, for example, emphasizes both King's personal ambition and his cooperation with others. Members of his family play a key role, and the appearance of his wife, Coretta Scott, warrants an entire chapter (Patterson 1970, 33–38). Their marriage is represented not as mere love story but as the collaboration between two powerful social agents. The narrator explains that in accepting marriage to King, “Coretta decided to join the young minister and share his dream” (Patterson 1970, 37). Finally, configura~<br>

Abstract: Gastronomical practice and his dramaturgical philosophy charmingly intertwine in his 1897 review of John T. Day's explicitly antivegetarian play
      The Fanatic. In it, Shaw expresses his bemusement with “a dramatist who makes the whole interest of his play depend on a passionate faith in the nutritiousness of a cutlet and a glass of wine.”
            Its plot concerns a young woman newly married to a rabid vegetarian and teetotaler who immediately proceeds to feed her such enormous quantities of meatless fare that only, as Shaw writes, “if she were an elephant working out a sentence of hard labor [would] she … possibly be able to get exercise enough to keep pace” (352–53). (The playwright himself had outlined the perils of such overeating in an 18867
         Pall Mall Gazetteop-ed titled “Failures of Inept Vegetarians.”) When she sickens, a doctor is called in who earnestly if predictably prescribes cutlets and wine. Clear in its answer to, in Shaw's words, the “question … of cucumbers versus corpses” (354),The Fanaticculminates in the doctor's impulsive elopement proposition to his patient and the husband's mysterious yet gracious gesture of dropping dead.<br>

Abstract: To make things worse, the allied victors ignored his advocacy of a just and merciful peace treaty at the conclusion of World War I, so that the vanquished would not plot murderous revenge. Regrettably, because of this colossal myopia, the defeated did precisely what Shaw foresaw and, to our everlasting sorrow, six million souls went to the ovens amid the carnage of the Second World War (not to mention the fiery mushroom clouds that incinerated much of Hiroshima and Nagasaki). Everywhere his discerning eye turned, Shaw saw outrages perpetrated against the sanctity of the person and the integrity of the planet. This is not the stuff sanguine dreams are made of. Ironically, through it all Shaw did manage to achieve a degree of stature for his feverish efforts on behalf of a beleaguered humankind, but it was not the kind of prominence he sought. Popular opinion regarded him more as a witty jester who reduced everything to a pointless joke than as an earnest prophet who conveyed providential correctives to a wayward people. Commonly perceived as a master of the frivolous, he was not taken seriously as an artist or thinker until relatively late in life. No. Events did not transpire according to Shaw's preferences, to put it mildly. Yet Shaw never succumbed to the enticements of fashionable nihilism or the futility of abject negativity. He could hold competing conceptions in his mind without suffering the disquieting dissonance that frequently accompanies analytical thinking.<br>
