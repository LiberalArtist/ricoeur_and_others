  Care and Grief at Sanctuaries from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1c6v89n">Mourning Animals</a><br>
  Author(s) MCARTHUR JO-ANNE<br>
  Abstract: If a friend of yours loses a beloved companion animal, would you send her or him a condolence card? Previous research suggests that, because of a widespread taboo on the display of grief for companion animals, it is doubtful that you would. The explanations for such a pet grief taboo converge around one main point: a human’s grief for members of other species threatens humans’ anthropocentric worldview.¹ Companion animals have a liminal position as they are regarded both as persons and as property, as subjects and objects, and to mourn such liminal persons would be to transgress the human/animal divide.²<br>

  Author(s) Utley Ebony A.<br>
  Abstract: Of all the lessons I have learned from Kenneth Burke, none is more valuable than what he shows and tells about irony. For Burke, irony is not simply a strategy that allows us to say one thing when we mean something else. Instead, irony becomes a point of coalescence between strategy and substance—a way of talking and thinking that simultaneously constructs, engages, and alters our encounters in the social world. Among other things, Burkean irony suggests a way for us to teach rhetoric rhetorically, and that is the issue I want to explore in this paper.<br>

  Author(s) Alison James<br>
  Abstract: Among scholars dedicated to mimetic theory recent debates raised the question of how Islam is related to Judaism and Christianity. One frequently mentioned starting point is the “Epilogue” in René Girard’s
                  book Battling to the End, in which he claims that Islam is a religion that “has used the Bible as a support to rebuild an archaic religion that is more powerful than all the others” (Girard 2010, 214). Could one draw from this and similar remarks the conclusion that Islam is an archaic religion and not at all comparable with Judaism and Christianity, even going as far as rejecting<br>

  Abstract: The father is dead. On this point, Julia Kristeva and René Girard agree. What then can be said any longer of the paternal function? What legacy of the father persists in ongoing economies of sacrifice? And, if the father is not actually dead but only missing in action within the family romance, site of our earliest mimetic rivalries, what role, if any, could a father play in an intimate domain characterized by positive, nonconflictual mimesis? May a father yet live within intimate spaces? Endeavoring to answer these questions, I turn to literature, for Girard and Kristeva agree that literature is<br>

  Abstract: Sovereignty is the vote. The union card. The insignia of membership in the club. Less exclusive than it once was, the club now encompasses much of the globe and those not members at present continue to seek entry, often utilizing rather impolite methods to that end. Sovereignty remains the “essential qualification for full membership in international society, or, to express the point more comprehensively, the qualification which makes a state eligible for full membership.”¹ Sovereignty names an aspiration; serves as a goad to action; signifies an accomplishment; defines an opposition (state/society); and encodes a legalistic construction (formal sovereignty).<br>

  Abstract: FROM THE POINT OF VIEW of modern geography, the world appears clear and simple. This is somewhat paradoxical, since one of the special qualities of modernity is deemed to be complexity (complex societies, complex personality, complex logic, and so forth). But with the advent of modern geography, every schoolchild should know that the world is divided into a set number of landmasses and seas: there are seven continents, just as there are five oceans, and a set number of seas, all made up of salt water, some completely bounded, others almost so.<br>

  Abstract: The vicissitudes of authorship revisited in chapter 6 point to a larger issue. Since around 2000 there has been a lot of musicological effort lavished on the “workconcept” and the competing claims of the fixed, authoritative musical work and the creative act of performance, mostly to the detriment of the work. Like most such binary quarrels, this one reveals a little and obscures a lot. It certainly oversimplifies the historical situation, which is full of complex instances in which the roles of the work—as inscription, conception, or instruction—and of performance—as animation, interpretation, or reproduction—meet, mix, and<br>

  Abstract: In considering languages of grief in relation to languages of certainty, there is a tension in the ways death can be thought of in connection to modern knowledge. On the one hand, we can consider death as that which underlies the possibility of knowledge, as that end point to the fostering or disallowing of life that stands for the modern configuration of power/knowledge (as Foucault [1978] had it). And on the other hand, we can imagine death as that which cannot be spoken in languages of modernity (as de Certeau [1986] suggested). Put differently, this is the distinction between death<br>

A few iconic names make the point nicely: Schoenberg. Joyce. Eliot. Picasso. Time may long since have blunted their radical edge, but the memory remains sharp. How, then, does either modernism or modernity fit, except as a tragic or celebratory passage away from bygone clarities and promises, in a historically sensitive theory of interpretation?

                  perfect accordwith any one but himself”¹ and extolling the virtues of self-sufficiency, Schopenhauer nevertheless acknowledges that, for many people, the inner life is so empty and unsatisfying that they are driven “to the company of others which consists of men like themselves, forsimilis simili gaudet” (Birds of a feather flock together).² Elsewhere, he makes this point with a parable.

  Abstract: Those of us who are troubled by the confusion in contemporary education, perhaps especially if we continue to believe in a liberal or general education, are sometimes tempted to look to the past for guidance. But the lessons of history are rarely unambiguous. For one thing, its messages are various. Like Scripture, it can generally be made to support what we want it to support; and in the case of education, the Western cultural tradition incorporates not just one but a whole scries of educational ideals, which rest on quite different assumptions and point in different directions.

  Abstract: By 1920, modern historical thought had reached a certain point of maturity. My aim in this chapter is to explain this process. With improved accessibility to new types of knowledge and completely new forms of intellectual organization, the perceptual tools of educated people were modified, at first quite slowly, but by 1919, quite decisively. Though it is yet too early to speak of a genre of modern history, the development of new linguistic resources, in fact an entire semantic field, was the crucial and final element that brought the historicization process to a mature point.

  Abstract: The sheer number of words for nature in Tokugawa texts dramatizes the concept’s many facets and renders vocabulary an obvious starting point for discussing nature’s multivalence. Despite this abundance of terms, Maruyama Masao’s critique of nature in early modern Japanese political thought relies almost exclusively on one word,

Indeed, before the 1890s,shizenappears to have been rather uncommon; certainly it was not a preoccupation in Confucian studies.

  Book Title: Aspects of Alterity: Levinas, Marcel, and the Contemporary Debate-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): TREANOR BRIAN<br>
  Abstract: Every other is truly other, but no other is wholly other.This is the claim that Aspects of Alterity defends. Taking up the question of otherness that so fascinates contemporary continental philosophy, this book asks what it means for something or someone to be other than the self. Levinas and those influenced by him point out that the philosophical tradition of the West has generally favored the self at the expense of the other. Such a self-centered perspective never encounters the other qua other, however. In response, postmodern thought insists on the absolute otherness of the other, epitomized by the deconstructive claim every other is wholly other.But absolute otherness generates problems and aporias of its own. This has led some thinkers to reevaluate the notion of relative otherness in light of the postmodern critique, arguing for a chiastic account that does justice to both the alterity and the similitude of the other. These latter two positions-absolute otherness and a rehabilitated account of relative otherness-are the main contenders in the contemporary debate.The philosophies of Emmanuel Levinas and Gabriel Marcel provide the point of embarkation for coming to understand the two positions on this question. Levinas and Marcel were contemporaries whose philosophies exhibit remarkably similar concern for the other but nevertheless remain fundamentally incompatible. Thus, these two thinkers provide a striking illustration of both the proximity of and the unbridgeable gap between two accounts of otherness.Aspects of Alterity delves into this debate, first in order understand the issues at stake in these two positions and second to determine which description better accounts for the experience of encountering the other.After a thorough assessment and critique of otherness in Levinas's and Marcel's work, including a discussion of the relationship of ethical alterity to theological assumptions, Aspects of Alterity traces the transmission and development of these ~<br>

  Book Title: Material Spirit: Religion and Literature Intranscendent-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): GOOD CARL<br>
  Abstract: The essays in this collection examine philosophical, religious, and literary or artistic texts using methodologies and insights that have grown out of reflection on literature and art. In them, them phrase "material spirit" becomes a point of departure for considering the continuing spectral effects of religious texts and concerns in ways that do not simply call for, or assume, new orrenewed forms of religiosity. The writers in this collection seek to examine religion beyond traditional notions of transcendence: Their topics range from early Christian religious practices to global climate change. Some of the essays explore religious themes or tones in literary texts, for example, works by Wordsworth, Hopkins, Proust, Woolf, and Teresa of Avila. Others approach in a literarycritical mood philosophical or para-philosophical writers such as Bataille, Husserl, Derrida, and Benjamin. Still others treat writers of a more explicitly religious orientation, such as Augustine, Rosenzweig, or Bernard of Clairvaux.<br>

  Book Title: Rethinking God as Gift: Marion, Derrida, and the Limits of Phenomenology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Horner Robyn<br>
  Abstract: Rethinking God as Gift is situated at the intersection of philosophy, critical theory and theology. The first sustained study of the work of Jean-Luc Marion in English, it offers a unique perspective on contemporary questions and their theological relevance. Taking its point of departure from the problem of the gift as articulated by Jacques Derrida, who argues that the conditions of possibility of the gift are also its conditions of impossibility, Horner pursues a series of questions concerning the nature of thought, the viability of phenomenology, and, most urgently, the possibility of grace. For Marion, phenomenology, as the thought of the given, offers a path for philosophy to proceed without being implicated in metaphysics. His retrieval of several important insights of Edmund Husserl, along with his reading of Martin Heidegger and Emmanuel Lvinas, enables him to work out a phenomenology where even impossiblephenomena such as revelation and the gift might be examined. In this important confrontation between Marion and Derrida issues vital to the negotiation of postmodern concerns in philosophy and theology emerge with vigour. The careful elucidation of those issues in an interdisciplinary context, and the snapshot it provides of the state of contemporary debate, make Rethinking God as Gift an important contribution to theological and philosophical discussion.<br>

  Book Title: Human Rights, Inc.: The World Novel, Narrative Form, and International Law-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SLAUGHTER JOSEPH R.<br>
  Abstract: In this timely study of the historical, ideological, and formal interdependencies of the novel and human rights, Joseph Slaughter demonstrates that the twentieth-century rise of world literatureand international human rights law are related phenomena. Slaughter argues that international law shares with the modern novel a particular conception of the human individual. The Bildungsroman, the novel of coming of age, fills out this image, offering a conceptual vocabulary, a humanist social vision, and a narrative grammar for what the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and early literary theorists both call the free and full development of the human personality. Revising our received understanding of the relationship between law and literature, Slaughter suggests that this narrative form has acted as a cultural surrogate for the weak executive authority of international law, naturalizing the assumptions and conditions that make human rights appear commonsensical. As a kind of novelistic correlative to human rights law, the Bildungsroman has thus been doing some of the sociocultural work of enforcement that the law cannot do for itself. This analysis of the cultural work of law and of the social work of literature challenges traditional Eurocentric histories of both international law and the dissemination of the novel. Taking his point of departure in Goethe's Wilhelm Meister, Slaughter focuses on recent postcolonial versions of the coming-of-age story to show how the promise of human rights becomes legible in narrative and how the novel and the law are complicit in contemporary projects of globalization: in colonialism, neoimperalism, humanitarianism, and the spread of multinational consumer capitalism.Slaughter raises important practical and ethical questions that we must confront in advocating for human rights and reading world literature-imperatives that, today more than ever, are intertwined.<br>

  Book Title: Crossover Queries: Dwelling with Negatives, Embodying Philosophy's Others-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): WYSCHOGROD EDITH<br>
  Abstract: Exploring the risks, ambiguities, and unstable conceptual worlds of contemporary thought, Crossover Queries brings together the wide-ranging writings, across twenty years, of one of our most important philosophers.Ranging from twentieth-century European philosophy-the thought of Heidegger, Foucault, Derrida, Levinas, Janicaud, and others-to novels and artworks, music and dance, from traditional Jewish thought to Jain andBuddhist metaphysics, Wyschogrod's work opens radically new vistas while remaining mindful that the philosopher stands within and is responsible to a philosophical legacy conditioned by the negative.Rather than point to a Hegelian dialectic of overcoming negation or to a postmetaphysical exhaustion, Wyschogrod treats negative moments as opening novel spaces for thought. She probes both the desire for God and an ethics grounded in the interests of the other person, seeing these as moments both of crossing over and of negation. Alert to the catastrophes that have marked our times, she exposes the underlying logical structures of nihilatory forces that have been exerted to exterminate whole peoples. Analyzing the negationsof biological research and cultural images of mechanized and robotic bodies, she shows how they contest the body as lived in ordinary experience.Crossover Queries brings together important essays on a remarkable range of topics by one of our most insightful cultural critics. Commenting on philosophical and theological issues that have shaped the recent past as well as scientific and technological questions that will preoccupy us in the near future, Wyschogrod consistently alerts us to the urgency of problems whose importance few recognize. To avoid the challenge these essays pose is to avoid responsibility for a future that appears to be increasingly fragile.-Mark C. Taylor, Columbia University<br>

  Book Title: Toward a Theology of Eros: Transfiguring Passion at the Limits of Discipline-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): KELLER CATHERINE<br>
  Abstract: What does theology have to say about the place of eroticism in the salvific transformation of men and women, even of the cosmos itself? How, in turn, does eros infuse theological practice and transfigure doctrinal tropes? Avoiding the well-worn path of sexual moralizing while also departing decisively from Anders Nygren's influential insistence that Christian agape must have nothing to do with worldly eros, this book explores what is still largely uncharted territory in the realm of theological erotics. The ascetic, the mystical, the seductive, the ecstatic-these are the places where the divine and the erotic may be seen to converge and love and desire to commingle.Inviting and performing a mutual seduction of disciplines, the volume brings philosophers, historians, biblical scholars, and theologians into a spirited conversation that traverses the limits of conventional orthodoxies, whether doctrinal or disciplinary. It seeks new openings for the emergence of desire, love, and pleasure, while challenging common understandings of these terms. It engages risk at the point where the hope for salvation paradoxically endangers the safety of subjects-in particular, of theological subjects-by opening them to those transgressions of eros in which boundaries, once exceeded, become places of emerging possibility.The eighteen chapters, arranged in thematic clusters, move fluidly among and between premodern and postmodern textual traditions-from Plato to Emerson, Augustine to Kristeva, Mechthild to Mattoso, the Shulammite to Molly Bloom, the Zohar to the Da Vinci Code. In so doing, they link the sublime reaches of theory with the gritty realities of politics, the boundless transcendence of God with the poignant transience of materiality.<br>

  Abstract: To set up a limit is a dual gesture, at once instituting difference and indicating a point of contact. Martin Heidegger’s critique of the discipline of poetics, a recurrent feature throughout his long engagement with poetry, is just such a gesture. On the one hand, he claims that his own readings of poems or
                  Erläuterungen(“soundings-out”) can articulate aspects of these poems to which poetics itself is blind. It thus stands beyond the limits of poetics—limits, that is, not simply born of bad critical practices, but which belong to the very “essence” of poetics as a mode of questioning.<br>

  Author(s): KEARNEY RICHARD<br>
  Abstract: This important book brings together in one volume a collection of illuminating encounters with some of the most important philosophers of our age-by one of its most incisive and innovative critics.For more than twenty years, Richard Kearney has been in conversation with leading philosophers, literary theorists, anthropologists, and religious scholars. His gift is eliciting memorably clear statements about their work from thinkers whose writings can often be challenging in their complexity. Here, he brings together twenty-one originally published extraordinary conversations-his 1984 collection Dialogues: The Phenomenological Heritage, his 1992 Visions of Europe: Conversations on the Legacy and Future of Europe, and his 1995 States of Mind: Dialogues with Contemporary Thinkers. Featured interviewees include Stanislas Breton, Umberto Eco, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Herbert Marcus, George Steiner, Julia Kristeva, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jean-Fran?ois Lyotard. To this classic core, he adds recent interviews, previously unpublished, with Paul Ricoeur, Jean-Luc Marion, Jacques Derrida, and George DumZzil, as well as six colloquies about his own work.Wide-ranging and accessible, these interviews provide a fascinating guide to the ideas, concerns, and personalities of thinkers who have shaped modern intellec-tual life. This book will be an essential point of entry for students, teachers, scholars, and anyone seeking to understand contemporary culture.ContentsPrefacePart One: Recent DebatesJacques Derrida: Terror, Religion, and the New PoliticsJean-Luc Marion: The Hermeneutics of RevelationPaul Ricour: (a) On Life Stories (b) On The Crisis of Authority (c) The Power of the Possible (d) Imagination, Testimony, and TrustGeorges Dumzil: Myth, Ideology, SovereigntyPart Two: From Dialogues: The Phenomenological Heritage, 1984Emmanuel Levinas: Ethics of the InfiniteHerbert Marcuse: The Philosophy of Art and PoliticsPaul Ricour: (a) The Creativity of Language (b) Myth as the Bearer of Possib~<br>

  Book Title: Divine Enticement: Theological Seductions-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): MACKENDRICK KARMEN<br>
  Abstract: Theology usually appears to us to be dogmatic, judgmental, condescending, maybe therapeutic, or perhaps downright fantastical-but seldom enticing. Divine Enticement takes as its starting point that the meanings of theological concepts are not so much logical, truth-valued propositions-affirmative or negative-as they are provocations and evocations. Thus it argues for the seductiveness of both theology and its subject-for, in fact, infinite seduction and enticement as the very sense of theological query. The divine name is one by which we are drawn toward the limits of thought, language, and flesh. The use of language in such conceptualization calls more than it designates. This is not a flaw or a result of vagueness or imprecision in theological language but rather marks the correspondence of such language to its subject: that which, outside of or at the limit of our thought, draws us as an enticement to desire, not least to intellectual desire. Central to the text is the strange semiotics of divine naming, as a call on that for which there cannot be a standard referent. The entanglement of sign and body, not least in interpretations of the Christian incarnation, both grounds and complicates the theological abstractions. A number of traditional notions in Christian theology are reconceived here as enticements, modes of drawing the desires of both body and mind: faith as "thinking with assent"; sacraments as "visible words" read in community; ethics as responsiveness to beauty; prayer as the language of address; scripture as the story of meaning-making. All of these culminate in a sense of a call to and from the purely possible, the open space into which we can be enticed, within which we can be divinely enticing.<br>

  Abstract: If all the world’s a sign, and all things to which signs point become caught in signification again, then our world is full even as it is fleeting, traced with absence even in what stays. With the modern turn away from a sense of saturated signification, the world’s signs are lost not merely, perhaps not even primarily, in their ability to refer indexically; the world at once desacralized and insignificant loses still more its power to seduce.<br>

  Book Title: Muscially Sublime: Indeterminacy, Infinity, Irresolvability-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wurth Kiene Brillenburg<br>
  Abstract: Musically Sublime rewrites musically the history and philosophy of the sublime. Music enables us to reconsider the traditional course of sublime feeling on a track from pain to pleasure. Resisting the notion that there is a single format for sublime feeling, Wurth shows how, from the mid eighteenth century onward, sublime feeling is, instead, constantly rearticulated in a complex interaction with musicality. Wurth takes as her point of departure Immanuel Kant's Critique of Judgment and Jean-Francois Lyotard's aesthetic writings of the 1980s and 1990s. Kant framed the sublime narratively as an epic of self-transcendence. By contrast, Lyotard sought to substitute open immanence for Kantian transcendence, yet he failed to deconstruct the Kantian epic. The book performs this deconstruction by juxtaposing eighteenth- and nineteenth-century conceptions of the infinite, Sehnsucht, the divided self, and unconscious drives with contemporary readings of instrumental music. Critically assessing Edmund Burke, James Usher, E.T.A. Hoffmann, Novalis, Friedrich Holderlin, Arthur Schopenhauer, Richard Wagner, and Friedrich Nietzsche, this book re-presents the sublime as a feeling that defers resolution and hangs suspended between pain and pleasure. Musically Sublime rewrites the mathematical sublime as differance, while it redresses the dynamical sublime as trauma: unending, undetermined, unresolved. Whereas most musicological studies in this area have focused on traces of the Kantian sublime in Handel, Haydn, and Beethoven, this book calls on the nineteenth-century theorist Arthur Seidl to analyze the sublime of, rather than in, music. It does so by invoking Seidl's concept of formwidrigkeit ("form-contrariness") in juxtaposition with Romantic piano music, (post)modernist musical minimalisms, and Lyotard's postmodern sublime. It presents a sublime of matter, rather than form-performative rather than representational. In doing so, Musically Sublime shows that the binary distinction ~<br>

  Book Title: The Roots Of Thinking-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): Sheets-Johnstone Maxine<br>
  Abstract: "A significant contribution to the study of early humans, this book is a philosophical anthropology.... it makes genuinely novel, and highly persuasive, claims within the field itself." --David Depew In this ground-breaking interdisciplinary study about conceptual origins, Maxine Sheets-Johnstone shows that there is an indissoluble bond between hominid thinking and hominid evolution, a bond cemented by the living body. Her thesis is concretely illustrated in eight paleoanthropological case studies ranging from tool-using/tool-making to counting, sexuality, representation, language, death, and cave art. In each case, evidence is brought forward that shows how thinking is modeled on the body-specifically, how concepts are generated by animate form and the tactile-kinesthetic experience. Later chapters critically examine key theoretical and methodological issues posed by the thesis, Sheets-Johnstone demonstrates in detail how and why a corporeal turn in philosophy and the human sciences can yield insights no less extraordinary than those produced by the linguistic turn. In confronting the currently popular doctrine of cultural relativism and the classic Western metaphysical dualism of mind and body, she shows how pan-cultural invariants of human bodily life have been discounted and how the body itself has not been given its due. By a precise exposition of how a full-scale hermeneutics and a genetic phenomenology may be carried out with respect to conceptual origins, she shows how methodological issues are successfully resolved. "Ranging across the humanities and sciences, this thoroughly original book challenges both traditional metaphysics and contemporary cultural relativism. In their place, it persuasively develops a phenomenonological, tactile-kinesthetic account of the origins of thinking. This philosophical anthropology could not be more timely. It replaces the 'linguistic turn' with a promising new 'corporeal turn.'" --John J. Stuhr, University of Oregon "This w~<br>

Tactile–kinesthetic invariants obviously provide the strongest and most direct way of demonstrating those grounds. Rather than taking up these invariants straightaway, however, a more circuitous epistemological route will be followed, and this in order to demonstrate how<br>

  Abstract: Fundamental theology is traditionally viewed as the starting point for the various disciplines within Catholic theology; it is the place where solid foundations are established for the further research and engagement with the vast terrain of historical, systematic, philosophical, and sacramental/liturgical theology. In Foundational Theology, a landmark new study, Neil Ormerod and Christiaan Jacobs-Vandegeer seek to ground foundational theology in the normative drive toward meaning, truth, goodness, and beauty, appropriated by the theologian through religious, moral, intellectual, and psychic conversions. In doing so, the work maps out the implications of those fundamental orientations to the specific questions and topics of the Catholic theological tradition: God, Trinity, revelation, and an array of doctrinal points of investigation. The authors in this work provide a comprehensive approach to theological foundations for theologians while employing a new, groundbreaking approach to the discipline through the application of the insights of Bernard Lonergan, one of the foremost Catholic theologians of the modern era.<br>

  Book Title: The arc and the machine-Narrative and new media<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Bassett Caroline<br>
  Abstract: The Arc and the machine is a timely and original defence of narrative in an age of information. Stressing interpretation and experience alongside affect and sensation it convincingly argues that narrative is key to contemporary forms of cultural production and to the practice of contemporary life. Re-appraising the prospects for narrative in the digital age, it insists on the centrality of narrative to informational culture and provokes a critical re-appraisal of how innovations in information technology as a material cultural form can be understood and assessed. The book offers a careful exploration of narrative theory, a sophisticated critique of techno-cultural writing, and a series of tightly focused case studies. All of which point the way to a restoration of a critical - rather than celebratory approaches - to new media. The scope and range of this book is broad, its argumentation careful and exacting, and its conclusions exciting.<br>

  Abstract: In seeking to establish exactly how the writing of history was conceptualised and practised in the Middle Ages, a sensible starting point is to identify where historiography fitted into a programme of study, that is, where medieval authors would themselves have encountered the writing of history as a body of material and as part and parcel of their education.¹ What becomes immediately apparent is that, initially at least, it would have been as an integral component of the study of grammar and rhetoric – in grammar, as excerpts from classical historians and, in rhetoric, as the theory and practice of narrating<br>

  Abstract: In the view of New Testament scholars, the baptism of Jesus by John is most probably historical, if only for the simple reason that it is inconceivable that the early Christian church would have invented such an embarrassing story about Jesus going through a “sacrament” of repentance for the remission of sins. Although the Fourth Gospel all but ignores the episode, the three Synoptics more or less reluctantly report it. It is even presented as an important event, marked by a theophany declaring Jesus the Son of God. Historically, we may imagine that Jesus at that point was seized by<br>

  Abstract: Was World War II a radical break in French Jewish history—a turning point in notions of community, identity, and political expression—or did the restoration of Jewish citizenship and the Fourth Republic’s promise to protect and defend all citizens regardless of religion or ethnic origin allow long-standing patterns of Jewish identification to reinstate themselves? This chapter will address this question by turning to an aspect of Jewish communal life that transcended the pre- and postwar years—that of how to integrate incoming Jewish refugees and immigrants into communal institutions and French society more broadly.

  Abstract: Although a distinct section of the HBOT, the ‘Latter Prophets’ or ‘Writing Prophets’ are an integral part of the ongoing story of Israel and of the larger story of humanity and creation that begins in Genesis 1. Most of the books commence with a superscription that locates the particular prophet at a certain point in the storyline. For example, Isaiah 1:1 refers to the vision that Isaiah saw ‘in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah kings of Judah’. Some books of the twelve ‘minor prophets’ lack this kind of superscription but can nevertheless be located along the storyline<br>

Their responses reflect the precise historical moment in which this project took place: the end of the first decade of devolution, the recent 9/11 and 7/7 attacks and bombings, an intense focus on asylum and immigration, and an attempt to reinstate Britishness as an explicit point of collective identification. Starting by outlining some of the theories of national belonging, we will go on to present and analyse responses picked up in our fieldwork.

  Abstract: Despite journalistic normative claims that news accounts on poverty are driven by a quest for social justice, the way poverty is articulated today by the global news media is instead a convergent by-product of more down-to-earth organisational dynamics and interests that happen within the newsrooms. First, we can point to the media’s editorial and news policies, which are shaped by a multiplicity of interests and objectives; second, we have the ideological interventions and approaches of journalists and editors in the process of news gathering and dissemination; and, third, the framing provided by news sources and news shapers in the construction<br>

Her first fictional publication (the author is also a journalist) is not so much a novel as a series of vignettes about sex written from a young woman’s point of view<br>

From his starting point in phenomenology, Ricoeur ventured into structuralism, psychoanalysis, biblical studies, linguistics, narrative theory, historiography, and even neuroscience. Ricoeur’s exploration in these diverse fields is part of his overarching project of philosophical anthropology, which asks the questions of human being, self-understanding, and action. These questions also provide the context for Ricoeur’s work in the philosophy of religion, which is where Bonhoeffer’s influence on Ricoeur is most evident.<br>

  Book Title: Le bal des arts-Le sujet et l’image : écrire avec l’art<br>
  Publisher: Quodlibet<br>
  Author(s): Rolla Chiara<br>
  Abstract: Aujourd’hui, les frontières des formes artistiques tendent à devenir de plus en plus indéfinissables sous l’effet d’une intense activité de circulation, d’hybridation et de métissage conduisant à la naissance de nouveaux régimes de la création et à la composition d’oeuvres complexes et multiples. Les textes littéraires n’échappent pas à cette transformation mettant en scène de nouveaux paradigmes de lecture et de signification par l’expérimentation d’autres manières de dire la réalité, de raconter des histoires, de se poser face au monde. Le sujet, son statut et les modalités de sa présence dans les oeuvres littéraires qui entretiennent une relation avec les autres arts, sont autant d’axes privilégiés dans ce volume. En transgressant les frontières entre les arts, les oeuvres donnent à voir et à penser des univers de signification et de représentation élargis devant lesquels le sujet bénéficie en retour d’un accroissement de ses capacités de compréhension et d’invention. Dans ces textes la communication entre les différentes formes artistiques se trouve mise en jeu au point qu’il ne suffit plus de la définir en termes d’hybridation, et qu’il convient peut-être mieux d’y réfléchir en termes d’intermédialité. Le présent volume reprend ces thématiques de recherche et ces interrogations ; il les approfondit et les développe en déchiffrant des pratiques d’écriture contemporaines qui entretiennent des rapports étroits avec les arts et les techniques de l’image. Les mises au point théoriques et méthodologiques côtoient des analyses pointues et des propositions d’interprétation de phénomènes nouveaux et encore peu définis par la critique.<br>

  Abstract: The notion of French exceptionalism is deeply embedded in the nation's self-image and in a range of political and academic discourses. Recently, the debate about whether France really is "exceptional" has acquired a critical edge. Against the background of introspection about the nature of "national identity," some proclaim "normalisation" and the end of French exceptionalism, while others point out to the continuing evidence that France remains distinctive at a number of levels, from popular culture to public policy. This book explores the notion of French exceptionalism, places it in its European context, examines its history and evaluate its continuing relevance in a range of fields from politics and public policy to popular culture and sport.<br>

  Abstract: Magic, sorcery and witchcraft are at the epistemological centre of anthropology. They embed matters at the heart of the definition of modern anthropology, and the critical issues that they raise are of enduring significance for the discipline.

  Book Title: Critical White Studies-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stefancic Jean<br>
  Abstract: No longer content with accepting whiteness as the norm, critical scholars have turned their attention to whiteness itself. In
      Critical White Studies: Looking Behind the Mirror, numerous thinkers, including Toni Morrison, Eric Foner, Peggy McIntosh, Andrew Hacker, Ruth Frankenberg, John Howard Griffin, David Roediger, Kathleen Heal Cleaver, Noel Ignatiev, Cherrie Moraga, and Reginald Horsman, attack such questions as:*How was whiteness invented, and why?*How has the category whiteness changed over time?*Why did some immigrant groups, such as the Irish and Jews, start out as nonwhite and later became white?*Can some individual people be both white and nonwhite at different times, and what does it mean to "pass for white"?*At what point does pride in being white cross the line into white power or white supremacy?*What can whites concerned over racial inequity or white privilege do about it?Science and pseudoscience are presented side by side to demonstrate how our views on whiteness often reflect preconception, not fact. For example, most scientists hold that race is not a valid scientific category -- genetic differences between races are insignificant compared to those within them. Yet, the "one drop" rule, whereby those with any nonwhite heritage are classified as nonwhite, persists even today. As the bell curve controversy shows, race concepts die hard, especially when power and prestige lie behind them.A sweeping portrait of the emerging field of whiteness studies,Critical White Studiespresents, for the first time, the best work from sociology, law, history, cultural studies, and literature. Delgado and Stefancic expressly offer critical white studies as the next step in critical race theory. In focusing on whiteness, not only do they ask nonwhites to investigate more closely for what it means for others to be white, but also they invite whites to examine themselves more searchingly and to "look behind the mirror."<br>

  Book Title: Death's Following: Mediocrity, Dirtiness, Adulthood, Literature-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): LIMON JOHN<br>
  Abstract: Almost all twentieth-century philosophy stresses the immanence of death in human life-as drive (Freud), as the context of Being (Heidegger), as the essence of our defining ethics (Levinas), or as language (de Man, Blanchot). In Death's Following, John Limon makes use of literary analysis (of Sebald, Bernhard, and Stoppard), cultural analysis, and autobiography to argue that death is best conceived as always transcendentally beyond ourselves, neither immanent nor imminent. Adapting Kierkegaard's variations on the theme of Abraham's near-sacrifice of Isaac while refocusing the emphasis onto Isaac, Limon argues that death should be imagined as if hiding at the end of an inexplicable journey to Moriah. The point is not to evade or ignore death but to conceive it more truly, repulsively, and pervasively in its camouflage: for example, in jokes, in logical puzzles, in bowdlerized folk songs. The first of Limon's two key concepts is adulthood: the prolonged anti-ritual for experiencing the full distance on the look of death. His second is dirtiness, as theorized in a Jewish joke, a logical exemplum, and T. S. Eliot's "Ash Wednesday": In each case, unseen dirt on foreheads suggests the invisibility of inferred death. Not recognizing death immediately or admitting its immanence and imminence is for Heidegger the defining characteristic of the "they," humanity in its inauthentic social escapism. But Limon vouches throughout for the mediocrity of the "they" in its dirty and ludicrous adulthood. Mediocrity is the privileged position for previewing death, in Limon's opinion: practice for being forgotten. In refusing the call of twentieth-century philosophy to face death courageously, Limon urges the ethical and aesthetic value of mediocre anti-heroism.<br>

  Abstract: In this paper I take select concrete “instances” as opportunities for reflection, openings for imagining a broader practice of carnal hermeneutics. These instances include snatches of conversation, experiences, and works of art. The general assumption is that these cases exhibit many “thinks at a time,” that philosophical reflection can bring this out, and that such reflection feeds back into deepening the original experience. After years in the deconstructive trenches, I have been recently influenced by a certain strain of Wittgensteinian practice.

  Book Title: Words of Life: New Theological Turns in French Phenomenology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Words of Life is the sequel and companion to Phenomenology and the Theological Turn,edited by Dominique Janicaud, Jean-Francois Courtine, Jean-Louis Chrtien, Michel Henry, Jean-Luc Marion, and Paul Ricoeur. In that volume, Janicaud accuses Levinas, Henry, Marion, and Chrtien of veeringfrom phenomenological neutrality to a theologically inflected phenomenology. By contrast, the contributors to this collection interrogate whether phenomenology's proper starting point is agnostic or atheistic. Many hold the view that phenomenology after the theological turn may very well be true both to itself and to the phenomenological things themselves.In one way or another, all of these essays contend with the limits and expectations of phenomenology. As such, they are all concerned with what counts as properphenomenology and even the very structure of phenomenology. None of them, however, is limited to such questions. Indeed, the rich tapestry that they weave tells us much about human experience. Themes such as faith, hope, love, grace, the gift, the sacraments, the words of Christ, suffering, joy, life, the call, touch, listening, wounding, and humility are woven throughout the various meditations in this volume. The contributors use striking examples to illuminate the structure and limits of phenomenology and, in turn, phenomenology serves to clarify those very examples. Thus practice clarifies theory and theory clarifies practice, resulting in new theological turns and new life for phenomenology. The volume showcases the work of both senior and junior scholars, including Jean-Luc Marion, Jean-Yves Lacoste, Kevin Hart, Anthony J. Steinbock, Jeffrey Bloechl, Jeffrey L. Kosky, Clayton Crockett, Brian Treanor, and Christina Gschwandtner-as well as the editors themselves.<br>

On closer examination, however, this contrast does not engender divergence as much as difference that suggests its own sameness in being different. Alternatively expressed, exposure of the concealed and concealment of the exposed ought not be seen as binary opposites; hermeneutically, exposure is the most exposed concealment, and concealment the most concealed exposure.

  Book Title: Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the Ethical Self-Christology, Ethics, and Formation<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Elliston Clark J.<br>
  Abstract: Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s work has persistently challenged Christian consciousness due to both his death at the hands of the Nazis and his provocative prison musings about Christian faithfulness in late modernity. Although understandable given the popularity of both narrative trajectories, such selective focus obscures the depth and fecundity of his overall corpus. Bonhoeffer’s early work, and particularly his Christocentric anthropology, grounds his later expressed commitments to responsibility and faithfulness in a “world come of age." While much debate accompanies claims regarding the continuity of Bonhoeffer’s thought, there are central motifs which pervade his work from his doctoral dissertation to the prison writings. This book suggests that a concern for otherness permeates all of Bonhoeffer’s work. Furthermore, Clark Elliston articulates, drawing on Bonhoeffer, a Christian self-defined by its orientation towards otherness. Taking Bonhoeffer as both the origin and point of return, the text engages Emmanuel Levinas and Simone Weil as dialogue partners who likewise stress the role of the other for self-understanding, albeit in diverse ways. By reading Bonhoeffer “through" their voices, one enhances Bonhoeffer’s already fertile understanding of responsibility.<br>

  Book Title: On the Anarchy of Poetry and Philosophy-A Guide for the Unruly<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRUNS GERALD L.<br>
  Abstract: Marcel Duchamp once asked whether it is possible to make something that is not a work of art. This question returns over and over in modernist culture, where there are no longer any authoritative criteria for what can be identified (or excluded) as a work of art. As William Carlos Williams says, A poem can be made of anything,even newspaper clippings.At this point, art turns into philosophy, all art is now conceptual art, and the manifesto becomes the distinctive genre of modernism. This book takes seriously this transformation of art into philosophy, focusing upon the systematic interest that so many European philosophers take in modernism. Among the philosophers Gerald Bruns discusses are Theodor W. Adorno, Maurice Blanchot, Arthur Danto, Stanley Cavell, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Franois Lyotard, Jean-Luc Nancy, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, and Emmanuel Levinas.As Bruns demonstrates, the difficulty of much modern and contemporary poetry can be summarized in the idea that a poem is made of words, not of any of the things that we use words to produce: meanings, concepts, propositions, narratives, or expressions of feeling. Many modernist poets have argued that in poetry language is no longer a form of mediation but a reality to be explored and experienced in its own right. But what sort of experience, philosophically, might this be? The problem of the materiality or hermetic character of poetic language inevitably leads to questions of how philosophy itself is to be written and what sort of communitydefines the work of art-or, for that matter, the work of philosophy.In this provocative study, Bruns answers that the culture of modernism is a kind of anarchist community, where the work of art is apt to be as much an event or experience-or, indeed, an alternative form of life-as a formal object. In modern writing, philosophy and poetry fold into one another. In this book, Bruns helps us to see how.<br>

  Book Title: Constellations of a Contemporary Romanticism-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): McGrath Brian<br>
  Abstract: Constellations of a Contemporary Romanticism takes its title and point of departure from Walter Benjamin's concept of the historical constellation, which puts both "contemporary" and "romanticism" in play as period designations and critical paradigms. Featuring fascinating and diverse contributions by an international roster of distinguished scholars working in and out of romanticism--from deconstruction to new historicism, from queer theory to postcolonial studies, from visual culture to biopolitics--this volume makes good on a central tenet of Benjamin's conception of history: These critics "grasp the constellation" into which our "own era has formed with a definite earlier one." Each of these essays approaches romanticism as a decisive and unexpired thought experiment that makes demands on and poses questions for our own time: What is the unlived of a contemporary romanticism? What has romanticism's singular untimeliness bequeathed to futurity? What is romanticism's contemporary "redemption value" for painting and politics, philosophy and film?<br>

Her aim is to provide a revised history of Renaissance Machiavellism, particularly in England: one that sees the Machiavel and the republican as equally valid--and related--readings of Machiavelli's work.<br>

  Abstract: The word ‘atheism’ is derived from the Greek: a meaning ‘not’ is conjoined with theos meaning ‘god’. So atheism may be defined as follows: it is the belief that there is no God.

In this educational book, Michael Palmer undertakes to analyse, develop and discuss the complex and too often reduced notion of atheism. In spite of the consciously atheist point of view adopted by the author, the volume remains critical and objective, making religious, philosophical and political concepts around atheism understandable. Even though the book clearly addresses a young audience, any kind of reader will find food for thought in this vivid and detailed work.<br>

Further, I hope that it is clear that we can now no longer simply

  Book Title: The Crisis of Global Capitalism-Pope Benedict XVI's Social Encyclical and the Future of Political Economy<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Pabst Adrian<br>
  Abstract: The current economic crisis stems from a deeper crisis of cultural imagination and civilisational ethics: here is the starting point of this collection of essays which draw a new political economy facing the crisis of Western civilization. This book gathers together a range of audacious and provocative readings of Caritas in Veritate, the first papal encyclical that addresses issues immediately relevant for politic, economic, and social theory. These readings embody the kind of fruitful dialogue Pope Benedict XVI wanted to generate with his radical discourse for an alternative political economy.<br>

  Book Title: In the Eyes of God-A Metaphorical Approach to Biblical Anthropomorphic Language<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Howell Brian C.<br>
  Abstract: Anthropomorphic language has provided a conundrum for exegetes and theologians for millennia. Attempting to use human language to describe the divine presents ontological and epistemological problems that push our speech to the breaking point. In this new work, Howell shows that instances of divine action should not automatically be reduced simply to theological categories such as omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence, immutability, etc., nor to criteria such as personhood, life, and approachability. Rather, he introduced readers to two unique approaches to “anthropomorphic expressions".<br>

  Abstract: Anthropomorphic language has provided a conundrum for exegetes and theologians for millennia. Attempting to use human language to describe the divine presents ontological and epistemological problems that push our speech to the breaking point. Initially, we looked at several different modes of speech, the univocal, equivocal, analogical, and metaphorical, looking at their approach to speaking of a transcendent being. The univocal approach treated language for God and for humans as having the same sense. This immediately runs into problems, however, as God is a non-created Being and His attributes are neither contingent nor finite in nature. Process theologians attempt to<br>

Because of his significant wrestling with the problems of modern theology and ethics in the early twentieth century, the early years of Barth’s thinking (1916–31) provides an important point of departure for our study. Barth rejects the anthropocentric “immanent frame” of liberal theology, by shifting theology away from personal religious consciousness toward a genuine search for the divine trinitarian

  Abstract: A central motif in the ethics of the Danish theologian and philosopher K. E.

Løgstrup has a phenomenological starting point, describing an ontological structure according to which human beings are delivered over into each other’s hands, thereby raising an ethical demand. In every encounter with another human being there is an ethical demand requiring care for the other.² For Løgstrup this is a universal demand and therefore not something unique to the Christian tradition.

In this chapter, I will argue that without a heuristic account of evil, people will be unable to discern why demonization continues the cycle of violence. We will see that social exclusion and humiliation provide for the emergence and survival of demonizing processes, while acts of dehumanization escalate those processes to the point where those demonized are robbed of their subjectivity.

  Abstract: Canadienne, Parisienne, musicienne, écrivaine de rénommée internationale, Nancy Huston séduit aussi bien par ses essais provocateurs que par ses romans audacieux. Vivant entre deux langues et deux cultures, elle a conquis tant les publics francophone qu'anglophone. La narratrice d'Instruments des ténèbres formule cette phrase troublante : « Pas de vision sans division. Je ne cesse de comparer, combiner, séduire, traduire, trahir. J'ai le coeur et le cerveau fendus, comme les sabots du Malin. Anglais, français. » C'est avec cette citation comme point de départ que cet ouvrage propose une vision de son écriture centrée sur le dédoublement et la duplicité. Des auteurs en provenance de nombreux pays présentent un oeuvre où priment les thèmes de l'exil et de l'enfermement, de la musique et de la folie, de l'enfance et de la vieillesse, sous la plume d'une écrivaine qui, selon le Magazine littéraire, compte au nombre de ceux « qui ne cessent de détruire pour mieux pouvoir reconstruire ». Au tout début de ce livre, le lecteur découvrira un essai de Nancy Huston sur le film The Hours. Il s'agit en fait d'une réflexion fascinante sur la création, la vie et la mort : une vision qu'elle a dédoublée selon sa coutume en français et en anglais.<br>

While the idealist interpretation antedates Ingarden’s first statement of criticism, his ceaseless endeavour to drive home his point for his entire career has resulted in his being designated its chief proponent. The current debate concerning Husserl’s metaphysical position may be said to have been initiated by Richard Holmes’s 1975 paper “Is Transcendental Phenomenology Committed to Idealism?,”¹ which, like most of the recent literature, identifies Ingarden as such. With regard exclusively to Ingarden’s interpretation, the issue as addressed in the recent literature focusses on<br>

  Abstract: Blank pages, comic strips, quotations, jokes, dreams, rhymes, newspaper clippings, ads, etymologies, multiple selves, silence: what we have traditionally referred to as the writing of Audrey Thomas is obsessed with the contextual, contradictory meanings, and meaninglessnesses, of words, with the ways subjectivity is represented, in fact present only, in and as language. When I say “the writing of Audrey Thomas” then, I mean to point out the duplicity of the phrase. The words “the writing of Audrey Thomas” may refer to those texts which, because of our particular ideology of literary production, we say have been written by Audrey Thomas,<br>

  Book Title: Europe et traduction-  Publisher: Les Presses de l'Université d'Ottawa<br>
  Author(s): Ballard Michel<br>
  Abstract: La traduction est un phénomène central pour l'Europe telle qu'elle est en train de se construire : elle assure les échanges entre états sans qu'une langue commune donne l'impression d'une hégémonie quelconque ou d'un abandon des identités nationales. Cet attachement à la notion d'identité tout en ménageant les échanges culturels est une constante de l'histoire européenne et ces échanges passées, fondés sur la traduction, font que la construction de l'Europe ne se réduit pas à la création d'une entité économique et politique : elle possède une dimension humaine et culturelle spécifique, qui lui donne son âme. Ce colloque a abordé ces deux aspects du rôle de la traduction en Europe : dans le passé et aujourd'hui comme facteur de découverte mutuelle et ferment culturel ; de manière plus spécifique aujourd'hui comme facteur d'équilibre et instrument de communication au sein des institutions. Le colloque a rassemblé des spécialistes de nombreux pays européens ou observateurs jetant un regard sur l'Europe. Les textes partent de la traduction en Irlande au Moyen Age pour aboutir aux traducteurs allemands de Roumanie au XIXe siècle. La dernière partie du colloque tente de faire le point sur divers aspects de la recherche en matière de traductologie ainsi que la formation des traducteurs.<br>

  Author(s) Rambo Shelly<br>
  Abstract: Leafing through introductory textbooks in Christian systematic theology, you will find discussions of salvation located in multiple places—under the topics of Christology (the nature and work of Christ), the “other” religions, and eschatology, the study of last or final things. Insofar as these primers orient elementary readers into knowledge of Christian faith, they set out the major points for theological discussion and debate. Eschatology often becomes the major landing point for discussions of salvation because the question of salvation is often framed in terms of ultimate ends. Under the doctrine of eschatology, soteriological discussions will circle around Jesus’s saying,<br>

  Book Title: The Wedding Feast of the Lamb-Eros, the Body, and the Eucharist<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hughes George<br>
  Abstract: Emmanuel Falque's The Wedding Feast of the Lamb represents a turning point in his thought. Here, Falque links philosophy and theology in an original fashion that allows us to see the full effect of theology's "backlash" against philosophy. By attending closely to the incarnation and the eucharist, Falque develops a new concept of the body and of love: By avoiding the common mistake of "angelism"--consciousness without body--Falque considers the depths to which our humanity reflects animality, or body without consciousness. He shows the continued relevance of the question "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?" (John 6:52), especially to philosophy. We need to question the meaning of "this is my body" in "a way that responds to the needs of our time" (Vatican II). Because of the ways that "Hoc est corpus meum" has shaped our culture and our modernity, this is a problem both for religious belief and for culture.<br>

By focusing on the absent, writers are able to discuss the community in which the story circulates. More broadly, contemporary media novels point to those elements of the story that are<br>

He emphasizes the extent to which scholarship on Latin America has been fundamentally defined by the need to point to or show phenomena that are most essentially characterized by the lack of graspable form, or formlessness, if by form we understand Western schemata meant to determine universally what is and is not thinkable, and more generally, what can and should be and what falls beneath the dignity of Being.

  Abstract: The title of this chapter derives from a metonymical displacement. Blanchot himself never authorized any confusion between his role as a drafter of the

The co-authors proceeded to quote from Karl Marx and Max Weber to suggest that there was an epistemological principle articulated in the Saussurean statement that unified social science practice in spite of ideological differences, one that involves seeing science as ‘an instrument for breaking with naive realism’ ([1968], 1991, 33).

On this point it is tempting simply to paraphrase Lacan and say that there is no academic relation. A nominal adjective like “Freudian” can—and does—cover a multitude of (largely inaccurate) sins, but “Kleinian” and “Kohutian” are not part of the undergraduate vocabulary, nor, so far as I can tell, are names like Winnicott, Bion, Bowlby, or Kernberg.<br>

In this work, a theoretical perspective is opened, which I define as the “contingency of antagonism” – an Adornian concept. I will argue: (a) that this is an original perspective, irreducible to any previous philosophical positions, (b) that Marx’s intuition finds a more sophisticated reformulation in Adorno, and (c) that the idea of a contingent antagonism can provide a key to overcome the apparently antinomical outcome of negative dialectic.

While his lectures embodied Kant’s crisis of identity as a professional philosopher, thus facilitating a border crossing between philosophy and anthropology,Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of Viewwas far short of his earlier critique of metaphysics and wanted anthropology to play by universal principles if not be totally subordinated to metaphysics.<br>

This neglect stands in stark contrast to the situation prevailing in Europe in the early and middle part of the last century, which can be described as the heyday of philosophical anthropology.¹ The basic aim of the present volume is to rescue the topic from oblivion, and more specifically to recover the older European legacy while transforming it in the light<br>

Although the six polities, or ‘worlds of worth’, that they present derive value from quite different sources, each world is subject to the same general accounting principles, such that one can compare how the worlds allocate costs and benefits to sustain their respective conceptions of value. Indeed, the very possibility of critique appears to require this capacity. (I shall return to this point below.) The general principles behind the polities are simple but clever:<br>

And what potential contribution can intellectuals make to it? This last question is the one that I would like to address here, taking Bourdieu’s own answers to it as my starting point.

  Abstract: Boorer explores the theology of an originally independent Priestly narrative (Pg), extending through Genesis-Numbers, as a whole. In this book she describes the structure of the Priestly narrative, in particular its coherent sequential and parallel patterns. Boorer argues that at every point in the narrative's sequential and parallel structure, it reshapes past traditions, synthesizing these with contemporary and unique elements into future visions, in a way that is akin to the timelessness of liturgical texts. The book sheds new light on what this material might have sought to accomplish as a whole, and how it might have functioned for, its original audience.<br>

  Abstract: The Italian biotechnological sector has become a battlefield between the Catholic Church and the various actors who disagree with its positions. They represent various power and knowledge subsystems in a society which has become complex. The conflict also grows out of the paradox of a society – like the Italian – which is partly secularized but can still portray itself as majority Catholic. From the social point of view, Catholicism continues to be the
                  basso continuoof collective conscience, although among the Italian population many attitudes and behaviours in the field of faith and religious practice have deviated – either discreetly or decisively<br>

  Abstract: I have been acquainted with several people who have worked as missionaries to tribes in Third World countries that had not yet heard the gospel.

If the missionary ever hopes to have the tribe eventually embrace the gospel and abandon their inhumane customs, they must rather initially<br>

  Abstract: In this essay I argue that applying the principles of unnatural narratology in the form of what I call unnaturalizing reading strategies to the interpretation of unnatural narratives is often a more appropriate choice than applying the principles of naturalization and familiarization. A main contention is that Genette’s separation of voice and mood (who speaks and who perceives) and Genette’s understanding of focalization as a restriction of access to point of view are more radical proposals than previous narratologists have recognized—and that they are in line with unnatural narratology and allow for unnaturalizing reading strategies.<br>

  Abstract: In the theory of autobiography, theoretical developments in literary studies are clearly reflected. From an earlier mimetic understanding of the genre as the representation of an autonomous and homogeneous self the pendulum swung to the deconstructionist view, dominant in the late 1970s and early 1980s. According to deconstructionist tenets, there can be no representation of self in language, but only an illusion of “self” generated by a purely textual subject. It was at this point that theorists like Michael Sprinker even went as far as to proclaim the “end of autobiography” (Sprinker 1980). Since the late 1980s, however, the pendulum<br>

  Abstract: In contemporary anthropology, much is made of the ways in which meaning is constructed by a culture’s members. The interpretive act by which sense is asserted, such as in the interpretation of art or dreams or language, is a moment m which such constructions of meaning become particularly clear. It seems therefore a particularly vital point at which to observe a culture’s workings. The meeting of individuals and events that interpretation implies is a reapplication of principles, occasionally a revision, rarely, in Java at least, a radical reconsideration of them.

  Book Title: Absorbing Perfections-Kabbalah and Interpretation<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Bloom Harold<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging discussion of Kabbalah-from the mystical trends of medieval Judaism to modern Hasidism-one of the world's foremost scholars considers different visions of the nature of the sacred text and of the methods to interpret it. Moshe Idel takes as a starting point the fact that the postbiblical Jewish world lost its geographical center with the destruction of the temple and so was left with a textual center, the Holy Book. Idel argues that a text-oriented religion produced language-centered forms of mysticism.Against this background, the author demonstrates how various Jewish mystics amplified the content of the Scriptures so as to include everything: the world, or God, for example. Thus the text becomes a major realm for contemplation, and the interpretation of the text frequently becomes an encounter with the deepest realms of reality. Idel delineates the particular hermeneutics belonging to Jewish mysticism, investigates the progressive filling of the text with secrets and hidden levels of meaning, and considers in detail the various interpretive strategies needed to decodify the arcane dimensions of the text.<br>

  Book Title: Agitations-Essays on Life and Literature<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Krystal Arthur<br>
  Abstract: We disagree. From small questions of taste to large questions concerning the nature of existence, intellectual debate takes up much of our time. In this book the respected literary critic Arthur Krystal examines what most commentators ignore: the role of temperament and taste in the forming of aesthetic and ideological opinions. In provocative essays about reading and writing, about the relation between life and literature, about knowledge and certainty, about God and death, and about his own gradual disaffection with the literary scene, Krystal demonstrates that opposing points of view are based more on innate predilections than on disinterested thought or analysis.Not beholden to any fashionable theory or political agenda, Krystal interrogates the usual suspects in the cultural wars from an independent, though not impartial, vantage point. Clearly personal and unabashedly belletrist, his essays ask important questions. What makes culture one thing and not another? What inspires aesthetic values? What drives us to make comparisons? And how does a bias for one kind of evidence as opposed to another contribute to the form and content of intellectual argument?<br>

  Abstract: As Laura Mulvey’s landmark essay, “Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema,” continues to endure as the point of reference for feminist discussions of film spectatorship, so Manthia Diawara’s “Black Spectatorship: Problems of Identification and Resistance” arguably occupies a similar position for thinking about black spectatorship and, more generally, racialized spectatorship.¹ Yet, as Janet Bergstrom and Mary Ann Doane caution in their introduction to “The Spectatrix” special issue of 
                  Camera Obscura in 1989, it is important “to avoid an overly linear account of the development of feminist interest in the female spectator,”² a forced linearity that might overlook significant contributions to and<br>

  Abstract: During the 1960s the structuralists had declared Sartre, as well as the paradigm of existential phenomenology he represented, obsolete, or “passé.” However, May 1968 signified a resounding vindication of Sartre’s doctrine of human freedom, for May demonstrated that “events” happened, that history was more than the opaque, frozen landscape the structuralists had made it out to be. Thereafter, Sartre’s concerted involvement with the Maoists—at one point, he served as the titular editor of no fewer than three Maoist publications (
                  La Cause du Peuple, J’Accuse,andTout!)—catapulted him to the center stage of French political life. Since the May<br>

In the years since, the volume of this lament has grown to the point of becoming audible within the main corridors of contemporary political debate. Most of these persons were “paleo” or traditional conservatives, who saw in the George W.

The only point in common throughout history has been the goal of helping people overcome disease and promote health. But if we try to analyze the contents proper of those two terms, “health” and “disease,” we realize that over time their meaning has changed; a canonical or paradigmatic concept cannot be found for them.

  Book Title: Fiction, propagande, témoignage, réalité-Cinq microessais sur la représentation de la guerre civile espagnole en Italie<br>
  Publisher: Quodlibet<br>
  Author(s): Curreri Luciano<br>
  Abstract: Ces cinq micro-essais sont consacrés à l’un des épisodes historiques les plus denses et complexes du XXe siècle : la guerre civile espagnole (1936-39), dont on célèbre cette année le 80e anniversaire. En Italie peut-être plus qu’ailleurs, fiction et réalité s’entremêlent dans la représentation de la guerre d’Espagne. En effet, l’histoire du « Bel Paese » a très vite fait osciller entre Droite et Gauche toute une série d’éléments qu’on aurait pourtant cru n’appartenir qu’à une seule vision du monde : le thème de la croisade, par exemple, ou l’ordre ‘militaro-narratif’, figures idéologiquement affiliables à un credo conservateur, comme on le sait, mais qu’on retrouve, néanmoins, à gauche. En ce sens, et dès le premier de ces micro-essais, il faudra affronter de façon quelque peu malicieuse et provocatrice un obstacle épistémologique coriace, pour faire le point sur une certaine réalité et l’usage plus ou moins légitime qu’en fait la fiction, avançant ou reculant entre propagande et témoignages et circulant entre narration, reportage, études, pamphlets, théâtre, cinéma, bande dessinée : et ceci d’un côté à l’autre de la barricade. On s’apercevra alors de la nécessité de ne pas se concentrer seulement sur les chefs-d’oeuvre, ni de se référer à une inutile philologie des représentations de la guerre d’Espagne — même si l’on ne négligera pas certains instruments connus de tous les philologues.<br>

  Book Title: The Imaginary Revolution-Parisian Students and Workers in 1968<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Seidman Michael<br>
  Abstract: The events of 1968 have been seen as a decisive turning point in the Western world. The author takes a critical look at "May 1968" and questions whether the events were in fact as "revolutionary" as French and foreign commentators have indicated. He concludes the student movement changed little that had not already been challenged and altered in the late fifties and early sixties. The workers' strikes led to fewer working hours and higher wages, but these reforms reflected the secular demands of the French labor movement. "May 1968" was remarkable not because of the actual transformations it wrought but rather by virtue of the revolutionary power that much of the media and most scholars have attributed to it and which turned it into a symbol of a youthful, renewed, and freer society in France and beyond.<br>

First, to dispose briefly of an objection that will seem irrelevant to scholars of Chinese art: that the Chinese tradition is apt to be understood in Western terms because it is simpler or narrower than our own.

Philosophers from the Greeks-to the twentieth century have advanced numerous theories of knowledge—for example, that knowledge comes from the senses and is reducible to a collection of sense impressions, or that knowledge comes from the creative activity of the rational mind. Traditionally they have also discussed questions of a more abstract, reflective kind: What problems should epistemology investigate? What are the limits of our knowledge? What method(s) should one employ in epistemology?<br>

  Book Title: The Superstitious Muse-Thinking Russian Literature Mythopoetically<br>
  Publisher: Academic Studies Press<br>
  Author(s): Bethea David M.<br>
  Abstract: For several decades David Bethea has written authoritatively on the “mythopoetic thinking" that lies at the heart of classical Russian literature, especially Russian poetry. His theoretically informed essays and books have made a point of turning back to issues of intentionality and biography at a time when authorial agency seems under threat of “erasure" and the question of how writers, and poets in particular, live their lives through their art is increasingly moot. The lichnost’ (personhood, psychic totality) of the given writer is all-important, argues Bethea, as it is that which combines the specifically biographical and the capaciously mythical in verbal units that speak simultaneously to different planes of being. Pushkin’s Evgeny can be one incarnation of the poet himself and an Everyman rising up to challenge Peter’s new world order; Brodsky can be, all at once, Dante and Mandelstam and himself, the exile paying an Orphic visit to Florence (and, by ghostly association, Leningrad).This sort of metempsychosis, where the stories that constitute the Ur-texts of Russian literature are constantly reworked in the biographical myths shaping individual writers’ lives, is Bethea’s primary focus. This collection contains a liberal sampling of Bethea’s most memorable previously published essays along with new studies prepared for this occasion.<br>

  Book Title: Reasoning from Faith-Fundamental Theology in Merold Westphal’s Philosophy of Religion<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): SANDS JUSTIN<br>
  Abstract: Merold Westphal is considered to be one of the preeminent Continental philosophers of religion. His articulation of faith as the task of a lifetime has become a touchstone in contemporary debates concerning faith's relationship to reason. As Justin Sands explores his philosophy, he illuminates how Westphal's concept of faith reveals the pastoral, theological intent behind his thinking. Sands sees Westphal's philosophy as a powerful articulation of Protestant theology, but one that is in ecumenical dialogue with questions concerning apologetics and faith's relationship to ethics and responsibility, a more Catholic point of view. By bringing out these features in Westphal's philosophy, Sands intends to find core philosophical methodologies as well as a passable bridge for philosophers to cross over into theological discourses.<br>

This is also the case for Husserlian phenomenology, which he sees as replicating Hegel by being purely descriptive, never prescriptive.¹ At this point, it is clear that Westphal aims to push philosophy into the realm of action: to not just reasonably argue but to move those arguments toward helping the widow, orphan, and stranger.

Here, however, I do not intend to theorise the emptiness of the subject in an abstract, psychoanalytic sense. Instead, my conceptual and empirical focus is on a particular group of rural, post-colonial men. Specifically, this chapter concerns shifting signifiers of masculinity in the Sepik region in Melanesia, this being the issue and region that so vexed Tuzin (1997) in his magisterial account of the demise of the male cult in Ilahita<br>

Relative, again, to this kind of subject, general logic functions to identify a set of conditions that this subject can come to see, reflectively, as necessary for the possibility of its own thought. Furthermore, any agent one takes to satisfy the above criteria—<br>

Before examining how classical theism might respond to the problem of the one and the many with reference to the distinction between finite and transcendent being, or the Creator-creature distinction, I will point to ways in which it appears that process thinkers themselves do not avoid this<br>

  Abstract: The year 1917 was a turning point for Heidegger. Prior to 1917, he never openly questioned the Roman Catholic/Scholastic appropriation of philosophical methods into theology. After 1917, Heidegger began to regard Scholasticism as the site of the hegemony of theoretical speculative-aesthetic concepts in Christianity and the consequent forgetting of factical Christian life. The catalyst in this reversal was Heidegger’s discovery of Protestantism, Schleiermacher, Dilthey, and above all, Luther. We know Heidegger was reading Luther as early as 1909, although evidence of an intensive study of Luther only appears ten years later.¹ Heidegger came to believe that Luther had correctly identified<br>

  Book Title: Mirages and Mad Beliefs-Proust the Skeptic<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Prendergast Christopher<br>
  Abstract: Marcel Proust was long the object of a cult in which the main point of reading his great novel
      In Search of Lost Timewas to find, with its narrator, a redemptive epiphany in a pastry and a cup of lime-blossom tea. We now live in less confident times, in ways that place great strain on the assumptions and beliefs that made those earlier readings possible. This has led to a new manner of reading Proust, against the grain. InMirages and Mad Beliefs, Christopher Prendergast argues the case differently, with the grain, on the basis that Proust himself was prey to self-doubt and found numerous, if indirect, ways of letting us know. Prendergast traces in detail the locations and forms of a quietly nondogmatic yet insistently skeptical voice that questions the redemptive aesthetic the novel is so often taken to celebrate, bringing the reader to wonder whether that aesthetic is but another instance of the mirage or the mad belief that, in other guises, figures prominently inIn Search of Lost Time. In tracing the modalities of this self-pressuring voice, Prendergast ranges far and wide, across a multiplicity of ideas, themes, sources, and stylistic registers in Proust's literary thought and writing practice, attentive at every point to inflections of detail, in a sustained account of Proust the skeptic for the contemporary reader.<br>

If one were to highlight a central feature of the modern age, one could plausibly point to its centrifugal momentum, its tendency toward fragmentation. In the intellectual domain, the tendency is patently evident in the process of specialization, the relentless segregation of fields of knowledge. However, the trend exceeds the knowledge domain. Together with other thinkers of his time, the philosopher Hegel saw modernity marked by radical “diremptions” or divisions (

Therefore, existing forms of customary or communal ownership will remain in place for a long time.

  Book Title: Art and Its Uses in Thomas Mann's 'Felix Krull'-  Publisher: Modern Humanities Research Association<br>
  Author(s): Schonfield Ernest<br>
  Abstract: The turn of the twentieth century was a time of identity crisis for the upper and middle classes, one in which increased social mobility caused the blurring of traditional boundaries and created a need for reference works such as the British Who's Who (1897). At the same time, the rise of a new leisure industry and an increase in international travel led to a boom period for confidence men, who frequently operated in hotels and holiday resorts. Thomas Mann's "Felix Krull", written between 1910-13 and continued (though never completed) in 1951-54, uses contemporary accounts of these figures as a starting-point from which to explore the aesthetics of society. The early Krull marks an important stage in Mann's development in a number of respects.In writing it, Mann acquired a more flexible conception of identity and a new understanding of the relation between artist and public. Krull also signals a deeper engagement with Goethe and a shift in Mann's work towards a more open treatment of sexuality. The novel presents art as being central to the development of the individual and to social interaction. While Krull is nominally a confidence man, he is more of a performance artist, a purveyor of beauty who relies upon the complicity of his audience. The later Krull takes up where Mann left off and continues the justification of art as an essential human activity. This study draws upon unpublished material in order to provide a comprehensive reading of "Felix Krull". It examines the novel within the context of Mann's work as a whole, and, in doing so, it seeks to demonstrate the remarkable continuity of Mann's creative achievement.<br>

 from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32b997">Art and Its Uses in Thomas Mann's 'Felix Krull'</a><br>
  Abstract: The main argument of this book is that, in 
                  Felix Krull, art and aesthetics are shown to be central to the life of the mind and to the life of society. The Müller-Rosé episode offers a paradigm of how art works: not as an imposed illusion, but as a mutually agreed, deliberate pretence.¹ The crucial point of this episode is that art is not a deception, but an imaginative exchange which relies upon an intersubjective arrangement. Müller-Rosé requires the ‘stillschweigende[s] Einverständnis’ (294) of his audience in order to succeed. Mann, like Coleridge, is advocating a willing suspension of disbelief,² in<br>

  Author(s) Mailloux Steven<br>
  Abstract: Rhetoric and hermeneutics today have achieved, as our editors point out in the Prologue, an impressive prominence across disciplines; indeed, they parallel each other in more than influence and multidisciplinary significance. They are parallel generically, they are interwoven historically, and they have experienced a remarkable expansion in theory and self-understanding in the last half of the twentieth century.¹ In each case, however, that expansion has been achieved, for the most part, in isolation from the other. Now it is time to renew old ties and explore what each can offer the other. My aim here is to affirm the desirability<br>

  Abstract: What is a consequent marxist view of the history and philosophy of science?

  Abstract: The argument between Derrida and Gadamer has made at least one thing clear: the charge brought against the universal search for truth and understanding is universal perspectivism, as Nietzsche inscribed it in philosophical consciousness. What is the point of striving for understanding, when everything is perspectival and historically conditioned? Often Gadamer has himself been viewed as the spokesman for historical relativism, since he had written that we do not understand better, but only differently. What would it mean to talk about the universality of understanding differently? Ultimately, does it not destroy the whole notion of truth?<br>

  Book Title: Interpreting Interpretation-The Limits of Hermeneutic Psychoanalysis<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Saks Elyn R.<br>
  Abstract: Psychoanalytic interpretation, according to the hermeneutic view, is concerned with meaning rather than facts or causes. In this provocative book, Elyn R. Saks focuses closely on what hermeneutic psychoanalysis is and how the approaches of hermeneutic psychoanalysts differ. She finds that although these psychoanalysts use the same words, concepts, images, and analogies, they hold to at least five different positions on the truth of psychoanalytic interpretations. Saks locates within these five models the thought of such prominent analysts as Roy Schafer, Donald Spence, and George Klein. Then, approaching each model from the patient's point of view, the author reaches important conclusions about treatments that patients not only will-but should-reject.If patients understood the true nature of the various models of hermeneutic psychoanalysis, Saks argues, they would spurn the story model, which asks patients to believe interpretations that do not purport to be true; that is, the psychoanalyst simply tells stories that give meaning to patients' lives, the truth of which is not considered relevant. And patients would question the metaphor and the interpretations-as-literary-criticism models, which propose views of psychoanalysis that may be unsatisfying. In addition to discussing which hermeneutic models of treatment are plausible, Saks discusses the nature of metaphorical truth. She arrives at some penetrating insights into the theory of psychoanalysis itself.<br>

  Abstract: The rhetorical modes of “negative” or “apophatic” theology — and of its twin, “mystical” theology — have since the 1970s attracted serious inquiry and extended discussion not only among theologians but also among literary theorists, and philosophers, who tend to share three interconnected concerns: the human subject’s finitude, its situation in language, and its desire. Among post-Heideggerian thinkers in particular, the fascination with textual and discursive traditions deriving from the negative theology of Pseudo-Dionysius (flourished ca. 500) almost always involves a fascination as well with the radically finite, desiring subject of language—to the point that one might suspect contemporary interest in<br>

                  explicatio, meditatio, applicatio. Applicatio, the last of these, is for him the transition from the sense to the use of scriptural texts. In his “rules” for using philosophical schemes or some subjective modality in reading, he was talking aboutmeditatio.

  Abstract: If a state cannot enact traditional retribution for its citizens who were victimized by the former government, is there any point in the gathering and publishing of these victims’ stories? While the story of the evolution from revenge to retribution shows us that a state must do something, must take responsibility to effect a rebalancing for the victims or risk a reversion to personal revenge, our collective imagination has given us little in the way of alternatives to state violence.

  Book Title: Homo Narrans-The Poetics and Anthropology of Oral Literature<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Niles John D.<br>
  Abstract: It would be difficult to imagine what human life would be like without stories-from myths recited by Pueblo Indian healers in the kiva, ballads sung in Slovenian market squares, folktales and legends told by the fireside in Italy, to jokes told at a dinner table in Des Moines-for it is chiefly through storytelling that people possess a past. In
      Homo NarransJohn D. Niles explores how human beings shape their world through the stories they tell. The book vividly weaves together the study of Anglo-Saxon literature and culture with the author's own engagements in the field with some of the greatest twentieth-century singers and storytellers in the Scottish tradition. Niles ponders the nature of the storytelling impulse, the social function of narrative, and the role of individual talent in oral tradition. His investigation of the poetics of oral narrative encompasses literary works, such as the epic poems and hymns of early Greece and the Anglo-SaxonBeowulf, texts that we know only through written versions but that are grounded in oral technique. That all forms of narrative, even the most sophisticated genres of contemporary fiction, have their ultimate origin in storytelling is a point that scarcely needs to be argued. Niles's claims here are more ambitious: that oral narrative is and has long been the chief basis of culture itself, that the need to tell stories is what distinguishes humans from all other living creatures.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hh3bq">Moral Evil</a><br>
  Abstract: The idea of moral evil has always held a special place in philosophical and theological systems of thought because the existence of evil has implications for the dignity with which and the limits within which we act. Moral culpability is made possible by our ability to choose to do terrible things or to refrain from doing good things. Philosophically, the categories of moral praiseworthiness and blameworthiness depend on the prospect of our being able to act or not act one way when we have the capacity to act otherwise. Theologically, the whole point to being humans made in God’s image<br>

  Author(s) Sloterdijk Peter<br>
  Abstract: We say “people are strange.”¹ This phrase is one of our most constant and rudimentary ontological attestations. In fact, it says a great deal. “People” indicates everyone else, designated as the indeterminate ensemble of populations, lineages, or races [
                     gentes] from which the speaker removes himself. (Nevertheless, he removes himself in a very particular sort of way, because the designation is so general—and this is exactly the point—that it inevitably turns back around on the speaker. Since I say that “people are strange,” I include myself in a certain way in this strangeness.)<br>

  Abstract: For some time now, the theme of discipleship in Mark has attracted my attention, for nowhere in the canon does a text generate in readers as much alienation from the disciples as in this Gospel (Kelber 1972; 1974; 1979; 1983). I continue to view it as a puzzle that admits of no simple or general answer. The very oddness of the theme ought to have inspired creative explorations, whereas, in fact, it has often given rise to evasive maneuvers. The elaboration of admittedly positive features of the disciples is, of course, very much to the point. But it has not<br>

  Author(s) Harrold Deborah<br>
  Abstract: In politics, time is a structuring force that shapes collective and individual identities, subjectivities, and imaginaries. We can see the role of political temporality in sweeping historical narratives, such as those a nation tells itself about its founding moment and subsequent arc of development, an arc that almost always legitimizes the status of the contemporary social and political order. We can see it in more quotidian forms such as the calendars that organize people’s lives and in so doing habituate citizens into annual practices of remembrance, memorialization, and obligation. These examples point to the fact that political time is a<br>

  Book Title: Ciaran Carson-Space, Place, Writing<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): ALEXANDER NEAL<br>
  Abstract: Ciaran Carson is one of the most challenging and inventive of contemporary Irish writers, exhibiting verbal brilliance, formal complexity, and intellectual daring across a remarkably varied body of work. This study considers the full range of his oeuvre, in poetry, prose, and translations, and discusses the major themes to which he returns, including: memory and history, narrative, language and translation, mapping, violence, and power. It argues that the singularity of Carson’s writing is to be found in his radical imaginative engagements with ideas of space and place. The city of Belfast, in particular, occupies a crucially important place in his texts, serving as an imaginative focal point around which his many other concerns are constellated. The city, in all its volatile mutability, is an abiding frame of reference and a reservoir of creative impetus for Carson’s imagination. Accordingly, the book adopts an interdisciplinary approach that draws upon geography, urbanism, and cultural theory as well as literary criticism. It provides both a stimulating and thorough introduction to Carson’s work, and a flexible critical framework for exploring literary representations of space.<br>

  Abstract: It is a foolish commentator indeed who would attempt to claim a precise moment in history when anthropology in the French-speaking world
                  becamepostcolonial – that point in time when predominantly French anthropological thought turned on its own history of involvement in the imperial enterprise and began to challenge anthropological theories and practices grounded in the discourses and assumptions of colonialism. That anthropology was one of the handmaidens of colonialism, a science of empire, is indisputable and well documented. For many, the postcolonial turn has yet to occur and anthropology is still irredeemably and fatally tainted by its colonial origins.<br>

  Abstract: Any artistic production inevitably involves an act of translation, a transference of a form, commodity, or idea across a boundary, be that boundary one of time, space, language, or cultural medium. Shakespeare and his works are among the most durable and flexible of translated media, and seem unlikely to be easily exhausted. Particularly interesting are the ways in which ‘Shakespeare’ operates both as an enabling medium and as an object who is himself translated. Within the economy of translation, the facilitating medium is a common point of reference, a shared experience which first makes conceivable the possibility and desirability of<br>

As he noted, “seeing a bird in the sky involves seeing that it will not suddenly dovertical snap rolls” (Hanson 1965, 20; emphasis added).¹ To see an object in the skyas a birdis to see the object knowingly, to see it as potentially flapping its wings, but not as potentially maneuvering like a fighter plane.

  Author(s) WHEELER WENDY<br>
  Abstract: In this essay I explore an ecocritical theory of cultural, and thus also literary, creativity from a biosemiotic point of view. While what follows might be thought broadly to fall within what is sometimes called the “post” humanities, in fact biosemiotics is a thoroughly interdisciplinary proto-discipline; it seeks not only to change how humanists think about culture, the arts, and the biological sciences but also to change how scientists and social scientists think about biological science and the arts and humanities.<br>

  Abstract: Autobiographies by Religious Dwellers differ from those by Religious Debtors primarily by locating religion and its positive role in the present. While religion may also have been part of the past, the focus is on the way in which it helps to account for where the writer is at the time of writing. The emphasis is less on recovery than on discovery, on having found something or having reached a location, decision, or point of arrival that often is marked by a new or renewed affiliation.<br>

  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Geertz Clifford<br>
  Abstract: Geertz, who once considered a career in philosophy, begins by explaining how he got swept into the revolutionary movement of symbolic anthropology. At that point, his work began to encompass not only the ethnography of groups in Southeast Asia and North Africa, but also the study of how meaning is made in all cultures--or, to use his phrase, to explore the "frames of meaning" in which people everywhere live out their lives. His philosophical orientation helped him to establish the role of anthropology within broader intellectual circles and led him to address the work of such leading thinkers as Charles Taylor, Thomas Kuhn, William James, and Jerome Bruner. In this volume, Geertz comments on their work as he explores questions in political philosophy, psychology, and religion that have intrigued him throughout his career but that now hold particular relevance in light of postmodernist thinking and multiculturalism.

  Abstract: Burns explores the rich narrative structure of the trial, beginning with the lawyers' opening statements, which establish opposing moral frameworks in which to interpret the evidence. In the succession of witnesses, stories compete and are held in tension. At some point during the performance, a sense of the right thing to do arises among the jurors. How this happens is at the core of Burns's investigation, which draws on careful descriptions of what trial lawyers do, the rules governing their actions, interpretations of actual trial material, social science findings, and a broad philosophical and political appreciation of the trial as a unique vehicle of American self-government.<br>

  Abstract: Freud’s thinking about the ego combines several formulations, which begin with early modernist principles. In some sense, he draws an alliance with Descartes’s meditation, “I am a thinking thing,” as the “true” center of his identity. Indeed, the modernist endeavor to define personal identity begins by recognizing that the self cannot be derived, but instead, the Cartesian
                  cogitans—the end point of the skeptic’s query—serves as the starting point of self-consciousness.¹ Accordingly, to the extent that “identity” has a definition in the Freudian universe, it must be that which can be identified; that is, the conscious ego examines and<br>

  Book Title: History as a Visual Art in the Twelfth-Century Renaissance-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Morrison Karl F.<br>
  Abstract: Karl Morrison discusses historical writing at a turning point in European culture: the so-called Renaissance of the twelfth century. Why do texts considered at that time to be masterpieces seem now to be fragmentary and full of contradictions? Morrison maintains that the answer comes from ideas about art. Viewing histories as artifacts made according to the same aesthetic principles as paintings and theater, he shows that twelfth-century authors and audiences found unity not in what the reason read in a text but in what the imagination read into it: they prized visual over verbal imagination and employed a circular, or nuclear, spectator-centered perspective cast aside in the Renaissance of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.<br>

  Abstract: In chapter 1, I defended the claim that the republican conception of freedom is grounded in the understanding that politics is constituted in the fundamental antagonism between the haves and the have-nots. Chapter 2 turned to the the obstacles to justice as Sallust represents them: the vulnerability of the political process to greed and corruption; the dangerous failure of the senatorial order to recognize the poor and marginalized; and finally, the constraints on just judgment created by the irrepressible play of chance. I sought to point out, too, how Sallust exposes and works with the corporeal element in world-perception.<br>

  Book Title: Neverending Stories-Toward a Critical Narratology<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Tatar Maria<br>
  Abstract: In these compelling new essays, leading critics sharpen our understanding of the narrative structures that convey meaning in fiction, taking as their point of departure the narratological positions of Dorrit Cohn, Grard Genette, and Franz Stanzel. This collection demonstrates how narratology, with its attention to the modalities of presenting consciousness, offers a point of entry for scholars investigating the socio-cultural dimensions of literary representations. Drawing from a wide range of literary texts, the essays explore the borderline between fiction and history; explain how characters are constructed by both author and reader through the narration of consciousness; show how gender shapes narrative strategies ranging from the depiction of consciousness through intertextuality to the representation of the body; address issues of contingency in narrative; and present a debate on the crucial function of person in the literary text. The contributors are Stanley Corngold, Gail Finney, Kte Hamburger, Paul Michael Ltzeler, David Mickelsen, John Neubauer, Thomas Pavel, Jens Rieckmann, Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan, Judith Ryan, Franz Stanzel, Susan Suleiman, Maria Tatar, David Wellbery, and Larry Wolff.<br>

There you’ve got our point of view. Not that we believe thatGod exists, but that we think that the problem of His existence is not the issue.”¹<br>

No matter how careful we are to treat the object of our study scientifically, it will at some point want to “speak” to us; such is its specificity.

Hampshire’s book begins with the assumption that conflicts are driven by often incommensurable values and that justice requires us to respond to them with an adversarial form of rationality. Faced with a conflict, in other words, we should aim to reach a balanced accommodation with our enemies, and this means negotiating with them in good faith.

  Book Title: Liturgy as Revelation-Re-Sourcing a Theme in Twentieth-Century Catholic Theology<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Caldwell Philip<br>
  Abstract: A critical issue in modern Catholic theology has been the relationship between the doctrine of revelation and the church’s liturgical and sacramental practice. This volume argues that although in the twentieth century Catholic theology increasingly recognized the centrality of Christology—particularly the person of Christ—as the locus of revelation and drew out the crucial implications of Christ as the revelation of God, it was slow to connect this revelatory dynamic with the encounter that occurs within the sacramental space of the liturgy, most notably the Eucharist. Taking the decline of the neoscholastic enterprise in Catholic theology and the challenges posed by modernism as his point of departure, Philip Caldwell traces the evolution of the Catholic theology of revelation in the twentieth century and the vital role played by the liturgical and sacramental renewal movements in reimagining this pivotal theological category. Examining the specific contributions of René Latourelle, Avery Dulles, Salvatore Marsilli, and Gustave Martelet against a background of pre-conciliar ressourcement theology, this volume provides a comprehensive account of why a Trinitarian and Christological construal of liturgy and sacraments as revelation is key to the vision that informed Vatican II and offers constructive theological and ecclesial possibilities for the future.<br>

  Book Title: Postmodernity and Univocity-A Critical Account of Radical Orthodoxy and John Duns Scotus<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Horan Daniel P.<br>
  Abstract: Nearly twenty-five years ago, John Milbank inaugurated Radical Orthodoxy, one of the most significant and influential theological movements of the last two decades. In Milbank’s Theology and Social Theory, he constructed a sweeping theological genealogy of the origins of modernity and the emergence of the secular, counterposed by a robust retrieval of traditional orthodoxy as the critical philosophical and theological mode of being in the postmodern world. That genealogy turns upon a critical point—the work of John Duns Scotus as the starting point of modernity and progenitor of a raft of philosophical and theological ills that have prevailed since. Milbank’s account has been disseminated proliferously through Radical Orthodoxy and even beyond and is largely uncontested in contemporary theology. The present volume conducts a comprehensive examination and critical analysis of Radical Orthodoxy’s use and interpretation of John Duns Scotus. Daniel P. Horan, OFM, offers a substantial challenge to the narrative of Radical Orthodoxy’s idiosyncratic take on Scotus and his role in ushering in the philosophical age of the modern. This volume not only corrects the received account of Scotus but opens a constructive way forward toward a positive assessment and appropriation of Scotus’s work for contemporary theology.<br>

  Book Title: Consider Leviathan-Narratives of Nature and the Self in Job<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Doak Brian R.<br>
  Abstract: Theologians and philosophers are turning again to questions of the meaning, or non-meaning, of the natural world for human self-understanding. Brian R. Doak observes that the book of Job, more than any other book in the Bible, uses metaphors drawn from the natural world, especially of plants and animals, as raw material for thinking about human suffering. Doak argues that Job should be viewed as an anthropological “ground zero” for the traumatic definition of the post-exilic human self in ancient Israel. Furthermore, the battered shape of the Joban experience should provide a starting point for reconfiguring our thinking about “natural theology” as a category of intellectual history in the ancient world. Doak examines how the development of the human subject is portrayed in the biblical text in either radical continuity or discontinuity with plants and animals. Consider Leviathan explores the text at the intersection of anthropology, theology, and ecology, opening up new possibilities for charting the view of nature in the Hebrew Bible.<br>

  Book Title: The Future of the Word-An Eschatology of Reading<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Kriner Tiffany Eberle<br>
  Abstract: In scripture, Jesus promises a future that potentiall infuses all texts: "my words will not pass away" (Matt 24:28). This book argues that texts--even literary texts--, have an eschatology, too, a part of God's purpose for the cosmos. They, with all creation, moves toward participation in the new creation, in the Trinity's expanding, creative love. This eschatological future for texts impacts how we understand meaning making, from the level of semiology to that of hermeneutics. This book tells he story of how readers participate in the future of the word, the eschatology of texts. If texts have a future i the kingdom of God, then readers' engagement with them--everything from preservation and utterance to translation, criticism, and call and response--can cultivate those futures in the love of the Trinity. Kriner explores how the fallenness and failures of texts, alongside readers' own failures, while seeming to challenge the future of the word, ultimately point to reading as a posture of reconciliation, in which reader and text meet in the Maranatha of all text.<br>

  Author(s) Fernandez James W.<br>
  Abstract: If there is a theorist who worked both anthropologically and rhetorically and deserves to be called a major theorist of rhetoric culture , it is Michel de Certeau. Given that this paper is about 9/11 and the dialectics of modernity, a particular passage of his seems clairvoyant. At some point in his career he stood atop the World Trade Center and later wrote:<br>

  Abstract: This collection does not seek merely to expound Arendt's opinions on these subjects; rather, it seeks to use her insights as the jumping-off point for further investigations - including ones critical of Arendt - into the ways in which race, imperialism, slavery and genocide are linked, and the ways in which these terms have affected the United States, Europe, and the colonised world.<br>

  Arendt between Past and Future from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qcjrb">Hannah Arendt and the Uses of History</a><br>
  Author(s) King Richard H.<br>
  Abstract: This chapter is about a series of contradictions in Hannah Arendt’s writings, contradictions that she names and explores, and contradictions in her own discourse. Arendt’s writings are a declaration of antipathy to the bourgeoisie by a thoroughly bourgeois writer, a defense of the nation-state based on dislike of nationalism, a defense of traditional bourgeois values from modern bourgeois domination, and an account of the modern state that granted the Jews emancipation at a point when, by becoming national, it was in the process of preparing the renewal of the Jews’ exclusion and persecution.<br>

  Author(s) Brüggemeier Franz-Josef<br>
  Abstract: From today’s viewpoint it might not seem an obvious choice to include an essay on East German radio in a volume on popular historiography. There is currently a boom in history, and contemporary history in particular, on TV, in museums and exhibitions and lately on the internet. If we take this as a starting point, then we can assume it to be a phenomenon of the last thirty years. That means, of course, that the German Democratic Republic (GDR), or East Germany as it is also known, was only touched by this boom in its last decade. Even more important<br>

  Book Title: Dark Traces of the Past-Psychoanalysis and Historical Thinking<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Rüsen Jörn<br>
  Abstract: The relationship between historical studies and psychoanalysis remains an open debate that is full of tension, in both a positive and a negative sense. In particular, the following question has not been answered satisfactorily: what distinguishes a psychoanalytically oriented study of historical realities from a historical psychoanalysis? Skepticism and fear of collaboration dominate on both sides. Initiating a productive dialogue between historical studies and psychoanalysis seems to be plagued by ignorance and, at times, a sense of helplessness. Interdisciplinary collaborations are rare. Empirical research, formulation of theory, and the development of methods are essentially carried out within the conventional disciplinary boundaries. This volume undertakes to overcome these limitations by combining psychoanalytical and historical perspectives and thus exploring the underlying "unconscious" dimensions and by informing academic and nonacademic forms of historical memory. Moreover, it puts special emphasis on transgenerational forms of remembrance, on the notion of trauma as a key concept in this field, and on case studies that point the way to further research.<br>

  Abstract: It seems certain today that the term “present” encompasses far more than a merely present identity of the self. Assuming that present time equals pure presence, and stating thereby that it be nothing more than itself, means to underestimate—or neglect—Edmund Husserl’s² differentiation of

  Abstract: We might first found the tropological point of view in social science inquiry in two ancient founding figures, the Pre-Socratic philosopher Heraclitus and the Roman Rhetorician Quintillian. As with all the contributors to our common Rhetoric Culture project, “social science inquiry” is understood as investigation into the rhetoric of culture creation and social interaction. Heraclitus may be regarded as foundational, not only in his doctrine of flux and constancy of change, but in his view that for the most part, acting under the requirements of social order, cultural constancy, and personal stability, people do not understand fully what is going<br>

  Author(s) Porta Donatella della<br>
  Abstract: Historians have traditionally considered Spanish anarchism to be the most successful variant of the international libertarian movement.¹ Most of them also believe that the terminal point of that variant came soon after the end of the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) and Franco’s dictatorship (1939–1975) came to power.² This chapter agrees with the first assumption, but considers the second to be open to question. Spanish anarchism indeed succeeded in creating a specific political culture and became a major political force in the first decades of the twentieth century.

  Book Title: Young Men in Uncertain Times-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Dyck Noel<br>
  Abstract: Anthropology is particularly well suited to explore the contemporary predicament in the coming of age of young men. Its grounded and comparative empiricism provides the opportunity to move beyond statistics, moral panics, or gender stereotypes in order to explore specific aspects of life course transitions, as well as the similar or divergent barriers or opportunities that young men in different parts of the world face. Yet, effective contextualization and comparison cannot be achieved by looking at male youths in isolation. This volume undertakes to contextualize male youths' circumstances and to learn about their lives, perspectives, and actions, and in turn illuminates the larger structures and processes that mediate the experiences entailed in becoming young men. The situation of male youths provides an important vantage point from which to consider broader social transformations and continuities. By paying careful attention to these contexts, we achieve a better understanding of the current influences encountered and acted upon by young people.<br>

  Abstract: My starting point is a deceptively simple query. What happens when transgressors of cultural norms, which camouflage class and gender inequalities, prove themselves worthy of admission to a pantheon of national heroes? The cult of national heroes, of course, has been indispensable in promoting national unity and pride. Instilling the people with properly national characteristics, modeled after national heroes, has been a central preoccupation for educators, artists, and scholars. Transgressive candidates for national heroes make this task harder but not impossible. Hence it is necessary to rephrase the question. How does the admission of transgressors to a patriotic canon work<br>

  Author(s) Ames Michael M.<br>
  Abstract: In
                  The conflict of interpretations(1974), Paul Ricoeur makes a distinction between three types of knowledge based on their different epistemological ascriptions. These distinctions provide a useful starting point for discussion about the variants of anthropological discourse and their relationship with what I have termed elsewhere, ‘the three museologies’ (Shelton 1995b: 7). Briefly, Ricoeur distinguishes between what we might call a culture’s operative discourses, disciplinary regimes of knowledge, and critical philosophy. This latter practice subjects the first two narrative forms to analytical scrutiny or, to use a postmodernist idiom, fields a sustained ‘incredulity to meta-narratives’ (Lyotard 1984: xxiv). It is clear<br>

  Abstract: One of Jürgen Oelkers’ many merits is to have studied – as a generalist – the complex relationship between pedagogy, politics and practice in great detail, especially in relation to ›reform pedagogy‹ (or New Education) and its potential contribution to educational innovations (see, e.g., Oelkers 1991; Oelkers/Osterwalder 1999; Oelkers ³1996). Based on such a position, the ›relevance‹ of historical research in educational sciences, at first glance, does not seem very problematic. Scientific knowledge that is based on empirical analytical research as well as on philosophically and historically acquired insights is, from this point of view, essential for formulating the future<br>

  Book Title: Islam & Europe-Challenges and Opportunities<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): TIBI Bassam<br>
  Abstract: Dedicated to increasing our knowledge and awareness of the ever-growing diversity and pluralism of global society, Forum A. & A. Leysen has initiated an annual debate/lecture series, beginning with a focus on Islam in today's world and in Europe in particular. Seven well-known influential authorities - each an active participant in the public debate on the global role of Islam past, present and future - recently presented papers at the first Intercultural Relations Conference sponsored by Forum A.& A. Leysen. These important contributions, on the topic Islam and Europe: Challenges and Opportunities, are reprinted in this volume. Although each contributor speaks from his own distinctive point of view, a common message emerges from all seven texts: only dialogue - on the one hand between the West (countries that manifest themselves as Western Democratic constitutional states) and Islam, and on the other hand within and among societies historically identified with Islam- will overcome entrenched confrontation and negative animosity, engender new possibilities and understandings, and, by encouraging free and critical thinking, pave the way to social equity and the scientific innovation that, potentially, can lead to more prosperity. In the course of the conference all seven talks led to fascinating debates. This book includes the most important questions asked and the speakers' responses. Although the question of how to actually construct the dialogue remains unsettled, this ground-breaking book takes a giant step toward an answer.<br>

  Abstract: Revisiting seventies socialism and soul culture from the vantage point of the United States in the nineties raises important questions about the structures of enjoyment embedded in the anticapitalist stance of many emergent socialist states, such as Tanzania during that turbulent time. Most critiques of seventies socialist cultures readily dismiss socialism as having no soul. The inherent assumption of such critiques is that capitalism is the sole arbiter of enjoyment through free and ideologically uncontaminated flow of consumption. Such binary critiques oversimplify the relationship between state formations and citizens as consumers. These critiques further elide the intricate and nuanced strategies<br>

  Book Title: Biography and turning points in Europe and America-  Publisher: Policy Press<br>
  Author(s): Négroni Catherine<br>
  Abstract: This sociological collection advances the argument that the concept of a turning point expands our understanding of life experiences from a descriptive to a deeper and more abstract level of analysis. It addresses the conceptual issue of what distinguishes turning points from life transitions in general and raises crucial questions about the application of turning points as a biographical research method. Biography and turning points in Europe and America is all the more distinctive and significant due to its broad empirical database. The anthology includes authors from ten different countries, providing a number of contexts for thinking about how turning points relate to constructions of meaning shaped by globalization and by cultural and structural meanings unique to each country. The book will be useful across a wide range of social sciences and particularly valuable for researchers needing a stronger theoretical base for biographical work.<br>

In line with this suggestion, I discuss the conditions under which contemporary biologists come to understand natural phenomena and I point to a number of ways in which the performance of specific research practices informs and shapes the quality of such understanding.<br>

                  Les Lieux de mémoire,it is no less true; indeed, the new millennium may be seen as heralding a high point in memorialisation.² This volume contributes to the debates which continue to be conducted around the place of empire in the contemporary life of the French nation, debates that have been underway since the 1990s and that now reach across public life and society with manifestations in the French parliament, media and universities.

  Abstract: When Walter Salles began making feature films in the early 1990s, Brazilian cinema was at one of its lowest ebbs, occupying at one point less than one percent of the domestic marketplace.² Struggling in the 1980s, the industry was completely derailed by newly-elected President Fernando Collor de Mello’s 1990 austerity programme which included a freeze on all personal savings accounts and the closure of Embrafilme, the government agency that had supported film-making since 1969. Any Brazilian film-maker in this period would have needed to go outside the country for work, or at least for international financing. As a result, for<br>

  Abstract: One of the most striking aspects of Saul Bass’s epically successful career as a designer was that he was essentially an autodidact without formal academic training. While his official biographies note that he studied with Howard Trafton and Gyorgy Kepes (the latter a superstar designer in his own right), the fact was that Bass’s “studies” were limited to a handful of night-school courses. Bass was always very modest on this point, reminding interviewers that there were few opportunities to study graphic design in America at that time because “commercial art” was considered a lowly profession.¹ Though it is true that<br>

  Author(s) Neusner Jacob<br>
  Abstract: How does Scripture propose to settle the question of God’s gender? Israel achieves its authentic relationship to God when Israel is feminine to God’s masculine role; its proper virtue when it conforms to those traits of emotion and attitude that the system assigns to women. In chapter 7 I raised that question, but in the years since then, I have learned more about the subject. The main point that I have found out is simple: the Torah in fact portrays God as androgynous. Because our traits correspond to God’s, God too turns out to share in and value the gender<br>

  Abstract: IF THE HOUR HAS COME for rethinking modernity, it is time to make very explicit the irrenconcilable opposition between culture and development. An analogous opposition would seem to be a good starting point for my argument. “Genetic endowment and cultural heritage evolve according to opposite laws.... Biological evolution sprouts new branches that do not cross-fertilize, branches that never again unite once they have become solid.

  Book Title: Everyone Says No-Public Service Broadcasting and the Failure of Translation<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): CONWAY KYLE<br>
  Abstract: Quebec has never signed on to Canada's constitution. After both major attempts to win Quebec's approval - the Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords - failed, Quebec came within a fraction of a percentage point of voting for independence. Everyone Says No examines how the failure of these accords was depicted in French and English media and the ways in which journalists' reporting failed to translate the differences between Quebec and the rest of Canada. Focusing on the English- and French-language networks of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Kyle Conway draws on the CBC/Radio Canada rich print and video archive as well as journalists' accounts of their reporting to revisit the story of the accords and the furor they stirred in both French and English Canada. He shows that CBC/Radio Canada attempts to translate language and culture and encourage understanding among Canadians actually confirmed viewers' pre-existing assumptions rather than challenging them. The first book to examine translation in Canadian news, Everyone Says No also provides insight into Canada's constitutional history and the challenges faced by contemporary public service broadcasters in increasingly multilingual and multicultural communities.<br>

  Abstract: An essential (albeit controversial) point should immediately be made clear: the work of Angelopoulos is not ‘modernist’ in the sense that Anglo-Saxon critics have given to this term to qualify, in art history, a time past, but still belonging to modernity.¹ From end to end, Angelopoulos’ work is, in fact, traversed by history. Yet modernity is defined precisely by our awareness of unsurpassable historicity. In the words of Jacques Rancière, we have entered into the ‘ age of history’. He adds that it is also the ‘age of cinema’, as this late art possesses a singular power of ‘historicity and<br>

We shall see how, in the archive, Sontag’s fidelity to modernism becomes, in fact, her relation to theory, and she re-emerges as a mind among the theorists. The chapter illuminates the understudied role and place of Sontag in the critical movement called ‘theory’.<br>

Both concepts are riddled with tensions and ambiguities, not least because they are used by a diverse collection of philosophers whose writings are commonly placed under the banner of structuralism and poststructuralism. They are concepts with their own distinct histories, their own logical and ontological bases (albeit contestable ones), but in the 1950s and 1960s, particularly in France, they come together, cross over and support one another, articulating a series of profound and influential problems and questions that<br>

  Abstract: One of the most obscure, yet significant, concepts in early nineteenth-century philosophy is that of the Absolute. As a word, the Absolute came into philosophical discourse with Schelling to mean the ontological ground of and point of identity between subject and object. In this sense Hegel adopted the term in his early works, while in his later writings he came to identify the Absolute with the process and final conclusion of reason. Although it is these figures who employed the words ‘the Absolute’ (

  Abstract: One rich and wide-reaching element in language has become the focal point of much study in the past three decades: metaphor. If this element of language has aroused such interest, it is because there has been increasing recognition that all of our concepts are framed within metaphorical terms. Rather than a model of language based upon the linguistic sign (a model which implies that words designate things in the world outside of language), linguists today are more inclined to accept that there exists a figurative substructure to concepts. This in turn helps us to understand that concepts are not extra-lingual<br>

The prospect of psychological disintegration, manifesting itself in the worst cases in schizophrenic illness, is, in Deleuze’s conception of writing, an ever-present threat. However, the very reality of this threat offers salvation from it. Failure and success<br>

  Abstract: Writing in spring 1947, Storm Jameson – the prolific Yorkshire-born novelist and former president of the English centre of International PEN – used the occasion of an essay on the ‘situation’ of contemporary fiction to glance back two years and reflect on her visit to an indelibly-scarred northern Europe. From an aerial vantage point, Jameson adopts, at least initially and fleetingly, a disinterested and reportorial perspective. Then the standpoint shifts, and with it the diction and gesture of Jameson’s treatment of destruction. Dropping the objective pretence of reportage, she progresses into a more personalised and noticeably elegiac register of remembrance:<br>

  Abstract: This survey of security theory is divided into two parts. The first defines security as a political concept and phenomenon. This discussion provides a point of departure for reviewing prevailing security theories. The second, and longest, section briefly examines and evaluates the claims of six competing research programs concerned directly or indirectly with security. These include realism, neorealism, economic liberalism, liberal institutionalism, behaviorism, and constructivism. These research programs can be distinguished on the basis of their ontological, epistemological, methodological, and evidentiary assumptions about actors and their behavior.

He accomplished this by using a formula he had found in an eighteenth-century mathematics text.² Two years later, three other theorists—Yoichiro Nambu, Leonard Susskind, and Holger Nielsen—independently suggested that Veneziano’s redeployment of this antique mathematical function implied that the particles that formed the nuclei of atoms were not actually zero-dimensional point-particles, but<br>

  Abstract: The multiplicity of configurations and the multiplicity of options within each configuration support the claim that theory indeed is a theoretical construction, or a mode of political thought in Freeden’s sense. Theories offer not just explanations for complex phenomena, but also an inclusive understanding of the phenomena. They do this by defining the political concepts and thus decontesting them. This is a point worth stressing: theories do offer explanations—that being their manifest function, after all—but on a prior and deeper level, they define political concepts for

  Book Title: Archives, Documentation, and Institutions of Social Memory-Essays from the Sawyer Seminar<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Rosenberg William G.<br>
  Abstract: As sites of documentary preservation rooted in various national and social contexts, artifacts of culture, and places of uncovering, archives provide tangible evidence of memory for individuals, communities, and states, as well as defining memory institutionally within prevailing political systems and cultural norms. By assigning the prerogatives of record keeper to the archivist, whose acquisition policies, finding aids, and various institutionalized predilections mediate between scholarship and information, archives produce knowledge, legitimize political systems, and construct identities. Far from being mere repositories of data, archives actually embody the fragments of culture that endure as signifiers of who we are, and why. The essays in A
      rchives, Documentation, and Institutions of Social Memoryconceive of archives not simply as historical repositories but as a complex of structures, processes, and epistemologies situated at a critical point of the intersection between scholarship, cultural practices, politics, and technologies.<br>

  Abstract: The transformation of Late Petrarchism from earlier stages reflects a profound shift in cultural values--a 'crisis of the Renaissance' that generated new perspectives in poetic theory and practice. Broadly, this book identifies a distinctive 'poetics of inconstancy' that came to the fore at the end of the sixteenth century and pervaded the love verse of the age. At the same time, as a study based on the inductive method, the book takes as its point of departure a single poet: Etienne Durand. Because of his frequently anthologized 'Stances a l'Inconstance,' Durand is often singled out as 'the poet of inconstancy.' This study, however, identifies the theme of universal change as a hallmark of Durand's contemporaries as well--a signal of a stylistic revolution that heralded the end of Renaissance verse.<br>

In these straits, philosophy has turned increasingly to criticism for an understanding of its activity, and so has risked also its possible disappearance into literature.

  Abstract: No comparable civilization has argued over definitions of selfhood as much as the Indian. Throughout its long and august history almost every branch of knowledge (including philosophy, literature, religion, and linguistics) has grappled with this extremely elusive concept. There is, however, one point on which all the commentators agree: the self is other than what our faculties persuade us it is. In other words, the construction of the self through social processes (which would require a social other to begin with) is overtaken by a principle in which the “real” or the “true” self comes into being only when it<br>

  Abstract: FIFTY YEARS have passed since the events of Red October 1917. Those events were the climax of a historical movement that began with the June 1848 insurrection on the streets of Paris, when the modern industrial proletariat first discovered its class autonomy, its independent antagonism to the capitalist system. A further decisive turning point came again in Paris, with the Commune of 1871, the defeat of which led to the generalization of the slogan of the party and the awareness of the need to organize class autonomy politically.<br>

It should be clear, however, that these two areas represent analytic moments that, considered separately, would be relatively uninteresting. Neither should narratology include in its premises any simple one-way relation between point (1) and (2), which would foreclose the constitution of its object into an instance and/or an image of communication in general.

Shoulson's analysis moves back and forth between Milton's writings and Jewish writings of the first five centuries of the Common Era, collectively known as midrash. In exploring the historical and literary implications of these connections, Shoulson shows how Milton's text can inform a more nuanced reading of midrash just as midrash can offer new insights intoParadise Lost.<br>

  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): MINOW MARTHA<br>
  Abstract: Minow firmly rejects the prevailing conception of the self that she believes underlies legal doctrine-a self seen as either separate and autonomous, or else disabled and incompetent in some way. In contrast, she regards the self as being realized through connection, capable of shaping an identity only in relationship to other people. She shifts the focus for problem solving from the "different" person to the relationships that construct that difference, and she proposes an analysis that can turn "difference" from a basis of stigma and a rationale for unequal treatment into a point of human connection. "The meanings of many differences can change when people locate and revise their relationships to difference," she asserts. "The student in a wheelchair becomes less different when the building designed without him in mind is altered to permit his access." Her book evaluates contemporary legal theories and reformulates legal rights for women, children, persons with disabilities, and others historically identified as different.<br>

  Book Title: Paradigms for a Metaphorology-  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Savage Robert<br>
  Abstract: "
         Paradigms for a Metaphorologymay be read as a kind of beginner's guide to Blumenberg, a programmatic introduction to his vast and multifaceted oeuvre. Its brevity makes it an ideal point of entry for readers daunted by the sheer bulk of Blumenberg's later writings, or distracted by their profusion of historical detail.Paradigmsexpresses many of Blumenberg's key ideas with a directness, concision, and clarity he would rarely match elsewhere. What is more, because it served as a beginner's guide for its author as well, allowing him to undertake an initial survey of problems that would preoccupy him for the remainder of his life, it has the additional advantage that it can offer us a glimpse into what might be called the 'genesis of the Blumenbergian world.'"-from the Afterword by Robert Savage<br>

  Abstract: Paradigms for a Metaphorology was first published in 1960 in the Archive for the History of Concepts (Archiv für Begriffsgeschichte), simultaneously appearing in book form with the Bouvier Verlag in Bonn.¹ At the time, Hans Blumenberg (1920– 1996) was known to the philosophically interested public only as the author of a half dozen or so articles scattered in various journals and reference works, one of which—“Light as a Metaphor of Truth” (1957)²—deserves to be mentioned as a preliminary study, or “proto-paradigm,”³ for Paradigms.

  Abstract: In the preceding chapters I have studied a range of literary and visual works representing a variety of Romantic encounters with art that shed light on the relationship between the real world and the space of the imagination as it was conceived around 1800. These examples have served to paint a fuller picture, so to speak, of what I consider a major turning point in the construction of the modern subject, particularly in relation to aesthetic experience. The critics and artists associated with this period opened a space we still inhabit; the contradictions they confronted have not yet been resolved.<br>

  Abstract: German Romantic literature rests on unstable ground. For example, Friedrich Schlegel’s notion of Romantic irony as a “permanente Parekbase” (permanent parabasis)¹ denies the authority of a single vantage point. As parabasis—the Greek term for the chorus stepping out of the action of the play and addressing an ode to the audience—irony is the constant possibility of assuming another subject position, of viewing and representing the world from a different and even contradictory angle.

  Book Title: Twenty Years On-Competing Memories of the GDR in Postunification German Culture<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Tate Dennis<br>
  Abstract: Twenty years on from the dramatic events that led to the opening of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the GDR, the subjective dimension of German unification is still far from complete. The nature of the East German state remains a matter of cultural as well as political debate. This volume of new research focuses on competing memories of the GDR and the ways they have evolved in the mass media, literature, and film since 1989-90. Taking as its point of departure the impact of iconic visual images of the fall of the Wall on our understanding of the historical GDR, the volume first considers the decade of cultural conflict that followed unification and then the emergence of a more complex and diverse "textual memory" of the GDR since the Berlin Republic was established in 1999. It highlights competing generational perspectives on the GDR era and the unexpected "afterlife" of the GDR in recent publications. The volume as a whole shows the vitality of eastern German culture two decades after the demise of the GDR and the centrality of these memory debates to the success of Germany's unification process.

As Rainer Nägele observes, Duden’s definition (“in the manner of Kafka’s description; uncanny and threatening in an enigmatic fashion”) manages to combine tautology with awkwardness.¹ In the English-speaking world the term also denotes the mysterious and unsettling qualities associated with Kafka’s texts, whether manifested in Gregor Samsa’s transformation in

Disbelievers are frowned upon while storytellers are seen to embellish and exaggerate their accounts on many occasions. The confusion that arises for the reader creates the impression that two points of view upon a given reality are battling with one another.

Because, as William Rowe has pointed out (Rowe, 2000, 17), Vanguardism as a movement had largely run out of steam by the 1940s and “In the poets who began to write in the 1950s, there is a concern with new starting points”.

  Book Title: A Companion to Friedrich Nietzsche-Life and Works<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Bishop Paul<br>
  Abstract: Nietzsche looms over modern literature and thought; according to Gottfried Benn, "everything my generation discussed, thought through innerly; one could say: suffered; or one could even say: took to the point of exhaustion - all of it had already been said . . . by Nietzsche; all the rest was just exegesis." Nietzsche's influence on intellectual life today is arguably as great; witness the various societies, journals, and websites and the steady stream of papers, collections, and monographs. This ‘Companion’ offers new essays from the best Nietzsche scholars, emphasizing the interrelatedness of his life and thought, eschewing a superficial biographical method but taking seriously his claim that great philosophy is “the self-confession of its author and a kind of unintended and unremarked ‘memoir’.” Each essay examines a major work by Nietzsche; together, they offer an advanced introduction for students of German Studies, philosophy, and comparative literature as well as for the lay reader. Re-establishing the links between Nietzsche's philosophical texts and their biographical background, the volume alerts Nietzsche scholars and intellectual historians to the internal development of his thought and the aesthetic construction of his identity as a philosopher.

In providing proof of the thesis that the main representatives of sociological thought in Europe converged on a solution for this problem, Parsons (1937/1968) did two things. First, he built upon the classical phase of sociological theory to bring it to a remarkable completion, and second, he established the foundation for the dominance of a normatively oriented functionalism in American<br>

  Book Title: Serbian Orthodox Fundamentals-The Quest for an Eternal Identity<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mylonas Christos<br>
  Abstract: This book is a comprehensive exposition of the interaction of a national (the Serbian people) and a religiou (the Orthodox Christian faith) content, in the formation of a distinctive national identity and a mode of being. Its interdisciplinary approach, drawing on sociology, social anthropology, theology, political theory, Balkan historiography, and Serbian folklore, is deployed to provide a powerful and original analysis of how Serbian Orthodoxy has resulted in the sacralisation of the Serbian nation by framing the parameters of its existence. Addresses the following questions: what 'makes' a Serb? Are meaningful assumptions possible by introducing Serbian Orthodoxy as the primal point of reference? Why does religion appear to have an especially strong appeal?<br>

  Abstract: In untangling this complicated subject it will be helpful to resort to a simplified schema, founded upon the following point of departure: that religion—Serbian Orthodoxy, in this particular context—defines man and his place in the universe. In order to function effectively, it is essential that a person or group have a precisely focused and systematically conceived definition of its environment and of itself. Such a definition of the system and the cosmos to which it is related is a conception of identity. Orthodoxy can be understood only as an integrated system of thought, logically sound and epistemologically valid,<br>

  Abstract: If you ask people who are involved in cultural production where to look for solutions to the problems of integration of the enlarged EU, you should not be surprised if they point at culture. Culture, indeed, should be part of solution. An awareness of some pitfalls that loom in this area is also desirable, however, because culture itself is also part of the problem.<br>

  Abstract: Walking round Paris in the 1980s, I was both surprised and impressed to discover the church of St Eustache, near Les Halles (fig.2). From a distance the church, begun in 1532, looks Gothic, but on a closer inspection many details, inside and out, are classical. How was such a mixture possible? At that point I was not aware of any discussion of the building, although in the nineteenth century, St Eustache had been condemned by the famous French architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc as a “confused heap of debris borrowed from all over the place, lacking connections and lacking harmony”.

The CPCz had been legally operating in the country since 1921 (although was banned in 1938 and illegal during World War II). Reasons for support are also rooted in the Munich Agreement in 1938—when the Sudeten lands were ceded to Hitler’s Germany and Czechoslovakia was effectively abandoned by the Western powers.² Germany, not the Soviet Union,<br>

Abstract: This article aims (1) to analytically disaggregate agency into its several component elements (though these are interrelated empirically), (2) to demonstrate the ways in which these agentic dimensions interpenetrate with forms of structure, and (3) to point out the implications of such a conception of agency for empirical research. The authors conceptualize agency as a temporally embedded process of social engagement, informed by the past (in its “iterational” or habitual aspect) but also oriented toward the future (as a “projective” capacity to imagine alternative possibilities) and toward the present (as a “practical‐evaluative” capacity to contextualize past habits and future projects within the contingencies of the moment).<br>

Abstract: For Immanuel Kant, a foundational figure of liberal Protestantism, the immortality of the soul is a postulate of pure practical reason, and the resurrection of Jesus, a legend in which Saint Paul would not have believed had it not served as a morally necessary proof of a future life. From the moral point of view (to which Kant reduces religion), it is irrelevant whether the terrestrial body is necessary for personal identity in the afterlife or even whether our bodies will be resurrected. See Immanuel Kant,
            The Conflict of the Faculties(1798), trans. Mary J. Gregor (Lincoln, Nebr., 1992), where Kant formulates principles of scriptural exegesis aimed at solving the conflict between the faculties of philosophy and theology.<br>

Abstract: Group styles filter collective representations; the result is culture in interaction. By contrasting each of our main groups’ style with those of other groups, and with the “default” style in previous cultural theories, this article has shown how groups can use the same collective representation to different meaningful ends in everyday life. The point is not that collective representations are meaningless in themselves, but that a focus on “culture in interaction” helps us understand how the same widely shared symbols, stories, vocabularies, or codes make different meanings in different settings.<br>

Abstract: 1. Is paradigm the right choice, and have I used it correctly?There is always a risk in adopting a concept that comes from a different tradition. It is even riskier when we fiddle with it and stretch it to fit a set of data for which it was not designed as I have done. But I believe that the risk is warranted for two reasons. The first is that there is considerable confusion within and outside of anthropology regarding the nature of the anthropological study of language. The oscillation mentioned in the article among a number of labels, including linguistic anthropology, anthropological linguistics, sociolinguistics, and ethnolinguistics, is only the most superficial and yet telling example of the widespread lack of clarity as to what constitutes linguistic research from an anthropological perspective. Further evidence of confusion can be inferred from the typically partial and often clumsy attempts to represent the linguistic subfield (or the study of language) in sociocultural anthropology textbooks. I felt that it was time to come to terms with the fact that perhaps those of us inside the subfield had not been communicating to those outside as effectively as we thought we were. I then realized that to address this issue I needed a notion that by its very nature would force us to think in terms of broad trends rather than particular notions or hypotheses. The popular notions of paradigm and paradigm shift seemed to me the perfect candidates; they could force us to think in terms of the major features of our research projects. CookGumperz and Gumperz are right when they write that Kuhns approach gives a sense of structural containment to the flow of ideas that to those living with them appear much more fluid and overlapping. (Their proposal to adopt Holtons themata is a bit cryptic given that his model is not considered an improvement on Kuhns by most historians of science.)

Abstract: If you would really like to know what makes us think, you will not get the answer by reading this book—the title is just a misnomer. The volume is a good after‐hours read on the views and exchanges of two prominent researchers, Jean‐Pierre Changeux, a neuroscientist, and Paul Ricoeur, a philosopher. They argue about a lot of issues, from evolution to brain to ethics, rarely reaching an agreement on the role of modern‐age neuroscience in shaping human values and experience. Changeux envisions an overarching role of neuroscience on human affairs. He writes, “[t]he knowledge that we are now in the process of piecing together about the human brain ought to allow us to have a clearer idea—I am perhaps overly optimistic—of the direction in which we wish to see human society develop” (p 27). Ricoeur holds steadfastly to every millimeter occupied by the totality of human experience and its unique value, seeing no special role in it for neuroscience
      qua neuroscience. For example, the authors engage in the following exchange: “Changeux: … Today … I think that observational methods make it possible to obtain physical facts about subjective psychological states. A physics of introspection may even be possible. Are we in agreement on this point? Ricoeur: In humans a function is not reducible to an observable behavior.… There is a hermeneutics of daily life that gives introspection the dimension of an interpersonal practice.… This is what I find expressed in the phrasefor intérieur,one’s heart of hearts—literally, a ‘forum’ in which one speaks to oneself. This heart of hearts has its own particular status that it would appear you will never succeed in explaining in your science. And so my answer to your question is no” (pp 67–69).<br>

Article Title: Freud Meets Lévi‐Strauss in Melanesia<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: ca.2004.45.issue-1<br>
Date: 02 2004<br>
Author(s): Juillerat Bernard<br>
Abstract: Several of the essays arein the theological senseapologetic. The first is a selfsituating, at times trenchant criticism of cognitive anthropology. The second is a historical account of psychoanalytic anthropology that is so parochial, so superficial that it hardly merits reading. Juillerat considers neither the critiques of psychoanalytic anthropology nor the research of ethnopsychoanalysts such as Paul Parin in Zurich, Waud Kracke in the United States, or the anthropologically oriented psychoanalysts in India, Japan, and South America. It would be a pity, however, if readers dismissed the book at this point, for the remaining essays are theoretically interesting, ethnographically rich, and at times conceptually disquieting. They include such topics as the nature of the symbol; the relationship between Freuds originary fantasies and LviStrausss basic kinship units (
      atomes de parent); the interaction between individual and collective representations; the conjunction of endopsychic projections of cosmologies and social reality; splitting and metamorphosis in the Yafar conception of death; parallels between the evolutionism in Yafar mythology and in BachofensMutterrecht; the stress on the paternal principle in Freud and the maternal in Jung; a rethinking of Maussian exchange theory that recognizes gifts that impose no obligation; an interpretation of a recent cargo cult that relates the land of plenty to the terror and longing for intrauterine return that is expressed in Yafar myth; and a reinterpretation of Naven as a psychodrama in which the uterine nephewthe eternal herois caught between agnatic law and incestuous ties with the mother. The last chapter consists of theoretical excerpts from JuilleratsLavnement du pre(1995), which, though meant to enrich the reading of Yafar ritual and myth, are difficult to evaluate out of context.<br>

Abstract: Other eighteenth‐century commentators were impressed by Cromwell’s meteoric rise, his military successes, and his foreign policy successes. But assessments, Whig and Tory alike, were generally hostile. In 1721, in
      Cato’s Letters, Trenchard and Gordon had commented that Cromwell “is scarce ever mentioned but with detestation, or thought of but as a monster.”43Neal was not unique in his positive acclaim for the Lord Protector, though it is significant that two out of the three positive biographies of the eighteenth century that Blair Worden can point to were written by Dissenting ministers: Isaac Kimber and William Harris.44But to write in the 1730s that while the Lord Protector did wield power, “no man ever used it to greater public advantage,” was a courageous statement of a minority position. And Neal’s final remarks are an uncompromising vindication of Cromwell’s position: “He was at the Helm in the most stormy and tempestuous season that England ever saw; but by his consummate Wisdom and Valour he disconcerted the measures and designs of his Enemies, and preserved both himself and the Common‐wealth from shipwreck.”45The confusion that followed his death only strengthens the point. Indeed, the remainder ofThe History of the Puritans, to the revolution of 1688, is a grim narrative of political repression and political disintegration that makes the blue remembered hills of the interregnum look even more attractive.<br>

Abstract: According to Aristotle, only the divine can reach the point of thinking its own thinking and knowing itself absolutely. And man has neither a definition of nor access to this knowledge. The theology of revelation, through other paths, confirms this impossibility. And yet, it no longer understands this impossibility as something forbidden, but rather as a grace and a privilege: man remains incomprehensible, but in the image and likeness of the incomprehensible par excellence; he thus holds a derived and gracious excellence: that of knowing himself as incomprehensible.<br>

Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: An increase in knowledge and religious sensitivity has thus revealed the representations of the religious “other” in opposition to which Christianity has traditionally defined itself to be little more than projections of an underlying desire to establish religious identity.
         59Thoughtful comparison exposes this basic need to establish religious identity by invalidating many of the representations through which this need has been at once expressed and concealed. We might say that comparative theology represents the demythologization of apologetics, where demythologization is understood in Rudolf Bultmann’s sense as the recognition of an expressive function underneath an appearance of objective description. So just as Bultmann sought to demythologize the New Testament by explicating the mode of being‐in‐the‐world expressed through a mythical world picture,60so too the comparative theologian recognizes the expressive intent beneath the often questionable comparisons of traditional apologetics. The analogy with Bultmann’s demythologization project calls attention to a point about this conception of comparative theology that brings it into line with Clooney’s, namely, that it does not imply an outright rejection of apologetics. Comparative theology can be regarded as the attempt to salvage what is legitimate in apologetics, namely, the desire to preserve the integrity of a particular religious community by establishing its cognitive boundaries. This conception of comparative theology as a demythologized apologetics thus acknowledges the legitimacy of a sociopolitical dimension to religion. Through judicious comparisons, comparative theology brings into relief the defining features of the Christian community. Yet this aspect of comparative theology differs from traditional apologetics in that it distinguishes a desire to define the Christian faith from a perceived need to refute the teachings of other faith communities. To the extent that comparative theology succ~<br>

Abstract: While these readings of Marion and Lévinas are admirable descriptions of a worthy project, objections that would strengthen Robbins’s argument can be made. Contrary to Robbins’s aim, the authors that serve as his models of philosophical theology present their work in a form that maintains the division between a theological side (Marion’s
      God without Being, Lévinas’s Talmudic commentaries) and a philosophical side (Marion’s phenomenology and Lévinas’s ethical philosophy). In not fully recognizing this, Robbins does not so much prove himself wrong as he overlooks an important point of his own argument. For, in order to understand how theology and philosophy relate, they must be distinguished. Only if differences remain can there be conversation and mutual, transformative indebtedness.<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: For Kant, a “boundary” always presupposes a positive conception of the enclosing region (e.g., the field of noumena) beyond the enclosed space (e.g., the “field of experience”), defining a shared border where the two spaces “touch” (sec. 57). In contrast, a “limit” defines a border as merely a negation of an incomplete quantitative series. Theoretical reason (mathematics and natural science) has no boundary; new cognition extends to infinity. Bourgeois’s main point is that the very enterprise of critique founders without its boundary relation to the positive content provided by the Ideas of Reason (ideas of the completion of the series of conditions)—in particular, as “postulates of pure reason” practically indispensable for obedience to the objectively binding moral law. Bourgeois cites Kant: “[The end of reason] is ‘to point out to us actually not only the bounds of the pure use of reason, but also the way to determine them’” (p. 43). What grounds critique and critical metaphysics is not reason in its conditioned use, the understanding (
      Verstand) and its categories; rather, it is reason (Vernunft) in its unconditioned use that establishes the sources of cognition, their domain, boundaries, and relations.<br>

Abstract: Whatever the starting point for investigation of agency, and whatever correctives are proposed, there must be both individual and social uptake of those changes in order for them to have any impact on women’s lives. Meyers faces this necessity more squarely in her final chapter on sexuality, where she points out that female sexual agency cannot change without concurrent changes in masculine sexual identity, although the problem of how to effect such changes remains. Similarly, McNay writes hopefully about creative connection and interdependence with others, but in her work—perhaps because of her reliance on a fractious group of theorists—these “others” remain largely abstractions. The discomforts in social roles of which she writes are not just between the self and a set of institutions or expectations; they are between the self and other people, people with their own specificity and their own discomforts. Despite—or perhaps because of—her emphasis on collective action, McNay seems to defer genuine selfhood to some future possible world. Nevertheless, McNay’s emphasis on collective action is a helpful complement to Meyers’s focus on imagery.<br>

Abstract: It is at this level of “text” that we are able to speak of a unit of meaning as having a semiautonomous existence. A text is to some extent detached from the conditions of its production, but it is not completely autonomous. Rather, it is mediation in three dimensions: between man and world, between man and man, and between man and himself. According to Ricoeur, the first mediation is referentiality, the second is communicability, and the third is self‐understanding [
         31]. He shows how hermeneutics describes, as well as the interpretation of texts, the whole activity at the point of intersection of the (internal) configuration of the work and the (external) refiguration of life [18].<br>

Abstract: Feminists and gender theorists might simply repeat the universalizing knowledge claims of colonialism by celebrating an ahistorical and acontextual blurring of boundaries. For instance, might the blurring of racial boundaries be an obfuscation of the systemic racial oppression and racial hierarchies that continue to affect women’s lives? I will return to this point shortly, but for the moment I want to suggest that neocolonial and imperial knowledge claims can be contested only through theories derived from located knowledge. Indeed, my own arguments for context‐specific theory derive in part from Haraway’s own paradigm of situated knowledge. Positing an alternative to a value‐free relativism that she declares to be the “perfect mirror twin of totalization” (
         1988, 584), Haraway suggests an alternative that is “partial, locatable, critical knowledg[e] sustaining the possibility of webs of connections called solidarity in politics and shared conversations in epistemology” (584). “Our problem is how to havesimultaneouslyan account of radical historical contingency for all knowledge claims and knowing subjects, a critical practice for recognizing our own ‘semiotic technologies’ for making meanings, and a no‐nonsense commitment to faithful accounts of a ‘real’ world, one that can be partially shared” (579).<br>

Abstract: Clooney acknowledges that comparative theology presupposes an initial theological understanding of other religious traditions that helps one be favorably disposed toward them and elicits a search for whatever goodness, virtue, and spiritual appeal—all at first understood in Christian terms—that can be found in those traditions. In his view, an inclusivist position is better suited for this purpose than an exclusivist or pluralist position. Francis X. Clooney,

Arguing against comparative theologians who demand a moratorium on theology of religions, Paul Knitter makes a similar point inIntroducing Theologies of Religions(Maryknoll, NY: Orbis, 2002), 235–37.<br>

Abstract: But how does the shroud‐relics reflection operate? What does it mean to participate in a divine mirroring? Tesauro again offers an intrinsically rhetorical interpretation of some tenets of Renaissance hermetic thought.
      110He reminds us that the inner qualities of a given “agent” (agente) become apparent when it is connected to its “symbol” (simbolo).111As agent, the relics speak forth the beneficial qualities of the shroud. The shroud, we could say, is here a noun, whereas St. Maurice’s body is its actualization. In other words, the name “shroud” means the relics of the martyr Maurice, and conversely the martyr’s relics are symbolized in the shroud. “Shroud” is the proper name of the relics. The link between an “agent” or object and its name or “symbol” can be in fact seen as a movement from potentiality (in potenza) to actuality (in atto).112To explain this crucial point, Tesauro reminds us that Paul, “already destined to martyrdom,” believed that he carried the “stigmata” of the Lord in his body.113<br>

Abstract: As with many of these issues, there is more that could be said. The point can be taken, however, that Frei’s attunement to Midrash emerges within his writings in conjunction with a stronger emphasis on the plurality of views within the literal sense.
         57It also models how Christianity, in the particularity of the literal sense, is called to be a countercommmunity, defined and interpreted within the world of scripture rather than on the general, ideologically‐driven criteria of a culture. Such particularity would enable an alternative way of living in our world—transforming relations between Judaism and Christianity, as well as redefining Christianity in relation to its surrounding culture. It also enables a pluralistic unity within the Christian community, as grounded in the shared pursuit of the literal sense.<br>

Abstract: “Citatology” nearly always ignores this question, implicitly treating references to an author as an index of recognition (of indebtedness or legitimacy). In point of fact this apparent function may nearly always be associated with such diverse functions as the manifestation of relations of allegiance or dependence, of strategies of affiliation, of annexation or of defence (this is the role, for example, of guarantee references, ostentatious references or alibi‐references).<br>

Abstract: The situation is hardly particular to fundamentalist Christian religious private schools. As Keith Barton and Linda Levstik (
         2004) point out, history education in U.S. public schools typically knits events into a narrative framework, and “not … just any old narrative,” but into the “dominant narrative of U.S. history—the story of freedom and progress” (166–67). As Bruce VanSledright (1998) has argued, “much of what passes for history in the [public] schools is actually rooted in heritage’s attempt to turn selective memories into articles of truth” (244). Numerous studies evince the potency of this master narrative, of American exceptionalism (among them: Barton and Levstik2004; Epstein1998; Foner1998; Kammen1991; Loewen1995; Wertsch2002). My own previous work on Holocaust education bears this out as well (Schweber2004). Though knowledgeable about history in general and Holocaust history in particular, a public high school teacher I called Mr. Zee taught about the Holocaust as a story of triumph and progress rather than as one of tragedy or moral collapse.18It is clear, therefore, that whether teaching toward religious collective memory or national collective memory, history teachers in both religious and public schools fit historical events into overarching narratives, consciously or not. And while the contents of the overarching narratives may differ greatly, the processes of directing students’ thinking do not necessarily diverge.<br>

Abstract: Again I need to comment on the kind of perspective exchange or, rather, perspective exchanges, that are at issue. Perspective coordination is more complicated than either information exchange or perspective exchange. What does a judge do when we view her actions from the angle of the two sets of paired contrasts I have identified: that of the participant self‐perspective and other perspective, and that of the participant and observer perspective? In the first stage the judge performs a participant perspective exchange, trying to transpose herself to the perspectives of both parties in turn. She establishes their situations and contexts, what their beliefs and practices are, what reasons they advance for these, what consequences they link with them, and so on. In this way she seeks to transpose herself to the “world” of each party, that is to say, she adopts their participant perspectives. But at some point she has to distance herself. That is the second stage, when she looks as an outsider at the beliefs and practices, the reasons for them, and their consequences. In other words, she adopts an observer perspective. Finally, in the third stage she has to deliberate in order to arrive at what Ricoeur calls an “attestatory judgment” or a “wise judgment in situation.” This deliberation entails a dual exchange of perspectives: first an exchange of the participant perspectives of both parties to which she keeps transposing herself, and second, an exchange of participant and observer perspectives.<br>

Abstract: It is appropriate at this point to go back and “recall” the opening reminiscences of this text. This recollection is no longer the same as the initial experience, of course; it is inflected by the thoughts that have come in between. Strictly speaking, only the statues in front of the university would correspond entirely to the notion of
         lieu de mémoireas utilized and defined by Nora. For the generations who were part of the institution‐building efforts of the young state and for whom the figures of the “pre‐Liberation period” were an important component of their immediate childhood memories, and not just textbook entries, the monument to the Brothers Georgievi (placed in 1934) used to be a veritablemilieu de mémoire.
            95To didactic historians, probably the most widely distributed breed among the species, these figures stand as symbols of genuine patriotism and selfless charity to be admired and emulated. To contemporary students, their names mean very little, and few actually know anything about their lives and other exploits. If not entirely forgotten, their huge bronze images, “like seashells on the shore from which the sea of living memory has retreated,” tease the historical memory of college students who pass by them every morning. There is nothing exceptional or unexpected in this. As Reinhart Koselleck has remarked: “Memorials, like all works of art, have a surplus potential to take on a life of their own. For this reason, the original meaning of countless memorials is no longer recognizable without recourse to inscriptions or other empirically comprehensible reference signals.”96<br>

Abstract: Such an endlessly self‐creative social responsibility arguably articulates something profound in the Christian ethical message. The dependency of humanity on God should open each of us to the important ways in which human beings are radically dependent upon one another. Responsibility for children as “the least among us” shines a particularly strong light on what it means to love fellow creatures of God overall. A sense of responsibility to human vulnerability is suggested in the gospel meaning of the golden rule: “Do to others as you would have them do to you” (Luke 6:31). As Ricoeur and others have argued, this formulation implies a double substitution: you are asked to imagine yourself as a recipient of another’s actions so as to understand your own moral agency from another’s point of view.
         53The golden rule puts you in the position of the one responsible, but from the point of view of the one you may potentially victimize. It demands two moral centers at once: yourself and the other. This decentering function of the golden rule is further radicalized by its immediately following Jesus’s extreme love command: “Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you” (Luke 6:27–28). The juxtaposition of such an asymmetrical or radical love command on the golden rule protects the latter from being reduced to any easy reciprocity or exchange. It renders moral responsibility a demand for superabundance toward others in the service of realizing a common humanity.<br>

Abstract: All I have claimed here, however, is that moral practice involves, even if it is not exhausted by, a primordial creative capability. However such a capability may be realized substantively, my point has been to argue, against a long history in Western moral thought, that such a capability is not ancillary or hostile to moral practice but rather presupposed within it. Poetics is the condition for ethical life’s transformative possibility. What it means to be an
         imitatio Creatorisis to be capable of imitating an invisible and dynamic creativity deeply impressed in the human will. This original human creative capability is absolutely necessary for forming worlds of moral meaning that may overcome historical distortions and violence and respond to human difference. Without it we are likely to retreat into unchanging moral certainties or a simplistic moral pluralism. The more profoundly human possibility is to engage in the endless but ultimately more rewarding task of creating real historical tensions into ever more meaningfully inclusive moral worlds.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: In a first reading of the book, I was critical of this emphasis on moral motivations, since it seemed to be overburdened by a psychological approach. But, on a second reading, I had to refrain from my critique. Ricoeur makes the point that he has no intention to “take the place of a resolution for the perplexities raised by the very concept of a struggle, still less of a resolution of the conflicts” (218). In other words, Ricoeur is proposing a well‐needed complement to the institutional design trend that has invaded contemporary political philosophy. Contrary to many, he stands before the most perplexing issue of recognition with eyes wide open: indeed, demands of recognition may never end and take the form of an “unhappy consciousness” (218). One can try to resolve this potential inflation of claims by sorting out political and substantive issues. But a solution that takes only this path could create vast areas of frustration that canny elites have learned to fuel, or come to neglect recognition claims on the grounds that they hide a Pandora's box waiting to be opened. I suspect that this neglect mechanism is one of the reasons why so many legitimate recognition claims still languish in limbo as we speak. The course taken by Ricoeur may be difficult to square with the mainstream approach in contemporary political philosophy—political liberalism, to name it—but it nonetheless deserves careful attention.<br>

Abstract: Three general features of this method can be noted in advance. First, this method must be immanent or internal to its subject matter. Dialectical theorists reject outright the idea that the thinker can occupy some privileged Archimedean point outside the subject of investigation. … A second feature of dialectical method is its dialogical character. Theorizing is an activity taking place not simply within the mind but between minds. Thinking is dialogical because it always takes the form of an exchange or a conversation between ourselves, our contemporaries, and our predecessors. … Third, the dialogical element is related to the historical dimension of theory.

Issue: ci.2007.33.issue-2<br>
Date: 01 2007<br>
Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: What unmistakably sets Patočka’s discourse apart from the traditional discourses on Europe—particularly those of Husserl and Heidegger—is what Derrida calls Patočka’s “essential Christianity” (
      GD,p. 22). Undoubtedly, Derrida makes this point first of all in order to distinguish Patočka’s interpretation of the theme of the care of the soul from Heidegger’s analysis of care (Sorge) inBeing and Timeas a fundamental existential structure ofDasein.Heidegger constantly sought to separate his thought from Christianity, while at the same time ontologically recovering—and de‐Christianizing—Christian themes and texts by inquiring into their originary possibility. Patočka, on the other hand, “makes an inverse yet symmetrical gesture.… He reontologizes the historic themes of Christianity and attributes to revelation or to themysterium tremendumthe ontological content that Heidegger attempts to remove from it” (GD,p. 23). But this reference to an essential Christianity also acknowledges that the emergence of responsibility in the face of everydayness and the sacred is, for Patočka, intimately connected to the history of religion. Patočka is intent on overcoming both the inauthenticity of everydayness and the demonic and the orgiastic that are an escape from it.Plato and Europeestablishes Plato as the Greek philosopher who brought the motif of the care of the soul into being and also as the thinker who transformed myth into religion, the one who “recommends … faith.” All differences considered, “faith, as the Greek philosophers saw it, is the foundation of what we call faith in the Christian tradition”; nevertheless, only Christianity is religion in an eminent sense.10Indeed, as Derrida remarks, Patočka’s thought is remarkably consistent in taking
            
      into account the event of Christian mystery as an absolute singularity, a religion par excellence and an irreducible condition for a joint history of the subject, responsibility, and Europe. That is so even if,~<br>

Abstract: If, for Halbwachs, history delegitimizes the “lived
         (vécu)past,” it is possible to observe a similar impulse occurring elsewhere, namely, Japan, where Yanagita Kunio produced a history(Meiji Taishoshi: Sesohen)on the model of an immense tableau comprised of past and present customs mingling together in 1920s Tokyo and actually envisaged history’s vocation as recording the cohabitation of different customs reflecting mixed temporalities in the present. In Peru at around the same time, Jose Carlos Mariátegui was reflecting on the intersection of historical times coexisting in conflict within a developmental framework and with the figure of unevenness that clearly signified the noncontemporaneity of the contemporaneous.32And in our time this fixation on the historical present as the punctual point of mixed temporalities has appeared more frequently, throughout the world, as evidenced by Chinua Achebe’s novelization of the conflict produced by clashing times in eastern Nigeria(The Arrow of God)—the visualization of temporal islands where contacts and collisions have taken place and have launched the production and spread of culturalmétissage—and even Achille Mbembe’s formulation of the entanglements of time employed to explain the postcolony. In fact, there are innumerable examples of the noncontemporaneous contemporary that can be recruited from the domains of literature, cinema, and, obviously, sociology, an immense literature analyzing the conflicts of tradition and modernity that, especially in the great cities of the world, take place between immigrant parents and their children, among the claims and practices of diasporic peoples in the heart of modern metropolitan life, and within virtual pockets of a transplanted Third World. Also, movements like the Zapatistas in Chiapas have managed to balance the cyclical time of the indigenous community with a political project of liberation inscribed in a Marxian narrative of modernity (though free of progressivist~<br>

Issue: 509555<br>
Date: 10 2007<br>
Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: With respect to academic arguments over the New Testament’s historicity, philosopher Mary Warnock has argued that the debates “show a failure to understand the full part that imagination plays not only in religion but in literature, history and in life itself, lived as it is through time, yet demanding a constant effort to make sense of time, to turn events into stories.”
         94Analogously, it can be said that the nature and function of Smith’s texts can best be understood not in terms of historical veracity but as a means to “make sense of time,” specifically biblical time. Or, in terms of narrative theory, Smith’s mythmaking may be best understood in terms of its capacity to make “human time,” that combination of what is already (our past) with what is anticipated (our future) to comprise the reality out of which we act in the present.95Thus, by maintaining the narrative function of the Bible in his own writings, Smith made more than a claim to history. He gave his believing readers a sense of what was experientially real, not merely philosophically true. Wittgenstein’s observation about Christianity is equally true of Mormonism. “Christianity is not,” he said, “based on a historical truth; rather it offers us a (historical) narrative and says: now believe! But not, believe this narrative with the belief appropriate to historical narrative, rather … make a quite different place in your life for it.”96Attention to narrative function furthers Wittgenstein’s point by positing that the believing reader’s commitment is not partial. The reader does not make “a place” for the narrative but enters—takes his or her life experience—into the narrative as a world of possibility.<br>

Abstract: While this book will be of great interest to Christian ethicists as well as to religious and moral educators, it should also be read by social scientists, philosophers, and evolutionary psychologists. Browning’s view that nontheological disciplines depend on images of the human that play a guiding role for their research, as well as for the interpretation of their results, points to the continued need for more interdisciplinary work. According to this point of view, theology should play a public role in identifying such prescientific or preempirical images as well as in describing and advancing refined and responsible images based on the Christian tradition. The present volume goes a long way in either direction.<br>

Countering all the more blasé signals my students were giving me that it was most naive to think the retelling of stories from another point of view could have any political impact, it is evidence that women’s rewritings of classic texts can still affect young women, still make them think and make them want to contribute to the discussions, the debates that shape the public sphere. Although we need, of course, to factor in serendipity—the student was on holiday and thought she had discovered a little‐known book when in fact it was a
      New York Timesbest seller—there is definitely a sense in which her discovery marked a moment in her life and signals the development of a feminist consciousness (broadly defined as a certain awareness of gender identity combined with a critical position in respect to misogyny and patriarchy and a conviction that things can be changed). There is no denying that increasing individualization at all levels of society has caused the loss of a sense of collective action and political projects. This is equally true for ideas of improvement, emancipation, and modernization, the responsibility of which has largely been shifted to the individual, whose “human rights,” as Bauman argues, are redefined as “the right of individuals to stay different and to pick and choose at will their own models of happiness and fitting life‐style” (2000;2005, 29). In this deregulated and privatized sociopolitical context that knows no common cause, re‐vision can only fail to formulate enabling fictions for a better future for all. Yet in its capacity to speak to individuals, it can still draw them into visions of community and collectivity. Re‐vision may thus not be the lifeline that is to haul us out of patriarchy any more, but as a structure of address that engages readers into contemplating differences, it remains one of the ways in which we keep sane and~<br>

Abstract: It is important to clarify at this point that the historicism we espouse is strictly a methodology to preserve the historical record. As stated above, the historicism we are advocating is founded upon the works of Johann Gottfried von Herder. We see in his reflections on mankind’s intellectual development a way to avoid the question of objective truth in librarianship for the sake of historical comprehension. It is very similar to Descartes suspending the truth value of the propositions of his beliefs in order to arrive at epistemological certainty. Our suspension of truth value does not arrive at epistemological certainty about the propositions contained in the many volumes housed in a library but rather at certainty that the historical record has not been compromised by the elimination of any these volumes. In other words, librarians must suspend the truth value of singular items and artifacts in the historical record in order that the whole truth of any given period of history be accurately analyzed and understood. As Herder states: “If history in its simplest sense were nothing but a description of an occurrence, of a production, then the first requirement is that the description be
         whole, exhaust the subject, show it to use from all sides” [74].<br>

New York: Cam- bridge University Press. 2003. Pp. xiii, 527. $60.00. In reviewing for this journal the first two volumes of J. G. A. Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters.

Abstract: [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility.

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives.

Abstract: In
         Fictional Truth, Michael Riffaterre sees the subtextual energy of fiction standing in the same relation to plot as does the unconscious in Freud to the system of conscious perception.29Like the unconscious, and revealed only in signs or symptoms of the otherwise functionally repressed, subtexts are therefore timeless, reversible, and cumulative. If denied maternity (its removal by death or its falsification) locates one such subtext inLittle Dorrit—strung along in counterpoint to the failed father motif, for instance—that matrilineal subtext has its perverse and unexpected returns across the marital trajectory of the son himself, as he is sped along the monorail of its domesticating engine toward the anticipated point of rest and its gender assimilation. Any such subtext, according to Riffaterre, is a phenomenon transcendent to change or if you will subtendent to it. It thereby lies, in the last sentence of his study, “outside the realm of time and … impervious to its ravages.”30Plot is the map of those ravages. Narratology understands this. Narratography would, as I say, reexperience it—and do so in a transferential exchange, against the medial flow, between a nervously cued attention and the insinuated unconscious of the text itself.<br>

Issue: 522216<br>
Date: 10 2008<br>
Author(s): Balsamo Gian<br>
Abstract: A discussion of the soul as the traditional seat of selfhood is justified in light of the fact that neuroscientists are gradually colonizing the notions and concepts pertinent to spiritual discourse. In
         Synaptic Self, for instance, Joseph Le Doux reminds us that inKing JohnShakespeare defines the brain as the “soul’s frail dwelling.” And then he goes on to remark: “A few minutes with my mother, a devout Catholic with Alzheimer’s disease, makes it painfully clear just how fragile the soul dwelling is.”1In imitation of the Freudian investigation of the unconscious through the analysis of its deficiencies and dysfunctions, Le Doux is implying that an expeditious way of determining what the soul is consists of looking at patients who have lost their mental faculties. A keen observer of the disconnection between introspective gaze and external action, Saint Augustine might see the soundness of Le Doux’s vantage point; the feebleness caused by a terminal illness, in the specific case of his mother Monnica, is described in Augustine’sConfessionsas provoking a “defectum animae,” a privation of soul—in modern terms, Monnica undergoes a swooning or a fainting whereby her consciousness drifts away from the people and things around her (Confessions8.9, 9.11).2And when Proust describes “the kind of beast” that his protagonist Marcel finds in the bed of his dying grandmother, an unrecognizable woman blinded by pain and unable to recognize her own kin, he is intimating that Marcel’s maternal grandmother also, like Augustine’s mother, is being robbed of the major identifying token of her conscious self. “But if the being that turned and tossed in my grandmother’s bed was just a beast,” wonders Marcel, “where had my grandmother gone?”3Indeed, where does the soul of Marcel’s grandmother, or of Le Doux’s and Augustine’s mothers, go when it leaves the body?<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 592372<br>
Date: 01 2009<br>
Author(s): Miller Richard B.<br>
Abstract: Augustine’s apology for Christianity and the idea of just war suggests a point that he and his interlocutors presumed as obvious, namely, that there is an ethics of memory—a duty to remember justly for the sake of history, self‐understanding, and narrative recollection. He thus invites us to consider the obligations and virtues of what Ricoeur calls a “just memory.”
         82Augustine’s ethics is, as I noted above, “agent‐referring”: it attends to the moral effects of an action on the character of the person carrying out that action. He developed his agent‐referring concerns, moreover, not by looking at the morality of individuals as isolated monads but as situated and affected by cultural forces that help shape character over time. The temporal quality of character and culture led him naturally to consider the virtues that surround memory, both individual and collective.83Given the intimate connection between memory and identity, there is an obvious obligation to remember for Augustine, a responsibility to remember truthfully. He thus worried about whether what people remember about themselves is prone to self‐aggrandizement and, with that, self‐deception. For these reasons, we can say that an Augustinian ethics of war is, among other things, an ethics of memory. That Rome’s morality “proceeded to bloody strife of all parties and then to the social and civil wars” is not his own personal judgment; it is, in his words, “the witness of history.”84<br>

Abstract: Now, the “world,” as I understand it, is a concept one uses for the complex ecology of reflexively interacting environments and the values historically etched into them. As human power grows through technological means, so too does our responsibility and also, interestingly, the world. In fact, our global age is a time of many worlds arising and reflexively interacting around the planet, and this challenges human beings to orient existence amid the possible collision and clash of diverse value orientations.
         34The current attacks on human agency in the name of the fate of Being, like Heidegger's, or nonpersonal social forces, in different ways by Luhmann and Foucault, are wide of the mark. The increase of power expands rather than effaces agency and responsibility; it creates new worlds, for good or ill. We must, then, insist on the work of ethics within the academy since it provides a normative discourse of power and responsible agency linked to the articulation and analysis of the lived structure of reality as itself structured through the interactions among agents and surrounding historically shaped environments. On this point, the religions and the legacy of humanism were right to explore agents who fashion worlds.<br>

Abstract: Readers without solid background knowledge of French film and colonial history may have some difficulty navigating through Eades's tightly packed, allusive prose, especially since no index of any kind is provided. This absence is difficult to understand in a work of serious scholarship aimed at academic readers, as is the press's decision to invest in numerous glossy still‐frame illustrations that add nothing substantive to the analysis. However, the extensive, thematically organized filmographies and bibliographies that conclude the volume should prove very useful to all readers by providing a starting point for further reading and research.<br>

Abstract: This is not Ricoeur at his most accessible, and I would not recommend the work as an entrance point for engaging his corpus. The essays are tough going, and the essays in the second section are particularly difficult. The essays do deal with important themes in Ricoeur’s work, ones especially visible in his later writings. Many of the essays are introduced with footnotes that indicate a debt to previous works, and nearly all the essays make some reference to the “little ethics” of
      Oneself as Anotherbut suggest that knowledge of these works is not necessary. This is not completely true in my estimation; it is difficult to discern where Ricoeur is headed in this volume if one knows little or nothing of where he has been. Some understanding may be gained without previous knowledge, but grounding in previous works is essential for a thorough understanding of this volume.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 603531<br>
Date: 10 2009<br>
Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: I want to conclude by seeing how Coleridge’s thinking on prayer might, in being part of the reconceptualization of religious subjectivity found in the nineteenth century, anticipate some of the stakes and terms of Derrida and Marion’s debate. The most obvious thing to note is that Coleridge makes the against‐itself of prayer central. His thought echoes the lesson of Rom. 8:26—“We know not what we should pray for as we ought”—and the strange fold that means we pray for the capacity to pray. Calvin, no less, argues that prayer involves a “twofold pardon”—one for the original transgression and one for the weakness of the prayer.
         62That is not to say that just declaring prayer paradoxical or catachrestic solves the problem (nor should it be taken for the terminal point of his own thinking), but it can help us further determine a distinctive Coleridgean position on the language of prayer. First, we should note that Derrida (like Kant) considers that prayer demands a certain purity of action in order to rigorously conform to its concept—in Derrida’s case, an act of pure address. By contrast, for Coleridge (like Marion and most thinkers in the theological tradition), we have seen that prayer is as much response as act, a position powerfully enunciated by Hans Urs von Balthasar’s view of prayer as hearing: “The better a man learns to pray, the more deeply he finds that all his stammering is only an answer to God’s speaking to him.”63<br>

Author(s): Franke,  William<br>
Abstract: Revelation of the transcendent is always apocalyptic, but apocalypse is not limited to religious discourse: “For in poetry, language is broken open to let the previously inconceivable appear” (24). The negative capability of poetry is a creative deconstruction akin to negative theology, and this is especially true of modernist poetry that reflects on the limits of its own representation. The result is deconstructive—a breaking down of the idols of thought and speech—but also openness to what we cannot conceive or represent. The deconstructive power of literature reveals and reveils grace or gift, but Franke insists that this openness to transcendent mystery has no positive or dogmatic content. However, to deny this openness as irrational repeats the dogmatism of absolutist belief, and here Franke parts company with Habermas and insists that such openness informs reason. None of us has a privileged vantage point to confirm or deny the transcendent, and reason itself requires an openness that questions the present in pursuit of new knowledge.<br>

Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: The studies under review represent significant revisions to the narrative of secularization. Their point of departure, as this essay has argued, is Enlightenment-era reactions to the inaccessibility of a radically transcendent, hidden God. By investing temporal concepts and institutions with new meanings that approximated religion's function of legitimizing human existence, eighteenth-century philosophers and theologians made the imperatives of the temporal sphere as binding as divine hierarchies once had been. Of course, the operative elements of this process varied, depending on the monograph in question: for Bell and Sepinwall, it was the regeneration of the nation-state and its inhabitants; for Sutcliffe, it was the Enlightenment's efforts to transcend Judaism; for Sheehan, it was the translation and repackaging of Scripture; for Dupré, it was the human person's emergence as the fundamental source of meaning. Yet each of these scholars insists that religious culture had a decisive influence on the formation of “secular” ideals and institutions. Enlightenment and religion, so long regarded as antithetical to each other, are now viewed as overlapping and interdependent agents of historical change.<br>

Abstract: More important to reconcile with this injunction, however, are the ethical restrictions on fighting as given in hadiths. Qutb cites these: First, Mohammad once ordered that no women or children be killed during combat. Second, he forbade the looting and mutilation of dead bodies. He is quoted as saying: “Proceed to fight in God’s name and for His cause. Fight those who deny God. Take the initiative but do not commit any acts of treachery, do not mutilate your victims, and do not kill any children.” Third, he once said that striking the face of an opponent should be avoided. Fourth, he forbade intentional, slow killing.
            79This is all to be understood in the context of seventh‐century Arabia, of course.80The net point is that killing is not supposed to give satisfaction. It is something one does for the deity.<br>

Abstract: Various features come to the fore. First, there is the formal aspect of time as present. Since its integral nature would seem to make time look like eternity, and since eternity has got everything to do with the “present of the present,” it is important to keep the two apart while at the same time honoring their affinity. In its capacity of enduring attention, it can be reduced neither to a point nor to the uncertainties of historicity pure and simple: it passes in a point. Second, the absence of a
      distinctio realisof future, present, and past inside the flux of time eliminates any possible chain of cause and effect. Thus the will can never be seen to establish a future for its own sake, since such a move presupposes a distinctness that would never allow that future to turn into atemps perduas if there were a real distance between past and future. Third, it would be wide of the mark to conclude from this “foregrounding” of temporality that the dimensions of the future and the past would be flattened. Rather, the contrary may be the case. Precisely in this prism of the present, “contingent events” break into myriads of presents, futures, and pasts. As for this “foregrounding” of time, what obtains for Joyce and Proust does so a fortiori for Augustine. Fourth, there is the issue of consciousness, for, far from floating in the air, time for Augustine is firmly embedded in consciousness: “All [manifestations of] time [alle Zeiten] are subjected to the movement, never to come to rest, of the actual flux of consciousness and are to flow into each other uninterruptedly.” To put it in Augustine's own words: “So, it is in you, my mind, that I measure periods of time.”
            Quite. But to be able to establish a link between, respectively, life as gift, time as the shift between future, present and past, and a sustained arrogation of voice, no allowances can be made for even the slightest gaps between those manifestations of time and of consciousness as if consciou~<br>

Author(s): Thistleton Anthony C.<br>
Abstract: Throughout the work, his approach is one that focuses on the key thinkers in the history of Western thought so as to illuminate the continuities and changes within the understanding of hermeneutics. Friedrich Schleiermacher, for instance, is named as the first turning point for inaugurating the modern subjective turn in hermeneutics by shifting its task from “rules of interpretation” to the “art of understanding.” He names Hans-Georg Gadamer as the second turning point for retrieving and rehabilitating notions of community, authority, history, and tradition for a more robust and rounded theory of hermeneutics. In addition to Schleiermacher and Gadamer, Thistleton accordingly devotes substantial sections and even separate chapters to other key thinkers in modern hermeneutics such as Wilhelm Dilthey, Rudolf Bultmann, and Paul Ricoeur. Thistleton is at his best in this work when he gives the sustained attention and acute analyses that these seminal thinkers in modern and contemporary hermeneutics deserve.<br>

Article Title: Still Life in a Narrative Age: Charlie Kaufman's<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 659348<br>
Date: 4 2011<br>
Author(s): Landy Joshua<br>
Abstract: Neither—to return to the earlier objection—has Kaufman quite yielded to the narrativity brigades by agreeing to tell that time-honored story, “Charlie becomes a writer.”
         36To be sure, the fictional character Charlie “grows” and “adapts” and “learns” and “overcomes obstacles to succeed in the end.” But above and behind Charlie, we sense the existence of an entity who doesnotgrow and adapt and learn, an entity who may well feel, with Susan, that “for a person, adapting is almost shameful; it's like running away,” an entity who has been more or less the same since the days ofBeing John Malkovitch. Here is where the distinction between Charlie and Kaufman, which might seem like a technical issue, actually becomes of prime importance (figs. 5–6). In the movie, one might say, Charlie becomes Donald. But, in real life, there is no Donald; in real life, there is only Kaufman, someone who is, we assume, an amalgam of Charlie and Donald, at once, enduringly, with an inexorable combat being unchangingly waged in his head, that marvellous, mysterious head into which Valerie Thomas, in the opening scene, expresses a desire to climb. From this point of view, the film is a spurious diachrony concealing a genuine synchrony; only superficially the story of how Charlie became Donald,Adaptationis, at a deeper level, the entirely nonnarrative portrait of a never-changing Kaufman.37<br>

Author(s): Bowman Sharon<br>
Abstract: First, it is not clear that Larmore’s evidence for mimetism (chap. 2) shows anything more than Charles Taylor or Wittgenstein have argued concerning meaning in general: our efforts to shape a practical identity must employ a shared language (32). That deliberation by reflection “consists in comparing ourselves to someone else” only seems evident if it amounts simply to Mead’s or Habermas’s point that reasons are dialogical or intersubjective (41), which Larmore repeatedly affirms (34). The thesis becomes dubious if instead it means that all persons are primarily motivated by tuitive motives such as envy, desire for status, or comparative advantage or that our achieving reputation in the eyes of others is fundamental to us, as Larmore’s examples often suggest (31, 46). Second, following “models” need not amount to “heteronomy” (35) since all plausible conceptions of personal autonomy admit sources of agentive capacities that influence a child in her upbringing without her choosing them; these are the educative processes that enable self-determination to start. Third, the theory of mimetism that Larmore reconstructs from René Girard seems to make any radical innovation in the history of ideas impossible. How then could the Troubadours have introduced the concept of romantic love (35)? How could cultures grow or develop if nothing is not copied from the past? Fourth, rejecting a latent self that subsists “deep inside us … unsullied by all that we have borrowed from others” (37) implies that unreflective emoting and action (or ‘flow’) is not more likely to constitute an experience of “being wholly ourselves” (55). Yet Larmore retains a version of Stendhal’s idea that completely unreflective experience is more “natural” (27) and provides one kind of authenticity since it leaves out the perspective of others that reflection always brings (64). This negative definition does not allow us to distinguish authentic spontaneity from merely careless or thoughtless ways of being ~<br>

Abstract: Historical realities, from the ziggurats of Babylon to the sixth-century exile, inform LaCocque’s study, but his real interest lies in the literary ingenuity of J, a “composer” who inherits a wide range of traditions. How these traditions are handed down is always difficult to establish, a point LaCocque makes with understated eloquence: “Literary themes are floating around, ready to be used by anyone” (15). The difficulty is establishing not only how ancient authors came upon these themes, but also how later readers variously interpret them. LaCocque’s own detailed analysis of the text, ranging across the methodological spectrum of biblical and literary studies, makes his readings cogent and compelling.<br>

Author(s): Csordas Thomas<br>
Abstract: I am grateful to this international group of scholars for accepting the invitation to engage my argument. My main points are that morality is not a cultural system but a modality of action present across all domains of human life, and that an anthropological approach to morality must recognize evil as an existential category. In other words, the article is neither a study of witchcraft for its own sake nor evil in its own right but a commentary on a particular moment in anthropological thinking about morality. Helene Basu recognizes the intent of my neologistic move toward homodicy and ethnodicy as alternatives to theodicy, which is to identify a starting point for anthropology distinct from those of theological anthropology or theology, in the shadow of which anthropology has approached morality obliquely if at all. She aptly identifies the importance of “concrete, situated human actions” and the “practical logic of evil.” To her question of whether this practical logic is discernible in violent encounters framed in terms other than witchcraft, the answer is an emphatic yes. Witchcraft is not the only evil, just as evil does not account for all of morality. Basu’s example of racial hatred in Germany shows morality as a modality of social action generating personal illness, collective suspicion and distrust, and an atmosphere of injustice. This supports my emphasis on the adjectival quality of moral action and moral interpretation rather than on a nominal morality, and on moral experience rather than on the structure of a moral code. Her interpretive polarity between police and immigrants might also be seen as a triangular one, including the violent right-wing xenophobes as moral actors, if there can be a morality of hatred. A practical contribution of evil as an analytic category in such an instance may be to help preserve cultural relativism while avoiding moral relativism.<br>

Author(s): Fisher Cass<br>
Abstract: The treatment of the ancient and modern examples is also somewhat too neat and overly selective. For example, it is definitely appropriate to analyze the relationship between theory and practice in rabbinic Judaism on the basis of Hadot’s analysis of ancient philosophy. But Fisher should have reflected on the interplay of theory and praxis in rabbinic Judaism in light of the Aristotelian tradition, which is utterly and consistently ignored in this book. Similarly, Fisher admits that his analysis of
      Mekhihta of Rabbi Yishmaelis indebted to Max Kadushin’s insightful presentation of rabbinic Judaism as “organismic” system of value concepts (105), but Fisher does not analyze the philosophical basis of Kadushin’s reading, as does Peter Ochs, whose book is cited in the notes but whose analysis is not engaged. The treatment of Rosenzweig also exhibits a penchant for selectivity. To show how his model of Jewish theological practice applies to contemporary debates about Rosenzweig and therefore to contemporary Jewish theology, Fisher singles out two interpreters: Leora Batnitzky (whose interpretation he finds “idiosyncratic” [163]) and Peter Gordon (who is accused of “grossly distor[ting] Rosenzweig’s point” [166]). While Fisher’s own interpretation of Rosenzweig is most suggestive, whether Jewish theological practice is a viable model cannot be decided by showing the limitations of two interpretations of Rosenzweig to the exclusion of all others.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 674410<br>
Date: 02 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Rüpke Jörg<br>
Abstract: The concept of “religions” itself is one important and problematic consequence of the historical approach sketched above. The units of description might be self-evident from an emic point of view, the internal discourse of a group, frequently adopted by political commentators and journalists, who all might share an interest in clear-cut boundaries, in exclusion of heretics or the inclusion of wavering allies. Varro’s history of religion as embedded in his systematic account of religious practices and beliefs at Rome, in Italy, and in the wider Mediterranean invites one to develop alternative concepts. “Roman religion,” as I hope to have shown, is not without alternatives. The direct coupling of religious identity and historiography of religion (familiar from a tradition of “national history”) in what we might term “confessional historiography” can be countered through the development of alternative and more complex histories of religion.
      
               Of course, every group is entitled to construe itself as the legitimate keeper of a tradition, but it should be the task of scientific history of religion to highlight the selections and exclusions of positions and people implied in such emic histories. Reflecting on the biases and concealments of traditional narratives and historiography of religions and on the history of its analytical and descriptive terms is vital for any history of religion in the twenty-first century.73<br>

Abstract: Exploring this question brings us to one of the great cruxes of the poem—the justice of the serpent’s punishment. The Son says two seemingly contradictory things, telling the Father that “conviction to the serpent none belongs” but describing him to Adam and Eve as “justly then accurst / As vitiated in nature” (10.84, 10.168–69). Obviously aware of the inconsistency, Milton assures us that “More to know / Concerned not Man” (10.169–70). But in inscribing this uncertainty so prominently into his poem, Milton virtually assures that we will seek to know more, whether it concerns us or not. And while he does not provide an answer to the question, Milton does indicate, I believe, the single fine point around which the debate must turn. When the serpentine Satan first prepares to address Eve, we are told:<br>

Author(s): Urbaniak Jakub<br>
Abstract: As I have attempted to show, one of the most valuable and lasting contributions of both Bonhoeffer and Badiou consists in their negative and anti-idolatrous insights. Attentive listening to Bonhoeffer’s critique of religion and Badiou’s reflection on evental grace that escapes the logic of traditional discourses and reflecting on the trajectory of thought indicated by the two of them may help Christian theology to avoid both the universal and specifically contemporary “religious trappings.” Without a doubt, from the Catholic point of view the notions of religionless Christianity and immanent grace are eliciting more questions than answers. At the same time, however, both Bonhoeffer and Badiou make us face the right questions, the questions that are relevant to our contemporary condition. The “world come of age” needs a “Christianity come of age,” a church built on worldly faith in the “resurrection truth-event” that can stand together as a global community, as a site of both contestation and reconciliation.<br>

Author(s): Huth Kimberly<br>
Abstract: Webster’s play, more than any other surveyed here, links the very genre of tragedy to metaphorical thinking. His self-conscious engagement with the genre incorporates both tragic action and tragic reflection or interpretation. That is to say, Webster integrates his own Bradley-like critics into the play itself, making room for both the pessimistic figure of pain and the redemptivist response to it, offering multiple options for affective response to the audience. His universe is one of doubt and uncertainty, and the play seems to be suggesting that metaphor—with all the issues of imprecision and distortion that accompany associative thinking—is an apt cognitive process for facing the tragic world. In the imagery of poison as fire, plays like
      Women, Beware Womenuse association to convey both sensory information and thematic significance. InKing Lear, Shakespeare’s characters speak in metaphors that build on sensory experience to process spiritual truth. But inThe Duchess of Malfi, metaphor becomes, in essence, the only way of knowing because the play continually undermines the veracity of sense perception. Over the course of the play, the Duchess has three children. Numerous characters see her pregnant body, and yet Bosola, employed to spy on her, still must seek further proof that she is with child. At one point, he feeds her unripe apricots, which cause her to go into labor. To conceal her condition and confuse Bosola, a rumor is circulated that she was poisoned—a reinterpretation of her pain that is so effective that even Bosola fears that the apricots might have been poisoned without his knowledge (2.2.31–32).
            And in the final act, the Duchess’s brother the Cardinal is murdered as his guards stand just outside the door, listening to his cries for help. But they had been told by the Cardinal himself that he would “faigne [him]self in danger” (5.4.15), and so they refuse to be taken in by what they think is his counterfeiting.

Abstract: In this book, Adriaan Peperzak, the Arthur J. Schmitt Professor of Philosophy at Loyola University Chicago, reflects broadly on the nature of philosophy, its relation to concrete life, and its rootedness in our encounters with other humans and God. The book covers similar themes as Peperzak’s earlier
      Thinking: From Solitude to Dialogue and Contemplation(New York: Fordham University Press, 2006) and largely collects material previously published or presented. Far from being redundant, however, Peperzak’s metaphilosophy benefits from the essayistic style in which it is presented inThinking about Thinking, and the occasional nature of some of the pieces illustrates Peperzak’s point that philosophy arises out of the commitments and engagements of an individual life.<br>

Issue: jpolitics.68.issue-2<br>
Date: 05 2004<br>
Author(s): Eubanks Cecil<br>
Abstract: This debate eventually focused on the nature of revelation (letters 35–39), with Strauss having written that “there is an essential distinction between the thinking of the Middle ages, based on revelation, and the thinking of classical antiquity, not based on revelation” (78). Voegelin responded that both revelation and reason are part of a universal human knowledge that is understood concretely and experientially. This prompted Strauss to write back that claims of a universal human knowledge must reside in the realm of philosophy and not in Christianity. To understand Plato properly, one should not impose “biblical concepts,” since they are separate from Greek philosophy. Although Strauss and Voegelin did not resolve this debate, it does clarify and present challenges to both thinkers' philosophies: for Voegelin, the claim that the experience of the divine is the foundation of a universal, human knowledge requires some sort of demonstration in order for him to escape what Strauss referred to as “the desert of Kierkegaard's subjectivism” (88); for Strauss, the tension between reason and revelation suggests a permanent condition of human incompleteness that is unable to point to a right way of life, leading one into nihilism.<br>

Abstract: The chapters that follow work out these dynamics in a variety of settings. The word
      investmentis a leitmotif, and she first tracks it through Shakespeare’sHenry IVandHamlet, where it tangles together “clothing, commerce, and religion” (35), preparing us for the deep puns at the heart of the Vestiarian Controversy. Chapters on the metaphoricity of the sacrament and on John Donne treat theological questions and, particularly with Donne, “the danger that I [the critic] will find creative metaphor — the magician’s fictive art — where a Renaissance reader would find an assertion of code” (70). A closely argued chapter on classical rhetoric shows how some English translations of Cicero and Quintilian suggest a sharper distinction between metaphor and catachresis than the Romans were willing to make. The productivity of metaphor, to the point of abuse, is deep in the tradition.<br>

Abstract: Benjamin also notes: “Every present day is determined by the images that are synchronic with it: each ‘now’ is the now of a particular recognizability. In it, truth is charged to the bursting point with time. (This point of explosion, and nothing else, is the death of the
            intentio, which thus coincides with the birth of authentic historical time, the time of truth.) It is not that what is past casts its light on what is present, or what is present its light on what is past; rather, image is that wherein what has been comes together in a flash with the now to form a constellation” (2002, N3,1). The two great related demands made by T. S. Eliot in “Tradition and the Individual Talent” will also be recalled here: his call for the exercise of the “historical sense” as a juxtaposition of significant events from discontinuous times, which in turn produces an “impersonal” (nonintentional) effect. These demands define the representation of history in works such asThe Waste Landand Pound’s early cantos.<br>

Article Title: Poetics of Conspiracy and Hermeneutics of Suspicion in Tacitus's<br>
Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: ca.2013.32.issue-1<br>
Date: 04 2013<br>
Abstract: This article argues that the end of Tacitus's
         Dialogus de Oratoribusis inconclusive in ways that draw attention to the difficulty of interpretation not onlyofthe dialogue, as by modern scholars, but alsointhe dialogue, as by its leading characters. The inconclusiveness is especially marked by a commonly noted, but little discussed, feature of the end: when the rest of the characters laugh at the point of departure, Tacitus himself does not. Arguing that this difference of affective response on the part of the characters prefigures differences in interpretive response on the part of readers, the article identifies different strains in recent scholarship: pessimistic and optimistic. Both forms of response entail an attribution of a “poetics of conspiracy” (Hinds) to the ultimate speaker of the dialogue, the author Tacitus, and a “hermeneutics of suspicion” (Ricoeur) to its reader. At the same time, the author's double-position, as character and author, between narrated event and narration of the event to the reader, suggests that the other characters in the dialogue may, like the author and reader, also exercise such poetics and hermeneutics on one another and themselves. The article ends with thecomparandumof the first satire of Tacitus's near contemporary, Juvenal, suggesting that, in the case of these works that can look with hindsight on the social and political past of the Early Empire, their modes of transmission and reception may be politically determined (e.g., as conspiratorial, suspicious) but may also demonstrate, within the restrictions of social and political determinations, a high degree of contingency, reflexivity, and autonomy. Such possibilities suggest that the text itself is part of a pragmatic and performative tradition of the kind enacted by its characters, in addition to a tradition of the production of (comparatively static and unfree) “literary” works.<br>

Abstract: The capitals on the working drawings demonstrate strong influence from those of the Monument of Lysicrates. However, by the time the office started working on full-size templates, the capital from the Temple of Castor and Pollux must have became a major inspiration. The archive of William Merchant, Maybeck's associate who worked on the project of the Palace of Fine Arts, contains a photograph copy of the plate from d'Espouy showing this version of the Corinthian order (see Environmental Design Archives, UC Berkeley, William G. Merchant/Hans U. Gerson Collection, VI)). It is placed next to photographs of full-size charcoal sketches of the capitals. I made this observation while continuing my research after my dissertation, where I had erroneously suggested that the capitals of the Pantheon in Rome was a starting point of the design for the palace's columns' capitals.<br>

Abstract: The first chapter, “Spatiality,” addresses an age-old problem in the study of Chinese tombs. What factors caused the shift from the pre-Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE) practice of burying the dead in wooden caskets set within deep vertical pits to the Han and post-Han preference for constructing chambered tombs positioned along a horizontal axis? Because in casket tombs the objects, not the architectonic space, give the tomb meaning, Wu reconceptualizes this transition as moving from an “object-oriented” to a “space-oriented” design, during which time tombs underwent a process of “architecturalization” (32). He attributes the shift to major changes in ancestral worship, conceptions of the soul and the afterlife, and the establishment of an underworld bureaucracy that occurred in or just before the Han. To this point, Wu informs us that whereas in pre-Han times immortality was equated with deathlessness, in the Han period immortality after death was believed possible. As a consequence, tombs were decorated with images of the home, the heavens, and the world of the immortals, thereby embodying “polycentric” spaces that offered the dead a rich variety of realms to inhabit (221).<br>

Article Title: Responsibility and Crime in Literature<br>
Publisher: Sage Publications<br>
Issue: i243092<br>
Date: 1 1, 1976<br>
Author(s): Morris Robert J.<br>
Abstract: Accountability for one's actions has been a major theme that literary artists have grappled with over the centuries. Among the works in which it plays a significant role, and which are here analyzed, are the Oedipus trilogy, Hamlet, The Brothers Karamazov, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, The Trial, The Stranger, and three twentieth-century American novels: An American Tragedy, Light in August, and Native Son. Insights into the dark recesses of the human mind, which can complement the insights of legal philosophers and social scientists, are revealed in these and other works. They point to an argument that prophesy is not immutable destiny and that social causation is not social determinism. The human being achieves freedom by acceptance of responsibility, each man for his own acts, each woman for hers.<br>

Article Title: Formal Fascinations and Nagging Excerpts: The Challenge of the Arts to Curriculum and Inquiry<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers, Inc.<br>
Issue: i250466<br>
Date: 4 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): White Marcy Singer<br>
Abstract: This article examines challenges to discourses of curriculum research and practice by the growing fascination with alternative forms of representation. The author takes as a starting point a cluster of exchanges with students that were situated in a study of a classroom in which music and image joined word and number as essential sources for learning about a context irreducibly distant from students' own: the past. In the study, what seemed to make painting, photography, film, and poetry potent sources of understanding was their capacity to bridge the gap between a remote, textbook past, and the sensory world of the students' present; these forms expressed to students not only the outline of events, but also what the events signified and felt like. Yet, in juxtaposing students' comments against discourses of historiography, philosophical aesthetics, and history teaching and learning, one soon recognizes that the very ability of the arts to communicate a sense of immediacy and human intention is what makes them problematic as sources of historical insight: in pushing out the boundaries of "acceptable" forms beyond discursive text, one also pushes up against assumptions about the nature and purposes of knowledge and inquiry. While the starting point of this article is historical inquiry, the author argues that the difficulties of representing experiences of persons in contexts removed in time or space, and of making sense of others' representations, are relevant to other forms of inquiry; the challenge of the arts to historical inquiry is paralleled in other fields, and no less in educational research.<br>

Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263715<br>
Date: 3 1, 1970<br>
Author(s): Windisch William A.<br>
Abstract: Considered rhetorically, or by phenomenological-literary analysis, the saying about finding one's life by losing it intends to break up the continuity of existence of the hearer to the extent that he or she is left without a frame of reference. Considered from a historical-literary point of view, however, the saying occurs in an environment and presupposes a context which gives meaning to the response. A Whiteheadian or process perspective of interpretation offers an approach which can relate these two types of understanding of the saying, and can also cast light on contemporary styles of interpretation with their ontological presuppositions, either to set the saying in a framework of "rightness" or in one of "creativity."<br>

Article Title: The Self beyond Itself: Hermeneutics and Transpersonal Experience<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263716<br>
Date: 6 1, 1930<br>
Author(s): Underhill David R.<br>
Abstract: This essay examines, from the point of view of an existential hermeneutics, five accounts of transpersonal experience: Robert Monroe's Journeys Out of the Body, Paul's experience in the third heaven in II Corinthians 12, a description of rapture by Teresa of Avila, a disembodied vision of guardian spirits by John Lilly from The Center of the Cyclone, and the vision of the assault of the Lords of the Dead from the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Through a consideration of world, embodiment, death, care and other existential categories, the discussion in each case focuses on a central ambiguity about the personal identity of the narrator. The question of authenticity, in a Heideggerian sense, is posed to these materials, and the central ambiguity is shown to strike so deeply as to undercut the assumption of autonomy as the criterion of authenticity. Being-toward-death is relativized in such experiences, but relativized by an even more radical threat to individual existence. In conclusion, some generalized principles are offered as heuristic criteria for interpreting transpersonal experience in general.<br>

Article Title: The First Evil Will Must Be Incomprehensible: A Critique of Augustine<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263713<br>
Date: 9 1, 1970<br>
Author(s): Teselle Robert F.<br>
Abstract: The thesis of this paper is that an absolute origin of evil, arising from the free will of a creature, must be incomprehensible. Although Augustine occasionally acknowledges this point, nevertheless in a number of better-known passages (chiefly in The City of God) he attempts to give a causal account of the fall of Adam and/or Satan. Much of the subsequent Christian tradition has unfortunately followed his lead, and major recent commentators routinely ignore or passively approve of his conceptual error. Augustine offers three unacceptable explanations of the fall, which conflict variously with his own doctrines of divine omnipotence, the goodness of creation, and creaturely free will and responsibility, as well as violating the canons of sound argumentation and explanation. First, his contention that free creatures made "out of nothing" inevitably fall makes the fall seem ontologically necessary (unfree) and thereby lays the ultimate responsibility for it on the Creator. Second, the appeal to pride as an explanation is a spurious causal account, for "pride" is only a synonym for "fallenness" itself and not a possible antecedent condition in a being created good and not yet fallen. Finally, his assertion that the first sin is intrinsically comprehensible, but not comprehensible to us because we are fallen, is an obfuscation masquerading as an explanation, for we have no warrant for supposing that this assertion is true or even meaningful. Instead of seeking causal explanation Augustine should have stayed with his own wiser observation that an evil will has no efficient cause. Theology of the Augustinian sort (which comprises much of the Christian tradition) ought to concede that the fall as a work of genuine freedom is an absurd "fact," an incomprehensible given which steadfastly and in principle resists causal explanation. The concluding section of the paper draws upon Ricoeur's insights to tell why the narrative structure of the "Adamic myth" (which has important p~<br>

Abstract: According to a school of thought that has been gaining ground for about a century, the social sciences are best conceived as styles of humanistic inquiry akin to hermeneutics rather than as branches of naturalistic inquiry paralleling the natural or physical sciences. In the past decade or so, advocates of this position have been active in providing critiques of educational research. It is argued that, although the case has some merit, the prognosis is mistaken--traditional naturalistic inquiry in education and the social sciences will continue to have an important and strong role. /// D'après une école de pensée qui gagne du terrain depuis environ un siècle, les sciences sociales devraient être considérées comme des enquêtes humanistes apparentées à l'herméneutique plutôt que comme des disciplines cherchant à comprendre la nature des choses comme le font les sciences naturelles. Au cours de la dernière décennie, les partisans de ce point de vue ont multiplié leurs critiques à l'endroit de la recherche en éducation. On affirme que, même si ce point de vue est valable à certains égards, le pronostic donné est erroné: les recherches en éducation cherchant à élucider la nature même de son objet d'étude et les sciences sociales continueront à jouer un rôle clé. /// Eine geistige Richtung, die sich seit etwa einem Jahrhundert stärker durchsetzt, sieht die Socialwissenschaften am ehesten als Arten humanistischer Untersuchung, die mit der Hermeneutik verwandt sind, denn als Zweige der naturalistischen Untersuchung, die den Natur- oder Physik-Wissenschaften gleichen. In den letzten zehn Jahren etwa waren Vertreter dieser Schule aktiv damit beschäftig, kritische Abhandlungen über erziehungswissenschaftliche Forschung vorzubringen. Es wird argumentiert, daß die gestellte Prognose falsch ist, wenngleich die Sache einen gewissen Wert hat--traditionelle naturalistiche Forschung in den Erziehungs--und Sozialwissenschaften wird weiterhin eine wichtige und starke Rolle spielen. ///~<br>

Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishing<br>
Issue: i20010363<br>
Date: 1 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Peters Gary<br>
Abstract: This essay is concerned with an initial mapping out of a model of intersubjectivity that, viewed within the context of education, breaks with the hegemonic dialogics of current pedagogies. Intent on rethinking the (so-called) "problem" of solipsism for phenomenology in terms of a pedagogy that situates itself within solitude and the alterity of self and other, Maurice Blanchot and Emmanuel Levinas will here speak as the voices of this other mode of teaching. Beginning with the problematization of intersubjectivity in romantic aesthetics and hermeneutics, I introduce the concept of irony as a crucial element in the conceptualization of this other pedagogical model, one that requires, initially, a discussion of Husserl's response to the charge of solipsism in the 5th Cartesian Meditation. As a starting point I introduce his symmetrical notion of bodily "pairing" into a consideration of rhetoric, understood here as an integral part of teaching, thus forging links with phenomenology via the work of Merleau-Ponty. The above provides a context for an extended discussion of pedagogy as it appears in the work of Blanchot and Levinas. Although similar in many respects, on closer inspection it will emerge that important differences are evident in the dissymmetrical and asymmetrical models suggested by the two thinkers respectively. These differences, I will argue, begin to open up a critical perspective on Levinas' "height" model of teaching in the name of the more radical configuration of phenomenology and rhetoric to be found in Blanchot.<br>

Abstract: Academia's mathematical metaphysics are briefly explored en route to an elaboration of the qualitatively rigorous requirements underpinning the calibration and unambiguous interpretation of quantitative instrumentation in any science. Of particular interest are Gadamer's emphases on number as the paradigm of the noetic, on the role of play in interpretation, and on Hegel's sense of method as the activity of the thing itself that thought experiences. These point toward and overlap with (1) Latour's study of the metrological social networks through which technological phenomena are brought into language as modes of being that can be understood, and (2) the way that Rasch's models for measurement comprise a potential beginning for metaphysically astute, qualitatively and quantitatively integrated, mathematical methods in the social sciences. The paper closes with observations on the general problem that is philosophy, the need to remain open to multiplicities of meaning even as clear understandings are sought and obtained.<br>

Abstract: ¿Cómo estudiar las experiencias sociales cuyas demandas escapan de los canales político-institucionales? Para llevar adelante este tipo de investigaciones, se encuentran coordenadas interesantes en el estudio del proceso sociopolítico y la subpolítica. Se desarrollan los niveles y las dimensiones con las que identificar e indagar lo sociopolítico. Así, aludimos tanto a las emociones como a los recursos culturales y simbólicos con los que construimos un modelo de análisis para dichas investigaciones. Esta perspectiva compara las maneras de explicar la aparición de las experiencias sociales a partir de la espontaneidad. El "cacerolazo" y las asambleas barriales ocurridos en la Argentina se constituyen en la experiencia social a partir de la cual poder reflexionar sobre tales cuestiones. /// How to study social experiences whose demands do not run through the political institutional channels? So as to put forward this kind of research, there are available interesting coordinates in the socio-political process and subpolitics. Levels and dimensions with which to identify and probe into the socio-political are developed. So, we refer both to the emotions as well as to the cultural and symbolic resources with which we construct a model of analysis to carry out such research. This approach confronts the ways to explain the emergence of social experiences taking spontaneity as a point of departure. The "cacerolazo" and the asambleas barriales which took place in Argentina make up the social experience from which we can reflect on such questions.<br>

mances of History, Ithaca-London, Cornell University Press, 1988. Dice Petrey: "As exempli-
fied in S/Z, the critical debate on realism posits a dichotomy between radical indeterminacy and
complete certainty. Textual meaning is either guaranteed by an extratextual referent to be fixed,
stable, and unquestionable or detached from every extratextual presence to become shifting,
ephemeral, and unknowable. From the point of view of such critics as Lukács, realism repre-
sents a world ontologically independent of the terms in which it is represented; for Barthes and
Johnson, ontological independence is a myth concealing the fact that representation can never
depict anything except its own artifices", p. 55.<br>

Abstract: At its most a typical sports narrative records what happens in space and time. Alongside this traditional history of events there has emerged a research approach that might be called structural sports history. Its methods move in the world under the surface of facts, explored by researchers in ways that resemble archaeology. The aim is to uncover the changed human relationships and new forms of presence in sport-figurations of corporeality, space and time. Where the event-history approach recounts and recapitulates, the new approach works towards interpretation and understanding. These two are joined by yet a third element, the most intimate aspect of sports narratives: microhistory and the routes that it opens to the interfaces between the public and the private and the general and the particular, where the reader-oriented focus of the experiencing and narrating subject is necessarily foregrounded and at this point surface such elements of narrativity as the "confessional", the "meditative" and the "fragmentary" (auto)biography. The article describes different levels of a sports narrative and their conventions in qualitative sports research.<br>

Abstract: Consacré à la section de L'Étoile intitulée « Le nom propre », cet article fait aussi ressortir l'influence sur Rosenzweig, à côté de Luther, de Samson Rafael Hirsch, dans sa traduction et son commentaire du Pentateuque. « L'appel du nom propre » de Rosenzweig sert ensuite de base à une réflexion sur la notion de « devoir de mémoire »: toujours adressé à quelqu'un, jamais abstraitement universel, ce devoir est également de nature éthique, c'est-à-dire politique. Centered upon the section of The Star… entitled « The proper name », this paper also brings out the influence upon Rosenzweig of Samson Rafael Hirsch, in his translation and commentary of the Pentateuch. Rosenzweig's « Call of the proper name » is then used as a point of departure for reflecting upon the « duty to remember »: this duty, which is always turned towards a singularity and never abstractly universal, also is ethical in nature, i.e., political.<br>

Abstract: The works of Tiryakian, Bruyn and Douglas are examined as representative of "phenomenological sociology." Radical problems are discovered in their use of key concepts in phenomenology: intention, reduction, phenomenon and essence. These problems are shown to arise out of a failure to grasp the nature of the phenomenological enterprise and its relationship to sociology. Turning back to the original formulation of this relationship by Husserl, we discover problems of transcendental intersubjectivity, of type and essence, and of objectivism. We then point out the existence of sociologies which do not share the shortcomings of what is called phenomenological sociology, yet which make use of the perspective and approach of phenomenology. We then focus on one of these sociologies, ethnomethodology in its relation to phenomenology. We find parallels in their methodology and domains of inquiry, and divergency in their approaches to intersubjectivity.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur distills this point well: "When we discover that there are
several cultures instead of just one and consequently at the time when we acknowledge
the end of a sort of cultural monopoly, be it illusory or real, we are threatened with the
destruction of our own discovery. Suddenly it becomes possible that there are just
others, that we ourselves are an 'other' among others" (History and Truth [Evanston,
Ill., 1965], p. 278).

Abstract: The Phenomenology says that every knowledge is a perspective knowledge, because every knowledge is situated in a time and in a space. The human's embodiment discloses a perspective overview on the world. The paper claims the aim to analyze how the sexual and gender dimensions, which are incarnated in a determinate body, are present in the qualitative research, specifically into the ethnographic observation. First for all, we hypothesize that the gender is a border for the access into a field and not in other, so to be man or woman is not neutral for the knowledge of a specific social context. Moreover, the performative dimension of the gender, which shows the norms that pre-exist and that conduct the role's interaction (i.e. the role's gendered content and the role's gendered language) is another tie in the participant observation. The awareness that all the knowledge is gendered, requires to the fieldworker to play a double competence (ability). The researcher must use the self reflexivity to point out his gender identity and his background on this theme: he must point out his background frame relatively to the gender, his gender behaviour's expectations in the interaction, and his correlated opinions. The researcher, moreover, must know that exist a cultural mainstream about the gender, but that the concrete gender playing is based on the interaction in a concrete frame. So, we have a lot of concrete ways in which the gender is embodied. The researcher on the field, so, must enter in a knowledge's circulation in which must point attention to: the epistemic interdependence, i.e. the knowledge borns in the symbolic interaction between the researcher and the subject; the gendered nature of the communicative interaction between the researcher and the subject; the negotiable nature of the concrete managing of the gendered role in the interaction.<br>

Abstract: La critique zolienne se situe « au confluent de Sainte-Beuve et de Taine », comme sa création littéraire a pour point de mire Balzac et Hugo. L'objectif de cette étude est d'apprécier la double influence des deux grands maîtres de la critique du XIX e siècle dans la naissance et le développement des théories du chef de file du naturalisme. La dette envers Taine est énorme, notamment, mais Zola est un disciple encombrant et insatisfait. Son activité critique, longtemps méconnue et réduite à des aperçus superficiels, même si elle est animée d'une fougue polémique, obéit à des principes, qu'il convient de dégager et d'examiner de près: c'est une poétique expérimentale, héritière des théories en vigueur, revisitant la question de la mimèsis, et, paradoxalement, un système ouvert, soucieux de frayer la voie à la modernité et de maintenir à leur plus haut niveau les fonctions et les pouvoirs de la littérature.<br>

Abstract: I argue that the aporetic character of clemency must be understood in terms of its unmerited and merited character to achieve the underlying purposes of justice within criminal justice: justice as fairness (punishment must be deserved and proportionate) and justice as restoration (repair of the harm to victims and society and the reintegration of offenders) are paramount goals. Rather than destabilizing political order, pardons can render productive potential tensions between justice as fairness and justice as restoration. Taking as my conceptual point of departure Paul Ricoeur's claims about the suprajuridical and supraethical character of pardon, I develop the argument through three central sections: an excursus into historical and contemporary practices of clemency in the United States; a critical analysis of the merited and unmerited aspects of clemency with respect to remorse and atonement theories within theological and legal discourse; and a normative engagement with pardons and felony disenfranchisement.<br>

Abstract: What role do emotions play in the way in which young people confront the history of the Holocaust? This article examines memorial sites and video interviews of survivors as interfaces of the representation and appropriation of the past. These contact zones satisfy the need for emotional participation and for information. Videos uploaded by youngsters on the internet following their visit to memorial sites, and short films extracted by pupils from survivor's video interviews, were used as examples in order to examine emotional strategies. These products of involvement point to stored images and ideas mediated by mass media. This repertoire of cultural knowledge and feelings can serve as a template for understanding how young people process the Holocaust emotionally.<br>

Abstract: A theory of the moral subject of cooperative relations proceeds from a different point of departure than a formalistic ethics based on individualism and rationalism. Shweder (Merrill-Palmer Quarterly, 1982, 28, 41–69) fails to see that, in this theory, persons communicate in order to co-construct knowledge and to maintain and promote mutual respect. Moral principles are, thus, cooperatively generated because validity is grounded in the structure of reciprocal relations.<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in con~<br>

Abstract: How do children conceptualise their own development? From their point of view, what serve as constraints for their movements in time and space? The theoretical framework of the experiment described here was a cultural historical first person developmental perspective. The concept of transition is here put in use to capture the children's experience of their movements with or against a dynamic, inviting and demanding socio-cultural landscape over time. An interpretation of children's experience of their developmental timing with temporalities of the childhood landscape is presented. Comment les enfants conceptualisent-ils leur propre développement? De leur point de vue, qu'est-ce qui contraint leurs mouvements dans l'espace et dans le temps? Le cadre théorique de la recherche décrite ici est une perspective historico-culturelle, développementale et à la première personne. Le concept de transition est utilisé pour mettre en évidence l'expérience que les enfants ont de leurs mouvements, allant avec, ou à l'encontre de leur environnement socioculturel et temporel, lequel est à la fois dynamique, invitant et exigeant. Une interprétation de l'expérience que les enfants ont de la temporalité de leur propre développement est présentée en rapport avec les temporalités caractérisant l'environnement de l'enfance.<br>

Abstract: En este artículo se analiza el trabajo de Natalie Z. Davis a partir de su compromiso con la historia de las mujeres. Una historia de las mujeres que la historiadora construye de la mano de una historia social renovada que, sin renunciar a una tradición que contempla el conflicto como motor de cambio, encuentra bajo la variopinta red de pertenencias sociales, rasgos identitarios que intervienen la relación individuo-grupo. Los espacios de poder y de disidencias se entrecruzan en el día a día, en el trabajo, el ocio, o los ámbitos de sociabilidad. En todos ellos, hombres y mujeres interactúan; hijos de una cultura común que tiende a definirlos en relación, pero en la que encuentran elementos suficientes para significar sus propios mundos. Using her commitment to women's history as a starting point, this article analyses the work of Natalie Z. Davis. This particular study of women's history that the historian makes in a renewed social history which without giving up on a tradition which has always used the conflict as a way to evolve, also finds identity traits that influence the relationship between the individual and his group in a variety of social issues. The spaces of power and dissidences intertwine in the day to day, in the workplace, in free time, or in areas of sociability. In all of these, men and women interact; as descendants of a common culture which tends to define them as one, but in which they finally find enough principles to define their own worlds.<br>

את... has a specific meaning.... As a result, Akiba became the foremost champion of
eisegesis,while other scholars tried to stay (somewhat) closer to the actual meaning of the text,
as did R. Yishmael who maintained דברה תורה כלשון בני אדם.... From the scientific point of view
Ishmael was right, but Akiba's point of view was more useful and mostly prevailed."<br>

Abstract: This essay advocates applying a "narrative" conception of the individual self to the problem of "collective responsibility." Participants in the debate agree that groups are composed of individuals and that group responsibility must somehow mimic individual responsibility. However, participants do not begin from a neutral and unproblematic conception of the individual. So far, most participants have assumed standard models of the individual that may unduly bias their conclusions about different forms of group responsibility. I argue that switching to a "narrative" conception may provide a more comprehensive and therefore preferable starting point for considering questions of group responsibility.<br>

Abstract: The relationship between Sören Kierkegaard and Johann Gottlieb Fichte has been a desideratum of philosophical inquiry for a considerable time. And this for two reasons: firstly, we do not know enough about Kierkegaard's relationship to German idealism, as long as we limit ourselves to the relationship of Kierkegaard-Hegel or Kierkegaard-Schelling. Secondly, there are quite a number of publications, which see in Fichte the most noteworthly intellectual relationship to Kierkegaard within the framework of idealism. It is necessary therefore to raise the following questions: what can we determine from the texts and historical material, which we possess, about Kierkegaard's relationship to Fichte? Is the opinion justified that Fichte is intellectually related to Kierkegaard? The present article's research gives the following answers to these questions: historically speaking there are again and again texts in which Kierkegaard relates to Fichte. Particulary for the early years, a certain occupation with him cannot be denied. As a matter of fact a whole series of formal agreements cannot be overlooked. Nevertheless there can be no question of a real meeting of minds. Fichte was merely an occasion for Kierkegaard to form his own philosophy, in no way however an intellectual partner. This historical result in no way excludes the possibility of comparing Kierkegaard and Fichte on the same intellectual level. Seen from this point of view there is actually a certain reason in establishing an intellectual relationship in the secondary literature. But nevertheless the differences outweigh the agreements. This can not only be ascertained fundamentally insofar as both come from a completely different understanding of reality, but also as regards their concept of subjectivity. Especially, as far as the structures, which ascertain the self-realization of the subjectivity, are concerned, the differences are particulary noticeable. With this result one does not however intend to say, t~<br>

Abstract: Going beyond the passing theological fashions, the article seeks to show the relevance of "narrative theology". It first illustrates its doctrinal foundation in the many narratives which provide the frame-work for the biblical books, in the narrative of the Creed itself, in the ancient theologies of salvation history, down to the rediscovery of "narrativity" in contemporary theology. It then seeks to throw light on the philosophical foundation of narrative theology relying on Gaston Fessard's reflexion on three histories, natural, human and supernatural, and of Paul Ricoeur on Temps et récit (Time and Narrative), history and narrative, narrative and freedom. It ends up with a pastoral anthropology of narrative which seeks the link and meeting-point between the narrative of salvation and our own stories.<br>

Abstract: Today, bioethical themes are no longer the exclusive patrimony of university classrooms. Everyone is talking about them; "secular" and "catholics" alike. Catholics are often accused of imposing a "confessional" point of view. This article wishes to clarify this point given its importance in themes regarding the life and death of man, such as: artificial fecundation, abortion, cloning, brain death, organ transplants, and euthanasia. The article is based on a philosophical reflection starting with anthropological considerations. The extensive number of themes does not allow taking all of them into consideration. Thus the article adheres to the following outline: 1. Establish the epistemological bases for a rational discourse based on universal premises, with particular reference to artificial fecundation and the nature of human sexuality. 2. Analize the "human nature" condition of the embryo, of the physically and mentally disabled, of the terminally ill, and their status as "human persons"; this discourse is founded on the ontological status of the human body. 3. Present the value of the human body as a psycho-biological unity, which constitutes man's substantial unity. 4. We call this psycho-biological unity "person": "corpore et anima unus"; an individual subject with a rational nature, with its own singularity and oneness. The person has an absolute value, therefore cloning, even for "therapeutic reasons", is contrary to its ontological status. 5. From the consideration that a "person is", while a "personality becomes", we can explain how the person develops and matures his biological and spiritual capacities, without incurring changes in his ontological status. 6. The psycho-biological unity of the human person (corpore et anima unus) is at the basis of death in man, a unique reality. In analysing "human death" we should avoid two reductions: a biological reduction which curtails death to physical-biological processes and events (medical diagnosis of brain death)~<br>

Abstract: Jean Ladrière, professeur à l'Université Catholique de Louvain, a développé une réflexion consacrée à la distinction et aux relations de la science et de la philosophie au point de vue épistémologique et ontologique, c'est-à-dire de la vérité. L'article parcourt trois de ses textes, écrits au long d'un demi siècle. La phénoménologie anime de plus en plus la réflexion, lui permettant de recentrer la dynamique de la science en un projet fondamental. Les vérités scientifiques et leur relativité historique sont à comprendre intérieurement à la pratique de la science, dont le philosophe médite le sens en prenant la responsabilité d'en révéler la vérité. L'évolution de la pensée de Ladrière illustre l'évolution de l'université de Louvain qui, fleuron du thomisme restauré par Léon XIII, s'est orienté de plus en plus vers la phénoménologie à l'époque de l'enseignement de notre auteur. Jean Ladrière, professor at the Catholic University of Louvain, developed a reflection on the distinction and relations between science and philosophy from the point of view of epistemology and ontology, i. e. from the point of view of truth. The article considers three of his texts, which span a 50-year period. The increasing influence of phenomenology on his reflection allows Ladrière to re-locate the dynamic of science in a fundamental project. The truths of science, and their historic relativity, are to be understood as belonging within the practice of science, while it is the task of philosophy to reflect on its meaning, by revealing its truth. The evolution of Ladrière's thought illustrates the evolution of the university of Louvain, which, from being a centre of the Thomism which was reinstated under Leo XIII, adopted a progressively more phenomenological orientation during our author's time as a teacher there.<br>

Abstract: Depuis 1996, les chômeurs qui ont adopté le nom de piqueteros sont devenus un nouvel acteur, particulièrement perturbateur, du scénario politique et social argentin. Le point de départ de cet article porte sur les conditions qui ont permis la constitution des organisations de chômeurs. La première partie analyse les courants principaux du mouvement piquetero, ses différentes matrices politiques et idéologiques, le rapport qu'il établit avec l'État et l'institutionnalisation des programmes sociaux. La deuxième partie étudie les éléments communs qui constituent l'espace piquetero. Enfin, l'article fait le point sur les difficultés actuelles du mouvement. Since 1996, the unemployed who have adopted the name of piqueteros have become a new and particularly perturbing actor on the Argentinean political scene. This article examines the conditions which have brought about the constitution of the unemployed into organisations. The first part analyses the principal currents of the piquetero movement, its different political and ideological matrices, the relationships it establishes with the State and the institutionalisation of social programmes. The second part studies the common elements which constitute the piquetero space. Finally, the article assesses the current difficulties of the movement.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo consiste numa análise da noção zubiriana de mentalidade. Começa por descrever a razão como busca para descobrir a estrutura da realidade. Esta busca requer um método que inclua um sistema de referência, que é o seu ponto de partida no sentido de sugerir hipóteses e teorias que expliquem a realidade. O sistema de referência deriva da transformação do campo de realidade. Esta transformação, que não segue uma via única, depende da "mentalidade" dos que procuram a realidade profunda. Em Zubiri, o conceito de "mentalidade" é polissémico. Existe uma "mentalidade estrutural e intrínseca", uma "mentalidade situacional extrínseca" e um "horizonte mental". Neste artigo estudam-se as três mentalidades e a sua relevância na constituição do sistema de referência e na elaboração de hipóteses e teorias. Finalmente, o artigo analisa a relevância destas mentalidades para compreender os contributos da investigação interdisciplinar e os seus desafios. The following paper is an analysis of Zubiri's notion of mentality. It starts by describing reason as a quest to uncover the structure of reality. This quest requires a method that includes a system of reference, which is its point of departure in the sense of suggesting hypotheses and theories that explain reality. The system of reference results from a transformation of the field of reality. This transformation, which does not follow a unique path, depends on the "mentality" of those who seek to deepen reality. In Zubiri the concept "mentality" is polysemic. There is a "structural and intrinsic mentality", an "extrinsic situational mentality" and a "mental horizon". The three of them and their relevance in the constitution of the system of reference and the elaboration of hypotheses and theories are studied. Finally the paper analyzes the relevance of these mentalities to understand the contributions of interdisciplinary research and its challenges.<br>

Abstract: This article critically revisits the Foucauldian perspective on modernity by exploring the constitutive importance of limits of transparency in relations of power and knowledge. It differentiates between Foucault's Panopticon as a model for modernity, which posits a total visibility of subject under modern gaze, and what I call cybernetic ways of knowing that posit the 'black box' of the inner self that is blocked from visibility. The case in point is a comparative study of two anthropologies — two groups of anthropological cadres — the American anthropologists who in the 1940s were involved in emerging Soviet studies, and Soviet anthropologists of the 1920s and 1930s who took part in Soviet reforms. The article draws attention to similarities in their perspective of images and notions of the enemy: the 'enemy of the people' within Soviet society and the Soviet society as the West's Cold War enemy. In doing so, the aim of this article is to develop an ethnographic perspective on state socialism that does not depend on a foundational dualist distinction between 'Soviet' and 'Western' or 'socialist' and 'capitalist' modernity as a starting point.<br>

Abstract: Abordaremos a autobiografia de Malcolm X (1925-1965) sob o prisma de uma hermenêutica do testemunho: ao aplicar a hermenêutica do testemunho na referida autobiografia, identificaremos as duas profundas transformações psicológicas e espirituais sofridas por Malcolm X, transformações indissociáveis de uma mudança na sua relação com a transcendência, o Islamismo e a comunidade afro-americana do seu tempo. Trata-se, em última análise, de percorrer a evolução de uma consciência humana que se cumpre e se manifesta na religiosidade (não-violência) e no testemunho. Neste estudo, o rito aparecerá como "passagem" no contexto da (re-)integração e (re)educação segundo o modelo da adoração (Mestre/discípulo), mediada pelo desejo mimético, cuja função é purgativa e fundacional porque reorientadora da existência do discípulo. O rito será visto ainda como "sinal da aceitação do testemunho". No contexto de testemunho, extrairemos ainda uma noção de coragem, integrante de noções contemporâneas. We will approach the autobiography of Malcolm X (1925-1965) from the point of view of a hermeneutics of testimony: on applying the hermeneutics of testimony in the said autobiography, we will identify the two deep psychological and spiritual transformations suffered by Malcolm X, transformations that can't be separated from a change in his relationship with the transcendence; the Islamism and the African American community of his time, being, ultimately, the go through of the evolution of human consciousness that meets and manifests itself in religion (non-violence) and witness. In this study, the rite will appear as "passage" in the context of (re-) integration and (re-)education according to the model of worship (master/disciple), taking part in the mimetic desire, whose function is purgative and functional because reorienting the existence of the disciple, the rite is still seen as "a sign of acceptance of the witness." Even in the context of testimony, we will demonstrate a sense of courag~<br>

Abstract: Cet article traite d'une part de la question de l'intersubjectivité — au sens merleau-pontien — dans le processus de la recherche, d'autre part des relations entre critique littéraire et histoire des sciences et des idées. L'examen de ma dette intellectuelle envers Gérard Simon conduira à l'analyse de la question de l'optique chez Marcel Proust, et tout particulièrement au décryptage des rapports, à première vue dépassés à son époque, qu'il établit entre regard et rayon visuel. The first part of this article deals with intersubjectivity and how I became interested in research from a Merleau-Pontian point of view. Part two explores the relationship between literary studies and the history of science and ideas. Indeed, I shall analyze the intellectual influence Gérard Simon had on my work, which then led me to a study of optics in Marcel Proust. I focus on the boundaries he draws between sight and visual ray, a distinction which, on a surface level, might appear to be outdated in his time.<br>

Abstract: Two visions of homicide, murderers and victims are contrasted. One, conventional in criminology, has it that murders are the culmination of drawn-out, acrimonious transactions occurring within demographically homogeneous sectors of the population. It leads to a blurring of moral identities and causal relations. The other is championed by homicide 'survivors' organizations, and it claims an existentially validated authority. Homicide is experienced by 'survivors' as a chaotic episode which gives way to strong, antagonistic archetypes of victim and offender. The two visions are examined, in part, to promote an appreciation of the analytic complexities of the phenomenon of murder; in part, to point to the fraught politics that are beginning to emerge around resolving the character of murder.<br>

Abstract: »Die räumlichen und zeitlichen Schichten der Globalgeschichte: Überlegungen zu einer globalen Begriffsgeschichte anhand der Ausweitung von Reinhart Kosellecks Zeitschichten in globale Räume«. Recent debates on global history have challenged the understanding of history beyond the nation-state. Simultaneously, they search for non-Eurocentric approaches. This has repercussions on the relation between historical space and time in both historical interpretation and in research design. This article reflects on the possibilities of a global conceptual history by expanding Reinhart Koselleck's theory of temporal layers (Zeitschichten) into global spaces. To this end, it introduces the notion of spatial layers (Raumschichten). First, historicisation and its relation to and interaction with spatialisation and temporalisation is pondered; then, the impact of global spatial and temporal complexities on comparative and conceptual history is considered, before, thirdly, a framework of three tensions of global history - normative, temporal and spatial - is introduced as a way to concretely unfold historical research questions through global conceptual history. Regarding time and space, the main lines of argument in global history have focused either on the question of whether or not European powers were ahead of non-European ones or on the supposedly Western linearity of time as opposed to a non-Western cosmology or circularity of time. Taking its point of departure in Zeitschichten, which break from the linear-vs.-circular logic, this article instead proposes to foreground an actor-based, multi-lingual, global conceptual history to better understand spatio-temporal practices.<br>

Abstract: The nineteen-nineties saw the so-called "deliberative turn in democracy", which was taken up by a large number of democracy theorists. This paper sets out: 1) to analyse why this turn took place; 2) to classify the different proposals of deliberative democracy into two models (D1 and D2), in view of their epistemological effectiveness (model D1 assumes the pattern of Rawls' political liberalism, and model D2, Habermas'Theory of Discourse); 3) to display the superiority of D2 over D1; 4) to point out certain shortcomings in Habermas' deliberative-discursive politics and to propose a model of democracy which will enable these to be improved on, to be known as "communicative democracy".<br>

Date: 1 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Dédeyan Daniel<br>
Abstract: Departing from the disconcerting tact that the only passage where Kant mentions court practice is in a chapter on art, the essay undertakes a reconstruction of Kant's esthetics. As to beauty, the judgment of taste appears as a judgment on the ability to judge, and it is universally valid not because it is true, but because it is communicable. Kant's notion of art turns out to be the autonomous discourse of taste as his notion of morality stands for autonomy of man and his notion of law for autonomy of civil society. However, Kant's esthetical experience of the sublime as appearance of what neither mind nor senses grasp breaks up harmony and autonomy and unjudges judgment. At this point, the essay uncovers an intrinsically destabilizing force of Kant's ‚reason‘, traces the consequences for the judicial judgment and gives a perspective to philosophy of law within a differentiated society.<br>

Abstract: Situé au nord ouest de la Chine et base de la guérilla communiste avant même l'arrivée de Mao Zédong en 1935, Yan'an a longtemps constitué, officiellement du moins, l'instant de pureté morale de la révolution chinoise. Les événements de la place Tiananmen en juin 1989, moment certes éphémère, ont définitivement mis fin au mythe de Yan'an, même si la réalité de cette révolution avait disparu bien avant. A son époque, Yan'an rayonna vers toutes les bases révolutionnaires et à travers toute la Chine, et ce, malgré le contexte de guerre et de révolution. Ce fut le moment de transition entre l'échec et le succès à la fois pour Mao Zédong en personne à travers son ascension au sein du Parti communiste chinois et pour le Parti lui-même. Les mots et la langue furent, à cet égard et plus que toute autre chose, d'une importance cruciale. "Faiseur de mythe", conteur, architecte moral, créant à la fois la logique et le texte de la révolution, Mao parvint à symboliser le discours hégémonique de la révolution chinoise comme l'unique culture politique possible. Les luttes pour le pouvoir menées par Mao s'articulèrent sur la prétention au monopole d'un "cosmos" défini par luimême autour d'une idéologie (le marxisme sinisé), d'un pouvoir de domination militaire, d'un pouvoir administratif, et d'un pouvoir intellectuel. Mao utilisa en effet ces quatre dimensions pour asseoir son autorité avec un savant mélange de finesse analytique et tactique que l'on retrouve aussi dans ses textes. Mais il se heurta à des compétiteurs à l'intérieur même du PCC. Aussi chacune de ces luttes révèle-t-elle une dimension différente du processus de monopolisation. Chacune était nécessaire mais même ensemble, elles étaient insuffisantes, en l'absence de l'ingrédient final, le capital symbolique. Situated in China's Northwest, and communist guerrilla base before Mao arrived, Yan'an hab been constituted during a long time, officially at least, the moral moment of the chinese revolution.

Author(s): Wilks Tom<br>
Abstract: Most accounts of social work values contain two central conceptual strands: social work ethics and anti-discriminatory practice. Within social work, relatively little attention has been paid to the potential of feminist approaches to ethics, grounded in identity to bring these two strands together. Narrative ethics is an approach which, like the feminist ethic of care, takes identity as its starting point and therefore has the potential to bridge these two distinctive approaches to social work values. However, in asserting the centrality of narrative in the construction of our identities, it moves beyond the feminist approach. Narrative approaches to ethics have been widely adopted in medicine. This paper explores their applicability to social work practice, particularly in the light of an increasing interest in narrative as a basis for practice intervention.<br>

Publisher: Fabrizio Serra editore<br>
Issue: i23722717<br>
Date: 1 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Sobel Richard<br>
Abstract: The analyses produced by the French 'regulationist' and 'conventionalist' schools of economic theory both complement and contradict each other. Adherents of the regulationist school fear that convention theory's 'soft consensualism' will cause it to lose its Marxist-Keynesian radicalism, while the conventionalists, on the other hand, seek to persuade the regulationists that they alone hold the microeconomic key to the relative theoretical impasse in which the latter are said to find themselves. It is absolutely essential for heterodox economics to have at its disposal an alternative theory of action with which to counter the homo œconomicus of neoclassical economics, which underpins the dominant mode of economic theorizing. Such a theory is lacking in both the regulationist and conventionalist schools, and is ultimately the missing piece in the heterodox jigsaw puzzle, without which radical institutionalism is condemned to remain a theoretical archipelago without any real power in the face of the neoclassical continent. We will investigate how, without always fully accepting it, these two schools point towards a common theory of economic action, for which we will attempt to prepare the ground.<br>

Author(s): Kontler László<br>
Abstract: This article attempts to refine the understanding of translation, thus contributing to evaluate its role in reception theory and in the history of ideas. A discussion of on the character, theories, and practices of translation in early-modern times is its entry point of analysis. During this period, what mattered in the first place was not the extent to which the translated text succeeded or failed in making the source text and its "original" ideas accessible in the target language, but rather the extent and the way in which the source text was instrumental in pursuing the agenda set by the translator or others in compliance with specific contexts. Such a perspective on translation seems also appropriate to current modes of inquiry for which translation is not an instance of inter-cultural communication, aiming to penetrate the Other in its fullness and make it intelligible in its otherness, but a communicative act whose purposes are predominantly intra-cultural and consist in supporting domestic agendas to which the translated text looks instrumental.<br>

Publisher: Brill<br>
Issue: i23730893<br>
Date: 1 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Scuccimarra Luca<br>
Abstract: Moving from Koselleck's most recent essays on Historik, the author explores the role played by historiography in the constitution of historicity as a peculiar experiential dimension of human existence. The essay focuses on the complex link between difference and repetition which, according to Koselleck's theory of experience, constitutes a "specific historical temporality" and its inner articulation. Actually, it is by exploring the "formal temporal structures" which constitute the horizon of historical intelligibility that Koselleck brings to light the decisive role that the point of view of historiography has for the constitution of man as the subject of historical knowledge and action. It is difficult to ignore the importance of this theory of historical temporalization in an age in which the End of History rhetoric tends to transform itself in a sort of media gospel.<br>

Abstract: Creating one's identity is an on-going process, which is greatly dependent on language. Having this idea as a starting point in the study of religiosity, sharing self-reported experiences can be seen as an integral part in constructing one's religious identity and personal conviction. In this article, I would like to present the idea of bringing together narrative research and the psychological approach to the study of religious experience with the help of personal experience stories about God's guidance told by Christian believers who are members of a charismatic revival movement.<br>

Abstract: A response to James Barr on the issue of how to depict God's words in Genesis 2:17 if the warning of death as a consequence of disobedience appears unrealized in the subsequent narrative. Barr's point that 'lie' is an inappropriate depiction is accepted, but the issue is recast in terms of whether God's words would be sheqer, unreliable. An interpretation of the overall narrative, congruous with the decision about the nature of God's words, is offered.<br>

Abstract: Es wird der Begriff der „Lebensgeschichte“ zur Diskussion gestellt. Am Beispiel ausgewählter Therapie-Konzeptionen (Dührssen, Cremerius, Loch, Kohut, Morgenthaler) wird gezeigt, daß in jeder therapeutischen Richtung verschiedene Segmente des lebensgeschichtlichen Problemfeldes isoliert, ausgearbeitet und zum Ansatzpunkt des therapeutischen Handelns gemacht werden. Die entsprechenden Konsequenzen für Diagnostik, Therapie und Forschung werden im Blick auf aktuelle Strömungen der therapeutischen Psychoanalyse (Ich-Psychologie, Narzißmus-Analyse, Repräsentanzenlehre, hermeneutische Psychoanalyse) verdeutlicht. The concept of „life history“ is the theme of this discussion. Working from a selection of therapy models (Dührssen, Cremerius, Loch, Kohut, Morgenthaler) it can be shown that in every therapeutic approach various segments from the problem area of life histories in general can be isolated, developed and made into the central point of therapeutic activity. The relevant consequences for diagnosis, therapy and research will be clarified with respect to present-day movements in therapeutic psychoanalysis (ego-psychology, the analysis of narcissism, hermeneutic psychoanalysis).<br>

Abstract: Unsere Literaturübersicht diskutiert die Frage, ob und inwieweit eine reife Liebesfähigkeit Erwachsener von entsprechenden Früherfahrungen abhängt bzw. inwieweit Liebe und Partnerschaft eine Korrektur ungünstiger emotionaler Erfahrungen der frühen Kindheit ermöglichen. Bestimmte Partnerschaftsstörungen stehen zu konkreten familiären Gegebenheiten der ersten Lebensjahre in keinem zwingenden Bezug. Sind Partnerschaftsstörungen nach traditioneller psychoanalytischer Auffassung als Folge eines ungelösten infantilen Konfliktes anzusehen, so greifen neuere Ansätze angesichts des weitgehenden Fehlens einer psychoanalytischen Interaktionstheorie bei der Beschreibung und Erklärung interpersoneller Phänomene zunehmend auf systemische Ansätze zurück. Äußerungen psychoanalytischer Autoren zur Entwicklung der Liebesfähigkeit reflektieren im historischen Überblick wesentliche Veränderungen der Theoriebildung. Neuere empirische Arbeiten weisen auf Korrektur- und Kompensationsmöglichkeiten ungünstiger Früherfahrungen von mittlerem Schweregrad hin. Dafür aber dürfte die warme und bedürfnisgerechte Zuwendung durch eine oder mehrere feste Bezugspersonen (möglichst durch die liebevoll und partnerschaftlich aufeinander bezogenen Eltern) in den ersten Lebensjahren eine grundlegende Voraussetzung erwachsener Liebes- und Partnerschaftsfähigkeit sein. In this survey of literature on the subject, we discuss the question of whether or not and if so to what extent a mature, adult ability to love depends on relevant early experience, or whether it functions as a corrective to unfavorable emotional experience in early childhood. There is no compelling connection between certain disturbances of partner relations and concrete family circumstances in the first years of life. Such disturbances are regarded by traditional psychoanalysis as the result of an unresolved infantile conflict; however, since there is no psychoanalytical interaction theory for the description and explanation of interpersonal~<br>

Abstract: Finke, pp. 41-42: "In the Middle Ages, torture was not regarded simply as a form of
punishment. It was, as Foucault has shown, a technique and a ritual, a semiotic system which 'must
mark the victim.' Torture inscribed on the victim's body the 'signs' of the ruler's power. It was
one of the most visible displays of that power, an art, 'an entire poetic' that competed with other
visual displays of theocratic rule. The marking of the victim's body signifies the power that
punishes. "In the 'excesses' of torture, a whole economy of power is invested". In her excesses,
the mystic becomes at once both torturer and victim. This, it seems to me, is the whole point. The
mystic's pain - her inflicting of wounds upon herself — grants her the authority to speak and be
heard."<br>

Abstract: This article tries to give an outline of Christian ethics in a pluralistic world most clearly characterized by its Babel of moral languages. There is no longer any single valid moral language. The liberal solution to establish a neutral moral language – a moral Esperanto – to solve this crisis of modernity is not possible without turning into some sort of moral imperialism. To avoid, however, the other extreme – nihilism – this article follows to some degree "communitarian" thinkers like A. MacIntyre, J. Stout and M. Walzer. Every ethics must be rooted in a narrative tradition and needs a concrete community as its precondition. The second part of this article addresses the narrative structure of Christian ethics. At first it follows MacIntyre's insight that every ethics is based on myth. It differs, however, from MacIntyre's position by putting special emphasis on the substantial content of the Christian "myth". With the help of Girard's mimetic theory this article distinguishes between archaic myths that are the product of the scapegoat mechanism and identify with the view of the lynch mob and the Biblical history of salvation that consists of a story written from the perspective of the victims of collective persecution. In the center of Christian ethics we find the example of Jesus Christ – the victim of collective violence par excellence – and the example of those of his disciples who became aware of their own contribution to Jesus's death and converted to the side of the victim. The third part of this article addresses the question of the concrete community that makes Christian ethics possible. Again MacIntyre's communitarian emphasis on the connection between concrete communities and ethics is taken as a starting point. Whereas communitarians, however, tend to support patriotism the community necessitated by Christian ethics is the universal Church. Patriotism like the ancient Greek polis is essentially characterized by its enmity to outside communities, a frie~<br>

Abstract: Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855) prepared the ground for individual fighters on philosophical-literary topics in the twentieth Century. In his writings he chooses the most varying problems as a starting point for his assessment of the existing relations between the Church and the World. As Kierkegaard fights for the individual, he criticizes the power of the masses over the quality of life of the individual citizen. He also criticizes the moralizing attempts of the "paid" clergy to make their demands on the individual believer. Following Theodor W. Adorno, Kierkegaard is to be read with a permanent considération for Kierkegaard himself. Autobiographical notices make it clear, that he is caught up in a constant struggle with himself. His both happy and tragical relationship with Regine Olson, which ended when he broke off their engagement, was the décisive impulse for him to become a "religious writer". It is to his former fiancée and his father that he dedicates his life's work, in which mostly Pseudonyms – as an indirect way of communication – express his existence. Kierkegaard mentions three essential levels or stages of life: the aesthetical outlook on life and the ethical, both of which are "catégories", finally, the religious outlook, which is more an "atmosphère". These stages can both follow each other, and also pervade one another. They are accompanied by the borderline catégories of irony and humour. These three phases do not simply depict a mode of abstract thinking, but also deal with concrète situations in life, as are those involved in passion, fear, misery and despair.<br>

Abstract: The christology of the French Jesuit Joseph Moingt, L'homme qui venait de Dieu (published in 1993), is part of the younger history of narrative theology. Referring to the christology of Rahner and Balthasar, Jüngel and Pannenberg, Moingt is "reconstructing" the history of faith in the horizon of the narrative time of the Gospel. The criterion for this "reconstruction" is the history – of God and men – which follows the path of the Gospel's texts and which has been orientated from the beginning to future. Jesus Christ is "announced as the man who has to come and whom the whole world attended", the man "coming from the future and who is the future of men, because of illuminating for all men the way to the future". Joseph Moingt's "théologie du récit" récit" to the discussion about the foundation of systematic christology. The following article presents the principal idea of Moingt's christology, it is governed by the question of the Christ's preexistence. This is the central point in the discussions about the importance of narrativity in actual dogmatics.<br>

Abstract: The article deals with the problem of revelation in Levinas' writings. The first part of the article analizes Levinas' ideas on the Same and the Other, more particularly the topics of the face and of discourse, as these come to the fore in the first section of Totality and Infinity. Investigating the non-totalising relationship between the Same and the Other presents us with the suitable framework for understanding the relation between the finite and the Infinite. Leaving out any ontotheological speech, Levinas shows how Metaphysics is enacted in the ethical relation. The second part cootinues with a description of Levinas' position on revelation in the Jewish tradition. The active Interpretation of Biblical texts "beyond the verse" represents an opportunity of hearing the divine word today and to enter into a more primordial Order than the Order of the Same. In the course of the article, we point to affinities and striking similarities between E. Levinas' and F. Rosenzweig's view on revelation. We also demonstrate how Levinas Orients his Jewish writings to his philosophy of the Other and vice versa. In writing on revelation, Levinas' main concern seems to be the description of the possibility of a fracture in the immanent order of totality and in the self-sufficiency of reason which is its correlative. This fraction is produced by the command "thou shalt not kill", calling the Same to open itself to the Other.<br>

Abstract: This article concerns itself with the question of what constitutes a hymn, within the framework of the existing state church. This framework is defined as "religious pluralization", characterized by an individualized understanding of Christ, and the parallel development of a new interdenominational religious awareness, two trends which have been increasingly prominent since the days of post-Reformation Orthodoxy and the Enlightenment. "Pluralization" is intimately associated with a fundamental movement away from traditional forms of religious piety. The article attempts to describe the hymn as a figure of "tentative continuity"; that ist, the hymn is the means by which human beings symbolically express their religious perception of their own finiteness in history. The hymn can therefore claim a more universal validity than if it merely pinpoints a specific moment of human religious history. At this point, the article carefully examines several examples of older as well as of more modern hymnody.<br>

Abstract: It is the purpose of this paper to present a reassessment of the works of the first nineteenth century French Utopian Socialists. It is well known that their contributions have been highly criticised, from both the economic and social point of view and the political or ethical one. Recent commentators, mostly historians and philosophers, have, however, underlined the realistic ambition and the reformist spirit of those approaches. This paper aims to develop this perspective. Indeed, it is my intention to defend the idea that the realism of utopia can be even better characterised by economists: the analyses of Leroux, Enfantin, Chevalier, Buchez or Considérant can be interpreted in terms of development. We study more specifically the initial flowering between 1830 and 1835 of the writings of the Saint-Simonians (Enfantin, Chevalier, Pereire), the works of the dissidents (Buchez, Leroux) and those of the main supporters of Fourier (Considerant, Transon, Lechevalier). We will conduct our survey proceeding from the notion of 'vision' proposed recently by Robert Heilbroner. We then examine whether these socialist pioneers really worked in order to elaborate a 'vision' in terms of 'development'.<br>

Author(s): Tchumkam Hervé<br>
Abstract: Dans son roman Le Mal de peau, Monique Ilboudo entremêle dans la narration les itinéraires respectifs d'une mère meurtrie par un viol et de sa fille métisse en quête de son identité. Ce roman qui signe l'acte de naissance de la littérature dite féminine au Burkina Faso est ici analysé du point de vue des modalités de l'irruption de la figure féminine dans la fiction. Ma réflexion interroge les paradigmes de la représentation des femmes, à partir des questions du sexe et de la couleur de peau. Plus exactement, il s'agit de mettre en évidence d'un point de vue diachronique les tribulations de femmes dont l'autonomie se trouve a priori rendue inopérante par les avatars de la colonisation et le chaos postcolonial. Mais bien plus qu'une lecture du statut subalterne de la femme dans la fiction, mon analyse s'appuie sur les thèses de Paul Ricœur sur les identités narratives, la mémoire et l'oubli, afin de suggérer l'émergence dans ce roman d'une nouvelle posture féminine. L'ultime objectif de cet article est de montrer qu'en dépit de son apparente impuissance, le personnage féminin dans le roman étudié échappe au stéréotype et réussit à se constituer en sujet de pouvoir.<br>

Abstract: La discussion entre Paul Ricœur et Claude Lévi-Strauss qui portait en 1963 sur la Pensée sauvage mérite d'être placée dans un contexte où l'opposition de la structure et du sens était le point de discorde décisif. Mais, il est possible de souligner aujourd'hui qu'entre l'herméneutique de Ricœur et le structuralisme de Lévi-Strauss, ce sont deux conceptions de l'interprétation qui s'opposent et s'entrecroisent, l'une textuelle, l'autre musicale.<br>

Abstract: De ce point de vue, le texte de la conférence de Vienne est sans ambiguïté. Voir Platon et
l'Europe, op. cit., p. 31-32 : « Elle [notre Europe] recèle quelque chose d'unique, qui est sensible
même à d'autres groupes humains : c'est quelque chose qui - en dehors de tout souci utilitaire -
devient pour elle un motif de s'européaniser plus ou moins, alors que, si nous avons de nous-
mêmes une juste compréhension, nous ne chercherons pas, par exemple, à nous indianiser. »<br>

Issue: i24256635<br>
Date: 5 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Helcinel Gaston<br>
Abstract: En s'appuyant sur Pessoa et Brecht, Badiou se livre à des variations intéressantes sur le
« nous » du Parti. Intéressantes, mais se rapprochant diablement de réflexions quasi ecclésiolo-
giques (voir p. 170-183). De ce point de vue, Badiou, qui décrète que « le Dieu des mono-
théismes est mort depuis longtemps, sans doute au moins deux cents ans », devrait davantage se
méfier des substituts au Dieu mort et à l'Église défaite. Mais ses réflexions sur l'humanisme
classique qui « sans la vitalité du Dieu, présent ou absent, qui en soutenait l'exercice » aboutit
à une « représentation de l'homme qui le réduit à un corps animal » sont très suggestives.<br>

Abstract: Ce texte de 1958 évalue l'impact du progrès technique sur les rapports que l'homme entretient avec le monde et avec lui-même. Jusqu'à quel point l'homme se change-t-il lui-même en accroissant son pouvoir sur les choses ? Analysant successivement les effets de la révolution technique sur le travail, la consommation et la compréhension de soi, Ricœur se situe à égale distance du discours de la déploration et de celui de l'enthousiasme progressiste.<br>

ne lui reproche pas (en principe!) d'être chrétien. Le soupçon énonce plutôt ceci : la philoso-
phie que Ricœur veut profane est en réalité chrétienne. Le plus simple est de renvoyer ici à sa
réponse à C. Bouchindhomme dans Temps et récit de Paul Ricœur en débat, op. cit., p. 212, avec
la question pertinente qu'il pose : « Les penseurs de la modernité ne peuvent-ils entendre que
leur propre discours? »<br>

Abstract: Chez Ricœur, la tension Spinoza/Kant est au moins aussi présente, quoique de manière
moins explicite, que la tension Aristote/Kant examinée dans la « petite éthique » de Soi-même
comme un autre. Il ne s'agit pas seulement ici de l'opposition, finalement conciliable, entre une
perspective téléologique sur l'éthique (Aristote) et une perspective déontologique sur la morale
(Kant), mais de la confrontation entre une ontologie centrée sur le concept d'activité et un point
de vue transcendantal qui reste résolument hostile à toute incursion conceptuelle dans le
domaine de l'être.<br>

Author(s): Ning Zhang<br>
Abstract: Hannah Arendt, Condition de l'homme moderne, Paris, Calmann-Lévy, 1961, p. 307. Paul
Ricœur souligne aussi la difficulté du pardon, en raison de « la disproportion existant entre les
deux pôles de la faute et du pardon » ou « entre la profondeur de la faute et la hauteur du par-
don » (la Mémoire, l'Histoire, l'Oubli, Paris, Le Seuil, 2000, p. 593). D'une certaine manière,
Derrida relance la discussion grâce à un examen rigoureux de la relation toujours présente entre
conditionnai]'té et inconditionnalité du pardon. Ses principaux textes sur ce sujet sont : « L'ex-
cuse et le pardon », dans Donner le temps. La fausse monnaie, Paris, Galilée, 1991, p. 139-217;
« Justice et pardon », dans Sur parole, Paris, L'Aube, 1999, p. 141; « Le siècle et le pardon »,
Le Monde des débats, décembre 1999, p. 10-17; « Pardonner : l'impardonnable et l'imprescrip-
tible », conférence donnée à l'université de Pékin, 2001 (non publiée). Est aussi utile la mise au
point de Giovanna Borradori, « La déconstruction du concept de terrorisme selon Derrida »,

Author(s): Cadolle Sylvie<br>
Abstract: La notion de distinction de sexe a été présentée une première fois aux lecteurs d'Esprit il
y a quelques années, et je tiens à le rappeler ici car le principe d'écriture de mon livre est de
toujours présenter mes propres analyses en « héritage » et en « conversation » avec ceux qui
m'ont précédée. Mon seul regret est d'avoir dû choisir un nombre limité d'interlocuteurs afin
que la mise en scène de mon essai reste lisible et permette de distinguer les analyses anté-
rieures auxquelles je rends hommage, et celles que j'assume personnellement en particulier en
exerçant ma responsabilité dans la « mise en intrigue » de mon essai. Sur la notion de « distinc-
tion de sexe», on se reportera avec profit à l'article qu'avait rédigé Cécile Barraud pour notre
numéro spécial d'Esprit, « L'un et l'autre sexe » (C. Barraud, « La distinction de sexe dans les
sociétés. Un point de vue relationnel », Esprit, mars-avril 2001, p. 105-129).<br>

Abstract: Claude Lévi-Strauss s'en prend à Sartre dans la préface de la Pensée sauvage et inter-
vient dans Esprit dans le cadre d'un échange avec Paul Ricœur. Sur le paradigme structuraliste
et le statut de l'événement, voir les mises au point de Frédéric Keck: « La pensée mythique ne
cherche pas à donner sens à l'événement historique, en l'insérant dans une chaîne d'événe-
ments qui l'expliquerait ou qu'il éclairerait rétrospectivement: elle cherche dans l'événement
une opposition logique qui lui permet de mettre en scène l'ensemble des structures symboliques
qui lui préexistent. Le sens de l'événement ne se manifeste pas dans son unité ou sa nouveauté,
mais au contraire dans l'instabilité logique par laquelle il reproduit une structure passée », Fré-
déric Keck, Claude Lévi-Strauss, une introduction, Paris, La Découverte-Pocket, 2005, p. 145.<br>

rait reconnaître que ce que l'on a « identifié » au préalable. C'est au contraire la reconnaissance
qui précède la connaissance puisque l'on « connaît » un sujet à partir de ses actes « expressifs ».
De ce point de vue, il n'y a pas d'opposition entre ce qu'est un sujet et ce qu'il fait.<br>

Abstract: M. Iacub, « Un crime parfait, l'assistance médicale à la procréation », dans Le crime était
presque sexuel et autres essais de casuistique juridique, Paris, Epel, 2002 (Flammarion, 2003). Par
la suite, cet auteur a semblé changer assez radicalement d'analyse en défendant dans VEmpire du
ventre une approche fondée sur le dualisme esprit/corps et la toute-puissance de la volonté:
« Tous les enfants trouvent le même fondement à l'établissement des liens de filiation : la volonté
de certains, voire d'un seul, d'en être les parents. Les corps deviennent un moyen parmi d'autres
de réaliser un projet parental, et non plus les causes magiques des filiations », cité (avec un point
d'exclamation en commentaire), dans G. Delaisi de Parseval, Famille à tout prix, op. cit., p. 195.<br>

Abstract: Deux décisions récentes des pouvoirs publics réduisant le soutien à Esprit nous incitent à faire le point sur la situation des revues généralistes et leur contribution à la vie intellectuelle française. Alors que les états généraux de la presse ont laissé de côté le monde des revues et que l'évaluation de travail universitaire survalorise les approches spécialisées, pourquoi nous semble-t-il vital de défendre un esprit résolument généraliste ?<br>

Abstract: Notre rapport à l'argent relève à la fois de la morale, de l'économie et de la politique. L'approche économique prédominante ne suffit pas parce que l'argent n'est pas un simple instrument d'échange. Il touche aux passions et aux identifications, et il a surtout tendance à déborder sans cesse son statut d'outil, au point d'annexer la totalité des sphères de la vie et de subordonner l'ensemble des valeurs. Si la politique a pour rôle d'ordonner les conflits de valeurs, les sagesses, si anciennes soient-elles, n'ont peutêtre pas dit leur dernier mot devant les problèmes du présent.<br>

Abstract: Voir mon compte rendu de Voix off (Esprit, novembre 2008). Denis Podalydès, qui joue le
personnage de Nicolas Sarkozy dans un film sorti sur les écrans en mai 2011 (c'est l'accession à
la présidence qui est mise en scène dans La Conquête), parle ainsi de la voix du président de la
République: «Je répugnais à m'appuyer sur ses tics, mais je l'ai bien écouté afin de trouver son
rythme, ce point d'autorité dans la voix. C'est un homme qui peut vite passer de la violence à
l'extrême séduction. Ses moments d'enfance sont précieux aussi, ce "hein!" qui affleure lorsqu'il
est heureux de sa répartie. Je l'ai vu sur des images, lorsqu'il se prépare à entrer en meeting et
oublie les photographes. Cette concentration, cette solitude sont celles des comédiens avant
d'entrer en scène», dans Le Monde magazine, 9 janvier 2011.<br>

Author(s): Abel Olivier<br>
Abstract: Relire l'auteur du Dictionnaire historique et critique (1696) aujourd'hui, c'est se livrer à une sorte de remémoration critique de la tradition des Lumières, jusqu'au point où elles s'originent, c'est-à-dire dans un sentiment de « ténèbres ». Bayle ne croyait pas que l'humanité soit une grande famille provisoirement divisée par l'ignorance, et que la raison, diffusée par l'instruction, suffirait à pacifier. Le problème, c'est que toute croyance humaine a bien souvent la prétention à être la seule véritable, et à ramener toutes les autres à elle.<br>

Abstract: Les années 1960 sont à part. Elles représentent pour les uns une rupture, pour les autres un tournant ou une cassure, mais peu importe le mot utilisé: le constat est unanime. Cette décennie marque pourtant une étape passée un peu inaperçue dans l'histoire du protestantisme français faute d'une étude d'ensemble. Ouverture œcuménique, contestations internes, crise des mouvements de jeunesse et crise théologique, mutations des comportements et des mœurs, émergence de nouvelles structures, montée en puissance du protestantisme évangélique... Comment interpréter cette décennie de révolutions pour le protestantisme : enrichissement ou éclatement? The 1960s stand apart. Some see them as a rupture, others as a turning point or a break: whatever the word used, the verdict is unanimous. Yet, for lack of an overall study, this decade is a somewhat neglected stage in the history of French Protestantism. Ecumenical progress, internal conflicts, crises in youth movements, theological crisis, changes in behaviour and conduct, emergent new structures, the rising influence of evangelical Protestantism... How should this decade of revolutions for Protestantism be interpreted: enrichment or fragmentation? Die sechziger Jahre stehen für sich. Die einen deuten sie als Bruch, die anderen als Wende oder Einschnitt, aber es kommt auf das benutzte Wort nicht an: die Feststellung ist einstimmig. Dabei markiert dieses Jahrzehnt ein Stadium in der Geschichte des französischen Protestantismus, das mangels einer Gesamtuntersuchung fast unbemerkt blieb. Ökumenische Öffnung,interne Streitigkeiten, Krise der Bewegungen innerhalb der Jugend und theologische Krise, Veränderungen der Sitten und Verhaltensweisen, Erscheinen neuer Strukturen, starkes Wachstum des Evangelikalismus... Wie ist dieses Jahrzehnt der Umwälzungen und Umbrüche im Protestantismus zu deuten, als Bereicherung oder als Auseinanderbrechen?<br>

Abstract: On part ici de l'hypothèse que Mémoires d'aveugle. L'autoportrait et autres ruines de Jacques Derrida est en quelque sorte l'illustration de La Voix et le phénomène et donc la critique, par Derrida, de la phénoménologie de l'intuition, de la perception et de la vue. On relève toutefois aussi des rencontres avec Husserl et Kant. On n'oublie pas non plus qu'il y va de l'art, des arts visuels et, dans la grande richesse thématique de cet ouvrage, on relève des moments forts, aussi bien que des moments faibles, au sujet des arts du « visible ». La question demeurant : Derrida « voit »-il le dessin, la peinture et, même, entend-il la musique? The starting point of this paper is the hypothesis that Mémoires d'aveugle. L'autoportrait et autres ruines is somehow the illustration of Speech and Phenomenon, and constitutes consequently Derrida's critique of the phenomenology of intuition, perception and vision. It is however also possible to put the emphasis on some crossingpoints with Husserl and Kant. What should not be forgotten is the fact that what is at stake here is art, i.e. visual arts, and that in the great thematic richness of this work, it is possible to bring to light strong and weak points concerning the arts of the « visible ». But the question remains : can Derrida « see » the design, the painting, and even can he hear the music?<br>

Abstract: De l'habitude, p. 49 gibt Ravaisson zwei charakteristische Stellen: „Dans
l'homme, le progrès de l'habitude conduit la conscience, par une dégradation non
interrompue, de la volonté à l'instinct, et de l'unité accomplie de la personne à
l'extrême diffusion de l'impersonnalité. C'est donc une seule force, une seule
intelligence qui est dans la vie de l'homme le principe de toutes les fonctions et de
toutes les formes de la vie." — „... avec les conditions de l'espace et du mouve-
ment disparaissent celles de la réflexion et de la mémoire. Les fonctions les plus
involontaires de notre vie, celles de la nutrition, par exemple, ne sont pas des habi-
tudes anciennes, transformées en instincts. Non seulement nous ne voyons pas
qu'elles aient jamais dépendu de notre volonté, mais jamais elles n'en ont pu
dépendre; elles se composent de mouvements insensibles et d'altérations organiques
qui sont hors de la sphère de l'imagination et de l'entendement. Mais l'habitude
amène au même point les mouvements volontaires, et les transforme en instincts."<br>

Abstract: Aristoteles, De Generatione et Corruptione, 1,10,328b6-14. Un peu
plus haut (328a25-26), le Stagirite s'exprime autrement en signalant que deux
composants de quantité ou de volume inégal ne produisent pas à strictement
parler « un mélange (μίξις), mais une augmentation de ce qui prédomine
(κρατούντος) ». La « prédominance » aristotélicienne consiste donc en ce que
l'un des deux composants de ce qui aurait pu constituer un mélange est qualita-
tivement affecté au point qu'il disparaît en tant que nature et ne constitue plus
qu'une propriété supplémentaire du composant dominant. Ce n'est pas le cas
du mélange total stoïcien, dont les deux composants demeurent qualitativement
inaffectés et peuvent en conséquence être recouvrés après coup. Si, dans le
mélange stoïcien, le principe actif domine en quelque sorte le principe passif,
c'est seulement dans la mesure où il lui insuffle une cohésion qu'il ne possédait
pas de lui-même. Ainsi, d'un point de vue stoïcien, l'âme assure la cohésion du
corps, qui permet pour sa part à l'âme de s'étendre. Cf. l'article de B. Collet-
te-Duùc et S. Delcomminette, art. cit., surtout les sections 3 : « L'actif et le
passif » et 7 : « Quelques applications ».<br>

Abstract: Comme le montre l'excellent article de E. Eliasson {art. cit.), il est par
ailleurs très intéressant de noter que, chez les médioplatoniciens, cette reprise
se fera à partir d'une double réception : celle du mythe d'Er, à partir duquel il
s'agit d'articuler les rôles respectifs de l'action humaine (le choix), de l'inter-
vention divine ou du destin (exécution de ce choix) et du tirage au sort
(hasard); et celle de la conception aristotélicienne du έφ' ήμίν, pensé à partir
de DI13 comme non-nécessaire et identifié à l'action humaine, dont la réalisa-
tion et les conséquences sont pour leur part assimilées au destin. Le destin, dès
lors, inclut tout, mais certaines choses à titre d'hypothèses (nos choix et actions
identifiées au έφ' ήμίν) et d'autres à titre de conséquences (leurs effets). Le
έφ ήμίν est donc inclus dans le destin, mais non soumis au destin, ce qui per-
met, comme le note E. Eliasson, d'éviter les « conséquences déterministes de
la théorie stoïcienne ». Sur ce point, voir également S. Bobzien (art. cit.), qui
montre la façon dont, à travers cette reprise, la notion de έφ ήμίν se trouvera
subordonnée au contingent et, plus précisément, à ce qui arrive non pas la plu-
part du temps ou rarement, mais à ce qui arrive « en part égale », que Némésius
(De la nature de l'homme, 104. 6.7; 114.21.2), comme Plutarque (Du destin,
571 c-d), identifient à ce que nous sommes capables de faire et son opposé.
Dans cette tradition, elle montre donc que le concept de έφ' ήμίν se trouve
pensé à partir de trois sources aristotéliciennes : la question du délibérable
(EN III 4); le concept de possibilité double en sa relation à la puissance
rationnelle (DI 13; Mét. Θ); et le problème des futurs contingents (DI 9).<br>

Abstract: This essay discusses Heidegger's interpretation of autobiographical narration in his lecture on Basic Problems of Phenomenology (WS 1919/20) as an alternative conception of authenticity. A focused comparison between Heidegger's early understanding of the 'narrated self' and the analysis of the call of conscience in Being and Time shows that the most problematic aspects of Heidegger's later idea of authenticity result from a distinct isolation of the authentic self, which is specific for his conception of authenticity since the mid-twenties. At last, the article intends to demonstrate that Heidegger's early idea of an original self-understanding is close to current philosophical theories which assume a holistic idea of authenticity and point out a strong relation between authenticity and narrativity.<br>

Abstract: La Modernidad parecía condenar a la expulsión de la religión respecto del proyecto ilustrado al considerar que fe y razón eran excluyentes. No obstante, esa promesa de futuro de emancipación y de racionalidad ilustrada ha incurrido en sus propios aspectos negativos, hasta llegar, en la postmodernidad, a la deconstrucción de todo y la pérdida de sentido. El filósofo Habermas y el teólogo Ratzinger, después Papa Benedicto XVI, debatieron el papel que razón y fe debían desempeñar en las actuales sociedades plurales. Ambos partían de premisas distintas –Habermas desde la confianza en la Ilustración y en la religión como humanismo y Ratzinger desde el necesario entendimiento entre fe y razón– para llegar a un punto de encuentro: la necesidad de defender una nueva Ilustración, compatible con la religión, para operar en la postmodernidad. Modernity seemed to replace religion with the Enlightenment project, since it considered that reason and faith were mutually exclusive. However, the promise of a future of emancipation and Enlightenment reason has finally culminated, in Postmodernity, in the destruction of everything and the loss of meaning. Habermas, philosopher, and Ratzinger, theologian and later Pope Benedict XVI, discussed the role that ought to be played by reason and faith in the current plural societies. They were based on different premises—Habermas on trust in the Enlightenment and in religion from a humanistic perspective and Ratzinger on the necessary understanding between faith and reason—and reached a common point: the need to defend a new Enlightenment, compatible with religion, which can operate in Postmodernity.<br>

Abstract: Encroachments of contemporary social theory on the field of theology are the focal point of this essay. In postmodernity, theology facilitates connections with social theory. In the domain of theology, sociocultural problems are being presented as theological issues. Secularized variants of world theology meet with theologizing postsecular social theory above and beyond sociology. This is facilitated by the constant discourse of ambiguity. In this discourse, "the theological" is a vehicle of indeterminate meanings. Praxis' oriented discourse uses the term "social theory" with its modernist connotative envelope of science and rationality, but with no obligation whatsoever to maintain objectivity of cognition. Sociology doesn't interfere with theological discourse, but may analyze it, leaving the otherworldly outside its perspective on sociocultural phenomena. The sociotheological discourse of ambiguity, however, opposes both religion and the rationality of science.<br>

Abstract: The Aristotelian concept of phronesis or practical wisdom has played a prominent role in the long and deep wake of the Perestroika controversy in political science, where a diverse group of practitioners rallied in opposition to the perceived hegemony of quantitative methods in the discipline. As scholars like Bent Flyvbjerg have proposed the contours of a post-Perestroikan social science, political scientists and theorists have taken his use of the idea of practical wisdom to herald the dawning of a new social science, less beholden to notions of method. This paper examines the post-Perestroikan appropriation of Aristotle using Hans-Georg Gadamer's interpretation of phronesis as a starting point. Viewed from this vantage, contemporary uses of phronesis seem less like the foundations for a new social science, and more like a new spin on the old arguments about method that have characterized social science since the mid-1800s.<br>

Abstract: De septembre 1941 à novembre 1943 le lieu-dit Babij Jar, vaste ravin situé dans la périphérie de Kiev, devint un immense charnier où s'entassèrent les corps de milliers de Juifs fusillés entre les 29 et 30 septembre 1941 ainsi que ceux de prisonniers de l'Armée rouge, de nationalistes ukrainiens, de familles entières de tsiganes, et les cadavres d'hommes, de femmes et d'enfants massacrés tout au long de l'occupation de la ville par l'armée allemande. Si le déroulement du massacre a été l'objet de nombreuses études historiques précises, l'analyse littéraire des textes – poèmes, œuvres en prose, articles de presse – traitant de Babij Jar a été délaissée. Le point de départ du présent article est la littérature considérée dans le sens russe du mot de textes écrits sur un sujet donné, et donc toute forme de documents écrits en URSS en russe, ukrainien ou yiddish entre 1941 et 1948, année de la fermeture du journal yiddish Ejnikajt. En plaçant la littérature au centre de l'article, nous estimons que le contenu même des textes doit permettre d'établir des connections éventuelles avec d'autres œuvres s'inscrivant dans la thématique malheureusement très vaste de la souffrance juive. Il n'est évidemment pas question de nier l'assassinat de personnes non-juives à Babij Jar, mais de souligner l'extraordinaire ampleur du massacre d'une grande partie de la population juive de Kiev en l'espace de deux jours et en un seul lieu. Between September 1941 and November 1943 the place called Babii Iar, a large ravine not far from Kiev, became a mass grave. Thousands of Jews were shot down on the 29th and 30th of September 1941, and the ravine was piled with their dead bodies, as well as the bodies of prisoners of the Red Army, Ukrainian nationalists, entire families of gypsies, and the corpses of men, women and children slaughtered during the German occupation. A lot of historical studies have dealt with the proceedings; but the literary analysis of texts (poems, prose, articles) dealing~<br>

Abstract: Sven Arntzen arrive, par une analyse détaillée, à une conclusion qui n'est
pas loin de l'idée de J. Patocka : « Duty to oneself requires that one resist
political authority under certain circumstances and thus is a basis for
permissible resistance. ».Kant on duty to oneself and resistance to political
authority, in Journal of the History of Philosophy, juilllet 1996, vol. 34, n°3,
pp. 409 sq. Il faut ajouter que la parole kantienne « Ne devenez point esclaves
des hommes. Ne souffrez pas que votre droit soit impunément foulé aux pieds
par les autres » a dans le texte de Kant une portée limitée. Elle avertit contre la
perte de l'indépendance économique de l'individu (car les dettes peuvent
mener à ce qu'on devienne mendiant), contre la génuflexion devant les images
et contre un comportement trop révérencieux par rapport aux hommes
(lorsqu'il exprime par exemple la différence des états, la courtoisie mutuelle
entre égaux étant en revanche compatible avec l'estime de soi-même). Ces
formes d'estime n'ont aucune dimension politique et Kant ne provoque pas à
une résistance dans le cadre de la défense contre l'injustice. Et pourtant, les
analyses de Patoika et Arntzen peuvent s'appuyer sur l'œuvre de Kant dans
son ensemble. Du point de vue d'ensemble, le droit à la résistance chez Kant
n'est pas seulement une question de légalité, mais de moralité.<br>

Abstract: Il faudrait ainsi comparer L'amour, la fantasia, écrit en 1985, avec Nulle
part dans la maison de mon père. On y retrouve la réticence d'Assia Djebar à
l'égard de l'autobiographie, comme « déroulé chronologique » mis en ordre
« après coup » et donnant une apparence de continuité, alors qu'écrire est
« revivre par éclairs, pour approcher quel point de rupture, quel envol ou à
défaut, quelle chute? » (p. 267). Il s'agit quand même, plus que dans L'amour,
la fantasia, d'avoir osé « écrire sur soi » (p. 445). Certains événements relatés
dans le premier livre y sont racontés autrement, ainsi que d'autres épisodes qui,
outre la passion pour la lecture découverte dès l'âge de cinq ou six ans,
concernent — entre autres — l'hypokhâgne de Fatima à Alger et ses émois
amoureux. Le point culminant du livre est « ce matin d'octobre 1953 » (p. 429)
où elle se jette sous un tramway. La « querelle banale d'amoureux » qui avait
motivé cette impulsion suicidaire, seulement évoquée dans L'amour, la
fantasia (p. 161), est longuement analysée dans Nulle part dans la maison de
mon père. Ces deux ouvrages sont ainsi parfaitement illustratifs de la façon
dont une même vie est susceptible de plusieurs récits possibles.<br>

Abstract: La CONADEP (Commission nationale sur la disparition des personnes) a
réuni les témoignages de tortures, viols, détentions en camps clandestins,
fusillades, disparitions de personnes, rapts d'enfants nés en captivité — dont
les parents furent assassinés —, saccages de maisons et falsifications de titres
de propriété, tout ce qui est perpétré par le terrorisme d'État en matière de
crimes contre l'humanité. Ces témoignages donnèrent lieu à un livre, Nunca
Mâs, et nombre d'entre eux ont par la suite été confirmés lors du procès des
anciennes Juntes militaires par lequel, pour la première fois en Amérique
latine, les principaux responsables ont été traduits en justice et condamnés à la
prison à vie (1985). Après ce procès, que certains ont appelé le « Nuremberg
argentin », il y eut les lois dites de « Point final » (Punto Final) et de « Devoir
d'obéissance » (Obediencia Debidà) qui ont empêché la poursuite judiciaire
des autres tortionnaires puis, en 1989 et 1990, les amnisties dont ont bénéficié
environ deux cents condamnés. En 2003, sous un autre gouvernement, ces

Publisher: Brill Academic Publishers, Inc.<br>
Issue: i24649492<br>
Date: 1 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): WATSON STEPHEN H.<br>
Abstract: Paul Klee's art found broad impact upon philosophers of varying commitments, including Hans-Georg Gadamer. Moreover, Klee himself was not only one of the most important artists of aesthetic modernism but one of its leading theoreticians, and much in his work, as in Gadamer's, originated in post-Kantian literary theory's explications of symbol and allegory. Indeed at one point in Truth and Method, Gadamer associates his project for a general "theory of hermeneutic experience" not only with Goethe's metaphysical account of the symbolic but equally with a "rehabilitation" of allegory. In this paper, I examine this position and Gadamer's own use of it in his analysis of Klee's work, contrasting it with that of Walter Benjamin's account of allegory, equally indebted to Goethe and this archive. Finally, I contrast the resulting interpretations of Klee, discussing the implications that evolve for understanding both Gadamer and Benjamin—but equally for understanding Klee's work and, provisionally, the work of art, thus construed, for philosophy.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur's account of the human capacity for taking action stands in opposition in important respects to two other prominent views. One of these alternatives is exemplified in the position that John Rawls holds. A second alternative appears in some interpretations of the results of neuroscientific research. My aim in this paper is first to highlight a number of the salient feature of Ricoeur's account. Then I will briefly point to some of the challenges it presents to these two alternatives.<br>

Author(s): Savin Alexey E.<br>
Abstract: The article comprises three parts. Part I contains an overview of the areas in the analysis of modern French philosophy that have been of the greatest relevance to Russian researchers over the last years. We conclude that numerous aspects of the French philosophical thought of the twentieth century are well represented in the research of Russian authors, who also point out the emerging trends in its development. Part II deals with the development of analytic philosophy in Russia within the framework of such areas as "critique of bourgeois philosophy", a purely ideological stand only nominally related to philosophy, logic, and the history of philosophy and theoretical research. Part III contains a periodization of the history of phenomenology in Russia, pointing out the most important achievements of the contemporary Russian scholars of phenomenology as well as their understanding of the essence, the problems, and the aims of phenomenological philosophy. We also indicate the tendencies within the development of the discipline in the Russian Federation.<br>

Issue: i24672910<br>

Author(s): Mazurel Hervé<br>
Abstract: L'histoire des sensibilités suscite encore une méfiance persistante, avant tout parce que son projet intellectuel demeure mal identifié, parce que l'historiographie a souvent laissé penser que ses origines s'ancraient uniquement dans la continuité du projet de Lucien Febvre et de l'histoire des mentalités à la française. Or, en vérité, celle-ci n'est autre que la traduction historiographique d'un mouvement philosophique beaucoup plus ample et ancien, né du basculement incarné par Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche et Sigmund Freud, ces penseurs du soupçon, qui nous ont appris à repérer derrière les idées, la raison et la conscience, le rôle des désirs et des appétits, le jeu des pulsions et des sentiments. Rendant ainsi l'homme moins transparent à luimême, l'historien du sensible vise, outre à restituer l'historicité de notre vie sensible, à réévaluer la part des affects dans la détermination des conduites humaines. Pour ce faire, il s'appuie également sur la riche nébuleuse des savoirs critiques élaborés ensuite, dans l'Allemagne de la première moitié du 20e siècle, sous les appellations de « psychologie sociale » ou « historique » ou, à la manière nietzschéenne, de « psychologie des profondeurs ». The history of sensibility still continues to elicit suspicion, first and foremost because this intellectual project remains poorly defined, historiography often having led us to believe that its roots stemmed solely from Lucien Febvre's endeavours and the French history of mentalities. And yet in truth, the history of sensibility is nothing less than the historiographical translation of a much broader and older philosophical movement, born of the tipping point provoked by Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud. Those great sceptical thinkers taught us to unmask the role of desires, appetites and impulses behind our ideas, reason and consciousness. In addition to recreating the historicity of our lives of sensibility and thus rendering man less transparent to himse~<br>

Yan Karski (2009), et le conflit entre Haenel et Claude Lanzmann relèvent en partie de la même

Abstract: See Ricoeur in the essay mentioned in note 33 on the transition from 'sub-
ject' to 'structure' in Althusser's works: 'Zugleich wird damit die Wachsamkeit
gegenüber Verifizierung und Falsifizierung geschwàcht' (p. 208). Openness on this
point cannot, in my opinion, be expected until followers of Althusser show a
readiness to abandon the disastrous notion that the appealing, interpellating
^uthority which demands accountibility can be no other than Ideology. See for
instance Althusser, 'Ideologie en ideologische staatsapparaten' ('Ideology and
ideological state apparatuses'), in Te elfder ure (At the eleventh hour), 24 (1978,
no. 1), pp. 99f: 'the individual is addressed as a (free) subject, so that it subjects
itself in freedom to the commandments of the Subject' (100), '... the ideology
brings about simultaneously (1) the addressing of the 'individuals' as subjects; (2)
their subjection to the Subject' (99).<br>

Author(s): Morton Herbert Donald<br>
Abstract: For Dooyeweerd's Western oriented, sometimes even nationalistically tinted and yet, in
its intention, normative view of culture, see A New Critique, vol. 2, pp. 266-68, etc. In his
Roots in particular, the Occident' is very central (ch. 1, §§ 3,17-25), as the following passage
illustrates: Ά truly scriptural view of history... knows that the great antithesis between the
ground motive of the divine revelation of the Word and the ground motive of the apostate
spirit operates [in history] in the power struggle for the future of western civilization' (p.
108). Yes, Dooyeweerd at one point even calls the Dutch national character, in view of its
calvinistic bent, its humaneness, its sober life-style, and the like, a 'normative type' of histor-
ical disclosure and differentiation (p. 82). See also the striking analysis by C. T. Mclntire in
'Dooyeweerd's Philosophy of History', especially pp. 104-5, together with the nuanced criti-
cism of S. Griffioen in 'De betekenis van Dooyeweerd's ontwikkelingsidee', pp. 105-7.<br>

Abstract: Generalization of the concept of positivizing is also to be observed in Dooyeweerd and

highest commandaient and the concrete situation. See A. Tol and Κ. A. Bril, Vollenhoven als

Abstract: In this context, Dooyeweerd's reading of Stoker seems misleading. When Stoker suggests
that his concept of substance gives a better expression to "the autonomous being and value of
the cosmos with respect to God" {die eien zijn en die eienwaarde van die kosmos teenover God),
Dooyeweerd fears that the radical biblical view of the dependence of all creation upon God is
somehow being threatened (NC, III, 71). But this overlooks precisely the point Stoker is
affirming: namely, the real difference instituted between the Creator and His creation by the
very act of creating. Accordingly, creation is not self-sufficient; but it is not nothing; it is
something. (Cf. Zigterman, op.cit., pp. 129,132,136.)<br>

Abstract: A well-known example of this is one of the paradoxes of Zeno, who argued that Achilles
can never overtake the turtle if the latter is allowed to start out first. When Achilles has covered
the distance that the turtle had at point a the turtle has moved on, and when Achilles has
covered that distance as well, the turtle has moved up too, etc. The paradox dissolves as soon as
it is recognized that the spatial analysis (distances) is not enough to study the phenomenon of
speed. Speed is a kinematic category. When the spatial aspect is not related to time (as in the
kinematic aspect) speed difference is a phenomenon that cannot be grasped.<br>

Abstract: Al estudiar los procesos de transmisión dialógica de las memorias sobre la dictadura militar chilena y el rol que en ella tuvo la Iglesia Católica, desde la Corriente Liberadora (Teología de la Liberación), en tanto memoria subalterna, podemos concluir que opera una paradoja. El principal desafío de esta Corriente es defender la forma en que vivieron el cristianismo durante la dictadura, tratando de influir a la propia Iglesia Católica tras su progresivo alineamiento con los sectores más conservadores a partir de la recuperación democrática. Sin embargo, dentro del clero no encuentran herederos o cómplices para esta Corriente, con lo cual se arriesga el olvido de sus experiencias. Sin embargo, los laicos/as han encontrado en otros actores no eclesiales formas en que sus memorias transiten, en tanto recurren al sentido último de la Teología de la Liberación: el compromiso con las nuevas luchas sociales de los actores marginados. Au moment d'étudier les processus de transmission dialogique des mémoires sur la dictature militaire chilienne et le rôle qu'a joué l'Église catholique dans cette dictature auprès du courant libérateur (Théologie de la Libération), en tant que mémoire subalterne, nous pouvons conclure que ce rôle relève du paradoxe. Le principal défi de ce courant est de défendre la façon dont ses partisans ont vécu le christianisme pendant la dictature, en essayant d'influencer l'Église catholique après son alignement progressif sur les secteurs les plus conservateurs, une fois le démocratie revenue. Cependant, le clergé ne trouve pas d'héritiers ou de complices de ce courant parmi ses membres, au risque d'oublier ces expériences. Néanmoins, les laïcs ont trouvé chez d'autres acteurs, non ecclésiaux, des formes par lesquelles leurs mémoires transitent, en ceci qu'ils recourent au sens ultime de la Théologie de la Libération : l'engagement dans les nouvelles luttes sociales des acteurs marginalisés. After studying the processes of dialogic transmission of the~<br>

Abstract: The Schumann's sonata form (or sonata form-like) compositions little can be explained from the standpoint of tradition. Instead of classical dramatic contrasts, thematic action develops towards a definite goal. This type of musical narration often lasts to the end of the coda, in other cases the constant evolution of a thematic thought or the continual transformation of a motif receives the leading role. In order to obscure the essential events of the works or of the movements Schumann often employs "traditional" formal gestures. One of the most interesting is the repetition of a longer section in different keys, reminding of the exposition-recapitulation duality. The déjà vu feeling was generally one of the starting-point in Schumann's workshop to move away from traditional sonata procedures. Influenced by the narrative content of the works, various strategies were elaborated by him to excite the déjà vu, or to relive musical moments.<br>

Article Title: The New Annalistic: A Sketch of a Theory of History<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i342990<br>
Date: 10 1, 1976<br>
Author(s): Nipperdey Lucian<br>
Abstract: This article argues for the establishment of a new, "annalistic" model of history and historical investigation. This implies a new concept of historical event: instead of being seen as an element within a historical narrative, the historical event is defined as the common reference point of many narratives that can be told about it. The annalistic model also implies a new concept of historical change: instead of being defined as the change of an "object" within a set of given historical parameters, historical change has to be perceived as the change of parameters related to a given historical object. A new concept of history follows from the annalistic model: instead of history being a metaphysical unity of space and time (the destiny of mankind, the positivist's world of facts), in which everything is linked to everything, it is instead the product of historical judgment carried out by those who design stories about their own past, present, and future. To the "annalist" a world is imaginable in which no history has existed, exists, or will exist. The article analyzes three aspects of the concept of historical time: it demonstrates the huge variety of temporal structures in history; it argues for the foundation of the representation of historical time in linguistic concepts; and it discusses the relationship of fictionality and reality in historical discourse. Finally, the annalistic model is compared to the traditional concept of history established by historicism in the nineteenth century.<br>

Publisher: Wesleyan University<br>
Issue: i342980<br>
Date: 2 1, 1992<br>
Author(s): Bloch Ignacio<br>
Abstract: Historians of historiography have paid more attention to differences and innovations than to similarities and constants. This article investigates the importance of "longue duree structures" in nineteenth- and twentieth-century historiography. The first part shows the extent of the common philosophical ideas shared by the "new histories" on the rise from the 1920s to the 1970s: the Annales school, Marxist historiography, the American social science historians, the Past and Present group, and the "Bielefeld school." It suggests continuity between German Historismus and these "new histories." From the postmodern point of view, all "new histories" are also "modern histories"; since the 1970s various types of history have come to be regarded as postmodern and, therefore, radically different. The second part of the article brings to light major continuities running from modern to postmodern thought, from the "new histories" to the "new new histories." The article ends with some ideas on how to "reconstruct" a plural historiographical community.<br>

Publisher: West Chester University<br>
Issue: i25115472<br>
Date: 1 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Rodden John<br>
Abstract: This essay posits the conceptual rudiments of "rhetoric of narrative." Approaching contemporary narrative theory according to the classical trivium, the essay explores what and how stories mean and argue. It focuses on the relevance and value of the rhetorical tradition for illuminating distinctive features of a "rhetoric of narrative," showing how a "rhetoric" of narrative builds upon a "grammar" and a "logic" of narrative. Ultimately the essay posits that narratives can be positioned at some point along a continuum represented by poles roughly characterized as "aesthetic" and "ideological," with propagandistic argument lying at the latter extreme. The chief literary example for applying the conceptual distinctions emerging from our investigations is George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four.<br>

Abstract: The myth of an economy where nobody could have a predominant position, has lost its credibility. The presentiment of a high risk of social explosion makes companies undertake tentative moral legitimation. Thus, a new paradigm develops according to which the firm has to care for the satisfaction of public interest if "it wants to try to win forgiveness" for misbehavior towards the decorum rules of the atomicity of competition. Thus, there is a wave of "business ethics industry" building up. However, the stock exchange performances considered as ethical, are not different from others! The market does not seem to be able to say why it might be interesting to invest in stock considered as ethical. Moreover, opinion polls reveal a very significant discrepancy between the characterization of "the responsible company" as defined by itself or by notation agencies and, on the other hand, the hierarchy of criteria according to the answers of polled people. When companies and agencies favor sustainable development and good governance, rejecting child labor and so on, polled people consider that the paramount criterion of ethical conduct is personnel management. The problem is right here. Such is the view of a positively critical economist, situated at the point where macroeconomics meets corporate management.<br>

Abstract: Nous avons tenté de montrer que les recherches longtemps réunies sous le nom de biologie de l'art ont constitué les racines oubliées de la pensée anthropologique d'Aby Warburg. Connues par lui en 1895-1896, ces perspectives nourrissent encore en 1927, à la fin de sa vie, sa réflexion. À partir de l'analyse ethnographique de la représentation des noms propres dans le Sepik, nous avons ensuite montré que, pour tenter de déchiffrer l'utopie dont témoigne sa pensée - formuler une anthropologie de la mémoire sociale telle qu'elle se fonde sur les traditions iconographiques -, il est nécessaire de reprendre, d'un point de vue critique, la méthode morphologique de la biologie de l'art, et sa manière de reconstruire les opérations mentales impliquées par le déchiffrement des images. /// The studies that have, for a long time now, been assembled under the name " Biology of Art " form the forgotten roots of Aby Warburg's approach to anthropology. He learned about them in 1895-1896, and the thus opened perspectives were still enriching his thinking at the end of his life in 1927. An analysis of conceptions about proper names in the Sepik area is used to show that, to decipher the utopia in Warburg's thinking - formulate an anthropology of social memory in relation to iconographic traditions - it is necessary to critically examine the morphological method of the biology of art and its way of reconstructing the mental operations involved in deciphering images.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing<br>
Issue: i25478832<br>
Date: 5 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Kansteiner Wulf<br>
Abstract: This essay provides a close reading of Saul Friedländer's exceptionally successful comprehensive history of the Holocaust from the theoretical perspective of Hayden White's philosophy of history. Friedländer's The Years of Extermination has been celebrated as the first synthetic history of the "Final Solution" that acknowledges the experiences of the victims of Nazi genocide. But Friedländer has not simply added the voices of the victims to a conventional historical account of the Holocaust. Instead, by displacing linear notions of time and space and subtly deconstructing conventional concepts of causality, he has invented a new type of historical prose that performs rather than analyzes the victims' point of view. Friedländer's innovation has particularly radical consequences for the construction of historical explanations. On the one hand, Friedländer explicitly argues that anti-Semitism was the single most important cause of the Holocaust. On the other hand, his transnational, multifaceted history of the "Final Solution" provides a wealth of data that escapes the conceptual grasp of his explicit model of causation. Friedländer chooses this radically self-reflexive strategy of historical representation to impress on the reader the existential sense of disbelief with which the victims experienced Nazi persecution. To Friedländer, that sense of disbelief constitutes the most appropriate ethical response to the Holocaust. Thus the narratological analysis of The Years of Extermination reveals that the exceptional quality of the book, as well as presumably its success, is the result of an extraordinarily creative act of narrative imagination. Or, put into terms developed by White, who shares Friedländer's appreciation of modernist forms of writing, The Years of Extermination is the first modernist history of the Holocaust that captures, through literary figuration, an important and long neglected reality of the "Final Solution."<br>

Abstract: The representation of history continues to evolve in the domain of museum exhibitions. This evolution is informed in part by the creation of new display methods-many of which depart from the traditional conventions used to achieve the "museum effect"-in part by an increased attention to the museum-visitor relationship. In this context the ethical force of bearing witness, at times a crucial aspect of the museum experience, has emerged as a particularly compelling issue. In seeking to represent and address atrocity, injustice, and the abrogation of human rights, museums have the potential to become "sites of conscience" and to encourage "historical consciousness." Through a series of three exhibitions devoted to slavery, the New-York Historical Society demonstrated how such sites can be constructed and how objects can be deployed to represent extreme or "limit cases." In this review/essay I investigate and interrogate these exhibitions, looking closely at the use of objects as a source of "indirect testimony" (Marc Bloch) and at the "dialogical situation" (Paul Ricoeur) that might arise in an encounter among objects, exhibit narratives, and visitors. Thinking in terms of point of view, I look at the variety of rhetorical platforms from which objects speak in these exhibitions; thinking in terms of syntax, I look at the effects of ordering and of the radical juxtaposition of objects; thinking in terms of irony, I look at the provocations of double-voiced narratives and at how objects are used to support those historical sentences.<br>

Abstract: The trial of Adolf Eichmann, in 1961, is generally considered a turning point in the history of Holocaust memory because it brought the Holocaust into the public sphere for the first time as a discrete event on an international scale. In the same year, Jean Rouch and Edgar Morin's film Chronicle of a Summer appeared in France. While absent from scholarship on memory of the Nazi genocide for over forty years, Chronicle of a Summer contains a scene of Holocaust testimony that suggests the need to look beyond the Eichmann trial for alternative articulations of public Holocaust remembrance. This essay considers the juxtaposition in Chronicle of a Summer of Holocaust memory and the history of decolonization in order to rethink the "unique" place that the Holocaust has come to hold in discourses on extreme violence. The essay argues that a discourse of truth and testimony arose in French resistance to the Algerian war that shaped and was shaped by memory of the Nazi genocide.<br>

Abstract: The onset of dementia raises troubling questions. Does the person with dementia still recognize you? If someone cannot recognize you, can they still care about you? This essay takes such questions as the entry point for a broader inquiry into recognition, its linkages to care, and how claims to social and political "recognition" are linked to, or premised on, the demonstrated capacity to "recognize" people and things. In the words and actions of her severely impaired mother, the author finds guidance toward a better, more compassionate question to ask about dementia: how can we best strive to "keep the cares together"?<br>

Abstract: Oneness refers to the convention of recognizing a single individual's performance and ignoring others, including those who may have performed as well. Although oneness is an adaptation to cognitive deficits, it cannot be explained by them. If long-term and working memory were more capacious, society's need for ideals to establish realm-specific standards and meanings would tend to limit recognition and renown to one individual. The apotheosis of Rosa Parks is a case in point. Her celebrity and the obscurity of others who risked and accomplished more than she are two aspects of the same social process. Revealing oneness to be a social imperative, this case study leads to a broader understanding of collective forgetting.<br>

Abstract: Une étude de la vie aborigène dans la région subarctique au début des explorations européennes doit nécessairement s'appuyer sur des textes. On a consulté un de ces textes en particulier: le récit d'exploration. Le genre " récit " cependant n'est plus compris comme il se doit. Il a été traité comme un réservoir de 1) différents faits sur la vie aborigène; 2) dont le sens est déterminé indépendamment de la forme cognitive et linguistique dans laquelle les faits ont été coulés. Les études actuelles ne réussissent pas à comprendre 1) comment le sens des événements et des activités est structuré dans les textes, ni 2) comment l'histoire peut être interprétée. Pour éviter ces incompréhensions, on doit adopter une perspective adaptée à l'époque historique étudiée. L'histoire, croit-on, exige qu'on prenne d'abord le point de vue de celui qui l'a produite.<br>

Abstract: Cet article aborde un aspect du processus d'interprétation de la vie religieuse ou cloîtrée amorcé au sein des communautés religieuses catholiques romaines dans les années '70. On avance que, durant cette période de transition, on a fait l'expérience d'un rejet massif du concept de "cloître" en tant que clôture au sens physique, en soulignant le fait qu'il y avait là plus qu'une simple modification de la pratique communautaire, axé sur une réalité transcendante de caractère utopique qu'on aurait voulu orientée en direction d'une expérience communautaire de caractère profane. En fait, ce type de rejet apparaît comme une transformation du concept de "cloître," ne niant point le fait de la continuité au niveau de l'identité communautaire. Les religieuses catholiques romaines ont eu recours à deux images de pointe: la fiancée éternelle du Christ et le clown, ou bouffon, du monde profane. /// This paper examines one aspect of the interpretive process undertaken by religious communities of North American Roman Catholic sisters in the 1970s, or the redefinition of cloister. It is suggested that during this transitional period, widespread rejection of the concept of cloister as physical enclosure was more than a mere illustrative shift away from a communal paradigm stressing utopian transcendence, and toward a communal paradigm identified as profane. In fact, this rejection signaled a transformation in the concept of cloister that allowed for continuity in communal themes of identity across contrasting paradigms. To effect this transformation, Roman Catholic sisters contrasted two liminal images: the transcendent Bride of Christ, and the profane clown.<br>

Abstract: Alberto Guerreiro Ramos's intellectual trajectory is analyzed to show his permanent concern with the condition of contemporary humanity. Two moments in his trajectory are specifically addressed. In the first, under the strong influence of Christian intellectual thought, the category of human person was most important to him. In the second moment he sought to demonstrate autonomy from those earlier influences, secularized his thought, and coined the expression Parenthetical Man, which was central to his criticism of the social sciences and especially of organizational theory. From this he proposed his theory of social system delimitation. From this point of view, it is possible to affirm that Guerreiro Ramos's sociology is predominantly antropocentric, in other words, Ramos takes man as the main reference in his design of social systems.<br>

Abstract: Recent attempts by geographers to explore the human experience of space have focused on overt behavior and its cognitive foundations. The language and style of our descriptions, however, often fail to speak in categories appropriate for the elucidation of lived experience, and we need to evaluate our modes of knowing in the light of modes of being in the everyday world. Phenomenologists provide some guidelines for this task. They point to the preconsciously given aspects of behavior and perception residing in the "lifeworld"-the culturally defined spatiotemporal setting or horizon of everyday life. Scientific procedures which separate "subjects" and "objects," thought and action, people and environments are inadequate to investigate this lifeworld. The phenomenological approach ideally should allow lifeworld to reveal itself in its own terms. In practice, however, phenomenological descriptions remain opaque to the functional dynamism of spatial systems, just as geographical descriptions of space have neglected many facets of human experience. There are certain avenues for dialogue between these two disciplines in three major research areas: the sense of place, social space, and time-space rhythms. Such a dialogue could contribute to a more humanistic foundation for human geography.<br>

Abstract: Le verset de la lumière a fait l'objet de nombreux commentaires allant de la simple interprétation littérale à l'interprétation allégorique qui mobilise un lourd appareil herméneutique et doctrinal. Cette étude passe en revue les premières exégèses basées sur le contact direct avec les témoins de la révélation, et examine ensuite trois interprétations relatives à trois modes de pensée différents: 1) l'interprétation philosophique d'Ibn Sīnā qui justifie le système métaphysique par le recours au texte de la tradition (le Coran); 2) l'interprétation symbolique de Ġazālī qui crée une interaction entre les idées philosophiques et l'expérience mystique, sous l'égide d'une visée éminemment «théologique»; 3) l'interprétation soufie d'Ibn 'Arabī qui se laisse guider par l'énoncé du Coran et son esprit. Le verset de la lumière offre une multitude d'interprétations en fonction de l'esprit doctrinal qui prédomine. Les symboles employés sont autant un «texte» qu'un «prétexte» pour légitimer un point de vue ou une visée théorique.<br>

Abstract: On peut opposer point par point la conclusion d,uHazaran" a la conclusion de "La
Pierre qui pousse" d'Albert Camus. Dans cette nouvelle, d'Arrast est un ingenieur fran-
cais qui se rend a Itaqua, une petite ville du Bresil, pour construire une digue et proteger
les habitants du bidonville contre les crues du fleuve. Dans Tepilogue du recit, d'Arrast
vient s'etablir lui-meme au centre de la nouvelle communaute. On voit ici tout ce qui
separe les deux ecrivains. Tandis que Camus met Taccent sur Tintegration des minorites
dans la ville, sur la justice sociale et sur les bienfaits de la technologie moderne, Le Clezio
refuse en bloc les produits de la vie moderne et decrit une quete du sacre qui conduit
ses personnages a la fuite et a la rupture. La ou Camus presente une vision optimiste et
positive des relations Nord/Sud, Le Clezio met Taccent sur Tantagonisme foncier des deux
blocs. La oil Camus cherche un compromis entre le rejet de la religion etablie (la proces-
sion) et la hantise du sacre (la macumba), Le Clezio privilegie Tapport des philosophies
orientales. Sur ce point, voir Tentretien de Tecrivain avec Claude Cavallero (172-73).<br>

Abstract: The interdependence of language and culture highlights the need to find methods for second language students to acquire cultural information and practices. This article reviews definitions of culture posited by anthropologists and language educators and discusses problems related to the recent paradigm shift from "small 'c' and big 'C'" as classifications for culture to the three 'P's of products, practices, and perspectives proposed by the Standards for Foreign Language Learning in the 21st Century (National Standards 2006). Drawing from Kramsch's (1993) postulate of real culture (C1) versus perceived culture (C1'), the current study solicited responses to a questionnaire regarding the practices of Spaniards from two age groups (young and mature) and American students involved in a study abroad program in Spain. Data analyses reveal that perceptions of American Students most closely align with those of Young Spaniards. Implications point to the need for intervention and instruction to provide students with a broader perspective of Spain's cultural practices.<br>

Abstract: Le mot « traduction » est à l'honneur: le philosophe Paul Ricœur l'érige en principe éthique, la « traductologie » se pose en nouvelle discipline littéraire et un courant de la sociologie des sciences le prend pour paradigme. Au-delà de ce dernier usage analogique, n'y a-t-il pas place pour une sociologie de la traduction qui ne soit pas seulement une sociographie des traducteurs amateurs ou professionnels, ni même une annexe fonctionnelle de la théorie des champs culturels et de leurs échanges inégaux? L'événement éditorial que constitue une nouvelle traduction littéraire de la Bible offre ainsi au sociologue matière à associer ses dimensions linguistiques, institutionnelles et relationnelles pour déterminer une « configuration traductive » exemplaire de la rencontre équivoque entre mondes littéraires, médiatiques et religieux en contexte de modernité avancée. The word « translation » has pride of place at the present time: the philosopher Paul Ricœur sets it up as an ethical principle, « translation studies » become a new international subject and the sociology of sciences takes it up as paradigm. Beyond this last figurative use, the question is how can we draw up a sociology of translation apart from studies of professional sets and transnational cultural exchanges? The New Bible Translation, a recent literary event in the French-speaking world, gives matter for combining linguistic, institutional and relational points of view. This translation case as a sociological configuration accounts for this ambiguous meeting point — at the crossroads between literature, religion and publishing — in advanced modernity.<br>

Author(s): Scheuch Erwin K.<br>
Abstract: First of all an overview is presented of the development in the social sciences that led to postmodernism. The starting point for this is the modernity that was under the influence of Parsons after the second World War. It extended to the Third World mainly in the context of development research. Since the end of the 1970s the contributions of two German scientists, Niklas Luhmann and Jürgen Habermas, have received international recognition. During this time the first critical voices concerning the modernist theories were heard. Among ideas opposing these theories the approaches should be named first, which the author calls "post industrial". To these he counts primarily the analysis of the modern socio-economic system by Daniel Bell and the studies of the "post-material personality" by Ronald Inglehart. Research on the change of values in modern societies should be named in the same context. However, "post-industrial" should not be confused with "post-modern". The origin of the latter term from the "culture scene" is explained. The language of the post-modernists can be viewed as their characteristic, as well as the attempts of deconstruction imprinted by Derrida. Ever since Lyotard the strong bond between the name and the named object within the language has been questioned. Therefore, Jean Baudrillard is correct in noting a loss in the sense of orientation of the modern human being. For example, the works of two post-modernists, Anthony Giddens and Ulrich Beck, are discussed in detail, after which the author concludes: "That is the most important meaning of postmodernity: as a symbol for the weakened autonomy of the sciences and arts, as a lack for the support of sciences in culture and politics". Nevertheless one can observe a return to rationality in recent years.<br>

askesis preparatory to the understanding of scripture, which in turn is intended to
nourish the ascetic discipline required for an understanding of scripture."<br>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to analyse some questions proposed by the debate on the issue of modernity and post-modernity in the context of the philosophy of Leonardo Coimbra, from the reflection on these issues made by Jürgen Habermas in the work
         The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity. Thus, the critique to modern reason, the reflection on the metaphysics, the issues about the relationship between reason and faith, the religious phenomenon, the process of secularization, are our starting point for the questioning and the philosophical understanding that postmodernity makes of these problems The inauguration of this new rationality allows a new questioning about the reason and the world, manifesting the sublime character of its nature, allowing a new reflection, a critique of self-sufficient and self-reflexive reason and recovering another discursive and cooperative form of reason.<br>

Abstract: Voir la place considérable des
opérations de nettoyage des instruments

De même, dans un atelier de fabrication,
les surfaces lisses de l'objet impeccable
font qu'«une rayure, une couche

l'incapacité de l'ouvrier (R. Linhart,
op. cit., 1978, p. 57). En conséquence,
la révolte peut s'adresser directement
à l'objet, comme lorsqu'un ouvrier
«se met à hurler [...] se précipite sur
les ailes des voitures en brandissant
son tournevis comme un poignard [et]
lacère une bonne dizaine de
carrosseries» (ibid., p. 59). On se
souvient aussi des dramatiques déboires
de l'être à l'établi. L'arrivée d'un établi
neuf, normal et fonctionnel, rompt
le régime de familiarité et brise
le retoucheur non seulement dans son
habileté mais aussi dans sa personnalité.
Pris de «gestes maladroits», il
«s'embrouille», «rougit, gêné», alors que
son supérieur martèle les conditions de
l'épreuve de qualification industrielle :
«Je vous observe depuis un quart

La meilleure des machines ne sert à rien
si celui qui l'utilise ne fait pas l'effort
d'en comprendre le fonctionnement
et de s'en servir correctement. On vous
monte une installation moderne,
soigneusement mise au point, et voilà
ce que vous en faites!» (ibid., p. 173).<br>

au mieux capables de répondre par oui ou non à une
question préconçue, mais incapables de déplacer les

Abstract: Much the same is true of those 'Utopian realists' who, I suggested earlier, in this respect
at least make common cause with Dunn. Giddens, for example, insists that we must
'balance Utopian ideals with realism' given the extremely high-consequence risks of
contemporary social life, echoing Dunn's insistence on the complexity and risk inherent in
modernity, and Booth stresses that his utopianism is not an end-point Utopia but a process
Utopia, agreeing with Dunn's concern that the third task of political theory is to conceive
of realistic ways of getting from where we are to where we might, and should, aim to be.<br>

on justice and self-interest, however, and it is removed from other topics in the Persian
Letters, despite the efforts of Hundert and Nelles to stretch the metaphor to its breaking
point. See E.J. Hundert and Paul Nelles, 'Liberty and Theatrical Space in Montesquieu's

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: i327937<br>
Date: 9 1, 1979<br>
Author(s): Watson-Gegeo Karen Ann<br>
Abstract: Two traditions have been vying for supremacy in the area of cultural analysis. The first sees culture as encompassing the totality of socially learned human phenomena; the second restricts the term to shared mental-primarily cognitive-properties. David Schneider has achieved a dominant positon in the latter school. In this paper I examine critically Schneider's approach to culture, with special attention to the problems raised by his perspective with respect to intracultural consistency and contradiction. While agreeing that the ethnographer must attempt to shun prior assumptions as to the nature of symbolic and conceptual domains recognized by the people under study, that it is incumbent on the anthropologist to comprehend reality from the natives' point of view before attempting to formulate laws or generalizations, that the symbolic systems and their associated meanings plays an essential part in making sense of any human action system, I shall argue that cultures do not exhibit the degree of integration, consistency, and articulation assumed by Schneider, that in his attempt to render culture wholly integrated and consisten he strips the concept of its analytic utility, that social action and symbolic systems are empirically and epistemologically more closely intertwined than he would lead us to believe, and that the very debate over what culture "really" is constitutes an exercise in reification.<br>

Issue: i27642764<br>
Date: 12 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Casey Edward<br>
Abstract: This essay begins by situating the work of David Carr in relation to the reception of phenomenology in the United States. It addresses Carr's early (and continuing) contributions to the philosophy of history, especially as this topic emerges in Husserl's middle and later writings. The idea of point of view as this emerges in Carr's own writings on history is examined, with special attention to differences between its spatial and temporal instantiations. Carr's emphasis on the primacy of temporality in human experience is contrasted with an approach that is more appreciative of the role of place in this experience. It is suggested that place offers an important alternative to time as a basis for the understanding of history and narrative.<br>

Author(s): Vasterling Veronica<br>
Abstract: In this essay I compare Nussbaum's and Arendt's approach to narrativity. The point of the comparison is to find out which approach is more adequate for practical philosophy: the approach influenced by cognitive theory (Nussbaum) or the one influenced by hermeneutic phenomenology (Arendt). I conclude that Nussbaum's approach is flawed by methodological solipsism, which is due to her application of cognitive theory.<br>

Author(s): Motta Sérgio Vicente<br>
Abstract: A presente análise do conto "Seqüência", do livro Primeiras estórias, de Guimarães Rosa, pretende demonstrar um recurso recorrente de estruturação das "estórias" do autor. Esses enredos mobilizam, de uma maneira geral, o motivo da viagem e, de uma maneira particular, o percurso do eterno retorno. Nesse trajeto estrutura-se a travessia por um rito de passagem, cujo desfecho dá-se, com uma espécie de sobrelevação lendária, numa paisagem mítica. Para perfazer esse processo, o autor parte de um motivo da cultura popular que acaba amalgamado ao universo da tradição erudita, por meio de referências à tradição da história do gênero da narrativa e de seus códigos míticos. /// This analysis of "Seqüência", a short story from the book Primeiras estórias, by Guimarães Rosa, aims at showing a recurrent device used in the author's stories. These plots have, in a general sense, the motif of travel and, in a strict sense, the journey of eternal return. In this path, the traverse is structured through a rite of passage, whose completion occurs at a mythical scenery as a sort of legendary lifting. In order to accomplish this process, the author's starting point is a motif of popular culture, which ends up by being amalgamated to the universe of the erudite tradition, through references to the narrative genre historical traditions and to its mythical codes.<br>

Abstract: Oponiéndose a la perspectiva que reduce toda problemática vinculada a las drogas al orden del exceso y descontrol, este trabajo interroga la articulación entre ciertas consecuencias del capitalismo neoliberal en Argentina y la variación en las prácticas de consumo de drogas en conjuntos sociales vulnerables. Particularmente, examino el vínculo entre el sufrimiento social generado por la violencia cotidiana y el trauma crónico engendrado por la pobreza y la exclusión social y el consumo de cierta sustancia popularmente denominada "pasta". La producción del olvido, la fragmentación de la memoria y la disociación son los estados que los usuarios asocian y/o promueven con el uso de esta sustancia. De este modo, el argumento de este trabajo consiste en que mientras el uso de drogas se convierte en una de las pocas alternativas que los jóvenes disponen para aliviar el sufrimiento social asociado con la destitución social, esta condena al olvido limita el potencial para que los recuerdos y las experiencias se conviertan en materia prima para el trabajo de la memoria, la constitución de una capital emocional compartido e identidades sociales complejas. /// This work, opposing to the perspective that reduces all problems related with drugs to excess and lack of control, deals with the articulation between some consequences of neoliberal capitalism in Argentina and the variation in practices of drug taking in vulnerable social groups. It analizes especially the link between social suffering generated by day-to-day violence, chronical trauma engendered by poverty and social exclusion, and the taking of a substance popularly called "pasta". Production of forgetfulness, fragmentation of memory and dissociation are the conditions associated or promoted by consumers through the use of this substance. The point of this work is that while the use of drugs becomes one of the few alternatives young people have to aliviate social suffering associated with social destituteness, it conde~<br>

Issue: i27859582<br>
Date: 10 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): ATZENI PAOLA<br>
Abstract: Using an "anthropo-pragmatic" approach, this essay analyzes the speech made by Mussolini in the square in Carbonia, Sardinia, on 18 December 1938. The analysis also takes in other speeches and reveals the power of Mussolini's logos: this was not simply inaugural, ritual and foundational in its celebration of the new town, but recognised a historic turning point in the policies of the Italian nation and empire in the passage of the fascist state from ruralism to industrial urbanism. By broadening the study, the power of Mussolini's declarative strategy becomes more apparent. Also that other subjects were submerged with subversive micro-narrations of different types. Finally, multiple discourses, practices and complex negotiating subjects appeared in the post-fascist democracy. The "anthropo-pragmatic" approach, which is at first restricted, is later broadened and utilized on a speech-by-speech basis: from the comical and satirical to the poetic and the contractual. Highlighting the discursive conflicts at work, examples are emphasized of dialectical speeches that constitute and characterize other antagonists and protagonists of democratic cultural modernity: the nurse-comedy-writer, miner-poet, and miner-trade unionist. In the new fascism these figures test new risky declarations that were also practices of freedom, caring for oneself and many others, to the extent of spreading into democratic relations. These speeches and themes operate in a setting where discursive and identity-related powers meet, hidden and manifest, public and private, in the mine and the city.<br>

Issue: i27919256<br>

Author(s): Smith Jonathan Z.<br>
Abstract: This essay makes explicit what lay behind the author's earlier casual observation that "Tillich remains the unacknowledged theoretician of our entire enterprise"—whether in the AAR or in North American studies of religion more generally. While the article does not make a narrowly (i.e., archivally verified) causal claim about Tillich's influence on the study of religion in the academy, it does point out three crucial roles Tillich's thought and practice played in the development of North American religious studies. (i) Tillich's understanding of religion as an "ultimate concern" provided a language deemed suitable to the new departments of religious studies in this country's higher education institutions (especially at state-run colleges and universities). (ii) Though not uniquely formative of the academy's longstanding discourse on symbolism, Tillich's interest in the symbol served as a legitimating vote of confidence about the worth of that discourse. Moreover, his understanding of the symbol (as that which "points to") ostensibly struck a balance between Eliade's onto-realistic and Geertz's more minimal fictive views of the symbol. (iii) Through his sustained interest in cultural institutions and products of cultural labor—more than through his theories about the relation between religion and culture (e.g., his method of correlation)—Tillich inspired the "dialogic fields" (e.g., Religion and Literature) and subsequent cultural and anthropological studies of religion. The author's earlier claim, then, was intended as a double critique: first, that the study of religion in secular public institutions should ground itself in a Protestant Christian theological project; second, that this influence should remain largely unacknowledged.<br>

Abstract: Sociocultural anthropology and evolutionary biology have reached the point at which it is possible to give a coherent and synthetic account of the origins of human cultural variability. From a sociocultural perspective what must be explained is not just the fact of varying cultures and societies, but also the human capacity to create, maintain and alter social forms over time. From a biological perspective we have to ask, what is the selective advantage of such variability? The answer lies in human sociality. Sociality consists in a package of social intellectual capacities-higher order intentionality, pedagogy, narrativity, crativity, speech-which made possible an increasing division of labour. But as these capacities grew, they gave rise to distinctively human (rather than Darwinian) history, that is to the forms of social, political, economic and cultural causation which create ever new variations on the theme of social existence.<br>

Abstract: Partant de l'analyse de la situation mémorielle actuelle, cet article diagnostique la question qu'elle fait naître pour la mémoire relative à l'esclavage dans les Antilles françaises, prise dans une frénésie qui renforce l'idée de mémoires soudainement inventées. Des mémoires de l'esclavage de l'ordre de la circulation intergénérationnelle sont-elles présentes? Cette question renvoie au débat anthropologique propre à ces sociétés où la mémoire collective relative à l'esclavage a longtemps été tenue pour être absente. À partir d'une recherche conduite sur un événement ancien qui reconduit le cadre du conflit originel entre maîtres et esclaves, à savoir l'insurrection de 1870 à la Martinique, l'article décrit les processus mémoriels qu'il a générés. Le recueil de témoignages auprès des descendants des insurgés rend compte de la présence de récits familiaux transmis jusqu'à aujourd'hui selon des modalités particulières liées aux conséquences de la répression de l'événement insurrectionnel. L'interprétation qui s'en dégage amène à revoir la question de la mémoire collective à la Martinique. Taking the analysis of the current memory situation as a starting point, this article analyses the question that it provokes about the memory of slavery in the French West Indies, subjected to a frenzy that reinforced the notion of spontaneously invented memories. Is there an inter-generational dissemination of slavery memory? This question refers to the anthropological debate in societies where collective memory about slavery has long been deemed absent. Using research carried out on an historical event that revives the framework of the original master/slave conflict, namely the 1870 insurrection in Martinique, we describe the memory processes this generated. The collection of accounts from descendentes of the rebels shows that family accounts have been transmitted until this day, using specific forms related to the consequences of the repression of the rebellion.

Abstract: Cet article confronte la théorie du mythe d'Ernst Cassirer à celle de Claude Lévi-Strauss. Il cherche à démontrer que, en dépit de leurs préoccupations différentes, le philosophe s'intéressant au mythe en tant qu'aspect de l'activité de la pensée humaine et l'anthropologue voyant dans les mythes un aspect de la pensée sur l'activité humaine se rencontrent sur plusieurs points. En particulier, cette étude comparative fait ressortir l'unité qui leur sert à tous deux de point de départ et qui permet au philosophe de construire l'homme et à l'anthropologue de le disséquer.<br>

Issue: i30154373<br>
Date: 10 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Wogenstein Sebastian<br>
Abstract: The question how to situate Dea Loher's drama Manhattan Medea in the Medea reception serves as a point of departure for a discussion of imitation, originality, and the act of copying. In their dialogues, the characters Medea, as in Euripides' tragedy a refugee, and Velazquez, a security guard, reflect on originality and imitation. The article explores the theoretical and self-referential aspects evoked by these discussions and links them with a more general inquiry into the dimensions of interpretation in the arts. The question of originality and appropriation is expanded and problematized through focusing on radical social criticism voiced among others by the drag queen Deaf Daisy. In this context the article also examines the potential of performative signification encountered in Medea's deadly bridal gift, especially in light of Marjorie Garber's remark that "[w]hat gets married is a dress." Transgressive in its form too, Manhattan Medea combines tragic elements and those characteristic of comedy.<br>

Publisher: University of Wisconsin Press<br>
Issue: i30161639<br>
Date: 12 1, 1993<br>
Author(s): Konzett Matthias<br>
Abstract: This essay, written more than a year after the surfacing of the Wolf debate, examines the complex connection between politics and art which the case of Christa Wolf exemplifies. Was bleibt, a novella which evokes Hölderlin's grand assertion of the poet's pervasive founding spirit-"Was aber bleibt, stiften die Dichter"-forms the central point of the inquiry. The essay challenges the facile dismissal of literature, as exemplified in Wolf's case, on the sole basis of ideological deficiencies of the writer. It interprets these two domains as essentially different yet complementary in their aspiration towards social transformation. In this light, Christa Wolf's work can be seen as a belated attempt to work towards such a differentiation so as to free the artist from a false confusion and entanglement of these two domains.<br>

Article Title: Recovering Politics for Socialism: Two Responses to the Language of Community<br>
Publisher: Wilfrid Laurier University Press<br>
Issue: i362030<br>
Date: 12 1, 1976<br>
Author(s): Lane Richard<br>
Abstract: Socialism is often defined in terms of "community," or, as Professor John Wilson once put it, as a "society of friends." Thus defined, it is contrasted with the competitive relations of bourgeois society. But in some recent theory and practice, political competition is taken to be a defining feature of a legitimate socialist order. The persistence of political institutions is thus stressed, both by Western socialist theorists and by reformers in Eastern and Central Europe, and the orthodox view that "state" is to be superseded by "community" is sharply rejected. These two critiques differ, however, in one major respect: for Western socialists, the state is to be legitimated by the principles of socialist rationality, while for many reformers of Eastern and Central Europe it is to be legitimated by political life itself. From this second point of view, neither "friendship" nor "rationality" responds to the tensions which a socialist polity, no less than any other, will face: for both these concepts, to the extent that they are taken to set pre-established norms, constrict the "space for political action," and thus remove the necessary conditions for legitimacy. /// Le socialisme est souvent défini en termesde << communauté >> ou, selon l'expression de John Wilson, comme une << société d'amis >>. Cette définition permet d'établir un contraste avec les relations de compétition de la société bourgeoise. Toutefois, d'aprés les développements des faits et de la théorie, la compétition politique devient une caractéristique d'une société socialiste légitime. La persistance des institutions politiques est maintenant soutenue, aussi bien par tes théoriciens socialistes de l'Quest que par les réformateurs du Centre et de l'Est de l'Europe: la vision orthodoxe du remplacement de l'<< Etat >> par la << communauté >> est maintenant rejetée. Les critiques formulées par ces deux courants different principalement sur un aspect: pour les socialistes de l'Ouest, l'Etat est légitimé pa~<br>

Publisher: Wilfrid Laurier University Press<br>
Issue: i362155<br>
Date: 3 1, 1962<br>
Author(s): Opitz Ellis<br>
Abstract: Eric Voegelin's master work is Order and History, published over a period of three decades with the fifth and final volume appearing posthumously in 1987. The focus of attention here is on the first of these volumes, Israel and Revelation (1956), which may be regarded as intellectually the sequel of volumes two and three, since the writing of those volumes (published in 1957) antedates composition of the study of Israel. From the outset, Voegelin makes clear that his concern is with a philosophy of order historically grounded as the primary means of combating the contemporary crisis of human existence, which he identifies with pervasive deformation of consciousness by ideology and the threat of civilization's extinction through totalitarian mass movements. Thus the task is to regain reality through a recovery of the principal experiences upon which man's historical existence is dependent, with both diagnostic and therapeutic intentions. The attention to the historical record is a means of anamnetically overcoming the social amnesia that threatens to extinguish human existence as it has emerged over millennia back to the Stone Age. Diagnosis and therapy are intended to go hand in hand, since the eclipse of reality, and especially of its highest and hegemonic dimension, the divine Ground of being, in favour of various substitute grounds, is the principal danger to be understood and addressed. The enduring experience of open existence in history is glimpsed, in man's continual Exodus in loving partnership with God, in tension toward the mystery symbolized in eschatological fulfillment. /// L'oeuvre maîtresse d'Eric Voegelin est intitulé Order and History.

Abstract: This essay critically examines the clash between conventionalist and absolutist, relativist and dogmatist political theory. The author's point of departure is a confrontation of the historicism of Sabine with Easton's attack, which held historicism largely responsible for the poverty of political theory. Exposing the common foundation of Sabine's and Easton's positions in a sceptical and faulty dogmatism, he argues that the problem can be resolved through a theory of personal knowledge.<br>

Abstract: Interpretation has been an issue in political theory for nearly two decades, but its influence for the most part has been limited to problems in the history of ideas. In this article, William Adams uses the methodological claims of the "new historians" of political thought as a point of departure to argue for an interpretive approach to contemporary theory. He contends that an important part of the task of political theory is to fashion critical interpretations of contemporary political culture. He claims further that many of the great works in the history of political thought pursue a strategy of this sort and might therefore be useful as models of political/cultural criticism. Adams elaborates his thesis with a brief analysis of Plato's critique of poetry in the Republic.<br>

Article Title: In the Dark Backward: Time in Pindaric Narrative<br>
Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i371935<br>
Date: 12 1, 1899<br>
Author(s): Zeilinski R. Drew<br>
Abstract: This paper considers the temporal relationship between account and story in the narrative passages of Pindar's odes. Highly selective, each narrative covers a vast extent of story-time, creating rapidly juxtaposed tableaux. The account typically begins near the end of the story, proceeding backwards by stages until it reaches the beginning. Thence it returns through all, some, or none of the intermediary stages until it has reached its starting point, beyond which it may then continue forward in time. Prophecy and foreshadowing provide a counterpoint to this basically analeptic structure. Different story lines, simultaneous events, and alternative possibilities all find their place in the narrative. The length of account-time is generally less than that of story-time and diminishes as the narrative proceeds. Repetition is necessitated by the backward and then forward order of combination as well as serving other purposes. Elaboration, when it occurs, serves to explain events that are improbable or inconsistent with the maxims contained in the non-narrative passages.<br>

Author(s): Young Isabelle<br>
Abstract: L'article fait le point sur la crise de la totalisation en ethnographie et sur les perspectives qui s'offrent actuellement pour la dépasser. Il résume les grandes lignes de l'ethnographie " intégrative " qui s'est constituée dans le prolongement de l'anthropologie sociale et culturelle, autour de l'idée de totalisation monographique. Puis il discute la critique qui en a été faite et les nouvelles formes de rapports entre enquête et écriture qui ont été explorées dans les démarches narratives. Il envisage enfin, sous le terme d'ethnographie " combinatoire ", les pratiques d'enquête qui se sont mises en place dans le cadre de l'interactionnisme puis des développements récents de la sociologie de l'action. Partant de la question de la totalisation des données dans chacune de ces trois formes d'empirie ethnographique, il caractérise les différentes formes d'altérité ainsi constituées dans le cours de l'enquête. /// This article considers the crisis of totalisation in ethnography and the perspectives that are currently available to overstep it. It summarizes the major lines of "integrative ethnography" which has developed as a prolongation of social and cultural anthropology, around the idea of monographical totalisation. The article goes on to discuss the criticism it received and the new types of relation between survey and wiriting that have been explored in the narrative approach. It then imagines ethnographical practice which, by distinguishing between generalisation and totalisation, is put into place in the light of interactionism, then recent developments of action sociology. /// Der Aufsatz berichtet über den heutigen Stand der Totalisierungskrise in der Ethnographie und über die heute bestehende Aussichten, Fortschritte zu verzeichnen.

Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i370160<br>
Date: 9 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): Young Brian<br>
Abstract: Using life narrative interviews with Arab students with Israeli citizenship collected in 1997-98, I inquire into the processes and problems in talking about one's collective identity. In particular, I address how Arab students manage multiple identifications and the role of social relationships in shaping identity narratives. First, I argue that identity narratives do not voice a single point of view. Rather, identity narratives articulate multiple affiliations that, often, cohere in an uneasy fashion. Our identities are not incoherent, but such multiplicity provides the opportunity for talking about identity in novel ways. Second, I argue that social relationships are an integral part of identity stories that work to introduce, close off, balance, and rebalance possible self-identifications. In talking about identity, we narrativize our social relationships, and these narrated relationships are key points in the plotline of our identity stories. Drawing on this interpretation, I argue that social policies that equalize power relations and allow for the creation of social relationships based on mutual respect have the potential to shape identities that, without giving up valued affiliations, contain an acceptance of the other at their core.<br>

Article Title: The Ontology of "Political Violence": Action and Identity in Civil Wars<br>
Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i288399<br>
Date: 9 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): Zur Stathis N.<br>
Abstract: I discuss several conceptual problems raised by current understandings of political violence, especially as they pertain to actions, motivations, and identities in civil wars. Actions "on the ground" often turn out to be related to local and private conflicts rather than the war's driving (or "master") cleavage. The disjunction between dynamics at the top and at the bottom undermines prevailing assumptions about civil wars, which are informed by two competing interpretive frames, most recently described as "greed and grievance." Rather than posit a dichotomy between greed and grievance, I point to the interaction between political and private identities and actions. Civil wars are not binary conflicts, but complex and ambiguous processes that foster the "joint" action of local and supralocal actors, civilians, and armies, whose alliance results in violence that aggregates yet still reflects their diverse goals. It is the convergence of local motives and supralocal imperatives that endows civil wars with their particular and often puzzling character, straddling the divide between the political and the private, the collective and the individual.<br>

Abstract: N'y aurait-il que les philosophes à s'interroger sur le temps? Les historiens resteraient-ils positivistes au point de bouder toute réflexion sur cette catégorie qui gît pourtant au cœur de leur discipline? "L'ordre du temps," de K. Pomian, qui vient de paraître chez Gallimard, montre combien le temps des historiens a varié et à quels dangers ils s'exposent en n'y prenant pas garde. /// Should time be a philosophical question? In general, French historians seem to have neglected this essential problem concerning reflection on time. Both because of a positivist tradition which seeks the linearity of the event and of a mistrust of the philosophy of history, they have not wanted to come to grips with the question of temporality. And yet the very nature of history comes from this question. K. Pomian's recent book, "L'ordre du temps" (Gallimard) illustrates the richness of the philosophic thinking on the variation of the notion of time and its importance in understanding the various historical schools.<br>

Abstract: Au départ, quatre groupes discriminés au nom de la nationalité française: les femmes qui épousaient un étranger, les naturalisés restés inéligibles, les juifs depuis Vichy, les musulmans d'Algérie. Au point d'arrivée: chez les deux derniers groupes, des traces si fortes et si durables qu'elles ont pu créer un sentiment de non reconnaissance et de rejet. Voici, par un de nos meilleurs spécialistes, le point sur une hantise française très présente. Et un appel au travail d'histoire. L'article examine la discrimination dont furent victimes, depuis le Code civil et l'installation de la République, quatre catégories de Français: les femmes qui ont épousé un étranger; les naturalisés de fraîche date qui n'ont pas joui de tous les droits civiques, en matière de vote et d'élection notamment; les juifs victimes des mesures raciales sous Vichy; les musulmans dans l'Algérie coloniale. Il détaille tout particulièrement les traumatismes que cette situation a engendrés jusqu'à nos jours chez les deux dernières catégories et propose de renouveler l'analyse historique de certains d'entre eux. /// The article examines, since the Civil Code and the setting up of the Republic, the discrimination that four categories of French people were victims of: the women that married foreigners; those recently naturalized that didn't enjoy all their civic rights in voting and elections in particular; the jews who were victims of racial measures during the Vichy government; the Muslims in colonial Algeria. It details the traumatisms that this situation continues to engender in the last two categories and mentions plans to revisit the historical analysis of some of them.<br>

Abstract: Hannah Arendt's and Charlotte Delbo's writings about the Holocaust trouble our preconceptions about those who do evil and those who suffer evil. Their jarring terms "banal evil" and "useless knowledge" point to limitations and temptations facing scholars of evil. While Arendt helps us to resist the temptation to mythologize evil, Delbo helps us to resist the temptation to domesticate suffering.<br>

Issue: i40000783<br>
Date: 10 1, 1996<br>
Author(s): Schweiker William<br>
Abstract: As Kosky and Avram show, the work of Levinas represents a significant contribution because (1) he takes seriously the challenge posed by the decay of religious traditions and other inherited frameworks of meaning and (2) he insists on the unconditional character of the good. Nonetheless, critical questions about the adequacy of this contribution need to be pressed more forcefully. I suggest that from the point of view of theological ethics his work is problematic in three ways: (1) He can give little guidance concerning what values we ought to seek; (2) in indentifying the good with the event of encountering the completely other, he falsely in- flates moral demands at the same time that he devalues commonalities; and (3) he offers scant grounds for affirming the goodness of being.<br>

Article Title: Hermeneutics and Ethics: The Example of Reinhold Niebuhr<br>
Publisher: Religious Ethics, Inc.<br>
Issue: i40000905<br>
Date: 4 1, 1980<br>
Author(s): McCann Dennis P.<br>
Abstract: This essay explores the imaginative foundations of ethics, not by presenting a theory about the moral imagination, but by reconstructing the hermeneutic strategy underlying Reinhold Niebuhr's proposal for "an independent Christian ethic." The thesis is that Niebuhr's ethic cannot adequately be evaluated without careful attention to his hermeneutics, what he described as "the mythical method of interpretation." This point is argued first, by reconstructing Niebuhr's hermeneutics; second, by showing how his hermeneutics determines the strategy of his ethics; and third, by using this focus to clarify certain issues separating Niebuhr and some of his recent critics, specifically, William Frankena's criticism of his metaethics, Gene Outka's objections to his normative ethic of love as self-sacrifice; and John Howard Yoder's rejection of the strategy of his Christian realism as a whole. The essay is presented in the hope that Niebuhr's example will encourage American religious ethicists to explore the relationship between hermeneutics and ethics with greater intellectual sympathy and theoretical sophistication. The example of Niebuhr's "independent Christian ethic" is commended as one attempt to map the formal and substantive ways in which religious visions help shape our dispositions and moral choices.<br>

Date: 3 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Wall John<br>
Abstract: Challenging a long-standing assumption of the separation of ethical from poetic activity, this essay develops the basis for a theory of moral life as inherently and radically creative. A range of contemporary post-Kantian ethicists--including Ricoeur, Nussbaum, Kearney, and Gutiérrez--are employed to make the argument that moral practice requires a fundamental capability for creative transformation, imagination, and social renewal. In addition, this poetic moral capability can finally be understood only from the primordial religious point of view of the mystery of Creation as such. Humanity as an image of its Creator is called to the endless impossible possibility of the re-creation of its own complex, plural, and fallen social world. Such a perspective is opposed to views of moral life as the application of law-like principles or the recovery of past moral histories. Without a better understanding of moral life's radically creative imperative, we miss a vital element of social relations' distinctive humanity.<br>

Article Title: The Anxiety of Inheritance: Reinhold Niebuhr and the Literal Truth of Original Sin<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>

Date: 4 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Rees Geoffrey<br>
Abstract: Widely regarded as the most influential proponent of the truth of original sin in the twentieth century, Reinhold Niebuhr worked hard to excise any "literalistic" element from his interpretation of the doctrine. In his attempt to "correct" the Augustinian tradition on original sin by purging it of all "literalistic errors," however, Niebuhr assumed as his starting point the most characteristically modern objection to the doctrine: that birth is a thoroughly natural, animal, and morally meaningless event. As a result, Niebuhr unnecessarily constrained his vision of the dimensions of human freedom, and hence his description of the dynamic of anxiety and freedom that energizes sin. Through a careful reading of Reinhold Niebuhr's writings on original sin, in light of the truth that the end of human life is inseparable from its origins, a reappraisal and recovery of the meaningfulness of the assertion of original sin as a literal inheritance is possible. The result of such a reappraisal and recovery is an amplified insight into the existential anxiety that Niebuhr otherwise described so convincingly.<br>

Article Title: Planning: An Idea of Value<br>
Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
Issue: i40003740<br>
Date: 7 1, 2002<br>
Author(s): Campbell Heather<br>
Abstract: The development of the intellectual basis for planning activity has been a slow and problematic process. This paper seeks to build on existing intellectual understanding to argue that future developments in planning thought must take questions of ethical value as their starting point. The paper is essentially divided into three parts. The first makes the important distinction between planning as a narrow set of regulatory practices and planning as an idea, or more particularly a long-enduring societal activity. It is the latter concept of planning that frames the discussion in the remainder of the paper. The second, in which the core of the argument is developed, explores the nature of planning as an activity; an activity that is centrally concerned with making ethical judgements about better and worse, with and for others, in just institutions. It is about an idea of value. The third section examines the implications of this perspective for planning as a subject of academic endeavour. The argument is illustrated throughout with examples drawn from the author's research.<br>

Abstract: Reinhart Koselleck outlined a model of historical time in various essays most of them collected in the anthologies "Zeitschichten" and "Vergangene Zukunft". The article tries to reconstruct Koselleck's transcendental principals of history. It questions Koselleck's understanding of natural time and anthropological categories. According to Hans Georg Gadamer's criticism of Koselleck, the article argues that even Koselleck's anthropological categories are always already determined by culture and history. Historical time and historical truth are constructed by historical narrations. This conviction does not imply, however, the denial of historical reality. The author suggests combining Koselleck's categories "Erfahrungsraum" and "Erwartungshorizont" with a narratological point of view.<br>

Abstract: Cet article témoigne du courage, de l'éthique et du succès, ainsi que des tourments d'une musicienne. A Madagascar, il demeure essentiel de connaître ses racines et son appartenance ethnique. Or Mama Sana a abandonné volontairement sa communauté d'origine pour se faire adopter par une autre: un acte inhabituel que les siens pourraient ressentir comme une trahison, mais aussi un choix motivé par la passion de l'autre. A une époque où l'intolérance ethnique devient cruciale, la démarche de Sana est exemplaire. La vie de cette musicienne attitrée de la famille princière fut une suite ininterrompue de succès. Et pourtant, la souffrance de la nostalgie maladive appelée jagobo est au coeur de sa musique. Elle mettait en musique la peine des individus, pour que toute la société s'y associe. Sana plonge au plus profond de son inspiration pour chanter la nostalgie et la passion amoureuse, qui l'amènent à décrìre ses propres passions. A la fin de sa vie, cette virtuose de la valiha, adepte de la forme ouverte, se nommait elle même "jeune fille usée". L'angoisse d'un second exode l'avait alors assaillie au point de devenir musique, du connu à l'inconnu, de la vie à l'au-delà.<br>

Publisher: Martinus Nijhoff Publishers<br>
Issue: i40010631<br>
Date: 3 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Svenaeus Fredrik<br>
Abstract: In this paper I develop a phenomenology of falling ill by presenting, interpreting and developing the basic model we find in Jean-Paul Sartre's Being and Nothingness (1956). The three steps identified by Sartre in this process are analysed, developed further and brought to a five- step model: (1) pre-reflective experience of discomfort, (2) lived, bodily discomfort, (3) suffered illness, (4) disease pondering, and (5) disease state. To fall ill is to fall victim to a gradual process of alienation, and with each step this alienating process is taken to a new qualitative level. Consequently, the five steps of falling ill have not only a contingent chronological order but also a kind of logical order, in that they typically presuppose each other. I adopt Sartre's focus on embodiment as the core ground of the alienation process, but point out that the alienation of the body in illness is not only the experience of a psychic object, but an experience of the independent life of one's own body. This facticity of the body is the result neither of the gaze of the other person, nor of a reflection adopting the outer perspective of the other in an indirect way, but is a result of the very otherness of one's own body, which addresses and plagues us when we fall ill. I use examples of falling ill and being a patient to show how a phenomenology of falling ill can be helpful in educating health-care personnel (and perhaps also patients) about the ways of the lived body.<br>

Abstract: La mayoría de las tradiciones religiosas posee en común un canon conformado por un texto o grupo de textos a los que se les concede toda la autoridad. Sin embargo, toda doctrina canónica es sujeto de exégesis, o interpretación, que presenta un riesgo, pues no reproduce de manera íntegra la ortodoxia recibida. En este ensayo se exploran dos casos de interpretaciones divergentes en las tradiciones de la India del s. II y la Inglaterra en vísperas del romanticismo. Los textos son la Tripurã-tãpinī-upanisad, de autor anónimo, y TheMarriage of Heaven and Hell, del poeta William Blake. A lo largo de este artículo el autor argumenta que ambos, en su momento, comprendieron tentativas por realizar una relectura de unos cánones religiosos que, más que rechazar abruptamente nociones o términos manejados por una tradición teológica, fueron resignificados bajo el concepto doctrinario de una energía que debe ponerse en acción. Así, un punto en común en los dos textos es que se acepta el mundo material y se le vincula con el espiritual, en vez de condenarlo. /// A large majority of religious traditions share the commonality of possessing a canon made up of a text, or a set of texts, from which all authority is said to emanate. However, canonical doctrines are the constant subjects of ex-egesis, or interpretaron, which presents a risk, given that these forms of rereading do not tend to faithfully reproduce received orthodoxy. The ob-ject of this text is to explore two exemplars of divergent interpretations within the very different canonical traditions of India in the second century AD and England at the outset of the Romantic movement of the nineteenth century. The chosen works are Trípurã-tãpinī-upanisad, which was written by an anonymous author, and William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell. Throughout this article the author maintains that both texts repre-sented important rereadings of established religious canons; however, rathern than presenting an abrupt rejection of ~<br>

Abstract: O presente estudo constitui um ensaio crítico de reflexão sobre a questão dos limites da linguagem em Wittgenstein. A perspectiva deste estudo observa, numa primeira parte, o próprio procedimento do método wittgen-steiniano e segue um modelo de discurso plural, a partir de várias perspectivas que, não só permitem desconstruir a aparente unidade da razão, como indagar interiormente do próprio limite da análise wittgensteiniana. Retomando a caracterização da linguagem e do pensamento nos seus traços fundamentais, desde o "Tractatus" até às "Investigações Filosóficas", chama-se a atenção para os pontos de dificuldade, da indefinição e da cons-trutividade do modelo de Wittgenstein. A plena lição do "autómaton" da linguagem face a uma possível diferenciação dos signos e aprofundamento lógico, constitui uma parte desta reflexão que se complementa pela referência aos horizontes de resíduo do não-linguístico, ou até do indizível, numa dupla maneira de estabelecer os limites da linguagem. Enfim, e a título conclusivo, apontam-se, não apenas os contornos do que se entende como uma moral retórica da linguagem em Wittgenstein, mas para perspectivas originais de um reaprofundamento em termos etioló-gicos de diferenciação de escala da lógica e da linguagem, e de recuperação de uma intencionalidade psico-lógico-linguística superando aquela indiferen-ciação do dizer no automático da fala estatuída na "ordinary language". /// La présente étude constitue un essai critique qui réfléchie sur la question des limites du langage dans la philosophie de Wittgenstein. Dans une première partie la perspective de cette réflexion analise les procédés que Wittgenstein lui-même utilise dans sa méthode, et pour cela se sert d'un modèle de discours pluriel, lequel permet non seulement la déconstruction de l'apparente unité de la raison, mais aussi faire une enquête au dedans des limites de l'analyse wittgensteinienne.

Abstract: Partindo de alguns pressupostos que explicitam a questão nuclear da "instância do sujeito" na obra de Ricoeur (anteriores ou contemporâneos ao debate com o estruturalismo), e que tipificam a via filosófica ricoeuriana, e partindo também da articulação axial do pensamento de Lévi-Strauss (relacionada com esse debate), são depois propostos os tópicos dessa controvérsia. Tais tópicos, que se desenvolvem em torno dos elementos já considerados, gravitam à volta da inteligibilidade do sentido e do sentido da inteligibilidade, da complementaridade dos métodos, e dos níveis semiológico e semântico, este último estabelecido mediante a pregnância da frase na linguagem, e da palavra (mot) como operador entre a estrutura e o acontecimento. /// La présente analyse commence par mettre en relief quelques présupposés qui explicitent la question nucléaire de "l'instance du sajet" dans l'oeuvre de Ricoeur (présupposés antérieurs ou contemporains du débat avec le structuralisme) et qui caractérisent le chemin philosophique de celui-ci; on prend également pour point de départ l'articulation centrale de la pensée de Lévi-Strauss relative à ce débat, afin de proposer ensuite les lignes mai-tresses de cette controverse. Ces lignes maitresses, qui se développent autour des éléments déjà mentionnés, gravitent autour de l'intelligibilité du sens et du sens de l'intelligibilité, de la complémentarité des méthodes et des niveaux sémiologique et sémantique, en établissant ce dernier niveau par le biais de la prégnance de la phrase dans le langage, et du mot comme opérateur entre la structure et l'événement. /// After presenting the presuppositions which underlie a question which is central to Ricoeur's work, "the subject as act, as instance", and which exemplify Ricoeur's way of doing philosophy, as well as presenting Lévi-Strauss' thought concerning this question, the article proposes the fundamental topics which define the controversy.

Abstract: Este artigo apresenta o pensamento mais recente de P. Ricoeur sob a perspectiva de uma lógica da produção de sentido, discutindo criticamente as possibilidades e os limites do círculo hermenêutico. Tomando como ponto de partida os pressupostos fenomenológicos e ontológicos da sua filosofia, são sucessivamente abordadas as questões relativas à interpretação textual, imaginação e criatividade, acção, tempo e narrativa, ideologia e utopia. Reconhecido um certo logocentrismo - uma mistura de Logos e de suposto real - implicado na solução destas questões que nos é proposta pelo autor, procura-se repensar a ligação entre o sentido e o consensus, a coerência e a própria questão da violéncia. Estabelece-se para isso, na última secção, um confronto entre as posições defendidas por Ricoeur e a hipótese de R. Girard sobre o desejo mimético e a violência. /// Cet article présente la pensée la plus récente de P. Ricoeur sous la perspective d'une logique de la production du sens, en discutant de façon critique les possibilités et les limites du cercle herméneutique. On prend comme point de départ les présupposés phénoménologiques et ontologiques de sa philosophie, pour aborder successivement les questions concernant l'interprétation textuelle, l'imagination et la créativité, l'action, le temps et le récit, l'idéologie et l'utopie. Tout en reconnaissant un certain logocentrisme–un mélange de Logos et de réalité supposée–impliqué dans la solution de ces questions qui nous est proposée par l'auteur, on cherche à repenser le lieu entre le sens et le consensus, la cohérence et la question même de la violence.

Abstract: O estruturalismo levistraussiano tern urn vasto alcance critico em relação ao conceitochave da filosofia do conhecimento que é a razão. Alicerçando a racionalidade num inconsciente universal, num sistema formal categórico, e postulando urn isomorfismo entre a natureza e a cultura, Lévi-Strauss faz uma critica nova da razão humana. Esta não pode ser concebida como consciência, como representação, tão ao gosto do racionalismo moderno e de algumas filosofias contemporàneas, nem perspectivada dialectica e temporalmente, como o fazem o positivismo e o hegelianismo. /// Levi-Strauss' structuralism strongly criticizes "reason", a key-concept in the philosophy of knowledge. Grounding rationality upon a universal unconscious and upon a categorical formal system, and postulating an isomorphism between nature and culture, Strauss produces a new criticism of human reason. Reason can no longer be conceived as it is both in modern rationalism and in some contemporary philosophical trends, as consciousness, as representation. Nor can it be thought of from either a temporal or a dialectical point of view, as it is in positivism and in hegelianism.<br>

Abstract: Objectivo dopresente artigo é estabelecer a relação entre a filosofia hermenêutica de Hans-Georg Gadamer e a teologia, a partir do estudo da referênda mútua que existe entre ambas. Analisa, por um lado, a influência da questão hermenêutica, em tor no a Bultmann, à "Teologia da Palavra" e ao próprio Heidegger, sobre a formulção filosofica de Gadamer; por outro, analisa a influencia exercida pela filosofia hermenêutica de Gadamer sobre a discussão teológica posterior, sobretudo ao nível da Teologia Fundamental, ou seja, de uma reflexão sobre os pressupostos hermenêuticos da própria teologia. Chega-se, desta forma, a uma tematização da metafisica, na confluência entre filosofia e teologia. O artigo salienta também a importância das reflexões de Gadamer sobre a arte e o tempo, pelas possibilidades que, para além da hermenêutica restrita, abrem ao estabelecimento de outrospontos de ligação entre a filosofia e a teologia. /// Ojective of the present article is to establish a relation between Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics and theology on the basis of an overlapping thematics. On the one hand, there is the influence of the hermeneutical question, centered around Bultmann's "Theology of the Word" and Heidegger's work, on Gadamer's philosophical discourse. On the other hand, Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics excercised an influence on fundamental theology, particularly in relation to the hermeneutical presuppositions operative in the theological enterprise. Metaphysical thematics can be thus found at the point where philosophy and theology converge. The article seeks, in addition, to bring out the importance of Gadamer's reflexions on art and time as especially useful in establishing other common concerns shared by philosophy and theology.<br>

Abstract: O enigma do mal, o escândalo do mal em todas as suasformas, não cessa de inquietar a consciência humana, revelando-se hoje como obstáculo principal à crença em Deus e assunindo proporções tais que as teodiceias do passado, por vezes heróicas, deixaram mesmo de ser possíveis. O presente artigo não as pretende justiflcar, nem sequer desculpar Deus. O seu ponto de partida está antes na consciência de que não se pode separar o mal e os maus, a maldade e o sofrimento, o qual é muitas vezes o reverso do crime. Para o autor, a síntese e o nó górdio da questão do mal está na infelicidade (malheurj no sentido que lhe dá Simone Weil (ódio, opróbrio e sofrimento indissoluvelmente ligados) e a figura do Servo Sofredor. O mal puro, o "mal radical", constitui um desafio à metafísica, desafio este que ela deve ter a coragem de aliviar, de questionar sem cessar, mesmo sabendo que não há solução para o problema do mal, pois que quanto mais lidamos com ele tanto mais se nos obscurece e transforma em mistério. /// The riddle of evil, the scandal of evil in all its forms, does not stop disturbing the human conscience, revealing itself today as the main obstacle to the belief in God and assuming such proportions that even the theodicies of the past, sometimes heroic, stopped being possible. This article does not wish to justify them nor even excuse God. Its starting point is rather in the conscience that evil and the evil ones, wickedness and suffering cannot be separated, which is many times the reverse of crime. According to the author, the synthesis and the Gordian knot concerning evil is in the unhappiness (malheur) according to Simone Weil's sense (hate, opprobrium and suffering indissolubly connected) and the Suffering Servant figure. Pure evil, or "radical evil", is a challenge to metaphysics, challenge that metaphysics should have the courage to mitigate, question unceasingly, even knowing that there is not a solution for the problem of evil as the more we deal with it, the more~<br>

Abstract: A quebra no que se refere às certezas da fé, a ênfase da própria experiência e os horrores do século XX levaram ao surgimento de uma vaga de (anti-)teodiceias. Aos ataques por parte do ateísmo correspondem do lado dos teólogos ou um certo resentimento em relação a Deus ou a sua desculpa mediante um pôr-em-questão da sua omnipotência. Surgiram desta forma propostas de carácter ora dualistico ora monístico que fizeram com que a resposta clássica ao problema tivesse progressivamente ficado quase reduzida ao âmbito do ininteligível (veja-se o caso da incompreensão das teses ontológicas referentes ao carácter deficitário do mal). Foi sobretudo em confronto com a tonalidade afectiva desta discussão que surgiu a "free-will-defense" da racionalidade, muito embora a questão seja aqui a de saber até que ponto não têve ela por isso de pagar um preço demasiado alto. Em referência à dupla questão de Boécio na obra "Consolação da Filosofia", o autor do presente artigo defende, por um lado, a não solubilidade do problema da teodiceia: "Si Deus est, unde mala?" - Néscio! Por outro lado, no entanto, o autor constata também que a reflexão sobre a experiência de si não só justifica, como até exige, uma abertura à esperança da fé: "Si vero Deus non est, unde bona?" Seio quod nonl Facto é que desta forma, diz o autor, nos confrontamos com a realidade do bem seja isso a propósito da exigência moral que experimentamos ou do protesto que levantamos contra a realidade do mal. Ora é esta auto-revelação do poder da realidade do santo e do bem que não só nos permite, mas também de nós exige a Esperança da sua manifestação final. /// Breakdown in what concerns faith certainties, emphasis on experience of the self, and the horrors of the XX century led to a wave of (anti)-theodicies.

Abstract: O presente artigo procura apresentar algumas das principais características do diálogo de Paul Ricoeur com a psicanálise freudiana no contexto da sua hermenêutica filosófica. Num primeiro momento, o artigo começa por se referir ao contacto inicial de Ricoeur com a problemática da psicanálise na obra La symbolique du mal. Num segundo momento, considerando a obra Essai sur Freud, o artigo procura situar a psicanálise como uma arqueologia do sujeito a ser conjugada com as instâncias teleológica (Hegel) e escatológica (filosofia da religião). A cumplicidade das três instâncias representa o terceiro ponto do presente ensaio: o desejo transforma-se na instância comum entre elas. O quarto ponto explicita a articulação entre o arqueo-lógico/pulsional e o teleológico/espiritual no domínio da arte: o passado pulsional é subsumido nas dimensões teleológica e escatológica do sentido. O quinto ponto trata da figura do pai presente na imagem de Deus que se encontra na Bíblia: ele regressa de um modo que está para além do mero antropomorfismo, assinalado como está pela realização de promessas futuras. Uma tal figura provoca um repensar dos afectos arcaicos referentes ao medo da punição. Um sexto ponto oferece uma apreciação geral da hermenêutica filosófica de Ricoeur e da resistência que ela propõe a todas as formas de subjectivismo. Finalmente, o artigo refere-se ainda ao modo como fé e filosofia se encontram e se afectam mutuamente ao mesmo tempo que uma e outra mantêm as suas características distintas. /// The present article seeks to present some of the main features of Paul Ricoeur's dialogue with Freudian psychoanalysis in the context of his philosophical hermeneutics.

Abstract: No presente ensaio trata-se da relação entre filosofia e cristianismo no século XX a partir da consideração de uma problemática comum a estas experiências: o eclipse do sentido, ou seja, a perda de referênda a um horizonte a partir do qual o ser humano pode orientar-se na vida. Esta problemática, diferentemente declinada nas formas do excesso do mal, do niilismo e da indiferença religiosa, é uma das heranças com que hoje tanto a filosofia como o cristianismo têrn de se debater. O presente artigo reconstrói uma "genealogia filosófica" da atitude de indiferença e oferece deste fenómeno uma análise articulada. A partir daqui apresentam-se duas soluçõoes possíveis, capazes de unir ainda filosofia e cristianismo e que estão em posição defavorecer novas formas de co-implicação entre Deus, homem e mundo: a referênda aos aspectos "positivos" da indiferença e a atenção à esfera do emocional, na qual as motivações têrn ainda espaço. /// The present essay deals with the relation between philosophy and Christianity in the 20 th Century in relation to the eclipse of meaning, i. e., the lack of a horizon that constitutes a point of reference by which one might orient his/her life. This problematic, affected differently by excesses of evil, nihilism, and religious indifference in the last century, is at the heart of the debate. In view of this, the present article offers a "philosophical genealogy" of the attitude of indifference. On the basis of an analysis of this phenomenon, it proposes two possible solutions that might bring philosophy and Christianity together by reformulating the ways that God, man, and the world may be seen as co-implicated and by considering how this indifference can have positive aspects.<br>

Abstract: This paper takes up Richard Kearney's work The God Who May Be, specifically in the context of postmodern debates concerning epistemological claims regarding the other. Kearney's hermeneutics of religion attempts to forge a middle path between ontotheological philosophies of religion and various quasi-religious manifestations of postmodernism; however, my main concern is to address certain points of disagreement between Kearney and proponents of a deconstructive "religion without religion" principally Jacques Derrida and John D. Caputo. The main issue at stake is just how other God is, which is itself a specific case of a broader question concerning otherness per se. Caputo et al. claim that religious assertions about God are fundamentally undecidable, which means that they are "infinitely translatable" and "substitutable," that we can never tell what is a translation of what, but the ultimate point is that it "does not matter" The undecidable nature of religious claims includes the very claim that religion is a discourse about God, which is why deconstructive religion without religion is a messianic hope for "the impossible" devoid of any content. Kearney objects that such radical undecidability leaves us lost in the desert ofkhora with no way to distinguish, even imperfectly and provisionally, between God and Satan, good and evil, the widow and the terrorist. In this paper I claim that Kearney succeeds in finding this via tertia between the Scylla of dogmatism and the Charybdis of complete indeterminacy by thinking God in two important ways: as persona-prosopon (which avoids confusing God with khora or monstrosity) and as posse (which keeps us from dogmatism). /// O presente artigo toma em particular consideração a obra de Richard Kearney The God Who May Be, especificamente no contexto dos debates pós-modernos acerca do estatuto epistemológico da alteridade.

Abstract: "Mystic Maybe's": the title comes from Augustine Birrill's words on the death of Matthew Arnold. Is it true that Richard Kearney's philosophy of religion, like Arnold's reflections on the Bible, are "mystic maybe's," mere flirtations with possibility? In order to answer this question I seek to understand Kearney's expression "the God who may be" and to see if it fits into a non-metaphysical philosophy of religion. The expression is clarified by way of comparisons with Wolfhart Pannenberg's eschatological understanding of God and Eberhard Jungel's theology of possibility. One weak point in Kearney's philosophy of religion, it is argued, is its avoidance of theology in the name of the philosophy of religion. A sound philosophy of religion needs to engage with theology. /// "Mystic Maybe's" (Possibilidades místicas): Este titulo deriva das palavras de Augustine Birrill acerca da morte de Mathew Arnold. O autor do artigo pergunta até que ponto a filosofia da religião de Richard Kearney não será, tal como as reflexões de Arnold acerca da Bíblia, um mew "místico talvez", um simples namoro com a possibilidaãe. Em ordem a responder à questão, o autor procura compreender o sentido da expressão de Richard Kearney acerca do "Deus que pode ser" de modo a avaliar até que ponto a expressão se adequa a uma filosofia não-metafísica da religião. O artigo clarifica a expressão de Kearney mediante uma comparação quer com a compreensão escatológica de Deus de Wolfhart Pannenberg quer com a teologia da possibilidade de Eberhard Jüngel. Mostra-se, desta forma, que um dospontos maisfracos na filosofia da religião de Richard Kearney consiste na sua tentativa de escapar à teologia em nome da filosofia da religião. Com efeito, argumenta o autor do artigo, uma autêntica filosofia da religião não pode deixar de estar num diálogo eficaz com a teologia.<br>

Author(s): Dachun Yang<br>
Abstract: The view of language is greatly changed from early modern philosophy to later modern philosophy and to postmodern philosophy. The linguistic question in early modern philosophy, which is characterized by rationalism and empiricism, is discussed in this paper. Linguistic phenomena are not at the center of philosophical reflections in early modern philosophy. The subject of consciousness is at the center of the philosophy, which makes language serve purely as an instrument for representing thoughts. Locke, Leibniz and Descartes consider language from a representationalist point of view. To them, language itself is idealized and represents thought as if it were thought representing itself. Like the structural linguist Saussure, the founders of phenomenology and analytical philosophy give much attention to the logical or static structure of language, and stick up for the representationalism of early modern philosophy. However, their successors refuse to accept this attitude, meaning the final collapse of representationalism. /// 从早期现代哲学到后期现代哲学再到后现代哲学，在语言观上产生了重大的 变化。早期现代哲学以唯理论和经验论为典型形式。语言现象没有成为该时期哲学 反思的中心问题; 意识主体处于哲学的中心，这使得语言仅仅充当着表象思想的工 具。洛克、莱布尼茨和笛卡尔都从表象论的角度看待语言，在他们那里，语言本身 被观念化了，它们表象思想，就像思想在表象它自身。正像结构语言学家索绪尔一 样，现象学和分析哲学的创始人关注的都是语言的逻辑结构或静态结构，他们延续 了早期现代哲学的表象论，但他们的后继者拒绝接受这种态度，而这意味着最终突 破表象论。<br>

Abstract: Cet article présente une lecture de l'histoire de la Palestine telle qu'elle est perçue par les historiens arabes. Il aborde l'évolution de cette histoire à travers les étapes marquantes de la construction identitaire et nationale du peuple palestinien. On propose, notamment, une analyse de l'historiographie arabe moderne de la Palestine dans le sens où elle est conçue en miroir de l'histoire israélienne et comme outil de revendication de l'appartenance d'un peuple à une terre. L'année 1948, caractérisant l'expulsion (Nakba) des Palestiniens de leur terre, est un tournant décisif dans l'écriture et l'appréhension de l'histoire palestinienne: elle représente l'année de départ mais également celle du retour vers la construction d'une identité nationale, territoriale et historique. /// This paper presents a new reading of the Palestinian history as perceived by the Arab historians. It tackles the evolution of the history throughout the significant stages of the nation and identity building of the Palestinian people, and proposes an analysis of the modern Arab historiography of Palestine conceived as a mirror to the Israeli one, and as a tool for the claim of the lost homeland. The year of 1948 designating the Palestinian expulsion (Nakba) remains the turning point for all the writings and represents at the same time, the year of departure and of return for the construction of the national, territorial and historical Palestinian identity.<br>

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i40016648<br>
Date: 1 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Sperl Stefan<br>
Abstract: Classical Arabic Ḥadīth literature is largely composed of micronarratives recording the sayings and deeds of the Prophet Muhammad. This study seeks to examine their literary form by focusing on selected examples listed in the canonical Hadīth compendia under the heading of adab, a term which may be rendered here as "practical ethics" but which is also commonly used to designate classical Arabic belles-lettres. While the latter is a type of literature quite distinct from the literature of Hadīth the texts here studied point to a certain interface between them. The ethical dimension of adab as it appears in Hadith is examined further in the light of Haydon White's theory on the relation between narrativity and law. Contrasting the micro-narrative of Ḥadīth with the "macronarrative" of the epic provides further insight into its approach to adab and serves to highlight its distinct literary and religious aesthetic.<br>

Abstract: De part et d'autre de l'Atlantique, l'œuvre de Michel Foucault a été reçue de manière très différente par les anthropologues. Si l'anthropologie américaine a accueilli avec enthousiasme les réflexions du philosophe sur les rapports entre pouvoir et savoir, sur sa conceptualisations du biopolitique, les anthropologues français se sont montrés plus réticents et ont manifesté longtemps une certaine méfiance à l'égard de ce penseur. Chez Foucault luimême, on ne trouve que de rares références à l'anthropologie, et son point de vue sur l'anthropologie structurale est extrêmement critique. Cet article est centré sur la question du pouvoir, car c'est là que l'influence foucaldienne sur la nouvelle anthropologie est particulièrement manifeste, et il s'inscrit dans le cadre d'une interrogation plus large sur les rapports entre philosophie et anthropologie. /// On both sides of the Atlantic, anthropologists have received Michel Foucault's work quite differently. Whereas American anthropology has enthusiastically accepted the philosopher's thoughts about the relations between power and knowledge, and his conceptualization of "biopolitics", French anthropologists have, for a long time now, been more reluctant, even wary of this thinker. Foucault's work contains very few references to anthropology, and his point of view about structural anthropology was extremely critical. This article, which focuses on the question of power, where Foucault's influence on new trends in anthropology is especially evident, is part of a broader inquiry into the relations between philosophy and anthropology.<br>

Article Title: Organizing Visions for Information Technology and the Information Systems Executive Response<br>
Publisher: M. E. Sharpe<br>

Author(s): Swanson E. Burton<br>
Abstract: Making sense of new information technology (IT) and the many buzzwords associated with it is by no means an easy task for executives. Yet doing so is crucial to making good innovation decisions. This paper examines how information systems (IS) executives respond to what has been termed organizing visions for IT, grand ideas for applying IT, the presence of which is typically announced by much "buzz" and hyperbole. Developed and promulgated in the wider interorganizational community, organizing visions play a central role in driving the innovation adoption and diffusion process. Familiar and recent examples include electronic commerce, data warehousing, and enterprise systems. A key aspect of an organizing vision is that it has a career. That is, even as it helps shape how IS managers think about the future of application and practice in their field, the organizing vision undertakes its own struggle to achieve ascendancy in the community. The present research explores this struggle, specifically probing how IS executives respond to visions that are in different career stages. Employing field interviews and a survey, the study identifies four dimensions of executive response focusing on a vision's interpretability, plausibility, importance, and discontinuity. Taking a comparative approach, the study offers several grounded conjectures con-cerning the career dynamics of organizing visions. For the IS executive, the findings help point the way to a more proactive, systematic, and critical stance toward innovations that can place the executive in a better position to make informed adoption decisions.<br>

Date: 9 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Maldamé Jean-Michel<br>
Abstract: The article aims at a demonstration of the various problems attached to the concordist project. The study begins with a definition of concordism, precisely in order to show that it is derived from the desire of assuring the unity of the human spirit as it is confronted with the great diversity of scientific knowledge, but also that it ends up contradicting this very intention due to its lack of a true spirit of criticism. The article shows also how during the xx! h century the crucial questions to which the concordism related have to do with those pertaining to the origin of the universe, to the formation of the planet earth and to the notion of original sin. However, due to the fact that this last point is, no doubt, the most delicate and sensible one, the article insists particularly on a more detailed analysis of the notion of original sin in a theological perspective, one namely that is coherent with contemporary scientific knowledge. /// O presente artigo tem por objectivo mostrar os impasses a que conduz a atitude concordista em relação aos dados da Ciência e da Teologia. Nesse sentido, o estudo começa por definir o que se entende por concordismo. Mostra-se até que ponto a intenção do concordismo é a de assegurar a unidade do espírito humano confrontado com a diversidade dos saberes, mas também até que ponto essa mesma intenção é traída pela notável ausência de um verdadeiro espírito crítico. Mostra-se também que ao longo do século XX os pontos mais salientes do concordismo têm a ver com as questões ligadas à origem do universo, à formação da terra e ao pecado original Dado, porém, que este último ponto é, sem dúvida, o mais delicado, o autor do artigo detém-se numa análise mais detalhada e situada da noção de pecado original numa perspectiva teológica renovada por virtude dos conhecimentos derivados das ciências naturais.<br>

Author(s): Colette Jacques<br>
Abstract: No centro do presente artigo está a problemática kierkegaardiana do possível e do impossível, ou seja, a coexistência dos opostos como explicitação do paradoxo, uma das figuras matriciais do Absurdo. Para Kierkegaard, o homem singular vê-se confrontado com o Paradoxo precisamente na medida em que a sua existência não cai sob o domínio da metafísica e do estético. Por outras palavras, o paradoxo invade a existência humana no momento em que se trata do paradoxo absoluto, escândalo para o Judeu, loucura para o Grego, absurdo para a Razão. O artigo mostra, contudo, que antes de se confrontar com o Paradoxo, o existente precisa de aprender a esperar, malgrado o absurdo, na certeza de que tudo é possível a Deus. Porém, a experiência do Paradoxo implica percorrer um caminho prévio. Por outras palavras, é necessário aprender a experimentar a "condensação do possível", seja sob a forma de melancolia seja sob a forma do escrúpulo, de modo a poder desesperar da ideia do possível. Mostra-se assim a capacidade inovadora de Kierkegaard, mesmo sabendo nós que o desespero constitui um tema filosófico clássico já deste a Antiguidade. O que Kierkegaard faz, porém, é colocar em movimento uma dialéctica em que o jogo dos opostos se organiza em diversas figuras precárias, sempre incertas e fluentes e que se escalonam segundo degraus múltiplos de intensidade. Ora é precisamente graças a este jogo de oposições que no pensamento do Solitário de Copenhaga se articulam, ainda que de forma frágil, o finito e o infinito, o temporal e o eterno, a possibilidade e a necessidade. /// At the center of the present article is the kierhegaardian approach to the dialectic of the possible and the impossible, whose co-existence gives evidence to the Paradox, one of the figures of the Absurd. For Kierkegaard, the singular human being finds herself confronted with the Paradox precisely in the measure in which her existence does not fall under the dominion of metaphysics and of the aesthetical.

Author(s): Margulis Mario<br>
Abstract: En este artículo se rescata la tradición crítica del concepto "Ideologia". Se le intenta definir tratando de superar los problemas que emanan de su polisemia y de su utilización desde el sentido común. Para definirlo, el autor inicia su análisis a partir del apartado sobre fetichismo de la mercancía en el primer volumen de El Capital de Marx. Partiendo de los efectos del fetichismo sobre los procesos de pensamiento y los códigos de la cultura en un sistema productor de mercancías, se exponen los efectos sociales de la reificación (Lukács y Goldmann) y los rasgos principales de los contenidos ideológicos presentes en los discursos. El autor considera que las luchas sociales por el poder y la dominación son paralelos con las pugnas por la construcción social del sentido. En esa línea, llega a definir ideologia como "las huellas dejadas por las luchas por la hegemonía en los códigos de la cultura". /// The critical tradition attending the concept of'ideology' is recovered by defining this term in a way to avoid the traps set by its many meanings and its common sense usage. The author grounds his analysis on the arguments about the fetishism of commodities in the first volume of Marx's Capital. Taking as his starting point the effects of fetishism on the processes of thought and cultural codes in a commodity-producing system, he explains the social effects of reification (Lukacs and Goldmann), and the main characteristics of ideological contents in discourses. The author considers that social struggles over power and domination run parallel to competing social constructions of meaning. He defines ideology as "the tracks left by the fights over hegemony in the codes of culture".<br>

Abstract: El propósito de esta artículo es reconstruir itinerario de investigción, a través de los diferentes proyectos que lo componen y que fueron realizados en los diez últimos años, con el fin de develar cierta coherencia metodológica y teórica. Cada estudio de esta trayectoria se propone analizar varias facetas de la juventud, desde un punto de vista antropológico y sociológico. Los años de doctorado fueron dedicados a entender el proceso de construcción identitaria de los jóvenes pijos madrileños a través de sus usos y costumbres. Luego, un trabajo post-doctoral se orientó hacia la ano-rexia nerviosa y la feminidad en jóvenes de la ciudad de México. Tercero, un trabajo de campo en la Meseta Tarasca permitió el acercamiento y entendimiento de las "nuevas" representaciones y prácticas de algunos jóvenes acerca de su cuerpo y de su alimentación, así como de algunas lógicas familiares, desestructuradas y re-estructuradas por el hecho de la migración hacia Estados Unidos. Por último, se presenta un cuarto proyecto sobre "bulimia, sexualidades y género", inscrito en una propuesta global de estudio de las inversiones de la "valencia diferencial de los sexos". /// The author revisits her research itinerary, reviewing the different projects that compose work carried out in the last ten years. The aim is to reveal a certain methodological and theoretical coherence. Each study in this trajectory set out to analyze several aspects of young people's lives from an anthropological and sociological point of view. The PhD years were invested in researching the process of identity construction of the Madrilenian pijos (young people from middle an upper middle class) through their uses and customs. Postdoctoral work was focused on nervous anorexia and femininity in young women in Mexico City. Later on, fieldwork in the Tarascan Plateau in Michoacán state in Mexico enabled the author to approach and understand the "new" representations and practices of some young people concerning their bo~<br>

Author(s): Berg Mark L.<br>
Abstract: Jürgen Habermas postulates an ideal archaic society as the starting point for his theory of social development, which involves subsequent loss of communicative rationality in a society as it grows into an industrial nation. The western Caroline Islands, an historical archaic society, exhibited a concern with a spirit-world and with the manipulation of the nonmaterial, inherited life-world; both of these features are ignored by Habermas. Western Carolinians had also usurped the ideal speech situation and turned it into a means toward strategic action that resulted in instrumental rationality.<br>

Publisher: Armand Colin<br>
Issue: i40023051<br>
Date: 2 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Béguin Édouard<br>
Abstract: Quel sens donner aujourd'hui à cette question ? Il y va de la compréhension de la théorie du réalisme d'Aragon. La notion de "réalisme socialiste" dont il s'est réclamé à partir de 1933 et qu'il a toujours revendiquée depuis, même après l'interruption du Monde Réel, soulève plus de difficultés qu'elle n'aide à en résoudre. Pour relancer l'investigation tout en faisant droit à l'ambition réaliste de l'auteur, on place Aurélien dans l'ombre portée que projette sur lui la suite de l'entreprise romanesque. Le roman apparaît ainsi au point de départ de la réécriture par quoi Aragon dépassera l'échec des Communistes, et qui aboutira à la définition d'un "réalisme expérimental". Cette nouvelle problématique théorique trouve un écho anticipé dans un texte contemporain de la rédaction d'Aurélien, l'article intitulé "Grandeur et misère des romanciers", où Aragon donne à penser le réalisme romanesque à partir du problème de la lecture. C'est ainsi qu'on peut ramener la question du réalisme dans Aurélien à celle des moyens par lesquels le roman se fait relation dialogique.<br>

Author(s): Mead W. R.<br>
Abstract: The paper considers the map and the milieu of Europe. Five distinguishing characteristics are discussed. Special attention is given to the "states system" of Europe, the intensity of the boundary network and the increasing tendency from the point of view of human geography to treat the continent as divided rather than as unitary. The first post-war generation of British geographers tended to neglect Europe in favour of North America. Sweden and France have been important in restoring the connection. Those whose research focuses on European topics will encounter bibliographical, linguistic and other problems; but these will be offset by the cordial working relationships among European geographers which, as among colleagues in the English-speaking world, seem to spring from the nature of the subject itself.<br>

Author(s): Affaya Mohammed Noureddine<br>
Abstract: L'auteur tente dans ce texte d'éclaircir certains aspects de l'imaginaire en relation avec l'Etat, la politique, mais aussi avec la violence et le mal, dans un contexte où la dialectique de l'identité et de l'altérité reste l'une des structures de l'imaginaire. L'imaginaire, débordant le champ exclusif des représentations, agit sur le monde et sur le mouvement de l'histoire. Mais le monde agit aussi sur l'imaginaire et ce sont les périodes de crise qui amplifient ses manifestations, appelées à "faire écran contre les peurs". C'est dans ce sens que la violence, face à laquelle différentes attitudes sont possibles, devient un élément symbolique pour interpréter nos forces. Jusqu'à quel point est-on en train d'assister à un nouveau mode de fonctionnement des imaginaires politiques et religieux ? Pour répondre à cette question l'auteur parle d'espérance interculturelle "dans un monde où les volontés de puissance du tragique brouillent les élans du communicationnel". In this text, the author attempts to clarify certain aspects of imaginarles in relation to the State and politics, but also in relation to violence and evil, in a context in which the dialectic of identity and otherness continues to be one of the structures of imaginarles. Imaginarles, beyond the exclusive sphere of representations, act on the world and on the evolution of history. But, the world also acts on imaginarles, and it is the periods of crisis that enlarge their manifestations, destined to "serve as a screen against fears." In this sense, violence, in the face of which different attitudes can be adopted, becomes a symbolic element for interpreting our strengths. To what extent are we witnessing a new way of functioning of political and religious imaginarles? To answer this question, the author discusses intercultural hope "in a world in which the will of the power of the tragic interferes with communicational impulses."<br>

Article Title: Utopia and history. Some remarks about Nikolai Berdjaev's struggle with history<br>
Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i40027959<br>
Date: 3 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Augustyn Leszek<br>
Abstract: The article deals with the philosophy of Nikolai Berdjaev (1874-1948), which he formulated between The Philosophy of Inequality (written in 1918, but published in 1923) and The New Middle-Ages (1924). Berdjaev's philosophy is analyzed in the context of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and its aftermath. The other point of reference is the crisis of culture and civilisation, which affected the West in the inter-war period. Berdjaev's position has been interpreted in view of the archetypal myth of the struggle of the two principles, the principle of order (cosmos) and the forces of destruction (chaos). This myth is tied to the millenialist world view. Berdjaev took an anti-utopian stance. He juxtaposed the utopianrevolutionary principle with the hierarchical-creative one. From this position he criticized among others democracy, liberalism and socialism. In the midst of the crisis of the 1920s he remarked the possibility of spiritual rejuvenation putting forward the concept of the New Middle-Ages. One can say that at that time Berdjaev's philosophy evolved within the conservative-creative framework, from the utopia of conservatism to the utopia of 'free creativity'.<br>

Abstract: Cet article propose d'utiliser le concept d'utopie rationnelle pour rendre compte des pratiques managérìales et tout particulièrement de la production de réformes répétées dans les organisations. Dans cette perspective, après avoir décrit une décennie de transformations au sein d'une organisation publique, certaines caractéristiques de la « culture manageriale » sont dégagées de sa pratique réformatrice. Dans un second temps, le concept d'utopie rationnelle est construit à partir de textes canoniques et des travaux d' « utopologues ». Dans un troisième temps, utopie rationnelle et culture manageriale sont comparées, afin de préciser l'apport cognitif de cet outil à la compréhension du fonctionnement des organisations. This article proposes to use the concept of utopia to account for the managerial practices and especially to explain the production of repeated organizational transformations. From this point of view, the case of a decade of ceaseless transformations into a public organization is first described. Some of the features of the « managerial culture » are then inferred from this empirical statement. In the second place, the concept of rational utopia is constructed, from canonical texts and works of « utopologists ». Finally, rational Utopia and managerial culture are compared, in order to specify the main cognitive contributions of this tool to the understanding of organizational functioning.<br>

Author(s): ZACKA BERNARDO<br>
Abstract: The critical discourse on U.S. military detainee abuse at Abu Ghraib prison has been dominated by Weberian-style arguments (a bureaucracy gone wrong, insufficient or badly applied administrative rules, or individuals acting as cogs in a machine). We argue that Michel Foucault's "security apparatus" provides a more insightful model for understanding the Abu Ghraib phenomenon. According to this model, the prison becomes a nodal point in an information-gathering nexus confronting unforeseen, emergent, and unclear events, a place where power is less disciplinary than improvisational, exercised through practical judgments about uncertain situations. The performance of such power at Abu Ghraib included the use of photography and acts that, we claim, resemble M. M. Bahktin's negative carnivalesque.<br>

Abstract: Dans l'entreprise de communication du Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional, la presse incarne l'espace de la représentation des événements de l'histoire immédiate — guerre, combats, mots qui marquent la matière, le temps, la terre du Chiapas —, espace public où refonder la légitimité d'une parole insurgée, un endroit qui surgit, propice à l'effraction poétique et au déploiement de subversions graphiques ludiques et modélisantes, un endroit tour à tour endroit et envers, où la parole puise au-dedans pour lentement véhiculer au dehors, où le dessous des choses du monde se change en dessus à saisir, pour bouleverser le politique. En la perspectiva de comunicación del Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional, la prensa encarna el espacio ejemplar de la representación de los acontecimientos de la Historia inmediata, guerra, combates, palabras que dejan huellas en la materia, el tiempo y la tierra de Chiapas. Un espacio público donde fundar otra vez la legitimidad de una palabra insurgente, un espacio que brota y se elabora, siempre propicio a la efracción poética y al despliegue de subversiones gráficas, lúdicas y modelizadoras. In the Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional's point of view, the press constitutes the exemplary space of the immediate History's events, such as war, battles, words that leave traces on the material, the time and Chiapa's land. A public space where the legitimacy of a rebellious word can be founded again, a space which springs and draws up, always favourable to poetical breaking and entering and to display graphic, playful and modelling subversions, full of political meanings.<br>

Author(s): LANGUE Frédérique<br>
Abstract: Ce travail analyse l'usage du mythe bolivarien dans l'histoire du Venezuela dans la longue durée, suivant l'approche de l'histoire des idées et des sensibilités et jusqu'à prendre en compte l'imaginaire politique de la République bolivarienne. Il montre qu'au-delà de la chronologie consacrée par les historiographies de l'indépendance et patriotique surgissent des thèmes et des passions souvent oubliés par l'histoire académique, aujourd'hui récupérés par l'histoire officielle. C'est dire la nécessité de dresser une esquisse « opportune » du héros, en laissant de côté les faits pétrifiés voire sanctifiés. Desde la perspectiva de la historia de las ideas y de la historia de las representaciones, este trabajo intenta analizar el uso del mito bolivariano en la historia de Venezuela, ubicándolo en el tiempo largo hasta llegar al imaginario político de la «República Boüvariana». Muestra cómo, más allá de la consagrada cronología independentista y de la historiografía patria, asoman temas y pasiones muy a menudo olvidados de la historia académica aunque si rescatados por une nueva historia oficial. De ahí la necesidad de llegar a un boceto «oportuno» del héroe, dejando de lado hechos petrificados y hasta santificados. This essays aims to analyze the use of bolivarian myths in Venezuelan history from point of view of the history of ideas and representations. So its focuses on long term interpretation in order to emphasize the political imaginary of Bolivarian Republic. It points out to the fact that, along with Independence consecrated chronology and homeland centered historiography, come up matters and passions frequendy forgotten by academic history but recovered by the new official history.<br>

Author(s): Miller Tyrus<br>
Abstract: Given World and Time is a collection of essays that summarizes much of the recent work on the theory of time, including cultural, political, and social conceptualizations of temporality. The grounding narrative of this collection, roughly stated, leads from the German and German-Jewish ideas of a temporality of crisis developed in the 1920s, to the French poststructuralism of the 1960s and 1970s, and concludes with the American syntheses of the 1980s and 1990s. Methodologically, the book weaves together different historical narratives with a new emphasis on their temporal dimension, all seen from the perspective of critical theory and recent cultural critique. However, it is interesting to point out that the majority of the articles do not challenge the classic critical tools of modernism, in spite of the frequent reference to poststructuralist critique. The volume editor has also not acknowledged more recent work that treats similar topics and themes through the application of a radical political critique, most significantly the work associated with biopolitics and the so-called theological turn.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i40038966<br>
Date: 1 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): CONSONNI MANUELA<br>
Abstract: The essay discusses the passage from an ideological, patriotic and anti-fascist memory of the deportations and the extermination to what the author describes as the "ethnic" memory of the Shoah, which has played, and continues to play, a central role in constructing the European historical narrative as that narrative depicts the Jews as Europe's "other". Theoretical reflection on memory is intertwined with historical analysis of the period between 1945 until the end of the twentieth century. Two, binary perspectives are featured, one, which examines memory from a cognitive point of view and the other, which examines memory from a cultural, ideological, moral and political perspective. These perspectives come to the fore in memoire-literature, movies, plays, historiographie and philosophical debates, which illustrate the two perspectives and their articulation, as well as they justify the essay's periodization.<br>

Abstract: L'éthique de la situation (Situationsethik) est une tendance diffuse, qui s'infiltre dans les systèmes éthiques les plus divers, plutôt qu'une doctrine aux arêtes bien nettes. Il faut cependant qu'on détermine son idée et il semble que ses positions extrêmes se prêtent le mieux à une clarification de son contenu. Elle s'oppose à toute éthique normative abstraite et universelle. Par contraste apparaissent certaines lignes maîtresses, au moins négatives. Les systèmes principalement visés sont le rationalisme, qu'il soit formel ou à contenu matériel, l'éthique sociologique positiviste (Science des mœurs de Durkheim, Lévy-Bruhl...) et toute éthique de l'essence. L'abstraction et l'universalité, l'immutabilité et l'extrinsécisme des normes morales sont les caractères mis en question. Nous nous attachons à montrer que l'éthique de l'essence, telle que la conçoit la tradition chrétienne, ne comporte pas nécessairement les caractères incriminés au sens péjoratif ou la „Situationsethik” les entend. Nous croyons même qu'une éthique de l'essence de par son statut même - certaines formes historiques peuvent être des déviations - tient compte de la situation concrète et historique. Elle le fait de deux manières bien différentes, d'abord en ce qu'elle intègre dans ses impératifs universels les situations les plus diverses, et en second lieu en ce qu'elle pose comme principe obligatoire et universel que chacun doit se laisser conduire par certains impératifs moraux, que lui seul peut voir, du fait qu'ils tiennent à sa situation unique, non seulement de fait mais en principe. En effet, une éthique de l'essence transpose en impératifs moraux aussi bien ce qui appartient à la structure essentielle de l'homme (impératifs absolument universels), que ce qui relève de la contingence, telles les circonstances extérieures et intérieures, qui sont susceptible de se répéter, si pas de fait au moins de droit (impératifs relativementuniversels).

Abstract: II n'y a rien d'étonnant à ce que la religion soit au départ de la philosophie. Sicelle-ci poursuit la connaissance la plus ample et la plus approfondie de la réalité telle qu'elle nous est donnée, elle ne peut faire abstraction de la religion comme phénomène humain universel, c'est-à-dire comme un fait qui a un sens. Ce sens nous paraît être donné dans une expérience du rapport réel de l'homme qui prie, avec Dieu, soi-même, le prochain et le monde. Cet article se limite aux relations de l'homme qui prie avec soi-même, le dialogue ego-(Dieu)-ego. Ce dialogue est un effort de sincérité au sens d'authenticité. La sincérité de l'homme qui prie apporte, en premier lieu, de la clarté et de l'unité dans l'homme lui-même. Dans la prière une harmonie s'établit à un triple niveau : au plan extérieurintérieur : je me présente à Dieu tel que je suis ; au plan de la temporalité : une unité se fait dans ma vie à la suite de la compréhension du présent avec une rétention du passé et une protention vers l'avenir ; au plan du rapport moi-réel et moi-idéal se manifeste un mouvement vers l'honnêteté et la loyauté. La prière de contrition éclaire la formation de mon moi au point de départ ; l'impétration d'une vie morale au point d'arrivée. En cas d'accord du moi-extérieur avec le moi-profond, tout n'est pas encore dit. Il importe de savoir comment va s'orienter le moi-fondamental. Vais-je me replier orgueilleusement sur moi-même ou m'ouvrir humblement à Dieu ? Le choix ultime : Dieu / moi-même, déterminera la qualité de l'ego. Celui qui choisit Dieu entrera en une relation d'amour avec lui. Non seulement l'amour unit, mais il exige l'abandon de tout ce qui n'est pas la personne aimée. La vie de l'homme qui prie se présente comme un rapprochement de Dieu et un abandon toujours plus prononcé de tout le reste. C'est un processus d'abaissement qui commence, basé sur la collaboration de Dieu et de l'homme. Parfois l'initiative de l'homme prédomine, comme dans l'ascèse, parfois celle de Di~<br>

Abstract: Pour que la raison humaine puisse vraiment parvenir à une authentique conscience de soi, elle a besoin d'un autre que la raison. C'est la vie du chrétien, qui se déroule à côté des impératifs de la raison, et surtout l'accusation de l'épître aux Corinthiens „La sagesse du monde est folie devant Dieu” (I Cor. 3, 19) , qui viennent briser le monologue perpétuel de la raison avec soi-même et la libérer ainsi de son ignorance de soi. En effet cette accusation, qui ne s'impose pas avec des arguments contraignants, met la raison globalement en question sans en exclure aucun procédé. Ainsi la raison n'a plus d'armes en main pour se défendre et se trouve à découvert. Tout d'un coup elle entrevoit que son exercice se fondait jusque là sur des évidences non établies. Des questions nouvelles se posent : quelle est la signification de la rationalité de la raison ? quel est le sens du sens ? En méditant sur ces questions, la raison se rend compte qu'elle ne peut même pas comprendre leur sens. Elle se trouve devant un autre langage qu'elle ne peut pas assimiler. Son egocentrisme fondamental est brisé. La raison se voit d'un oeil nouveau dans ce rapport avec cet autre, qui ne fonde plus la raison comme le faisait Dieu dans les philosophies précédentes. Cet autre ne lui ouvre pas la porte du ciel, mais la renvoie vers une conscience plus aiguë de soi, une conscience qui ne connaît plus son propre fondement. Ainsi la raison devient une raison en condition, elle participe maintenant intégralement à la condition incertaine de l'homme entier. Elle coïncide avec l'homme. Toutes ces considérations pourraient être la réflexion d'un incroyant qui, par hasard, se bute contre cet épître de S. Paul. Mais Thévenaz, en croyant authentique, accepte le rôle prépondérant de Dieu dans sa vie, même dans sa vie de philosophe. N'importe quelle activité humaine doit être une réponse à l'appel de Dieu, qui met en cause toutes les valeurs humaines en les déclarant insuffisantes pour Le trouver. Comment d~<br>

Abstract: L'article présente l'analyse de la situation des sciences de l'homme, donnée par M. Michel Foucault dans son livre Les mots et les choses. Il s'est choisi comme point de départ ce qu'il appelle le savoir archéologique. Ce savoir n'est pas une activité particulière de l'homme, mais l'attitude fondamentale présente dans toutes ses activités tant intellectuelles que pratiques. C'est la lumière qui constitue toute lucidité sans être pourtant transparante elle-même. La présence et la fonction d'un tel savoir ne peuvent pas être démontrées ni indiquées ni vérifiées, parce qu'il conditionne toute démonstration, indication, vérification. Sa présence est donc une hypothèse plutôt qu'une thèse. L'opinion de M. Foucault que le savoir diffère selon les époques et les civilisations est bien une autre hypothèse. La vie de M. Foucault a donc été construite sur une base bien incertaine et discutable. Le savoir d'une période se manifeste avant tout dans sa conception de la vie, de l'économie, du langage. Ce sont bien les charactéristiques les plus profondes de l'homme qui est un organisme vivant lequel se réalise en parlant et en travaillant. Les sciences de l'homme se sont présentées dans l'époque moderne. Le nouveau savoir était rupture avec le savoir classique, selon lequel toute réalité, l'homme et son monde, tous les étages de l'être cosmique, la parole signifiante et la chose signifiée, avait été intégrée dans un ensemble panoramique qui ne connaissait pas de spectateur extérieur. Le savoir moderne au contraire a découvert des profondeurs invisibles dans la réalité visible de l'homme, p.e. le travail comme constituant les valeurs économiques, la fonction vitale comme source des formes, la langue comme source de significations. L'homme apparaît comme le lieu de ces profondeurs. Sa dimension obscure qui donne naissance aux produits du travail, au champ des significations, à l'éblouissement vital, est-elle l'infini cartésien ? Pas du tout, parce qu'elle n'apparaît que comme le cô~<br>

Abstract: To see, to speak, to think : these are the three main topics of Merleau-Ponty's philosophy, tragically interrupted in 1961. He intended to write two works on The Origin of Truth. To understand the relationship between Merleau-Ponty I and Merleau-Ponty II it is a good lead to pay attention to the relationship between seeing, speaking and thinking. In a central passage of Phenomenology of Perception (p. 451) this relationship is called Fundierung. Merleau-Ponty conceives it as a two way relationship, which excludes every possibility of reducing one term (thinking, reason) to another (perception, language). Yet, at that time he is not able to point out clearly the originality of thinking. L'Oeil et l'Esprit and Le Visible et l'Invisible provide a first outline of l'Origine de la Vérité. The 'second' Merleau-Ponty wants to 'reassume' his whole philosophy in what he calls : fundamental thinking. Painting opens the way to the mystery of seeing : something visible begins to see. Subject and object are no longer opposed to one another ; not even related by intentionality. The new key-word is Ineinander (interrelatedness, to be in one another, chiasm). 'La chair' (the flesh) is a new notion, broader and more fundamental than the body. The sensible reflects upon itself. This 're-flection' (reflexivity or reversibility) is a work of Being. The visible can be seen in principle. Philosophy should accompany the coming-to-see of the visible. In this perspective the transition to thinking (or ideality) must be seen as a new case of 'reversibilité'. The generality of the visible opens up to the 'invisible', that which in principle cannot be seen, but is 'the other side' of the visible. The basic phenomenon of expression is central here. Language is not an absolute starting point. Language is rather a new and more subtile form of coporeity, a new instance of the same basic reversibility, which already contains the seeds of ideality (logos endiathetor). The idea is of the word (logos ~<br>

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to outline Ricoeur's outlook on the basis of ethics and on the main elements to shape the ethical intention. Although this topic is not to the fore in his thought, Ricoeur has often raised the ethical problematic and delivered most valuable insights into it. We explain how he let a subjective, intersubjective and neutral moment precede the relationship between freedom and law. We also inquire into his vision on values and on the impact and meaning of evil for ethics. The ground of ethical existence is the fact that man basically is original affirmation of being which manifests itself in longing and striving. This dynamic facticity which is only discoverable through a reflection upon the works and creations of man, represents the starting-point for an autonomous ethics having a historical character. In this way, Ricoeur - in the main stream of J. Nabert - turns against I. Kant whose duty ethics misjudges the basic dialectic of human action. Besides, this starting-point allows ethics to meet the Christian kerygma in a more meaningful way than duty ethics is in a position to it. For the kerygma sacralizes no ethical interdiction but situates man into a history of salvation and proclaims healing and fulfilment to man's longing. A second and decisive moment in ethical existence is the appearance of the other. When the other enters into my life, he calls me up to foster mine and his freedom als well. The other becomes a centre of obligation to me, and I am called up to promote the well being of all mankind. Ricoeur also points out that the very norm of morality is man both as an individual and communitarian being. Furthermore, as human freedom is always mediated, we should fully take into account the economic, political and cultural reality which is ethically most relevant. The practice of freedom raises the question of values. Ricoeur rejects any voluntaristic and essentialistic view. Values are immanent requirements of freedom in its effort ~<br>

Abstract: In this paper a distinction is made between two conceptions of the ego in freudian metapsychology. According to the first conception, a conception which Freud never gave up, the ego is conceived as a specific function on the surface of the living organism ; it is the result of a progressive differentiation of the Id ('Es') under the driving power of internal stimuli and external reality. Fitted with specific neutral, i.e. non-conflictual functions as perception, memory, control of the bodily motions and consciousness, the ego has to defend the individual as a biological living organism against the threats from without and within. In this conception the ego is treated as an instance that doesn't take part in the different psychic conflicts. We analyse the philosophical presuppositions and show the metapsychological disadvantages of this hypothesis that has been worked out especially in the American ego-psychology. According to the second conception, that takes into account important clinical pheno mena as identification, idealisation, narcissism, ideal of the ego, the ego is conceived as a metaphorical effect of a specific psychic act. With Lacan, we try to analyse and to interpret this specific act as an act that causes an infinite splitting in the ego : the ego is constituted as a subject that from its origin is separated from itself. Instead of being a biological function that lives in the immediate metonymical prolongiation of the living organism, it rather has to defend a certain representation of himself. This point of view doesn't exclude a purely functional description of the ego ; but the different functions have now to be interpreted differently because the ego is the effect of conflicts in which it takes part (consciousness is interlaced with unconsciousness, perception with denying...). In the last part of our study we show how Freud makes the philosophically important distinction between the ego as an object of the Id and the ego as a subject that has to~<br>

Abstract: Peirce offers us a perspective on identity that is less problematic than the Aristotelian, essentialist approach, which still latently, but deeply influences a lot of contemporary, analytic views on identity. The problem of the essentialist view is that it precludes the possibility of real novelty, and fails to account for the dynamic connectedness of the world. Peirce's account of identity does more justice to these elements. His view will be elaborated on the basis of his phenomenological categories of FirstnesSy Secondness, and Thirdness. The crucial point that will be made is that from Peirce's process-pragmatic point of view things and persons have no pre-given, independent identities, but identities emerge by virtue of regulated interactions.<br>

C'est ce que paraît suggérer l'expression même « dire - édicter - le droit » , et c'est de fait le point de vue généralement développé par la théorie éthique et juridique. Cette étude montre qu'il y a là une aberration au sens propre du terme, c'est-à-dire un écart par rapport à la réalité.<br>

Abstract: Cassirer faisait de la connaissance le point culminant du « processus d'objectivation de l'esprit » se révélant ainsi progressivement à soi-même à travers la spécificité de ses diverses configurations symboliques. Nous nous proposons d'élucider ici la loi de constitution propre aux sciences exactes à partir des principales figures de la physique moderne pour nous élever à une philosophie de la culture scientifique et dégager les principaux problèmes que pose sa réalisation comme « Weltbegriff ». Cassirer considered Knowledge as the terminating point of the « process of objectification » of human spirit that leads progressively to its self-consciousness through the differential specificity of symbolic forms. We are mainly concerned here with trying to clear up the constitutive law proper to exact sciences. Our analysis starts from the main figures of modern physics as its starting point in order to set our thought on a philosophy of scientifical culture and to draw the main problems related to its achievement as « Weltbegriff ».<br>

Abstract: En réaction au libéralisme rawlsien pour qui le droit est référé à la liberté d'action des individus, le mouvement communautarien a voulu référer le droit à l'identité culturelle (individuelle ou collective), lui assignant, ultimement, la fonction de stabiliser cette identité. Pour ces auteurs, le lien entre identité et droit est interne, ce qui ouvre la voie à ce qu'on a appelé « les paradoxes de l'identité démocratique » et conduit à la notion problématique de droits collectifs. On montrera ici comment une telle notion repose sur une « réduction identitaire » , par principe opérée au point de vue objectivant de la troisième personne, privant par là même les acteurs sociaux de leur capacité d'autodétermination, À cette vision anti-libérale dans son fondement, qui fait de la sécurité identitaire son horizon, on opposera la vision d'une identité risquée qui ne préjuge pas dogmatiquement des constituants identitaires de chacun et ouvre ainsi la voie aux authentiques principes de la coexistence multiculturelle. In reaction to Rawlsian liberalism, which relates law to freedom of action, the Communitarian movement wants to relate law to cultural identity (individual or collective), assigning it, ultimately, the function to stabilize this identity. For Communitarianism the relationship between identity and law is internal, which opens the path to what has been called « the paradoxes of democratic identity » , and leads to the problematic notion of « collective rights » . It is shown here how such a notion rests on an « identity-reduction » , which by principle is operated from a third-person perspective, depriving individuals of their capacity of self-determination. In opposition to this fundamentally anti-liberal vision, the notion of an open identity is proposed, which doesn't dogmatically predetermine the identities of everyone and opens therefore the path to the basic principles of a multicultural coexistence.<br>

Abstract: Dans le rapport qui s'établit, chez Hegel, entre le crime et la peine, c'est toute la validité du procès dialectique (et de son immanence) qui se joue en tant qu'il ne doit laisser place à aucune irrationalité. Penser la rationalité de la peine signifie, dans ce cadre, penser la continuité entre la volonté qui commet le crime et celle qui, en voulant la sanction, rejoint l'universel. C'est donc bien du point de vue du criminel qu'il faut se placer pour avoir une chance de saisir la vérité du droit pénal. Le crime, en même temps qu'il s'inscrit dans un ordre déjà régi par le droit, manifeste la finitude du droit abstrait, c'est-à-dire son incapacité à fournir un modèle de reconnaissance adéquat aux exigences de l'esprit. Dès lors, le passage à la « moralité » s'impose qui prend en charge la subjectivité agissante dans toute sa complexité et au cours d'un processus où le bien ne lui apparaît plus comme une contrainte. Mais ce passage n'est pas sans ambiguïté : Hegel nous met aussi en garde contre toute moralisation prématurée de la peine (sous la forme de la « vengeance » ) : le droit pénal n'accède véritablement à l'effectivité qu'au terme de son institutionnalisation dans la « société civile ». Bei Hegel steht die ganze Gültigkeit des dialektischen Progresses (sowie dessen Immanenz) in der Beziehung, die zwischen Verbrechen und Strafe besteht, auf dem Spiel insoweit dieser keinerlei Irrationalität irgend welchen Spielraum einräumen darf. Die Rationalität der Strafe zu denken, heisst, in diesem Zusammenhang, sich die Kontinuität von dem Willen, der das Verbrechen begeht und jenem, der zum Universellen gelangt, indem er auf der Strafe besteht, vorstellen. Das heisst also, man muss vom Standpunkt des Verbrechers ausgehen, will man die kleinste Chance haben, die Wahrheit des Strafrechtes zu begreifen. Das Verbrechen, das einerseits Bestandteil einer Ordnung ist, die vom Recht regiert wird, zeigt zur gleichen Zeit die Begrenztheit des abstrakten Rechtes, das heisst desse~<br>

Abstract: Bien que de nombreux auteurs aient fait œuvre à la fois de sociologue et de théologien, il n'existe pas à proprement parler de « sociologie de la théologie ». L'objet de cet article est de proposer une relecture de La topographie légendaire des évangiles en Terre sainte de Maurice Halbwachs afin de montrer que ce livre offre autant une étude de sociologie de la mémoire qu'une esquisse de sociologie de la théologie. Après avoir précisé en quoi on peut parler d'une étude de la « construction sociale de la pensée chrétienne » chez Halbwachs, on revient plus en détails sur la façon dont il analyse le mécanisme de production de l'orthodoxie théologique, puis sur la spécificité du regard que le sociologue porte sur les questions théologiques. Enfin, la conclusion est l'occasion de souligner ce que pourrait apporter la sociologie de la théologie à la sociologie en elle-même. Even if various authors contributed to sociology as well as to theology, nothing like a "sociology of theology" exists. The aim of this article is to offer a rereading of La topographie légendaire des évangiles en Terre sainte by Maurice Halbwachs, in order to show that this book is not only a study of sociology of memory but also an outline of a sociology of theology. After having defined in what extent we can find a study of "the social construction of the Christian thought" in Halbwachs' work, we turn to the way he analyses the production process of the theological orthodoxy, and then to the specificity of the sociological point of view on theological questions. Finally, the conclusion gives us the occasion to underline what the sociology of theology could bring to sociology itself. Aunque varios autores han contribuido tanto a la sociología que a la teología, no se puede decir que existe realmente una "sociología de la teología". Este articulo propone una relectura de La topographie légendaire des évangiles en Terre sainte de Maurice Halbwachs que pretende mostrar que este libro es tanto un estudio~<br>

Abstract: Cet article explore les dynamiques de l'échange communicationnel à l'époque de Stalin et son impact sur la formation de l'opinion. Alors que les journaux, qui présentent leurs auteurs dans un état solitaire de monologue intérieur, révèlent souvent des étendues d'ambiguité et de doute, une communication engagée, particulièrement entre personnes se faisant confiance, est beaucoup plus à même de donner naissance à des jugements et des opinions clairs, ce qui est de la plus haute importance sur le plan de la capacité critique. La riche correspondance personnelle de la famille Kravčenko-Spunde, famille de vieux bolcheviks engagés, montre à quel point un échange ouvert peut susciter et renforcer tant le soutien que la critique la plus âpre du système. Ces documents mettent en lumière un changement majeur, le passage d'un soutien quasi inconditionnel au régime stalinien à sa critique de « fossoyeur de la révolution » , condamnation qui émerge du débat politique tenu dans le cercle étroit de la famille. De plus, la défense d'un bien commun à l'encontre du discours public pousse les discutants à transcender leur cercle restreint et à chercher un contre-public indispensable pour lever le soupçon de particularité qui pèse sur les « biens » défendus au sein de ce cercle et pour confirmer ainsi leur caractère de « bien commun ». La tentative d'élargissement du cercle communicationnel mène à une nouvelle activité dans l'écriture mémorielle qui se propose aussi bien de dévoiler les mensonges du système que de révéler un héritage révolutionnaire distinct de la représentation officielle monopolisée par le régime. L'expérience des relations personnelles pendant la révolution joue un rôle essentiel pour cette revendication dissidente d'un héritage révolutionnaire. Camaraderie et confrontation unie face à l'ennemi pendant la guerre civile doivent être distinguées de l'énonciation et de l'élaboration d'opinions lors de débats publics. Seule cette seconde expérience, basée sur la récipro~<br>

Abstract: La démocratisation de l'enseignement supérieur en France a conduit, entre 1960 et 1970, à un vif développement des corps d'assistants et de maîtres-assistants, situations universitaires auxiliaires. Après 1968 et le vote de la loi Faure permettant la constitution d'universités autonomes, les statuts des personnels ont fréquemment évolué. Ces modifications résultent à la fois de conflits sociaux, par exemple autour de la situation des assistants ou des vacataires entre 1968 et 1983 ; de conceptions variées, voire opposées, des politiques universitaires ; des changements dans les pratiques professionnelles amenant à aborder de nouvelles questions. On analyse ici les rapports, les réformes et contre-réformes, et les compromis autour desquels se sont bâtis les dispositifs actuels. Sur une cinquantaine d'années, de 1960 à nos jours, les tendances majeures, autour desquelles la gauche et la droite politiques ont fini par converger, sont : la simplification de la typologie des corps universitaires en deux grandes catégories, l'articulation de plus en forte avec les études doctorales qui ont suivi des évolutions liées à celles des statuts, l'importance de la tension entre l'autonomie de chaque universitaire et celle de chaque université. On retrouve, à travers le dernier point, des débats importants au moment des grandes lois universitaires de la fin du XIXe siècle. The democratisation of the student population in France in the 1960s led to a quick growth of two groups: the assistant professors and the newly created associate professors. After the bill prepared by Edgar Faure was passed in 1968, thus paving the way to the constitution of autonomous universities, the statutes of the academics changed quite often. The modifications used to result both from struggles by academics, for instance about the job security of assistant professors and of part-time lecturers between 1968 and 1983, from diverging conceptions of academic policies and from changes in actual work practices~<br>

Publisher: Armand Colin<br>
Issue: i40044507<br>
Date: 9 1, 1992<br>
Author(s): Lenclud Gérard<br>
Abstract: Les auteurs rappellent quelques-unes des difficultés soulevées par la notion de blasphème, ballotté entre un fonctionnement de régime juridique et comminatoire dans la tradition chrétienne et une acception de sens commun liée au précédent. Les remarques qu'ils posent n'entendent pas porter directement sur le « blasphème » (ce qu'il faudrait entendre, savoir ou penser sous ce terme), mais plutôt sur les moyens d'en parler, sur les opérations conceptuelles mises en oeuvre pour qui se propose de l'aborder du point de vue des sciences humaines et sociales. The authors underline some of the difficulties raised by blasphemy, a notion hesitating between its function in a judicial and comminatory sense, in the Christian tradition, and a common sense acceptation, linked to this. The author's remarks do not bear directly on « blasphemy » , on what is to be understood by the term, what we can know or think about it, but rather on the ways of talking about it, on the conceptual operations to be implemented by those who propose to deal with blasphemy from the point of view of the human and social sciences.<br>

Abstract: En janvier 2003, le Musée national des Arts d'Afrique et d'Océanie ferme ses portes. Ses collections sont transférées au quai Branly, en vue de l'ouverture d'un musée des arts et civilisations d'Afrique, d'Asie, d'Océanie et des Amériques. Différentes campagnes d'enquêtes, réalisées depuis 2000, rendent intelligible ce nouvel épisode de l'histoire mouvementée du palais de la porte Dorée. A partir du triple point de vue de l'institution muséale, du personnel et du public, ces enquêtes éclairent le processus de la fermeture d'un musée « patrimoine national » et de son nouveau destin. La réflexion porte plus précisément sur les liens apparemment contradictoires entre rupture et continuité, clôture et pérennité, pesanteurs du passé et évolution du regard. La création prochaine d'une Cité nationale de l'histoire de l'immigration peut illustrer ces paradoxes. The National Museum of African and Oceanian Arts closed in January 2003. Its collections were transferred to the future Quai Branly Museum of Arts and civilizations from Africa, Asia, Oceania and the Americas. Various survey campaigns carried out since the year 2000 explain this new episode of the eventful history of the Palais at the Porte Dorée. From the threefold point of view of the museum institution, the personnel and the visitors these surveys throw some light on the closure process of a museum belonging to the national patrimony and on its new destiny. The study is focussed on the seemingly contradictory relations between rupture and continuity, closure and durability, heaviness of the past and new look at museums. The future creation of a national city of the history of immigration illustrates these paradoxes. Das nationale Museum der Afrikanischen und Ozeanischen Künste wurde im Januar 2003 geschlossen. Seine Sammlungen wurden in dem zukünftigen Museum der Künste und Zivilizationen aus Afrika, Asia, Okeania und die Amerikas am Quai Branly gebracht.Verschiedene Erhebungen, die seit 2000 durchgeführt wurden, ~<br>

Abstract: Partant du constat que les faits sociaux de mémoire sont portés par des actes de communication, il s'agit ici de dégager les pratiques qui alimentent les formes de « l'agir » socio-mémoriel, aujourd'hui présent en France et ailleurs. Quels processus sont a l'œuvre dans des situations post-génocidaires, souvent aussi post-migratoires, comme dans la Shoah (« Khurbn » en yiddish) par exemple ? Dans le cas d'Ashkénazes, il s'agit d'une reinscription qualitative au sein des cartographies de la parenté, mais aussi d'une reconnexion avec des périodes antérieures au genocide et à l'ethnocide à travers des événements culturels. Since the work of memory cannot exist without inter-subjective exchanges, this paper introduces in the study of memory the concept of « social acting » created by Weber. Attempting to point out the plurality of the practices that feed the various forms of socio-memorial movements present today in France and elsewhere. Which are the processes taking on a very particular aspect in post-genocidal as in post-migratory situations such as after the Shoah (Khurbn in Yiddish) ? In the case of the Ashkenase, these processes are also post-ethnocide and consist in a qualitative re-inscription within genealogical mapping and simultaneously in the long development of a history in which the genocide constitutes a memorial screen as well as actions of re-inscribing and re-connecting with cultural markers associated to periods antedating the genocide and ethnocide. Da Erinnerungsarbeit nicht ohne das Betrachten von zwischenmenschlichem Austausch und sozialer Praxis erfolgen kann, soll im Rahmen dieses Artikels das Webersche Konzept des « Sozialen Handelns » in die Untersuchung von Erinnerungen einbezogen werden. Ausgehend von der Tatsache, dass soziale Erinnerungen durch Kommunikation ausgedrückt werden, möchte dieser Artikel die Vielfalt der Praktiken zeigen, die heute in Frankreich und anderswo die Vielzahl der gesellschaftlichen Erinnerungsbewegungen prägen.

Abstract: Partindo de urna analogía, sugerida por Arthur Danto, com o que se passa no mundo artístico pós-moderno, o artigo começa por reconsiderar o estatuto da história narrativa no actual contexto da disciplina, caracterizado pela explosão dos géneros historiográfícos, para se debruçar seguidamente sobre o problema de saber que tipo ou tipos de verdade histórica a narrativa veicula. À partir d'une analogie avec l'évolution du monde artistique post-moderne, suggérée par Arthur Danto, l'article commence par reconsidérer le statut de l'histoire narrative dans l'actuel contexte de la discipline, caractérisé par l'explosion des genres historiographiques. Puis, il se penche sur la question de savoir quel(s) type(s) de vérité historique est véhiculée par la narration. With an analogy of the post-modern artistic world proposed by Arthur Danto as its starting point, the article reconsiders the role of narrative history in the current context of the subject. This has been characterised by many historiographie genres. The article then addresses the problem of knowing which kind or kinds of historic truth the narrative conveys.<br>

Abstract: Se former dans le travail apparaît maintenant comme une part naturelle, évidente de l'activité. Les personnes semblent pouvoir spontanément passer d'une posture de production à une position d'apprenant. Étudier les conditions pour se former dans des univers contraints révèle la nécessité de s'ajuster aux délais de la production et au rythme de la formation. Nous désignons par tempo cet ajustement de l'individu aux contraintes temporelles de la production, lui permettant de saisir dans les situations des occasions d'apprentissage. Les exemples fournis, issus de formations qualifiantes dans l'industrie, en proposent une interprétation croisant les dimensions d'engagement personnel et de transformation de l'activité. The "on the job training" seems for everyone, a natural part of the working activity. People would be able to change their point of view to perform the product target and in the same time the goals of training. This article shows that workers have to play with the time constraints to create by themselves a learning situation. We call "tempo" this capacity to catch in the course of the job, an opportunity to learn. From examples taken in the field of the training within industry, we suggest that this tempo depends on personal involvement in the changing or the activity.<br>

Abstract: Este artículo explora cuestiones relacionadas con la nueva diversidad y complejidad de la cultura europea, y procura hacerlo con referencia a debates contemporáneos en torno al cosmopolitismo. Un argumento central es que las ciencias sociales "dominantes" permanecen inadecuadas, en tanto que tratan estas cuestiones de forma abstracta y de manera superficial -sin tocar a nadie. El artículo propone una aproximación más concreta y sustantiva a la agenda cosmopolita -incluso poética-, ofreciendo sugerencias en términos de discursos alternativos relevantes -aquellos que han sido marginados a través de la elaboración histórica de lo que ha devenido la versión hegemónica de la cultura y tradición europeas. Se presenta una exploración de términos como "asombro" y "metamorfosis" (aparentemente obsoletos y quizás excéntricos), así como de la importancia comunicativa del pensamiento metafórico. Se argumenta que, al abordar el dilema cultural europeo contemporáneo, la finalidad es desarrollar un evocativo, y por lo tanto significativo y comunicativo, discurso en torno ai cosmopolitismo -en efecto, otra manera de narrarlo. This article explores issues relating to the new diversity and complexity within European culture, and seeks to do so with reference to contemporary debates on cosmopolitanism. A central argument is that the "mainstream" social science remains inadequate, in that it deals with the issues in an abstract and formulaic way -touching no-one. The article argues for a more concrete and substantive (and even poetic) approach to the cosmopolitan agenda, putting forward suggestions as to relevant alternative discourses -discourses that have been marginalised in and through the historical elaboration of what has become the hegemonic version of European culture and tradition. There is an exploration of such (seemingly obsolete, and maybe eccentric) terms as "wonder" and "metamorphosis", and of the communicative significance of metaphorical thinking.

Abstract: Diversos trabajos han señalado còmo en contextos altamente represivos el surgimiento y la continuidad del activismo no se entienden sin la intervención de fuertes elementos subjetivos, afectivos y emocionales.Este artículo participa de este enfoque con un análisis longitudinal del activismo de la primera generación de anarquistas clandestinos bajo la dictadura franquista (1939-1975). Los resultados destacan la combinación de tres factores que ayudan a explicar el sostenimiento del activismo anarquista: i) la mediación de la esperanza en la percepción de oportunidades para la movilización; ii) la movilización estratégica de la indignación en el discurso dirigido a los potenciales apoyos y participantes; y iii) el fortalecimiento de la identificación ideológica con el movimiento gracias, paradójicamente, a la represión. Las fuentes incluyen diversos materiales de archivo y testimonios de activistas. Previous research has shown that in highly repressive contexts, the emergence and continuity of activism cannot be understood without considering the role of strong subjective, affective and emotional elements.Building on this approach, this article offers a longitudinal analysis of the activism of the first generation of clandestine anarchists under Franco's dictatorship (1939-1975). The results point towards a combination of three factors that help explain the maintenance of anarchist activism. These are: i) the role of hope in the perception of opportunities for mobilization; ii) the strategic mobilization of indignation in the discourse directed at potential supporters and participants; and iii) the strengthening of the ideological identification with the movement due, paradoxically, to the effects of repression. The sources used include a range of archival material as well as activists' memoirs.<br>

Author(s): Bostic Heidi<br>
Abstract: Françoise de Graffigny's mid-eighteenth-century play Phaza features a main character who is unknowingly crossed dressed as male. The text provides a rich starting point for exploring questions of gender identity and performance. This article situates Phaza within the fairy-tale tradition in which women authors played a major role. Its analysis draws upon philosophies of narrative identity and theories of gender to show that identity comprises both permanence and performance. Reading Graffigny can make an important difference in our understanding of gender, authorship, and relations between the sexes in Enlightenment France. Phaza's masquerade sheds light on the ways in which women authors of the era approached and assumed various gender identities. Eighteenth-century texts like Phaza reveal a lineage of ideas that continue to influence feminist thought today and will do so in the future.<br>

Publisher: Wiley Subscription Services<br>
Issue: i40063719<br>
Date: 12 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): MARION MATHIEU<br>
Abstract: In this paper, we begin by suggesting an intuitive model of time embodying a notion of temporal distance that we claim is at work in Gadamer's hermeneutics, while it is rejected in Collingwood's theory of interpretation. To show this, after a brief review of the influence of Collingwood on Gadamer and of their disagreement over the possibility of recovering an author's intention, we examine in turn their answers to the problem of transposition, upon which the philosophy of Dilthey supposedly foundered. We show that Gadamer embraced the idea of temporal distance in his solution, which consisted in claiming that the distance between an author from the past and us is filled in by tradition, which opens access to the text for us, while Collingwood considered explanations of the actions of historical agents, and by extension understanding of a text, in intentional or rational terms. Furthermore, he thought that such explanations are not causal, and that the thoughts involved in them do not stand within the flow of physical time, which is involved in any notion of temporal distance. This is why Collingwood felt entitled to anti-relativistic conclusions about the recovery of authorial intentions, conclusions that prompted Gadamer to claim that "the dimension of hermeneutical mediation which is passed through in every act of understanding" escaped him. We then discuss the underlying notions of time at work in both Gadamer and Collingwood, showing that Ricoeur had a better appreciation of the issue, since he saw that Collingwood's moves parallel, up to a point, Heidegger's critique of "vulgar time," albeit with an entirely different result. We also point to the importance in Collingwood's thinking of his notion of "incapsulation."<br>

Abstract: Alors même qu'ils ne constituent qu'une petite minorité au sein du monde ouvrier et artisanal, les compagnons du Tour de France sont sur-représentés si on les considère du point de vue de la production autobiographique. À partir de ce constat cet article se propose d'examiner les conditions de formation de cette capacité singulière. L'examen de la dizaine d'autobiographies compagnonniques produites depuis le XVIIIe siècle permet ainsi de mettre en relief le fait que le compagnonnage, de par sa formule particulière, met en valeur parmi ses membres ceux qui savent conter, ceux qui savent écrire et ceux qui produisent des chansons. Ces trois types de mises en ordre de la vie et du monde invitent ainsi les compagnons qui en sont les maîtres à penser leur propre existence et, pour quelques-uns, à la mettre en texte. Although forming a tiny minority of workers and craftsmen, the Tour-de-France journeymen are overrepresented in the production of autobiographies. This observation serves as the starting point for examining the conditions underlying this peculiarity. The ten or so autobiographies written since the 18th century are used to show that this apprenticeship, given its specific form, valued those journeymen who knew how to tell stories, write songs or simply write. These three ways of setting life and the world in order led those who master them to conceive of their own existence and, for a few of them, to set it down in writing.<br>

Date: 5 1, 1992<br>
Author(s): Schmölders Claudia<br>
Abstract: Das Mārchen als Psychologe— Eine Hommage an Max Lüthi This essay was wtitten in honor of Max Lūthi, the renowned Swiss folklorist, who died in 1991. The starting point is an article by Lüthi in which he coined the term "the fairy tale as psychologist." In contrast to the psychoanalytic approach of Freudians and Jungians, Schmölders demonstrates how Lüthi drew a line between literature and psychology in his works. First, Lüthi studied the hero in the fairy tale from an anthropomorphological viewpoint. Second, Lūthi analyzed the style of fairy tales by examining the moral, aesthetic, and economic aspects of the action. Third, Lūthi also dealt with "the legend as psychologist." Using Lüthi's notions, Schmōlders stresses the dialogic strategies and anthropomorphological concerns of the tales within the domain of psychological object-relations theory, and it is in this regard that Lūthi's term "the fairy tale as psychologist" assumes its importance.<br>

Abstract: Clifford Geertz's influential definition of religions as providing their members with both an ethos and a worldview-in his terms, both a "model for" and "model of" reality-has of late become a neuralgic point of contention in religious studies. In particular some critics have seen his ideas of religious models of reality as biased, out-moded, or in other ways confused about the way that language refers (or does not refer) to the world. In this article, I consider two criticisms of Geertz's project and seek to show that, despite the partial value of the criticisms, the idea of religious models of reality continues to be a legitimate and fruitful approach to what religious communities are typically up to.<br>

Abstract: Internet suscite beaucoup d'espoirs et de craintes. Certains prétendent que cet outil sera favorable à l'émergence de sociétés de la connaissance à condition de réduire préalablement la fracture numérique et cognitive. Cet article prend prétexte de cette idée pour évaluer quels sont les réels rapports de force qui se jouent entre croyances et connaissances sur la toile. Il montre, d'une part, que l'amplification de la diffusion de l'information est favorable à l'expression du biais de confirmation qui est un des mécanismes fondamentaux de la pérennité des croyances. Il souligne, d'autre part, qu'Internet est un marché cognitif très sensible à la structuration de l'offre et donc à la motivation des offreurs, ce qui confère un avantage décisif à l'empire des croyances contre celui de la connaissance. Ce dernier point est mesuré dans cet article de façon quantitative sur des thèmes de croyances diverses. The Internet is the source of many hopes and fears. Some claim that this tool will help lead to the emergence of knowledge societies if digital and cognitive gaps can be reduced beforehand. This article takes that idea as a basis to then evaluate what are the real power relations played out between beliefs and knowledge on the web. It shows that the amplification of the dissemination of information is conducive to the expression of "confirmation bias" which is one of the mechanisms which permit beliefs to survive. It also stresses that Internet is a cognitive market which is very sensitive to structuring of supply and therefore the motivation of suppliers, which confers a decisive advantage to the "empire of beliefs". This last point is measured quantitatively in this paper on various topics of belief.<br>

Article Title: The Detraditionalization of Intimacy Reconsidered<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i388289<br>
Date: 9 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): Wilson Neil<br>
Abstract: This essay challenges those strains of contemporary social theory that regard romantic/sexual intimacy as a premier site of detraditionalization in the late modern era. Striking changes have occurred in intimacy and family life over the last half-century, but the notion of detraditionalization as currently formulated does not capture them very well. With the goal of achieving a more refined understanding, the article proposes a distinction between "regulative" and "meaning-constitutive" traditions. The former involve threats of exclusion from various moral communities; the latter involve linguistic and cultural frameworks within which sense is made of the world. Focusing on the U.S. case and marshaling various kinds of empirical evidence, the article argues that while the regulative tradition of what it terms lifelong, internally stratified marriage has declined in strength in recent years, the image of the form of couplehood inscribed in this regulative tradition continues to function as a hegemonic ideal in many American intimate relationships. Intimacy in the United States also remains beholden to the tradition of romantic love. That these meaning-constitutive traditions continue to play a central role in structuring contemporary intimacy suggests that detraditionalization involves the relative decline only of certain regulative traditions, a point that calls into question some of the normative assessments that often accompany the detraditionalization thesis.<br>

Abstract: The construction of a meta-discourse in order to describe interior monologues (IM) cuts across narratologic and linguistic approaches. It varies according to whether the purpose is to establish a typology based on their wider representation or to provide a linguistic analysis restricted to reported speech. The paper highlights the persistent under-rating of a phenomenon close to the IM, and related to the "unspeakable sentence", that of "the point of view". The represented "point of view" and the free indirect speech have coexisted since the second half of the 19th. However, unlike as in the IM, these forms are not clearly differentiated as dual forms of the expression of the inner speech. Consequently, inner speech (at least as a theory issued from literary experience) is reduced to the relatively homogeneous form of the "interior speech" or "flow of consciousness". But this representation is under the influence of enormous tensions as literary manifestations of inner speech are more varied than the phrase IM gives to understand.<br>

Abstract: O artigo é uma leitura do debate epistemológico sobre as condições de conhecimento na antropologia. Partindo das críticas que o próprío C. Geertz faz a seus seguidores, a autora se propõe a avaliar o potencial crítico da hermenêutica. Recupera seu questionamento acerca da oposiçâo sujeito/objeto e propõe a busca de uma objetividade negociada interpares e situada historicamente. A partir desse debate questiona-se uma ciência pura e sem implicações práticas e morais. O percurso que faz avaliando vários autores lhe permite concluir que o excesso de relativismo ou de subjetivismo transforma toda possibilidade de ciência em ficção. Para dar conta em sua etnografia dos sistemas simbólicos não lingüísticos, a autora busca um diálogo entre a teoría antropológica e as teorias nativas e afirma que é na experiência vivida em campo que está a fertilidade das perguntas e reformulações de conceitos da antropologia. This article is an attempt to interpret the epistemological debate concerning conditions of knoledge in antropology. Discussing the criticism which C. Geertz has made in regard to the work of his followers, the autor proposes to evaluate the critical potential of hermeneutics. A critique of the subject-object split opens the way for proposing a form of objectivity wich is historically located and negotiated among equals. This debate constitutes a point os departure for questioning the notion of a pure science devoid of moral and practical implications. In the course of discussing a number of authors, the conclusion may well be that excessive relativism and subjectivism transform all possibilities of science into fiction. In order to deal with nonlinguistic symbolic systems in etnography, the author sees the importance of dialogue between anthropological theory and native theory. Fertile grounds for raising questions and reformulating anthropological concepts are found in fieldword experience.<br>

Abstract: O presente artigo propõe uma interpretação do fenômeno Chico Xavier na cultura e na sociedade brasileira. A partir do reconhecimento da importância cruciai de seu modelo mítico de espírita exemplar, o lugar de absolute destaque ocupado pelo médium mineiro na história do kardecismo brasileiro será interpretado à luz de urn código cultural articulado em sua biografia, que busca sintetizar os personagens paradigmáticos do "santo" e do "caxias". Desdobrado na unidade de sua obra mediúnica e trajetória pública, o tipo de espiritismo construído em Chico Xavier evidencia a proposta kardecista dominante ao longo do século XX, enquanto modelo de cidadania, prática religiosa e projeto nacional. The present article is a reading of the place of the phenomenon Chico Xavier in the Brazilian culture and society. Starting from the recognition of his crucial importance as a mythical model of exemplary spiritualist, the absolute prominence of the medium in the history of the Brazilian spiritualism will be interpreted in the light of a cultural code articulated in his biography, that synthesizes the Brazilian mythical characters of the "saint" and of the "caxias". Unfolded from his life and works the model of spiritualism built by Chico Xavier evidences the kardecismo's dominant religious point of view along the 20th Century, while citizenship model, religious practice and national project.<br>

Abstract: Can the act of creation itself be considered like an infinite forgiveness that God turns to the earth and to those who live there after having preferred the waters as his place of first existence? The conference "In the beginning it was the forgiveness" held in L'Aquila in the occasion of a pluriconfessional meeting, suggests some hypothesis starting even from some biblical episodes like: the universal deluge, the Amalek's remembering, Giuseppe and his brothers, Isaac's sacrifice, and furthermore with Moses' death, to end with the forgiveness from the original sin through the entrance in the promise land. A suggestive analysis of the forgiveness in the Hebraism, seen too often as a pure religion of the contraposition law to the forgiveness given from the religion of love. The forgiveness in this way is dealt with the inter-religious point of view, and also with the human one that in the relationship between God and man has its top and beginning in the solemnity of Kippur.<br>

Abstract: Benveniste is famous but misread. His style, his manner, the specific rhythm of his discourse are not perceived with all their critical dimension. For example, the philological point of view chosen by C.

Abstract: To refer to reality in literature has often been incorrectly understood as the fact that the author designates elements of the real world of his time, term for term as it were and as if everyone would agree on what constitutes "the real world of his time"; from this point of view, an author such as Proust is cut off from reality... This is to miss the degree to which Proust's practice of language asks the relevant questions about reference as it tries to refer to reality, namely the phenomenological question of the way we dynamically construct at least the reality we perceive.<br>

Author(s): Blatz Charles V.<br>
Abstract: Moving from repression or tyranny toward the rule of law and reason is fraught with difficulties. One question of transitional justice is whether those responsible for the horrors of the previous régime should be punished or whether those involved in the transition should travel a path toward forgiveness and unity. Within this article, it is urged that in the (re-)establishment of the rule of reason among all involved there is a commitment to peace as opposed to force. This commitment marks retribution and utilitarian punishment as incoherent and normatively indefensible. Resorting to punishment is the abandonment of reason, not its reinstatement. Indeed, the point can be generalized. Punishment, as resorting to force, is a move away from establishing or sustaining a framework of justification and its commitment to peace.<br>

Article Title: La validation des acquis de l'expérience est-elle un moyen de reconnaissance du travail? / Is the process of granting equivalences based on work-related experiences a way to recognize the work performed?<br>

Issue: i40089829<br>
Date: 3 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Tuchszirer Carole<br>
Abstract: Cet article interroge la validation des acquis de l'expérience, droit instauré en 2002 dans le Code du travail, sur sa capacité à favoriser une meilleure reconnaissance du travail des salariés. Il s'appuie sur une enquête réalisée auprès de 15 entreprises, associations ou branches professionnelles engagées dans des opérations collectives de validation des acquis de l'expérience (VAE). Après avoir identifié quatre logiques distinctes de mise en œuvre du dispositif par les employeurs, les auteurs examinent les canaux par lesquels la VAE, telle qu'elle se pratique dans l'entreprise, pourrait favoriser la reconnaissance du travail. D'un côté, la mise en mots du travail est un puissant moyen de le rendre visible et l'opportunité de confrontation avec les pairs permet de renforcer l'identité professionnelle, mais de l'autre, la VAE influe peu sur la rémunération et l'ambiguïté demeure fréquente sur l'objet même de la validation. Le regard croisé des employeurs et des salariés montre donc à quel point la reconnaissance du travail ne va pas de soi. Mais la voie est tracée pour qu'il puisse en être autrement dans le cadre de procédures plus négociées, notamment avec l'acteur syndical. Based on a survey conducted in 15 firms, associations or occupations where work-based experiences were being validated under the terms of a law that entered the French Labor Code in 2002, questions are raised about this process and its capacity for obtaining more recognition for the work done by wage-earners. After identifying four distinct employer rationales for implementing validation, the channels favoring the obtainment of such recognition are examined when this procedure is actually applied inside firms. Putting one's job into words is a powerful means for making it visible; and the opportunity to face colleagues is an occasion for reinforcing an occupational identity. Nonetheless, validation has little effect on pay, and what is being validated is often ambiguous. Employers' and wage-ear~<br>

Abstract: The article is intended to indicate how the study of written and cultural texts may be used to approach the problem of identifying the system of thought characteristic of particular groups. Certain premises of what may be called an “interpretative paradigm” have been selected to create a theoretical starting-point, and in this context the most suggestive appear to be the concept of culture developed by symbolic anthropology, the cultural-semiotic concept of text and the multi-dimensional hermeneutic approach to textual intepretation. The author therefore seeks to bring together, in addition to the general features ofinterpetative ethnology, certain theoretical and methodological starting-points derived from the three approaches mentioned. One may approach the problem of understanding of a foreign testimony via “adequate interpretation”. Here, to understand means to adopt the cultural “language” of a message as one's own, and to interpret and so transfer the unknown into an accessible code, most often one's own code. The process of interpretation is understood as the discovery of the hidden content behind the apparent stirface, and in this activity the understanding of culturally remote testimony is axiomatically taken to bepossible and communicable. In a broader epistemological context we can see in adequate intepretation one of the means to the never-ending process of correction of our pre-judged knowledge. In a spirit of critical rationalism we could deflne such interpretation as the working hypothesis that may be falsified by further Scientific activity and then replaced by a better theory. Such conclusions on the methodological range of the interpretative approach indicate only one of the possible syntheses of various epistemological paradigms, for the theoretical use and application of which ethnology seems especially suited.<br>

Abstract: The essay focuses on the term textuality and foliows and comments the changes of its use and meaning. It examines the link between Russian Formalist concept of literariness (mostly Jakobson and Tynianov), its Bakhtinian switch to intertextuality, developed in quite contrastive but distinet ways by Julia Kristeva and Gerard Genette, and finally it interprets the use of the term textuality in Derridian deconstruction and Foucault’s semiotics of the world. The point of the essay is to show the importance of the deconstructive challenge of the traditionally supposed opposition between speech and writing as well as between the world and the seif. Following Hugh Silverman’s concept of the autobiographical textuality, the essay makes attemps to suggest an interpretation of ali Kundera’s writings (both „fiction“ and „essays“) as one undistinguishable textuality without óbvious boundaries of a genre or identity of the person who speaks.<br>

Abstract: This study represents a Chapter from a section devoted to the composition of a literary work and is part of a larger project called ‘The Poetics of a Work of Literature in the Twentieth Century’, which is being undertaken by the Theory Department of the Institute of Czech Literature. The fragment and fragmentariness in a twentieth-century literary work are a manifestation of a marked tendency towards discontinuity or in some cases towards continuity of a certain kind. There exist works of art that for various reasons remain fragments without, however, being preceived as such (the novels of Kafka and Ladislav Klíma’s Velký román, are cases in point); on the other hand, the fragment, that is to say an intentional fragment (such as a sketch or a synopsis), becomes an independent genre whose roots go back to Romanticism (for instance Novalis’s fragment). The fragment and fragmentarieness that manifests itself in the text in the widest possible number of ways (intentional incompleteness and sporadicity, ‘blank spots’ in the Story, the mixing of heterogeneous elements, the alternating of various genres within one work, and so on), we understand as a reaction to the idea about the work as a complete, inlernally unified and accomplished whole with a clear and single Sense, an idea that Classicism molleyeoddled, which was then to a large exient done by Realism and with it all so-called decadent literature (including tendencious, Socialist-Realist literature). The fragment and fragmentariness (with which is linked the idea of a sense that continuously defies being pinned down to any one definition, which follows from its quality of not being fully told, from suggestion, hints, silence, gaps and ‘ holes’) are, in the literature of the twentieth century, perceived as both a genre and also as approaches that can express the open nature of being and of the world better than the whole work can. Because fragmentary works often represent a work in a nascent state or in a state of tr~<br>

Abstract: Patočka summarized his conception of style in the essay „Umění a čas" [Art and Time] (1966), in which he observes style over historie periods and its increasing departure from a priori, metaphysically ascertained and universally valid meaning. In modern art, style is established by the freedom of the Creative act; its centre of gravity shifts to the level of „signifier". Patočka's essay „O minulém rázu umìění" [Concerning the Former Nature of Art] (written 1965) helped to clarify „aesthetic attitude". In this essay, he develops an interpretational duet: a critique of Hegel's metaphysical starting point, which distances itself from the experience of modern art, and an appraisal of Hegel's interpretation of time, which remains inspirational. In accordance with it, Patočka the phenomenologist considers art the place of „destructive creation", of vivifying revelation, whose source is in man. The next part of the article calls attention to a lecture by Paul Ricoeur „Vyprávění, metafora a teorie interpretace" [Narrative, Metaphor and the Theory of Interpretation] (1987), in which Ricoeur introduced a modern hermeneutic approach to literary studies. What is most relevant here is the concept of the „double reference". The first aspect of reference relates to empirical reality; the second to the „productive reference", which designs a world created by the literary work. Semantic innovation in the narration of a story has a parallel in the semantic innovation of the metaphor. In both cases there emerges „the new, the as yet unsaid, the inexpressible - in language".<br>

Abstract: The article traces distinet approaches to the concepts of 'meaning', 'reference' and 'sense' in twentieth-century literary theory and general semioties. It offers an account of different concepts of 'mimesis', 'reference', and 'representation' from the point of view of fictional world making as well as from the point of reading a narrative. The article focuses on the tension between mimesis and diegesis, as coined by Plato and Aristotle, and it interprets concepts developed in recent times by scholars such as Jakobson, Quine, Ricoeur, Eco and de Man. Distinet sections of the article focus on the following: the referential function of proper names and the two contrasting approaches of Kripke and Linsky; the contrast between mimesis and diegesis as a functional reference to the world of experience in Ricoeur; the correspondence and truth conditions in Strawson and Davidson; the emphasis on coherence as a way of eliminating mimesis and reference in Eco’s semiotics; the radical elimination of both the reference and the signified in deconstruction; the issue of textual re-presentation. The article attempts to illustrate the thesis that by accepting intentional, inside-of-the-text produced concepts of meaning the reader and the critic would eventually loos not only ali the ties to the actual world but also the impulses for reading and interpreting.<br>

Abstract: This article discusses the options that narrative and language have in their attempts to capture or describe traumatic experience and death. It concentrates on two prose texts by Karel Čapek, Obyčejný život and Povětroň, and the first phase of Freudian psychoanalysis, pointing at generally distinguishable limits and distortions that arise when narrative and language come in contact with trauma and death. Contrary to the current trend within „trauma studies“ , the article does not deal with autobiographical records of traumatic experience. It rather tries to point out that thinking consistently about the connection between memory, language and trauma tends to blur and question the traditional distinction between fiction (understood as a work of imagination) and autobiography (taken as a description of real events). It also tries to show that psychoanalysis arrives, explicitly and implicitly, at a similar conclusion. The last part of the article poses the question what the resulting relationship between the outside (narrated, written Story) and the „inner“ experience is like, and to what extent the structure of this dyad can also be questioned.<br>

Abstract: The article advances an interpretation of the self as an imaginary object. Focusing on the relationship between selfhood and memory in Sartre's The Transcendence of the Ego, I argue that Sartre offers useful resources for thinking about the self in terms of narratives. Against interpretations that hold that the ego misrepresents consciousness or distorts it, I argue that the constitution of the ego marks a radical transformation of the conscious field. To prove this point, I turn to the role of reflection and memory in the creation of the self. Reflection and memory weave past, present and future into a consistent and meaningful life story. This story is no other than the self. I propose to understand the self as a fictional or imaginary entity, albeit one that has real presence in human life.<br>

Abstract: Le recit de la theophanie en Ex 19-24 est traditionnellement considéré comme un ensemble de sources et de traditions assembliés de manière lâche dans une unique narration. Le présent article suggère de reconnaître dans la péricope du Sinaï un récit complexe et cohérent de la théophanie, divisé en trois séquences narratives, chacune d'elles étant délimitee par la récurrence d'un modele rhetorique (i.e. 19,3-8b; 19,8c-20b et 20,18-21; 19,20c-25 et 24,1-8). Alors que la structure de la première séquence se présente de manière assez simple, les deux dernières séquences sont interrompues et font ensuite l'objet de deux reprises narratives (i.e. 20,18-21 et 24,1-8). Ainsi que le manifeste cette structure, la théophanie est racontée de manière synoptique au chapitre 19 selon le point de vue de Dieu: l'accent est mis alors sur l'offre d'alliance et la sainteté divine. Le récit est ensuite raconté à nouveau et développé dans les deux reprises narratives selon le point de vue du peuple: la crainte de Dieu (20,18-21) et la ratification de l'offre d'alliance (24,1-8) sont alors soulignées.<br>

Abstract: The critical work of F. X. Šalda is from its beginnings full of the pathos of the arrival of the new poetry. The vision, comporting entirely with the principies of symbolisim, is characterized as the idea of synthesis of knowledge: ‘to abstract the Eternal, Unified, and Absolute from the secondary, accidental, relative, temporally and spatially limited, and the divided'. The analytical spirit of science and scholarship, and also of art, aroused a general scepticism and a need for a turnaround. It brought the knowledge that synthesis is the essence of art. It is from there, that Šalda derived his principies of criticism. Analysis, he argued, is justified to the extent that it is governed by a total view. The dark centre of art is accessible to criticism only at the price of criticism itself becoming art, and its essential instrument is intuition. The actual work of the critic begins when the he no longer knows where to go. He must rise above the insignificance of mere facts and look at the world from his own point of view. His work is complementary to the work of the artist, and the nature of art means that self-identification is the lot of the critic. Art cannot be explained causually; the connection between what is near and the suspected contexts, that is to say insight into the mystery of meaning, is the prerequisite of aesthetic contemplation. The author is not bound by objectivity towards the perceived world; the reader is not bound by the objectivity of the author's perceived world, is not limited by the author's intentions. The very action of synthesis is a dynamic reference and another possibility of being. The project of synthesism is a vision of thorough, concrete symbolism; both the expansion of consciousness and the indivisibility of the individual from the rest of the world are included in this postulated unity.<br>

Abstract: This study is concerned with the method and results of an empirical research project called’ Regional Topics and the Understanding of Region: Research into Reception of Literature in Silesia and North Moravia’, which took place in May 1998. The starting point was an attempt to summarize the predominant approaches to regionalism, the particular nature of a region, and the predominant forms of Communication in regional Communication in the arts and in society in general. The chosen method of asking the questions and the results of the quantitative analysis have been received with a certain degree of scepticism, though a comparison with some of the signs and features discovered in similar research in 1982-4 is not without interest. The entire matter, however, has taken on a new form and cannot be looked at in isolation.<br>

Abstract: From the Balfour declaration of 1917 to the birth of Israel in 1948 a great catastrophe (Nakba) crashed down on Palestine which afterwards got worse with the exodus of the major part of Palestinian population and reached an highest point with the arab defeat of 1967 (Naksa,). During the following period (Nahda) the Palestinians pursued an increasing visibility through military resistance, Intifadah, political initiative and cultural mobilization. The Author stigmatizes the mistakes of Palestinian leaders as well as the colonial policy carried on by Israel. Recollecting the experience of the South-African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, he thinks that a true reconciliation between Palestinians and Israelis will be impossible if they don't enter in a different mood, forgiving about Nakba and Shoah respectively and trying to convert their common pain and sorrow into hope and confidence in a shared future. Depuis la déclaration Balfour de 1917 jusqu'á la résolution du partage-découpage de la Palestine en 1947 et á la création d'Israël en 1948 la Palestine fit l'expérience d'une grande catastrophe (Nakba), qui devint tragique dans les années suivantes lorsqu'on assista á un véritable éclatement du corps social palestinien et culmina dans la défaite de 1967 (Naksaj. L'aprés-guerre de 1967 marqua un tournant majeur dans la mesure où les Palestiniens accédérent á la visibilité par la resistance militaire, par le soulévement dans les territoires occupés (Intifadah), par l'inititaive politique et par la mobilisation culturelle (Nahda). L'Auteur stigmatise soit les erreurs commis par les directions palestiniennes soit la politique coloniale pratiquée par Israël. Il voit dans l'obsession du Nakba pour les uns et de la Shoah pour les autres des obstacles qu'ilfaut dépasser pour ouvrir la voie d'une réconciliation véritable entre Palestiniens et Israéliens.<br>

Abstract: The central point is that Schutz's idealization of reciprocity, the matching of subjective intentions in the public world of interactive behaviour, necessarily involves agents in an ironic process. This is largely because, since they are taking so much for granted, they cannot be aware of what is latent in the intentional perspectives of their social partners. In bringing out the pattern of the irony of inter subjective dialectic, the argument makes plain the importance of pretence as a vital concept in philosophy, sociology and hermeneutics. The article closes with a criticism of naive optimism among purveyors of dialectic, recommending a proper concern with the irreconcilables of tragedy.<br>

Author(s): WODAK RUTH<br>
Abstract: The concept of the nation as an imagined community has gained importance in the relevant literature during the last decade. How do we construct national identities in discourse? Which topics, which discursive strategies and which linguistic devices are employed to construct national sameness and uniqueness on the one hand, and differences to other national collectives on the other hand? These questions were investigated in our study on the Austrian nation and identity. Taking several current social scientific approaches as our point of departure, we have developed a method of description and analysis of these phenomena which has applications beyond the discursive production of national identity in the specific Austrian example studied. By focusing particularly on the discursive construction of (national) sameness, this study has broken new ground in discourse-historical analysis, which until now has mainly been concerned with the analysis of the discursive construction of difference.<br>

Author(s): Elliet Guillaume<br>
Abstract: Depuis plusieurs années, les mots « morale » , « éthique » , « déontologie » ont fait leur apparition dans la sphère financière. Consciente des exigences éthiques de leur métier, de nombreuses institutions financières ont créé en leur sein des équipes de déontologues chargées de définir et de contrôler les comportements des professionnels. Un nouvel ordre normatif est né, composé non seulement des codes de conduite, mais aussi des travaux des autorités de contrôle et même du législateur. L'hétérogénéité de ces textes et l'utilisation désormais systématique du concept de déontologie par les acteurs de la place sèment une certaine confusion dans l'esprit du juriste, incapable aujourd'hui de définir juridiquement cette notion. Cet article a pour ambition de faire le point sur cette situation et de proposer des pistes de réflexion. For many years now, the words « moral », « ethics » , « deontology » have made an appearance on the financial scene. Being aware of the ethical requirements of their activity, many financial institutions have set up an inhouse team of deontologists in charge of defining and controlling professional behaviour. New standards have been applied, which are not only composed of codes of behaviour, but also of work done by regulators and even legislators. These heterogeneous texts and the systematic use of the deontology concept by market participants have brought about some confusion in jurist's minds, which until today have been unable to legally define this idea. This article aims at presenting this situation and proposing some areas of reflection.<br>

Author(s): SARMANT Thierry<br>
Abstract: Les frontispices des livres de médailles publiés entre la fin du XVIe et le milieu du XVIIIe siècle résument les conceptions et les intentions des numismates, manifestant l'ancien statut de la « science des médailles », non point science auxiliaire, mais quasi égale de l'histoire. Ils font d'abord l'éloge des médailles elles-mêmes, source de connaissance et divertissement : de là ces scènes de théâtre, ces arcs de triomphe, ces guirlandes, ces festons où monnaies et médaillons tiennent une large place. Les allégories de Clio et de Chronos, voisinant avec des monnaies sorties de terre, illustrent le lien entre la numismatique et l'histoire ; mais elles désignent aussi les médailles comme des parcelles d'éternité, échappées à la fuite du temps, objets offerts à la vénération autant qu'à l'étude. L'allégorie de Rome témoigne enfin à quelle époque vont les préférences de numismates tout imprégnés de culture classique : la monnaie de la Rome impériale est pour eux la médaille par excellence et préfigure celles du roi-soleil. Die Frontispizen der zwischen dem ausgehenden 16. Jh. und der Mitte des 18. Jh.s veröffentlichten Münzbücher spiegeln die Grundhaltung der Numismaten wider, für die althergebrachte 'Münzkunde' keine Hilfswissenschaft darstellt, sondern eine eigene Disziplin mit gleicher Dignität wie die Historie. Die Münzen werden als Quelle von Kenntnis und Zerstreuung gefeiert : In Theaterszenen, Triumphbögen, Girlanden und bei Festen werden Münzen und Medaillen an prominenter Stellen eingeführt. Die Allegorien von Clio und Chronos neben Münzen, die aus der Erde heraufsteigen, verbildlichen die Verbindung zwischen Numismatik und Geschichte ; zugleich weisen sie den Medaillen Ewigkeitswert zu : Als Wertstücken, die dem Lauf der Zeit entzogen und der Verehrung wie dem Studium anheimgestellt sind. Die Allegorie von Rom bezeugt schließlich die Hinwendung der Numismatiker zur Schlüsselepoche der für sie alles beherrschenden klassischen Kultur : Die Münzen des römischen ~<br>

Article Title: Irrationality and the Plurality of Philosophical Systems<br>
Publisher: Blackwell-Wiley Publishing<br>
Issue: i40115211<br>
Date: 1 1, 1985<br>
Author(s): Ricoeur Paul<br>
Abstract: Beginning with the paradoxical fact of the plurality of philosophical systems, the irrationality of this situation is examined, first, from the point of view of two solutions — the Hegelian solution and that which dissolves the paradox by denying that systems are exclusive of one another — judged to be inadequate; and then from the viewpoint of the contrast between the claims of genuine philosophy and its actual historical practice. The idea of system is examined from the perspective of Spinoza's Ethics and, finally, M. Gueroult's idéalisme intégral serves as a guide in exploring the result of subordinating the historical features of philosophical activity to its systematic features. Partant du fait paradoxal de la pluralité des systèmes philosophiques, l'auteur examine l'irrationalité de cette situation d'abord du point de vue de deux solutions — celle de Hegel et celle qui résoud le paradoxe en niant que les systèmes s'excluent mutuellement — solutions qui sont jugées inadéquates; puis du point de vue du contraste entre la véritable philosophie et sa pratique historique effective. L'idée de système est examinée dans la perspective de l'éthique de Spinoza et, enfin, l'idéalisme intégral de M. Gueroult sert de guide pour explorer les conséquences d'une subordination des aspects historiques de l'activité philosophique à ses aspects systématiques. Angesichts der paradoxen Situation der Pluralität von philosophischen Systemen wird die Irrationalität dieser Situation untersucht: zunächst vom Gesichtspunkt zweier Lösungen — nämlich der Lösung Hegels und derjenigen die darin besteht, die Unvereinbarkeit der Systeme zu leugnen —, die beide als inadäquat verworfen werden; dann von einem Standpunkt aus, der zwischen den Ansprüchen echter Philosophie und deren tatsächlicher historischer Praxis unterscheidet. Der Begriff des Systems wird aus der Perspektive von Spinozas Ethik untersucht und schliesslich wird M. Gueroults integraler Idealismus als Führer verwendet, um das Ergeb~<br>

Abstract: Le maloya est un genre musical essentiel de la culture réunionnaise. Associé aux racines noires, issu aussi bien de Madagascar, de l'Afrique, de l'Inde que de l'Europe pour certains de ses instruments, il est en fait le lieu même de la créolisation. Cette musique, longtemps frappée d'ostracisme et privée de représentations sur la scène publique, est, depuis ses origines, une musique sacrée. Elle est de plus en plus pratiquée aujourd'hui au point d'être devenue un signe symbolique fort de l'identité et de l'«authenticité» de la culture créole. Le texte du maloya, très proche du «fonnker» (ou poème) à l'époque contemporaine, est saturé par des réseaux intertextuels qui visent à produire un discours univoque sur la société réunionnaise: opposition entre dominés et dominants, quête désespérée des origines, motif de la cale du navire négrier... Autant d'éléments majeurs contribuant à la construction d'une parole collective de la mémoire et des origines retrouvées.<br>

Abstract: Deux tendances radicalement différentes semblent se partager la production historiographique médiévale. L'une, inaugurée par l'Histoire ecclésiastique d'Eusèbe et dominée par les réflexions que lui a consacrées saint Augustin (et de loin la plus importante), s'attache à retracer le destin des hommes appelés à se rassembler au sein de l'Église afin d'être portés vers un avenir qui doit leur permettre de sortir de l'histoire et de se retrouver à la fin des temps au sein de la Cité de Dieu. L'autre, renouant avec la tradition antique rejetée par l'historiographie chrétienne, se consacre à une communauté définie qu'elle pourvoit d'une origine et d'un passé qui fondent son identité et son existence présente, mais qui semblent en même temps constamment menacées par la fiction. Après avoir rappelé le point de vue de saint Augustin, et afin de mettre en lumière cette double orientation, cette étude s'appuie principalement sur l'historiographie des îles britanniques : à l'Histoire ecclésiastique du peuple anglais de Bède répond en effet l'Histoire des rois de Bretagne de Geoffroy de Monmouth. La critique adressée à ce dernier par Guillaume de Newburgh au seuil de son Histoire des choses anglaises, s'en prenant au caractère fictif des événements attribués au roi Arthur et aux prophéties de Merlin, éclaire de manière exemplaire le sens de l'opposition entre une histoire devant aboutir au ciel et celle qui trouve son assise sur la terre. Two conceptions, radically different, seem to share the medieval historiography. The first (and far most important) one, initiated by Eusebius' Ecclesiastical History and dominated by the reflections saint Augustine has devoted to it, recalls the destiny of human beings who should put themselves together under the conduct of the Church, in the expectation of a future which will allow them to get out of History and find themselves at the End of Times inside the City of God. The other one, linked to the tradition produced in Antiquity but rejecte~<br>

Abstract: This study considers Schumann's Kinderszenen (1838) from the point of view of the branch of literary criticism known as narratology. The author's aim is not to ascribe a specific narrative content to Schumann's cycle of thirteen brief pieces for piano, but rather to shed light on the inner nature of the work by identifying various ways in which Schumann adopts and adapts the techniques and strategies of narrative toward specifically musical ends. As the author observes, this approach is justified on at least two levels: first, by Schumann's passion for literature in general, and for the works of Jean Paul in particular; and second, by a variety of attributes of the work itself, the most obvious being the overall title as well as the specific titles given to its thirteen movements. Drawing on a broad spectrum of narratological writings - both in the areas of literary theory (Genette, Barthes, Ricceur) and musicology (Adorno, Newcomb) - the author proposes analogies between the various elements of literary narrative and their counterparts in Schumann's Kinderszenen. Specifically, the "narrator" of the cycle is identified with the composer himself, the overall structure of the work is construed as an "epic" as opposed to a "dramatic" one (owing to its articulation in thirteen diminutive episodes), and "diatonicism" and "chromaticism" are viewed as the cycle's principal "characters". For the author, the latter analogy is the decisive one. A substantial portion of the article is devoted to showing how the narrative design of the work as a whole arises from the interaction, alternation, and ultimate synthesis of these domains.<br>

Abstract: The analysis of an opera, understood as a dramatic text on which a plurality of texts converge, each generated by a different expressive code (be it verbal, musical, or visual), must first of all define a pertinent criterion by which the significant "actions" as discrete semantic units can be located in the text itself. Such a criterion can be identified within the principle at the basis of the dramatic genre, the interaction of the characters acting on stage and their changing relationships. On this basis, it is possible to read the action in Le Nozze di Figaro as the evolving system of dominance relationships between Count Almaviva and Figaro, and the various ways in which the other characters participate in this conflict. The same principle makes it possible to analyze a specific segment of the action (act II, scene VII-VIII, the second main section of the second finale), which can be broken down into a number of semantic units, along two hierarchically-organized structural levels. Earlier analyses have segmented this scene according to purely musical criteria, without considering its meaning for the overall unfolding of the drama. This new reading shows how the scene presents an important turning point in the plot, a temporary reversal of the relationship between the Count and the Countess. This turning point belongs specifically to the plot of the opera, which draws heavily on the text of the Beaumarchais comedy, but reformulates the syntax of the events; this shows how the "meaning" of a scene does not lie in the characters' dialogue alone, but that this is merely one of the possible devices by which the action is made to advance. As far as the role of the musical text is concerned, an analysis of its various components (form, motivic materials, tonal relationships, etc.) in the scene under consideration reveals that its role is primarily one of demarcation (it helps one to perceive the unity of a specific set of actions and its difference from the next set) a~<br>

Abstract: Dans le prolongement de la philosophie de Wittgenstein, les contributions récentes de Quine et de Searle invitent à modifier la manière de poser la question de la signification des termes théoriques : ne faudrait-il pas substituer à une préoccupation principalement ontologique (que désignent les termes théoriques ?) un souci plus praxéologique (quel rôle les termes théoriques tiennent-ils dans l'articulation des discours et des pratiques scientifiques ?). C'est ce renversement qu'il s'agit d'opérer ici. Starting from the philosophy of Wittgenstein, more recent works of Quine and Searle are presented. This reflexion leads to a modification of the way of considering the meaning of theoretical terms. It is suggested that, in place of a mainly ontological point of view (what is the reference of theoretical terms), a more praxeological point of view is more appropriate (which is the use of theoretical terms for the building of sciences and for scientific work). The goal of this article is to consider this change of perspective.<br>

Abstract: Au début des années 70 P. Ricœur travaillait à un rapprochement entre sémantique et herméneutique, projet qu'il n'a pas, semble-t-il, repris ultérieurement. Dans sa défense de la référence au monde contre les attaques des sémioticiens français, il était conduit à généraliser le rapport de référence à tout discours, y compris la poésie. Refusant autant le relativisme que le positivisme, il tentait d'unifier en une conception tensionnelle les termes des distinctions tranchées de la théorie classique. Dans cette perspective la logique du jugement accueille la créatitivé de la métaphore ; l'épistémologie des sciences reconnaît la valeur des modèles heuristiques ; et l'ontologie du discours s'adapte au pluralisme de notre rapport au monde à travers les œuvres littéraires. Tous ces déplacements d'accent devaient assurer une transition continue de la sémantique à l'herméneutique sans quitter le terrain du monde pour les abîmes de l'interprétation infinie. At the beginning of the seventies P. Ricœur was working upon the possibility of bringing together semantics and hermeneutics, although he did not, apparently, follow this line of concern thereafter. In his defense of the reference to the world against the French semiotician's attacks, he was driven to generalize the relation of reference to all kinds of discourse, poetry included. Rejecting relativism as much as positivism, he tried to unify in a tensional view the terms of the clear-cut distinctions of classical theory. From this point of view, the logic of judgement turns out to welcome the creativity of metaphor ; the epistemology of the sciences recognizes the worth of heuristic models ; and the ontology of discourse fits the pluralism of the relation to the world opened up to us by the literary works. All these shifts of emphasis were intended as securing a smooth transition from semantics to hermeneutics, without leaving the firm ground of the world for the depths of infinite interpretation.<br>

Abstract: Il s'agit de montrer comment l'ouvrage de J. Sommet, L'honneur de la liberté, réflexion biographique, avec, pour point fort, l'expérience du camp de Dachau, enracine, dans son récit, une pensée de la liberté, apte à trancher l'indéfini des débats d'école, tant dans le rapport entre liberté et loi que dans la relation avec des groupes différents dans leurs options sur le sens de la vie. In this narrative is shown how, through several experiences (including at Dachau concentration camp) freedom is at work and transcends intellectual discussions in matters concerning the relation between freedom and law and also different conceptions about the meaning of life.<br>

Abstract: Si l'on admet que l'herméneutique part de la reconnaissance d'une intention de signifier donnée déposée dans des signes, force est de considérer que l'entreprise kantienne s'y oppose, aussi bien d'un point de vue systématique que d'un point de vue historique. On critiquera à cette occasion la tentative de tirer du kantisme, en particulier de la troisième Critique, un point de départ pour une herméneutique. L'étude de « l'herméneutique morale » de l'écrit sur la religion replacé dans le contexte de la critique biblique de son époque apporte une confirmation des analyses systématiques et souligne les limites du dispositif kantien. Les reproches adressés par les tenants de « l'école mythique » de Göttingen (J. G. Eichhorn, J. G. Rosenmüller, G. L. Bauer) à la Religion dans les limites de la simple raison reviennent à distinguer nettement jugement et interprétation : Kant met en oeuvre un jugement, et non une interprétation. If one admits that the starting point of hermeneutics is a recognition of an intention to signify facts left in signs, then one must recognize that the project of Kant is opposed to this starting point, both from a systematic and historical point of view. The temptation to take from the works of Kant, especially the Third Critique, a starting point for hermeneutics will be subject to analysis. A study of « moral hermeneutics » that is drawn from the texts of religion (and which is done within the context of the biblical criticism of their period) confirms the analysis et underlines the limits of the Kantian plan of action. The criticisms of the « l'école mythique » of Göttingen (J. G. Eichhorn, J. G. Rosenmüller, G. L. Bauer) aimed at Religion within the limits of simple reason aid to clearly distinguish between judgement and interpretation. Kant implements a judgment and not an interpretation.<br>

Abstract: Dans le hiatus entre le langage et la pluralité des langues s'insère le problème de la traduction. D'un autre côté traduire a aussi une signification plus ample, qui couvre la communication entre les hommes et aussi la communication avec soi-même (voir Jakobson, Steiner). Le problème de la traduction est ici abordé du point de vue d'une herméneutique qui dialogue avec les sciences du langage et qui est engagée dans une réflexion sur la condition humaine, finie et charnelle. Si nous savons renoncer au rêve d'une langue unique et d'une traduction parfaite, en partant d'une relecture en termes positifs du récit de Babel, nous pourrons accueillir l'étranger dans la lignée d'une théorie et une pratique de l'hospitalité langagière (Ricœur). D'autre part, même notre quête personnelle d'identité passe par un travail énorme et jamais définitif de traduction, qui coïncide avec l'histoire de nos vies, avec son réseau infini d'actions et de passions et avec le travail du deuil et de la mémoire que cette œuvre exige. In the gap between language and the multiplicity of languages comes the problem of translation. To translate, moreover, also has a wider meaning, which covers both communication between people and communication with oneself (see Jakobson, Steiner). The problem of translation is examined here from the point of view of a hermeneutic that is both in dialogue with the disciplines of language and engaged in reflection on the human condition, which is both finite and corporeal. If we can put aside the dream of a single language and a perfect translation, starting from a re-reading in positive terms of the story of Babel, we can welcome the stranger in accordance with a theory and practice of linguistic hospitality (Ricœur). On the other hand, even our personal search for identity takes place through an enormous and never definitive work of translation, which coincides with our life history, with its infinite network of actions and passions and with the work both of grief ~<br>

Abstract: C'est dans le tome III de Temps et récit, paru en 1985 que, dans le cadre d'un chapitre intitulé « L'aporétique de la temporalité », Paul Ricœur entre directement en débat avec l'auteur d'Être et temps. Bien qu'il souligne d'emblée l'originalité proprement phénoménologique de l'analyse heideggérienne du temps qui a le mérite de rompre avec le subjectivisme d'Augustin et de Husserl, il ne l'en soumet pas moins à une critique sévère, centrée sur deux points principaux : le privilège donné à l'être pour la mort, qu'il oppose à l'insouciance spinoziste à l'égard de la mort et au privilège donné à la natalité par Hannah Arendt, et l'aporie inhérente à la conception heideggérienne d'une finitude de la temporalité et d'un concept vulgaire du temps, qui ne permet pas, selon lui, à Heidegger de rendre compte aussi bien du temps historique que du temps de la nature. On s'efforce ici, en prenant appui sur les textes mêmes de Heidegger, de répondre point par point à cette critique. In the chapter entitled « The Aporetic of Temporality » of the third volume of Time and Narrative, published in 1985, Paul Ricœur enters directly into a debate with the author of Being and Time. In spite of the fact that he begins by emphasizing the originality of the Heideggerian time-analysis which breaks with Augustine's and Husserl's subjectivism, he nevertheless submits it to a severe critique which is centred on two main points : first, the privilege given to the being toward death, which Ricœur opposes to Spinoza's carelessness regarding death and Arendt's privilege given to natality, and secondly, the aporia involved in Heidegger's conception of a finite temporality and of a vulgar concept of time, which in his view does not allow to take into account historical time as well as natural time. This paper undertakes, on the basis of Heidegger's texts themselves, to give a detailed answer to Ricœur's critique.<br>

Abstract: Ce texte a pour objet de montrer que le moment de la « refiguration » dans Temps et récit est indissociable d'un souci éthique. La fonction narrative a des implications éthiques car le récit — et particulièrement le récit d'une (ou des) vie(s) — constitue un point de passage: il pose la question de la communicabilité ou de l'échange des expériences. D'où la difficulté que Ricœur a lui-même affrontée: qu'en est-il des vies qui ne trouvent pas de narrateur? My aim is to bring to light how « refiguration » — as analysed in Time and Narrative — is strongly linked to an ethical care. Narrative function has ethical consequences because Narrative of a life (or of several Ufes) is a way to communicability and exchange of experiences. That is the raison why Ricœur himself confronted the difficulty: what about Ufes deprived of Narrative?<br>

Abstract: Le rapport de l'œuvre de Paul Ricœur à la modernité ne va pas de soi. Imprégnée profondément par le testament judéo-chrétien, méfiante à l'égard des ruptures brutales, soucieuse d'incarner le cogito dans l'existence, sa philosophie pourrait aisément s'inscrire dans une tendance néo-traditionaliste. Cette dimension anti-moderne se renforce en raison de la place majeure que la pensée de Ricœur accorde aux mouvances post-modernes, qu'elles soient d'inspiration vitaliste, structuraliste ou post-structuraliste. Pourtant, jamais le philosophe n'a abandonné ni le projet émancipateur, ni la conquête reflexive du cogito portés par la modernité. La dialectique subtile et originale dans son œuvre de ces trois paradigmes philosophiques se traduit donc sous la forme d'un modernisme paradoxal qui se comprend mieux lorsqu'on le replace dans le cadre d'un réformisme moral et politique, à l'opposé aussi bien d'un éloge de la tradition que des emportements révolutionnaires. The links Paul Ricœur's works maintain with modernity cannot be taken for granted. Being deeply immersed in the Judeo-Christian Legacy, wary of abrupt brenks, concerned about embodying the Cogito in existence, his philosophy could be easily associated with a neo-traditionalist trend. This anti-modern dimension is strengthened because of the chief place that Ricœur attaches in his philosophy to the post-modern ways of thinking, whatever inspiration they come from: vitalist, structuralist or post-structuralist. However, the philosopher abandoned neither the emancipatory project, nor the reflexive practice of the Cogito carried by modernity. Therefore, in his works, the subtle and original dialectics of these three philosophical paradigms expresses itself in the way of a paradoxical modernism which can be better understood when it is considered within a political and ethical reformism. Such a point of view is opposed to a praise of tradition as well as to revolutionary outbursts.<br>

Abstract: Hermeneutical theory remains rooted in a metaphysics of the "interiority of meaning". For example, Ricoeur transposed Freud's metaphysics of interior libidinal meaning into a literary theory of interpretation. The corollary to Freud's metaphysics of interiorized meaning is "desire as lack". Deleuze and Guattari's attack on Freud's theory of historical-libidinal drives formed the basis of their explication of the "rhizomatic" exteriority of meaning, which they develop, in literary terms, in their book, Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature. In their view, Kafka's novels model a style of writing that disavows interior meaning. They also oppose the primacy of Freud's concept of desire-as-lack with that of desire-as-plenitude. This paper will discuss a mode of biblical interpretation based on the twin concepts of exteriority of meaning and desire-as-plentitude, according to four interpretive stategies: 1) rediscover one's hyperdifferentiated life; 2) think politically; 3) seek out interstitial spaces; 4) change one's point of entry.<br>

Abstract: In a first section, the renewed interest in historical consciousness among social scientists and historians is discussed, which resulted in a clearer understanding of how historical memory functions and of the diverse ways in which historians use references to the past. Against this background, Paul's use of history in the letter to the Galatians is analysed in a second section. The apostle is not interested in recording the past, but develops, in the light of his own experiences in preaching the gospel among gentiles, an alternative perspective on Israel's past. By taking the figure of Abraham as his point of departure, he argues for a more inclusive understanding of Israel's history, which enables him to provide a theological justification for the equal status of gentile believers in the community of faith.<br>

Abstract: The different "readings and readers" are evaluated, with a view to responsible hermeneutics, on three levels. First, the question is asked as to whether the different readings took place in a responsible way in terms of their own presuppositions and goals. Some general remarks are made on the possible comparison and integration of these readings are made. Second, the question is asked whether some of these readings are more appropriate, responsible or legitimate readings of literature than others. The point is argued that such an evaluation cannot be timeless and abstract, but will depend on the purpose of the reader. Third, the question is asked how the specific pencope, namely a text from the Christian New Testament, can be responsibly read by New Testament scholars.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: i396847<br>
Date: 10 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): MellonAbstract: This article considers some methodological issues that arise when empirical inquiry is conducted within the framework of qualitative assumptions about the nature of reality and how we as humans can know it. These assumptions posit an empirical reality that is complex, intertwined, best understood as a contextual whole, and inseparable from the individuals-including the researchers--who know that reality. Four primary issues are considered in this article: the researcher as interpreter; the emergent nature of qualitative research; understanding the experience of others; and trustworthiness in qualitative research. Further, the article discusses methodological practices that have arisen in the context of qualitative assumptions and issues. The practices described are drawn from diverse qualitative research traditions, including participant observation, naturalistic inquiry, grounded theory, hermeneutic approaches to the interpretation of texts (and actions as texts), qualitative evaluation, and a body of methodological literature that calls itself generically "qualitative research." The goals of the article are threefold: (1) to present the internal rationale of qualitative research as issues and practices that arise within the context of assumptions about reality and what we can know about it; (2) to encourage researchers to examine the relevance of qualitative assumptions, issues, and practices to their own research problems; and (3) to point readers toward more detailed discussions of qualitative research.<br>

Abstract: The growth of knowledge in any discipline depends on discursive practice for the assertion of claims and the assessment of claims. At times, however, that discursive practice may be ideological in nature. Ideology is here defined as being grounded in efforts at domination--the ascendance of some ideas over others. Examination of the incidence of ideology in discourse is necessarily interpretive; part of this article explores the application of hermeneutics to the analysis of discourse. A set of examples of discursive practice in library and information science (LIS), purposely selected, is examined for ideological intent. Ultimately, the aim is to demonstrate that some discourse is ideological in nature and purpose, and to point out the implications of such discursive practice for knowledge growth in LIS.<br>

Abstract: The present methodological debate about the need for a particular theological perspective when researching on the subject of contemporary church history raises central issues about the question of the validity of theology as a subject for scientific investigations. On the one hand, we should seek to avoid any dualtrack approach which would question the whole notion claimed by theologians to be advancing the cause of truth in a scientific manner. On the other hand, theology is a "thorn in the flesh" for the world of scholarship, since it seeks to guarantee openness as a central maxim in scholarly research, and to oppose any reductionist tendency which would pervert the secular methods of scholarly work by advancing the monopolistic claim of a systematic, ideological atheism. The right of theologians to propose their own special approach to theological questions should not be based on abstract principle, but is better defended-drawing on the researches of Itopper, Ricoeur and Marrou-as being in accordance with man's sinful nature and pragmatically meaningful. Drawing a distinction between the discovery of knowledge and assessment of its meaning can lead to a positive evaluation of experiences and their various connections. Any examination of experience, from a theological or ecclesiastical point of view, should not therefore be dismissed as illegitimate. Rather, it can add a valuable dimension in producing new horizons and perspectives. Of course, any such theological endeavour will still be subject to the rigorous disciplines of interdisciplinary discourse. Church history, as well as contemporary church history, is therefore in some ways competing with other historical disciplines. They are all attempting to make sense out of the welter of events by means of a theoretical ordering of experience. As such they provide a desirable, but by no means an exclusive, method of guiding men and women in their on-going search for insights into the nature of the world, man and Go~<br>

Abstract: In Arendt's interrogations of political modernity, the concepts of history and politics have an ambiguous relation. On the one hand, she insisted that the performative character of politics as action was bound to its narrative aspect as remembrance. She was also a fervent proponent of integrating the historical sense into political understanding. On the other hand, Arendt characterized the modern historical sensibility from the point of view of politics as a "ghastly absurdity," and asserted that the political thought of our times needed to free itself both "from history" and "from thinking in historical terms." This paper explores the different meanings that Arendt granted to "history" as a (anti) political force and to historical sensibility as the basis for political understanding. It argues that not only were Arendt's rejection of the modern concept of history and its politics of history central for her critique, but that it was one of the key concerns that shaped the articulation of her own theory of action. The paper also examines the problem against the background of the intellectual tradition of Arendt's youth and in particular its uncompromising antihistoricism.<br>

Abstract: This article analyses the difficult relation between anthropology and history. The point, therefore, is to show how anthropology conceptualises the past differently from history as a discipline. Beginning with the differences between anthropology and history in terms of the concept of time, the article highlights that while for history time is concrete, objective and exogenous to human beings, for anthropology it is characterised by its being condensed, collectively subjective and endogenous. By analyzing actual examples, the article shows that the anthropologist is not interested in the past per se, but rather in the past as a dimension of the present. Accordingly, actualised, revised and manipulated history as well as the role of the past in the present need to be taken into account. Consequently, history and the past have their own specific efficiency because they are also a form of knowledge and social resource mobilised by single individuals or groups to find their bearings and act accordingly in the present and likewise to plan the future.<br>

Author(s): Daniels John<br>
Abstract: Desire is examined here with a view to informing a theological response to capitalism. The notion of mimetic desire offered by René Girard is used as a starting point, Girard's ideas being brought into critical engagement with, first, other intersubjective accounts, namely those offered by Alexandre Kojève and by psychoanalysis in its Freudian and Lacanian variants; and then the account of desire as productive becoming offered by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, in which the link to capitalism is explicit. It is suggested that both mimetic desire and its productive counterpart can be understood as asserting the priority of desire itself over both subject and object. The possibilities for framing a coherent theological account of desire which is both mimetic and productive are then assessed with reference to Bernard of Clairvaux, Aquinas and Augustine, noting that accepting a metaphysics of participation makes plausible a productive desire which is nonetheless coded as a mimesis of the divine precedent. Such a conclusion brings into relief the inevitable difficulty of reconciling Christian and capitalist economies of desire.<br>

Abstract: L'expresivité phonologigue de la langue poétique tchèque Nous disposons aujourd'hui de preuves suffisantes pour croire au bien fondé du symbolisme phonétique véritable. Selon les oeuvres cités de Jakobson, Fónagy et Žuravlev on peut donc considérer comme acquis le fait que certaines significations sont naturellement attachées à certains sons et que tout phonème lorsqu'il est réalisé peut se charger de symbolisme par référence à isa nature articulatoire et acoustique. Le but de ce travail est de créer le point de départ objectif a l'interprétation phonostylistique du symbolisme phonétique des sons tchèques. L'auteur suit la doctrine de la méthode psychosémantique, il utilise la différentielle sémantique et présente a 40 sujets tchèques les phonème de leur langue maternelle. Jiráček prouve la validité de son approche par la confrontation des résultats parmi dix groupes des sujets tchèques a 40 personnes. Les résultats de l'ensemble de 400 sujets ont montré des facultés considérables des phonèmes tchèques pour l'expressivité phonologigue univoque. Ala fin de son étude l'auteur cherche d mettre en relation ses constatations scientifiques avec le domaine de la langue poétique tchèque. Il crée les points de départ a la comprehension automatique de la composition des sons du vers. Il donne naissance (en collaboration avec L. Popelinský) du programme automatique de cette analyse du vers et son fonctionnement présente sur la traduction du poème de Paul Verlaine.<br>

Author(s): WOLICKA ELŻBIETA<br>
Abstract: The article of Elzbieta Wolicka is consecrated to the consideration of the phenomenon of time taken in the contexts of individual human experience, contemporary cultural situation and Christian faith. The starting point of the 1st part of the article is the fragment of Confessiones (ch. XI) of St. Augustine and the short parable of Franz Kafka entitled HE. The author of the article brings to the light the dialogical basis of the human perception of time and raises up the quaestion of "a hidden sabotage of trust" which is characteristic to the social relations of our times. This is also the one among many other factors of the so called "crisis of culture" (mal du siècle). The crisis consists of a feeling of a threat, a burden of the past and a fear of the future. The 2nd part of the article is concerned with the analysis of the eschatological meaning of some words of Christ in the Gospel of St. John (4, 23; 5, 25-29; 12, 13; 12, 27, 31). They reveal the Christian sense of the human temporal condition in the light of "the economy of salvation" and the dialogue between a believer and God. A catastrophic thrill, a feeling of existential paradox, a blockage of communication - the symptoms of the crisis of cultural conscience - could be described as "the edipse of God" (M. Buber) or "the abandonment of God" (J. Ellul) in the contemporary world. The Gospel points out that in the heart of human temporal experience there is still existing conversatio sacra and the presence of God in our history is actual.<br>

Article Title: Ralph Waldo Emerson and the Dual Economy of Recognition<br>
Publisher: Universitätsverlag WINTER GmbH<br>
Issue: i40138215<br>
Date: 1 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Voelz Johannes<br>
Abstract: Combining a historical with a theoretical perspective, this essay begins by reconstructing Ralph Waldo Emerson's evolving theory of recognition and the central role it played for his concept of 'self-reliance.' Initially having adopted the theorizations of recognition developed by Scottish Enlightenment thinkers, Emerson came to articulate the idea of self-reliance by way of developing an alternative approach to recognition, in which the source allocating recognition is neither society nor an inborn moral sense, but rather the transcendentally conceptualized self. Emerson's shift towards self-recognition poses questions seldom asked in the contemporary debate on recognition. Moving beyond a reconstructive aim, one such question is considered in the article's second part: What role does recognition come to play in the act of reading? Taking Emerson's own essays as a case in point, the author argues that the aesthetic experience afforded by non-fictional texts can be understood as a facilitator of self-recognition—as a continuous process of imaginarily experiencing the enlargement of the self. This process intersects with dynamics of social recognition, producing a 'dual economy of recognition.' The article concludes by challenging the assumption found in currently dominant paradigms of recognition which assumes that recognition can come to successful completion. Conceived as a dual economy, the article argues, recognition is to the contrary constitutively open-ended.<br>

Publisher: Universitätsverlag WINTER GmbH<br>
Issue: i40138215<br>

Author(s): Hanich Julian<br>
Abstract: In this article I suggest that we, as human beings, gain personal recognition not only through intersubjective encounters with others, but also through aesthetic experience. To support my claims about what I call 'aesthetic recognition,' I focus on a pervasive but rarely explored phenomenon: the cinematic shock. Not only a staple ingredient of thrillers, horror films, and disaster movies, it is also found in art-films. The cinematic shock will serve as the case in point of my argument because in its lived intensity, density, and conspicuousness we can describe it more easily with appropriate words than other aesthetic experiences that are equally able to foster aesthetic recognition but are less readily accessible via language. When experienced in the social environment of the movie theater, cinematic shocks enable two widespread types of aesthetic recognition: aesthetic experience as individual self-recognition, and aesthetic experience as a collective recognition of accord. Due to the strongly affective lived-body experience brought about by an encounter with the aesthetic object, the recipient not only feels self-aware of and self-affirmed in his or her own embodied existence, he or she also experiences confirmation as part of a group responding equally—in accordance—to an aesthetic object. This double recognition gained from the cinematic experience of shock derives from the individual film experience and the collective theatrical experience. An additional outcome of my methodological reliance on dense phenomenological descriptions may be an argument for the value of phenomenology in both the study of film and of aesthetics more generally.<br>

Abstract: This essay explores a phenomenon familiar to archivists: the seamless moment of time and space within the remembering process when communities become aware of and must confront the fragility of public memory and make decisions about the management and preservation of their information resources. This decision point has recently been called the documentary moment. The authors' exploration of this concept focuses on the theories, strategies, methodologies, and processes formerly employed and now emerging at Library and Archives Canada (LAC) to facilitate the disposition of government's information resources. They also examine the challenges presented by the digital age on the documentary moment and whether corresponding philosophical or methodological changes to current institutional strategies, including macro-appraisal, are required.<br>

Abstract: La 'démonstration' présentée dans Rhet. Her. 4,68 est le point de départ pour une étude qui vise à souligner comme traits qui lui sont propres la complémentarité de ενάργεια et de ενέργεια. À ce propos on prend en considération l'une après l'autre ces deux notions et les textes des auteurs anciens où l'on peut mieux comprendre leur nature et leur fonction à l'intérieur d'un discours. Après avoir mentionné les définitions de Γένάργεια données par l'Anonyme de Seguière et par Denys d'Halicarnasse et après avoir souligné la différence entre ενάργεια et σαφήνεια on s'attache à examiner quelles sont les conditions qui permettent au locuteur de 'mettre sous les yeux' des auditeurs ce qu'il dit. À l'importance des détails mentionnée par les différents auteurs s'ajoute en fait l'effet suggestif de ce que les Grecs appelaient φαντασίαι et les Latins visiones. On se penche donc sur les textes de Quintilien et de l'auteur du Sublime qui en traitent longuement et on met en relief le rôle joué à ce propos par Γένέργεία des faits, c'est-à-dire par leur façon d'être 'en acte'. Une fois cette notion éclaircie à l'aide de la Métaphysique et de la Rhétorique d'Aristote on conclut cette brève recherche par la mention du niveau le plus haut que l'évidence rhétorique peut atteindre : l'effet émotionnel du couple ενέργεια - ενάργεια qui pousse les auditeurs à se voir, eux-mêmes, sur la scène. The "demonstration" presented in Rhet. Her. 4,68, is the starting point of a study which aims at underscoring as specific features of the demonstration the complementarity of enargeia and energeia. In order to suit our purpose, we have examined one after the other those two notions and the texts of ancient writers in which we can better apprehend their nature and function within a discourse.

Abstract: Dans la Vie d'Apollonios de Tyane, Philostrate construit, au moment de la rencontre entre son protagoniste et Iarchas, le chef des brahmanes, un dialogue dans lequel autorité et charisme sont essentiels. Cette mise en scène l'autorise ensuite à produire un discours concernant la domination romaine et ses représentants, à destination des Grecs comme des Romains. La question du destinataire permet de mettre en lumière certains des enjeux les plus fondamentaux de l'œuvre du sophiste. Elle montre de quelle manière Philostrate interroge les Hellènes sur leurs choix de vie et leur identité dans le monde gréco-romain du début du IIIe siècle. In the Life of Appolonios of Tyana, Philostratos builds up, when his protagonist meets larchas, the chief of the Brahmins, a dialogue in which authority and charisma are essential. That staging allows him to produce a speech concerning Roman sway an dits representatives, addressing Greeks and Romans alike. The question of addressee enables him to highlight some of the more fundamental point at stake in the sophist's work. It shows in what way Philostratos questions the Greeks about their life choices and their identity in the Greco-Roman worlf at the beginning of the IIIrd century.<br>

Abstract: Au lieu de soi marque un Haut Lieu du soi. Dans cette perspective, la hauteur du sujet s'acquiert par la verticalité (transcendance), et non pas uniquement par l'horizontalité (immanence). Interrogeant l'ambition d'une approche de saint Augustin du point de vue de saint Augustin lui-même, on montrera d'abord le mérite d'un tel renouvellement dans le cadre de la philosophie comme telle : la question de l'homme, le poids du soi, et le statut de l'èros. Une noble « disputatio théologique et phénoménologique » cependant naîtra dans la confrontation avec d'autres ouvrages (en particulier Dieu, la chair et l'autre. D'Irénée à Duns Scot [PUF, « Épiméthée » , 2008]) : doit-on nécessairement « dépasser » la métaphysique dans un tiers ordre, ou ne convient-il pas plutôt de la « transformer de l'intérieur » dans le geste que semble avoir accompli le Docteur d'Hippone lui-même ? Il en va ici du statut de la philosophie dans son rapport ci la métaphysique et à la théologie, mais aussi de la possibilité d'une « nouvelle pratique phénoménologique de la philosophie médiévale », pour aujourd'hui comme pour demain. In Place of the Self marks what we might call a « high point of the self ». From this exalted perspective the measure of the subject is taken in its verticality (transcendence) and not simply its horizontality (immanence). Jean-Luc Marion approaches St. Augustine from the point of view of St. Augustine himself, and in this article I show first the merit of such an approach within a philosophical framework, its relevance to topics such as the question of man, the burden of the self and the status of eros. A significant « theological and phenomenological disputatio » does, however, arise when In Place of the Self is put up against other works (in particular against God, the Flesh and the Other : from Irenaeus to Duns Scotus [PUF, « Épiméthée » , 2008]). Do we have to « overcome » metaphysics by moving to another order of analysis ? Is it not better to work from the inside, i~<br>

Abstract: The idea/metaphor of the world as a text, essential to the so called linguistic turn of human and social sciences, has a long intellectual history which originates, from the very beginning of Christianity, in Saint Paul's assertion of the presence of a double sense (literal and spiritual) in the Old Testament. Starting from this point, the present paper sets out to describe the development and consolidation of the tradition of Biblical exegesis and hermeneutics which in the 20th century gave rise to a variety of schools and trends that in one way or another maintain the fundamental thesis that reality is a text that is to be deciphered. The article also highlights that the original Christian sources did generate two other lines of intellectual tradition: a more temperate exegetical tradition prevailing in the Catholic world, and furthermore the current Western cultural belief that world is like a book (a belief which kept the terms of the comparison separated and did not confuse them).<br>

Abstract: If human beings were empirically shown to be irrational, would this finding destroy the foundations of economic science? We think not because we doubt that this postulate is needed as a foundation of economic science. We examine the laboratory experiments conducted by behavioral economists and experimental psychologists on human judgment and decision-making, using Bayes' Theorem and the Expected Value model We examine a number of issues: Can we base ourselves on experimenters' full rationality for doubting of human rationality? Are rational models anything else than handy tools? Do humans' minds function like rational tools or with rational tools? How an "irrational" human being could create anything "rational"? Should rationality be subordinated to reason? Nature being neither rational nor irrational, is there any point in applying the concept of rationality to one its constituents? If human beings were rational forms of life, would this specie have survived?<br>

Abstract: A partir de una visión de la moneda que toma en cuenta su función simbólica primera —la de la representación de la totalidad social—, este artículo analiza la relación entre legitimidad política y el régimen monetario, puesta en escena por el paso de las altas inflaciones a la deflación en América Latina. En esta perspectiva se reconsideran los problemas de sustentabilidad de las políticas monetarias, y se establece que las mismas plantean más en América Latina que en Europa, el problema de la relación entre las soberanías política y monetaria. La interrogación se remite así al futuro posible del Mercosur: ¿se enredará en la discusión comercial o será motivo de emprender una deliberación política sobre la reorganización territorial y el marco institucional que sostendrían un crecimiento en economía abierta impulsado por el empleo y la demanda? On the basis of a view of currency that considers its initial symbolic function— that of the representation of social totality— the text analyzes the relationship between political legitimacy and monetary regime, caused by the shift from high inflation to deflation in Latin America. The problems of the sustainability of monetary policies are considered from this point of view, and the author suggests that, even more so in Latin America than in Europe, these policies raise the problem of the relationship between political and monetary sovereignty. The question leads one to the possible future of Mercosur: will it become enmeshed in trade discussions or will it lead to a political discussion on territorial reorganization and the institutional framework that would support growth in an open economy driven by employment and demand? À partir d'une vision de la monnaie qui prend en compte sa fonction symbolique première celle de la représentation de la totalité sociale, on analyse dans ce texte la relation entre légitimité politique et régime monétaire, relation mise en scène par le passage, en Amérique latine, de l'inflation galopan~<br>

Abstract: Desde una perspectiva relacional y a partir de la información contenida en la correspondencia epistolar, este artículo estudia las prácticas mercantiles de los mercaderes vascos establecidos en Buenos Aires durante el período de guerras internacionales de finales del siglo XVIII. Tomando como mirador la Casa de comercio de don Martín de Álzaga, se explorar algunos de los mecanismos que articulaban la integración de los circuitos mercantiles rioplatenses en el sistema de la economía colonial. Entre ellos, las gestiones concretas llevadas a cabo por los «agentes de enlace» organizados por el jefe de la Casa dentro de una conformación familiar de la empresa. A partir d'une analyse en termes de réseaux sociaux et à partir des informations recueillies dans la correspondance, ce travail étudie les pratiques commerciales des commerçants basques installés à Buenos Aires durant la période des guerres internationales de la fin du XVIIIe siècle. Choisissant comme point d'observation la maison de commerce de don Martín de Álzaga il explore quelques-uns des mécanismes qui assuraient l'articulation des circuits commerciaux du Rio de la Plata avec le reste de l'économie coloniale. Parmi eux, le texte souligne l'importance des négociations menées par les « agents de contact » organisés par le chef de la maison commerciale dont la structure restait familiale. From a relational perspective and springing from information gotten form epistolary correspondence, this article studies the business practices of the Bask merchants who settled in Buenos Aires during the international war period towards the end of the eighteenth century. Having as observer Don Martin de Álzaga's business house, we will explore the mechanisms that articulated the integrations of the business circuits of the River Plate area in the colonial economic system. Among them, the concrete deals carried out by the «bond agents» organized by the House's boss within the familiar business constitution.<br>

Abstract: L'article est une recension très développée du dernier livre de J. A. T. Robinson, The Priority of John (Londres, 1985). Il faut distinguer plusieurs aspects dans la thèse de Robinson. Pour la date de l'édition finale de Jean, il vaut mieux retenir les données de la tradition patristique que la critique interne vient confirmer, quoi qu'en dise R. : le recenseur fait la contre-épreuve de son argumentation. L'examen interne de l'évangile laisse à bon droit les critiques hésitant sur l'identité du « disciple que Jésus aimait ». La chronologie de la vie publique a été étudiée par R. avec soin et on peut le suivre dans la plupart des cas ; mais il n'est pas le premier qui donne à Jean une telle préférence sur ce point. On peut être plus hésitant devant sa reconstruction de la « vie de Jésus », dans la mesure où il lui manque une analyse méthologique sérieuse au sujet de la notion d'­« historicité » ; il tend trop à étendre celle-ci aux détails des récits et des paroles de Jésus. Il nuance en principe la « littéralité » de ces paroles dans la catéchèse de Jean ; mais en pratique il a toujours tendance à l'étendre outre-mesure, sans tenir assez compte de leur « relecture » dans la lumière de la Résurrection et en fonction de l'expérience de l'Église. This article is an extended review of J. A. T. Robinsons's last book, The Priority of John (London, 1985). Although Robinson holds for an early date of the final edition of John, the reviewer argues to the contrary, viz., that it is better to retain the patristic tradition of a late date and that internal criticism supports this tradition. Critics are understandably puzzled over the identity of the "disciple whom Jesus loved". The chronology of the public life of Jesus has been carefully studied by R. and one can follow him most of the time, but he is not the first to prefer John on this point. But one hesitates before his reconstruction of the "life of Jesus", since he lacks a methodologically serious analysis of the notion "~<br>

Issue: i40170775<br>
Date: 1 1, 1992<br>
Author(s): Beauchamp Paul<br>
Abstract: Avec quelques ouvertures nouvelles en direction des sciences humaines, et dans la ligne d'ouvrages publiés par l'auteur, surtout L'Un et l'Autre Testament, vol. 1 (1977), vol. 2 (1990) et Le Récit, la Lettre et le Corps (1982), l'accomplissement des Écritures, comme plénitude de l'acte du Christ, est proposé comme fondation d'une théologie, qui ne peut pas ne pas être biblique. Le chemin consiste à chercher la vérité anthropologique de l'accomplissement dans les dimensions humaines de la Parole et du Corps, vécues dans l'échange narratif. Le lieu de cet échange est la figure des noces à ses niveaux divers de réalisation, individuelle, sociale, historique. With some new pointers taken from anthropology and prolonging the inspiration of works previously published by the author (in particular: L'Un el l'Autre Testament, vol. 1, 1977; vol. 2, 1990 and Le Récit, la Lettre et le Corps, 1982), we here find the proposition that the fulfilment of Scriptures, inasmuch as it is the culminating point of the work of Christ, could be the basis for a genuinely and unescapably biblical theology. The method consists in searching for the human anthenticity of fulfilment in the anthropological dimension of Speech and Body understood as life through tales exchanged. The crucial point of that exchange is marriage symbolism on its different levels of experience: personal, social and historical.<br>

Abstract: L'interprétation du Cantique ne fait pas l'unanimité. Il se présente comme une composition polémique en réaction contre l'establishment civil et religieux et les mœurs de l'époque du second Temple. La langue tout entière du Cant, est une sorte de pastiche des traditions bibliques. Elle réutilise les métaphores prophétiques sur l'amour de Dieu et d'Israël dans le sens des relations erotiques d'un homme et d'une femme. Le passage le plus difficile du Cant. est étudié de ce point de vue herméneutique, pour voir s'il s'ouvre à notre investigation. The interpretation of Song of Songs escapes any consensus. Canticles has been written as a polemical piece in reaction against the religious and civil Establishment, and against the prevailing mores in the Second Temple period. The language is through and through a pastiche of sorts of the biblical traditions, thus bringing the prophetic metaphors on the loving relationships between God and Israel back to the human level of eros. The most difficult text of Cant, is explored from the point of view of the hermeneutical thesis, to see if it can be successfully exegeted.<br>

Abstract: Présentation et analyse de l'ouvrage Penser la Bible de Paul Ricœur et André LaCocque, qui s'efforce de montrer sous quelles conditions la rencontre entre l'exégèse historico-critique et l'herméneutique philosophique peut devenir féconde. Le point de rencontre se situe à l'intersection de l'histoire de la réception et d'une poétique de lecture. Cela trouve son illustration dans six stations de lecture consacrés à des passages clé de l'Ancien Testament : Gn 2-3, Ex 20,13, Ez 37, Ps 22, Ex 3,14, Ct. Pour chaque texte, l'analyse s'efforce de faire apparaître la complémentarité, mais aussi les tensions entre l'approche exégétique et l'approche philosophique. A review-article of Penser la Bible, by Paul Ricœur and André LaCocque. The book tries to show under which conditions historico-critical exegesis and philosophical hermeneutic can meet fruitfully. They meet at the intersection between the history of reception and a poetic of reading. This is illustrated by six readings devoted to key portions of the Old Testament: Gen 2-3; Ex 20,13; Ez 37; Ps 22; Ex 3,14; Ct. For each of those texts, the study endeavours to show the complementarity of, and also the tensions between exegetical and philosophical tradings of the Bible.<br>

Author(s): Viviano Benedict Thomas<br>
Abstract: This article reexamines Matt 2:1-23 in the light of the late twentieth century movement called theological aesthetics. After briefly sketching the movement with its emphasis on beauty rather than truth or goodness as the starting point for this approach to theology and the Bible, the article considers the often conflicted relationship between beauty and truth in western civilization and the Bible. It then attempts a close reading of Matthew 2, resulting in a new awareness of how carefully the evangelist has interwoven elements of beauty and ugliness, truth and mendacity into his narrative. Cet article examine Matthieu 2:1-23 à la lumière du mouvement contemporain qu'on appelle l'esthétique théologique. Après une brève esquisse de ce mouvement, l'article considère les rapports souvent conflictuels entre la beauté et la vérité, en particulier le masque que la beauté peut fournir à l'abus de pouvoir. Puis il propose une relecture de Matthieu 2 de façon à faire ressortir avec une clarté nouvelle le soin que met l'évangéliste à entrelacer les éléments du beau et du laid, du vrai et du mensonge, dans son récit de deux rois qui se battent pour être à la tête du peuple de Dieu.<br>

Abstract: Cet article trouve son point de départ dans l'analyse du caractère sévère de Jésus dans l'évangile. Des synoptiques, c'est Matthieu qui met le plus l'accent sur la tension entre les pharisiens et Jésus. Le point culminant est le discours dans le temple dont le noyau est constitué des sept « Ouai » (Mt 23,13-36). Pour expliquer cette sévérité, nous utilisons comme approche méthodique la « pragmatique » de la science de la communication et de la linguistique. L'objectif de la recherche est d'offrir une nouvelle perception de la réalité et d'interpeller sur l'agir moral. This article begins from the analysis of the harsh nature of Jesus in the Gospel. Among the Synoptics, it is Matthew who insists the most on the strain between the Pharisees and Jesus. Its culmination is Jesus' speech in the Temple, at whose centre are the seven "Woes" (Matt. 23 :13-36). To explain this harshness, we will make use of the methodical approach called "pragmatic", in communication science and linguistics. Our aim is to offer a new perception of reality and to challenge to moral action.<br>

Abstract: In this paper I set out a phenomenology of social transformation, based on an analysis of the distinctively religious form of communication which underlies the trans-generational and trans-cultural transmission of world traditions, taking Confucianism and Christianity as their representatives. A phenomenological analysis of their communicative structure allows the possibility of a better understanding of what can be learnt from them in the context of contemporary debates in both China and the West on the relations between religion, ethics and politics. This analysis suggests that the ethical consistency of belief and act, which is the necessary condition for the engendering of long-term solidarity in religious community, has significant implications for ethics in politics, and especially for the legitimacy of representational leadership as a focal point for change in society. The paper concludes that the historical experience of world religions can offer new insights into the nature of political leadership and representation in today's globalised world and that the appropriate locus for this inquiry is the present negotiation and re-negotiation of relations between China and the West.<br>

Author(s): Haers Jacques<br>
Abstract: The Jesuit Refugee Service contributes in a creative way to the mission of «faith doing justice». Its starting point is the experience of and with the refugees it is called to serve. This article, therefore, has a distinct narrative character. JRS' practice sheds light on some important aspects of justice, which can also be found in solid presentations of Catholic Social Teaching. This contribution highlights how faith, mission (accompaniment, service and advocacy) and institutional capacity are key features of a solid understanding of justice. Il Servizio dei gesuiti per i rifugiati (JRS) contribuisce in modo creativo alla missione della «fede che opera la giustizia». Il suo punto di partenza è l'esperienza dei e con i rifugiati che si è chiamati a serviré. Questo articolo, tuttavia, presenta una diversa peculiarità di discorso. L'esperienza del JRS illumina alcuni aspetti importanti della giustizia che possono anche essere ritrovati in importanti trattazioni della dottrina sociale della Chiesa. Questo contributo chiarisce come la fede, la missione (accogiienza, servizio e tutela) e la capacità di muoversi a livello istituzionale siano chiavi imprescindibili per una comprensione profonda della giustizia.<br>

Abstract: On traite ici de la mémoire comme lieu central où se noue, en perspective chrétienne, l'identité de l'homme, au cœur du temps et par-delà un «oubli» originaire. On montre comment la «polarité christologico-pneumatologique» propre à la doctrine chrétienne éclaire ce moment. On indique enfin comment la mémoire ainsi comprise s'inscrit dans des réalités anthropologiques générales, avant desquisser certaines incidences de l'orientation proposée en terrain proprement herméneutique. Memory is treated here as the central point where, from a Christian perspective, personal identity is formed at the heart of time and beyond an original "lapse of memory". It is shown how "christo-pneumatological polarity", proper to Christianity, sheds light on this moment, and how memory thus conceived lies in the scope of general anthropological reality. Finally, certain occurrences of the orientation proposed are traced in the specific field of hermeneutics.<br>

Abstract: La notion de tolérance est problématique: je m'efforce de le montrer en considérant tout d'abord les critiques dont elle est ou a été la cible. Puis, en partant de la conception de Locke, je relève les dilemmes qui peuvent surgir de la mise en pratique de la tolérance et la nécessité, mais aussi la difficulté, de fixer les limites de son application. Corollaire de la liberté de pensée et de l'acceptation du pluralisme, la tolérance est décrite, en dernier lieu, comme mise à l'épreuve purificatrice de nos convictions et comme instauratrice d'une véritable relation de réciprocité dans la mesure où elle parvient à dépasser le simple acquiescement à la diversité. The concept of tolerance is problematic : this I try to show first by considering the criticisms made of it. Then, starting with the perception of Locke, I point out the potential dilemmas of practising tolerance and the need, as well as the difficulty, of fixing limits to tolerance. A corollary to the freedom of thought and the approbation of pluralism, tolerance is finally described as the refining proof of conviction and the instigator of true reciprocity to the degree that it goes beyond the simple acquiescence of diversity.<br>

Abstract: La confrontation théologique à la critique du christianisme contenue dans l'œuvre du Marquis de Sade n'est pas encore habituelle. Ces pages offrent donc une entrée dans la réflexion qui peut naître d'une telle confrontation. L'article se divise en sept paragraphes qui reprennent les grandes lignes de mon travail théologique inspiré par la pensée de Sade. La question du mal semble être au centre de ce dialogue. C'est autour de notions telles que le péché, la responsabilité, la culpabilité ou le mal radical que s'articule l'argumentation. The theological confrontation with the criticism of Christianity contained in the work of Marquis de Sade is not yet common. These pages offer a point of entry into reflection which can originate from such a confrontation. The article is divided into seven paragraphs based on the main lines of my theological work inspired by the thought of Sade. The problem of evil seems to be at the centre of this dialogue. The argument develops around such notions as sin, responsability, guilt and radical evil.<br>

Abstract: L'éthique èvolutionniste est un courant qui cherche à introduire le point de vue de l'évolution dans la philosophie morale. Plus précisément, les tenants de cette approche s'inspirent de données issues de différentes sciences comme la biologie évolutive, la théorie des jeux, la neurobiologie, la psychologie évolutionniste, etc., pour aborder des questions traditionnellement traitées en philosophie morale. Évidemment, il y a bien des façons d'utiliser ce matériau et c'est ce queje me propose d'explorer dans cet article. Mon but est de saisir les limites et les possibilités d'une éthique evolutionniste. Je conclurai sur une note positive en faveur de ce courant philosophique. The objective of evolutionary ethics is to bring the point of view of evolution into moral philosophy. More precisely, to consider data coming from different sciences such as progressive biology, game theory, neurobiology, evolutionary psychology, etc., in the approach to questions traditionally treated by moral philosophy. Obviously, there are many ways of using such material and this is what I explore in the present article. We want to grasp the limits and the possibilities of evolutionary ethics. I will conclude on a positive note in favour of this philosophical current.<br>

Abstract: Dans cette étude je poursuis deux objectifs: d'une part, je tente d'établir d'un point de vue théorique les tenants et aboutissants de la question de savoir si le pardon entre deux communautés est possible; d'autre part, j'examine les obstacles et les dangers d'un tel pardon. En ce qui concerne le premier objectif, je fais appel à Hannah Arendt qui nous a donné dans La condition de l'homme modeme une définition du pardon que j'applique aux relations entre communautés. Afin d'examiner les problèmes d'un pardon inter-communautaire, je usage du roman de J. M. Coetzee, Disgrâce, qui offre à mon sens une illustration de ce qu'un tel pardon entraînerait. La situation que décrit Coetzee, et a laquelle je me réfère également, est celle de l'Afrique du Sud après l'apartheid. In this study, I have two aims: one, from a theoretical viewpoint, I try to establish the ins and outs of the question whether pardon between two communities is possible; secondly, I examine the obstacles and dangers of such a pardon. For the first, I refer to Hannah Arendt, who gives us, in The Human Condition, a definition of pardon, which apply to the relations between communities. In order to examine the problems of intercommunal pardon, I use the novel by J. M. Coetzee, Disgrace, which offers, according to me, an illustration of what such a pardon entails. The situation described by Coetzee, and to which I also refer, is that of South Africa after apartheid.<br>

Abstract: Dans son traitement de l'éthique, Ruwen Ogien combine de manière neuve ce qu'il est souvent convenu d'opposer: l'éthique normative, l'éthique appliquée et la méta-éthique. Son point de départ, analytique, le pousse à se méfier des expressions pompeuses. En même temps, l'attention méthodologique qu'il porte aux différentes formulations possibles des principes substantiels de l'éthique minimale le conduit à réinterroger les liens entre le Bien et le Juste et donc aussi les rapports entre l'éthique et la politique. In his approach to ethics, Ogien does something new in combining what we usually oppose: normative ethics, applied ethics and meta-ethics. His analytical starting-point leads him to distrust pretentious expressions. At the same time, his methodological attention to various possible formulations of the substantial principles of minimalist ethics leads him to question anew the links between Good and Right and therefore also the relationship between ethics and politics.<br>

Abstract: Tout au long de son œuvre, Henri Bergson s'est penché sur le temps du vécu qu'il nomme «durée», une notion qu'il a, des années durant, cherché à cerner. Du point de vue de l'énonciation de sa pensée surgit une difficulté: comment mettre des mots sur une notion qui a pour caractéristique d'échapper aux schèmes de penser habituels, de se soustraire aux filets du logos ? Si, comme il le souligne, «[l] a pensée demeure incommensurable avec le langage», il se doit d'ouvrir une nouvelle voie pour formuler malgré tout sa pensée en faisant appel à des ressources langagières proprement inhabituelles, voire étrangères à la philosophie. Pour dire le temps, le philosophe se doit de briser les cadres de la pensée conceptuelle. Ainsi, l'emploi de la métaphore, habituellement ressource du langage poétique, devient sous la plume du philosophe français un outil privilégié du philosopher, transcendant les concepts pour atteindre qu'il nomme l'intuition de la durée immanente à chacun de nous. In all his writings, Henri Bergson sought to define worked the notion of time lived, which he called duration. In the enunciation of his thought, emerges a difficulty: how to put words to a notion which characteristically escapes habitual schemas of thought and logical traps? If, as he claims, «thought remains immeasurable by language», we need, nevertheless, a new way to formulate his thought by calling upon unusual or even un-philosophical linguistic resources. In order to speak of time, the philosopher must expand the framework of conceptual thought. Thus, the use of metaphor, normally a poetical resource, becomes in the writing of the French philosopher an excellent tool for philosophy, going beyond the concepts in order to reach what he calls the immanent intuition of duration which each one of us has.<br>

Abstract: Trois intentions convergentes traversent cette étude: du point de vue de l'histoire de la philosophie, le monde social est dans un premier temps l'occasion de mesurer un écart entre Heidegger et Gadamer; puis, dans un second temps, il sert de fil conducteur pour explorer les ressources éthiques et sociales de la philosophie herméneutique. Enfin, d'un point de vue phénoménologique, nous montrons à l'aide de ces ressources comment l'anonymat et l'indétermination du monde social constituent des conditions nécessaires de la vie subjective et personnelle. In this study three objectives converge: from the point of view of the history of philosophy, the social world first allows us to measure the distance between Heidegger and Gadamer; secondly, it serves as a guide for exploring the ethical and social resources of hermeneutical philosophy. And in conclusion, from a phenomenological viewpoint, we show how, with the help of these resources, the anonymity and the indeterminateness of the social world form the necessary conditions for subjective and personal life.<br>

Abstract: Le Venezuela de la fin de la période coloniale se distingue sur bien des points des autres régions d'Amérique espagnole: une prospérité économique flatteuse fondée sur le commerce du cacao et que confirment les réformes bourboniennes de la fin du siècle; une configuration sociale contrastée mais extrêmement fluide et une aristocratie créole, les mantuanos, dont le discours et les généalogies sociales sont repris à leur compte par les autres groupes sociaux émergents, notamment par le monde des pardos (métis); mais également l'une des révolutions d'Indépendance les plus violentes du continent. Les sensibilités métisses vont de pair avec une mémoire partagée, au quotidien ou lors d'événements bien particuliers tels que visitas ou procès. D'autant qu'un autre élément contribue à faire de cette société métisse une société en mouvement: les femmes, quel que soit leur statut social ou ethnique. Transgressions des normes sociales et morales par les aristocrates mantuanas, revendications des pardas se voulant nobles et défendant leur « honneur »: se situant dans la perspective de l'histoire des sensibilités, cette étude tentera de faire le point sur ce métissage des représentations, ainsi que sur la subversion du modèle culturel hispanique qui en découle dans les pratiques effectives. At the end of the colonial period, Venezuela is quite different from any other regions of Spanish America: first an economic prosperity which benefits from the cacao trade and strengthened by the Bourbon reforms at the very end of the century; a very contrasted but fluid social configuration; a creole aristocracy, the mantuanos, whose words and social genealogies are retrieved by other emergent social groups, such as the pardos (mestizos, half-caste); one of the most violent revolutions of Independence in the mainland. Hybrid sensibilities emerged along with a shared memory at the everyday level or at specific events such as visitas or trials. In this half-caste society, women, whatever their ~<br>

Abstract: À partir de l'exemple de deux autobiographies, celles de Jacques-Louis Ménétra et d'Agricol Perdiguier, tous deux compagnons du Tour de France, il s'agit d'établir des constantes de l'écriture de soi. La perspective adoptée, le discours sur la sexualité, sert de point d'ancrage. Après avoir déterminé les sphères d'énonciation de la sexualité des deux compagnons, le ludique chez Ménétra, l'altérité chez Perdiguier, on en vient à établir, au-delà des spécificités de chacun, une permanence des formes et, partant, des règles de transformation internes au récit autobiographique. From the example of two autobiographies, those of Jacques-Louis Ménétra and Agricol Perdiguier, both compagnons du Tour de France, it acts of establishing constants of the writing of oneself. The prospect adopted, the speech on sexuality, is used as theme of approach. After having determined the fields of stating of the sexuality of the two compagnons, the ludic one for Ménétra, the alterity for Perdiguier, we can establish, beyond specificities of each one, a permanence of the forms and, therefore, internal rules of transformation to the autobiographical account.<br>

Abstract: A quelles conditions la théologie peut-elle se fonder comme théologie interprétative selon le vœu de Claude Geffré (La théologie au risque de l'interprétation) et d'Eberhard, Jüngel (Dieu mystère du monde) ? Réponse: elle doit demander concepts et méthode à une philosophie de l'interprétation. Pour surmonter la « crise de la métaphysique » (Nietzsche, Heidegger) ; ensuite pour fixer les principes de l'interprétation, garantissant l'historicité, la transcendance personnalisée et l'Amour de Dieu. Si une herméneutique (de Dilthey à Gadamer et à Ricœur) n'y suffit point, l'A. renvoie à sa proposition philosophique de « l'Inlégralisme » (cf. J. Granier, Le discours du monde), avec sa théorie de l'Intégral et du transréel, son analytique de la praxis sociale et son anthropologie « égotiste ». Under what kind of conditions can a theology be founded as an interpretative one, as suggested by Claude Geffré (La Théologie au risque de l'interprétation) and Eberhard Jüngel (Dieu mystère du monde) ? Answer: it is obliged to demand concepts and method from a philosophy of the interpretation. In order to overcome the "crisis of metaphysics" (Nietzsche, Heidegger) ; in order to determine the principles of the interpretation, which are able to guarantee the historicity, the personalized transcendency and the Love of God. If a hermeneutics (from Dilthey to Gadamer and Ricœur) is not enough, the author refers to his philosophical proposition of "integralism" (cf. J. Granier, Le discours du mondes), with its theory of the Integral and of Transreal, its analytics of the social praxis and its "egotistic" anthropology.<br>

Author(s): Colette Jacques<br>
Abstract: Confrontation de diverses lectures d'un récit, d'une scène, d'une tradition religieuse. À partir de la figure évangélique de la pécheresse (Luc 7), les analyses philosophiques du pardon s'inscrivent chez le jeune Hegel dans une réflexion sur l'opposition de la loi (le châtiment) et de la réconciliation (l'amour). Dans son Esthétique, les traités de l'art romantique et de la peinture voient en la Madeleine la figuration d'une beauté où intériorité et extériorité s'accordent harmonieusement. Dans divers écrits sur la religion, le même personnage, qui évoque les traits de la belle âme, n'est pas étranger aux méditations sur destin de Jésus, le pardon des offenses et l'idée de la grâce. Ces diverses représentations induisent une pensée en rupture avec d'autres approches philosophiques de la grâce et du pardon (Spinoza, Kant). Une deuxième partie évoque la pécheresse, souvent confondue avec d'autres femmes des Évangiles, telle qu'on la retrouve chez des écrivains de la spiritualité française (Bérulle 1627, Charles de Saint Paul 1628, Lacordaire 1859) et chez les peintres de l'époque baroque. L'article se termine par une étude des nombreuses évocations de la pécheresse chez Kierkegaard. À la différence de la spéculation philosophique ou des « élévations » mystiques, c'est dans une méditation toujours au plus près de la lettre même du Nouveau Testament que sont alors développés de manière existentielle les thèmes du repentir et du pardon. A look at diverse readings of a story, a scene, a religious tradition. Taking the gospel figure of the adulterous woman (Luke 7) as a starting point, the youthful Hegel sets his philosophical analysis of forgiveness in a meditation on Law (Punishment) versus Reconciliation (Love). In his Aesthetics, the treatises on the romantic art movement and on paintings see in Mary Magdalen the figuration of a beauty in which interiority and exteriority are harmonised. In various writings on religion, the same character, now the figuration of the bea~<br>

Abstract: With positivist and technocratic notions still prevalent, Paul Healy's (1986) insightful effort to advance "interpretive policy inquiry" both underscores the limitations of conventional analysis and helps us to grasp the policy process in human terms. Yet the article falls short of a systematic presentation of the interpretive position and, in doing so, reveals the limitations of that approach: the need for an explicitly critical posture becomes clear. This point is made with particular attention to a pre-positivist figure, Machiavelli.<br>

Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219705<br>
Date: 1 1, 1966<br>
Author(s): Lord Walter J.<br>
Abstract: Whereas the spoken word is part of present actuality, the written word normally is not. The writer, in isolation, constructs a role for his "audience" to play, and readers fictionalize themselves to correspond to the author's projection. The way readers fictionalize themselves shifts throughout literary history: Chaucer, Lyly, Nashe, Hemingway, and others furnish cases in point. All writing, from scientific monograph to history, epistolary correspondence, and diary writing, fictionalizes its readers. In oral performance, too, some fictionalizing of audience occurs, but in the live interaction between narrator and audience there is an existential relationship as well: the oral narrator modifies his story in accord with the real-not imagined-fatigue, enthusiasm, or other reactions of his listeners. Fictionalizing of audiences correlates with the use of masks or personae marking human communication generally, even with oneself. Lovers try to strip off all masks, and oral communication in a context of love can reduce masks to a minimum. In written communication and, a fortiori, print the masks are less removable.<br>

Author(s): Wing Nicolae<br>
Abstract: The conflict between formalist thinking and theories that view texts in their historical contexts serves as a starting point for the introduction of a cognitive view of literature. From this perspective language has full referential powers. The "referent" splits into two entities, however: things-in-themselves (in their material identity), which we cannot know, and things in their coded form, which are perceptually accessible. Readers' mnemonic potentials, a consequence of the bonding of perception and language, are adduced to show that texts originate in past interpretations of other texts and in personal experience and that consequently social forces and historical events are subsumed in the individual memory. In the cognitive light, memory becomes the ultimate metaphor, and the epistemological claim of realism regains its compelling force.<br>

Date: 12 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): Traverso Regina M.<br>
Abstract: This article investigates the exchanges of letters of 1987 between the historians Martin Broszat and Saul Friedlander through the interpretive framework of "dialogue." It is suggested that dialogue does not have a dyadic structure, but involves ever shifting Thirds that function as mediators in dialogue, i.e., God, conscience, reason, or tradition. On one hand, Thirds provide a seemingly stable, external reference point; on the other hand, they open up space for the play of power and desire. Four categories of Thirds are identified and their place and role in the dialogue between Broszat and Friedlander analyzed. The psychoanalytically inspired notions of "acting-out" and "working-through" are employed in order to interpret the varying degrees of critical control Broszat and Friedlander were able to apply to these interfering Thirds. Finally, I give an overall interpretation of Broszat's and Friedlander's positions in the dialogue, guided by the concepts of acting-out and working-through.<br>

Issue: i226513<br>

Author(s): White Cheryl<br>
Abstract: Based on ethnographic work among North American occupational therapists, I compare two forms of everyday clinical talk. One, "chart talk," conforms to normative conceptions of clinical rationality. The second, storytelling, permeates clinical discussions but has no formal status as a vehicle for clinical reasoning. I argue that both modes of discourse provide avenues for reasoning about clinical problems. However, these discourses construct very different clinical objects and different phenomena to reason about. Further, the clinical problems created through storytelling point toward a more radically distinct conception of rationality than the one underlying biomedicine as it is formally conceived. Clinical storytelling is more usefully understood as a mode of Aristotle's "practical rationality" than the technical rationality of modern (enlightenment) conceptions of reasoning.<br>

Author(s): Wolpe Donald L.<br>
Abstract: Recent changes within social and cultural anthropology have made history a key issue, but in this essay I argue that the field has yet to develop the resources that are required to deal with temporality. This point is made through an extended examination of Jean and John Comaroff's work on Christianity and colonialism in southern Africa. Arguably, the Comaroffs read history backward and then present its unfolding as a kind of inexorable logic. In doing so, they homogenize missionary and Tswana "cultures" and attribute agency to abstractions rather than to people acting in particular material contexts. In contrast, I argue for a narrative approach to historical anthropological explanation. The emergent qualities of events - and the variable ways in which capitalism, hegemony, Protestantism, and vernacular modernisms relate - require narrative for explanation, narrative that encompasses within itself the narratives of social actors themselves.<br>

Abstract: This article investigates the effects of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 in structuring an encounter over a decision about building a dam in central Arizona. From the vantage point of three groups with deep investments in the outcome of this decision, it analyzes how the interests and identities of these parties were transformed as a result of this encounter. In defining standing and the terms of relevance, in providing a political forum, and in requiring these groups to explain themselves to others, this law powerfully mediated the politics surrounding this controversial decision.<br>

Abstract: Introduite en France depuis une dizaine d’années, l’œuvre de Moishe Postone se présente comme une réinterprétation globale de l’œuvre de Marx. Elle est articulée autour de la thèse selon laquelle Marx ne propose pas une critique du capitalisme du point de vue du travail, mais une critique du travail sous le capitalisme. Cet article évalue la portée de ce marxisme hétérodoxe en cherchant à en situer l’arrière-plan épistémologique entre interprétation structuraliste et interprétation phénoménologique de Marx. Il montre que Postone construit un structuralisme original, combinant Althusser et Hegel, mais peine à lui articuler une théorie de la subjectivation et de l’action à la hauteur d’une pensée qui a en vue la transformation sociale et l’émancipation du capitalisme.<br>

Abstract: Taking as its starting point classical themes developed since the Greeks, the present study aims to suggest that today a threshold may be crossed by means of philosophical reflection on music. Without disregarding the meaning of the concepts of imitation and expression (expressivo), the phenomenology of the inner consciousness of time may offer new possibilities, in parallel with structural analysis. Literary criticism and methodological consideration of the task of the historian have already exploited these possibilities. Why should music not do the same? Without claiming that phenomenological analyses can found a new musical aesthetic, they may be considered worthy of the attention of musicologists.<br>

Abstract: Résumé. Ce texte démontre le genre de questions qui se présentent aux études sur la condition des personnes handicapées informées par la sociologieen interrogent les interactions qui émergent autour des luttes pour «l'accès» dans un milieu de travail scolaire/ académique. Au cours de mes expériences dans un des plus grands édifices dans une des plus grandes universités au Canada, j'ai amassé des paroles quotidiennes qui justifient l'exclusion des personnes handicapées. J'ai rassemblé des narratifs représentants ce-qui-est possible-de-dire aujourd'hui sur la lutte pour l'accessibilité. En utilisant une approche sociologique interprétativiste, ce texte illustre la façon dont les significations de l'incapacité sont générés par un discours qui rends légitime la construction exclusive ainsi que les structures inaccessible de la vie universitaire. Dans ce texte, je démontre que l'accès n'est pas synonyme de justice mais, par contre, est un point de départ pour la réflexion critique où les relations sociaux entre corps et espace peut être considéré à nouveau. Ce texte contribue aux études sur la condition des personnes handicapées informées par la sociologie en analysant la façon dont la narration ordinaire et quotidienne de l'incapacité peut continuer à, en même temps que l'environnement physique change, agir comme pouvoir social qui reproduit le statuquo.<br>

Abstract: Résumé. L'un des principaux problèmes dans la controverse entourant le recensement détaillé concernait la relation entre la science et la politique. En analysant les arguments et les hypothèses sous-jacentes de quatre interventions influentes et exemplaires faites au nom de la science, cet article rend un constat normatif de cette relation. Il nuance les idéaux protecteurs de la science que les critiques ont invoqués et avance que de telles ressources conceptuelles sont nécessaires pour protéger la science d'un empiètement politique indu. Cependant, dans leur zèle à défendre les droits de la science, les critiques en ont réclamé plus que nécessaire, ce qui a occulté la dimension de la valeur des décisions politiques et n'a pas respecté le rôle de la politique en tant que point légitime de prise de décision sur les questions de valeur. Un constat normatif adéquat de la relation entre la science et la politique dans la politique gouvernementale doit non seulement protéger la science contre la politique, mais aussi la politique contre la science.<br>

Abstract: Is the most important function of education to provide students with basic skills and useful knowledge in order to eventually become employable? In many parts of the world knowledge league tables and policy documents inform us this is the case. As the question of what should form the educational content seems to be answered, teachers can concentrate on how they should teach, and researchers can concentrate on what method is the most effective. In the current rhetoric, however, many vital pedagogical issues have been placed in the background and the aesthetic subjects are downgraded. These tendencies worried Frede V. Nielsen who stated that didactic studies and philosophical inquiries yet again are needed to explore and give substance to the content dimension. Nielsen's writings on didactics form the basis for this essay, where we highlight which perspectives and dilemmas could be placed on a critical, philosophical didactic study agenda. The starting point is the field of tension between the what and the why of education.<br>

Abstract: The above epigraph is the first line of Bernstein's “Manifest Aversions, Conceptual Conundrums, and Implausibly Deniable Links,” which continues in a florilegium of funny aphorisms.I love originality so much I keep copying it.
               —Charles Bernstein
            
               The poem puns on T. S. Eliot plus the language of economics: “142
            Immature poets borrow. Mature poets invest”; “poetry wants to be free. (Or, if not, available for long-term loan)”; “I'm the derivative product of an originality that spawns me as it spurns me.” The history of poetry is a long history of poems composed by announcing poetic debts, such as Dante does in his address to Virgil in the opening canto of theInferno: “First of all authors and master of me, / I borrowed from you and to you I owe a debt / For the music that's brought me success.” But Bernstein's “investing,” as an alternative for stealing and borrowing, offers a further valence for cannibalistic recombination. When a poetinvestsin another poet's work, he or she brings it forward into the future, sometimes literally, as Hayes's poem for Gwendolyn Brooks reproduces the full text of her poem “We Real Cool”; or as Philip does when repurposing citations from Ovid; or as Mohammad'sSonnagramsre-sequence the most fundamental linguistic elements of Shakespeare's sonnets. In fact, the latter's ultra-soundings may point to a gendered version of poetic generation, in the same way that Dante casts Virgil as a heroic woman, who swoops in and whisks the younger poet away from a perilous situation in Canto XXIII so that the elder poet protects the next.<br>

Abstract: Apter's book ranges widely across the landscape of contemporary literary studies, philosophy, art, and politics. As she says, rather than offering a comprehensive or programmatic narrative, the volume provides “an array of loosely affiliated topoi—oneworldedness, literary world-systems, terrestrial humanism, checkpoints, theologies of translation, the translational interdiction, pedagogy, authorial deownership, possessive collectivism” (16). If the book eschews any progressively developed argument, it does have a distinct point of origin, in Apter's work as coeditor of a paradoxical project: an English translation—or untranslation—of the
      Vocabulaire européen des philosophies: Dictionnaire des intraduisibles(2006), edited by the Parisian philosopher Barbara Cassin. Focused on the vexed translation history of philosophical terms, theVocabulaire's essays proved to need extensive reworking to become legible for an American audience. Six of Apter's eighteen chapters take up and build on aspects of Cassin's project. Like Cassin, Apter takes a post-Heideggerian approach to language, building on Derrida to argue against Heidegger's linguistic ontology in order to counter a too easy evocation of a world of open communication and the free play of the imagination, speciously unified via a Euro-universalism projected onto the globe at large.<br>

Abstract: In the use of sounds, we also see a change between part one and two in order to assist the reader's longing back to his earlier textual memory. In the transitional fifth chapter, the summer rain subtly changes from soft and wonderful to a windy and loud thunder as the story progresses toward the ultimate fate of Gatsby's nostalgic dream. It is the zenith, the narrative breaking point, when the reader suddenly emotionally becomes aware of the impossibility of Gatsby's project. The “faint flow of thunder along the Sound” suggests this feeling of irrecoverable moments, a loss that even Gatsby seems to realize when “Daisy tumbled short of his dreams—not through her own fault but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion” (95). Later, after Myrtle's death, the merry sounds of the summer birds have completely changed into singing “ghostly birds” (152). As Kundu has observed, “[t]he hiatus between beauty and the romance of nature and humanity's tragic fate” is established through the diverse use of sounds and descriptions of nature (101).<br>

Abstract: Are we in the position to provide him with answers to his bewildering questions? Do we know where his wife and children are? These questions are designed to put us on the spot and to embarrass us. In our helplessness, we might be tempted to point fingers. We know that the major culprits in the war are the warlords who may have conscripted his boys and killed his wife. But knowing the names of the warlords is not enough. That is not even what the speaker or the poet demands of us. The search, the questions addressed to an unnamed passerby, one whom the speaker calls friend, is an open invitation to the reader to take the place of this distraught questioner. It is an ethical call to empathize in the manner that Primo Levi urged in the epigraphic poem above. By switching perspectives, which is exactly what empathy achieves, by putting ourselves in the position of the sufferer, or, in this case, the grieving person, we begin to understand the devastation so completely as to be compelled to prevent its recurrence. This, to me, is at the core of Jabbeh Wesley's poetics of testimony. She foresees that anyone capable of fully experiencing another's pain will not likely stand by and allow that pain to be inflicted on others. It is true that the human tendency toward aggression offers no assurance that such shifts of perspective will prevent anyone from inflicting more pain on others. Yet the writer hopes that much can be achieved by keeping the consciousness of the human condition alive.<br>

Abstract: There was always the temptation to give up the tension created by the difference between the two modes of being in the world. From the side of African and other diaspora communities, there is always the utopian temptation to create a world of meaning only from resources that they define as original or “indigenous.” Such a position would represent a kind of mimicry of the Europeans who think that their cultures have never learned from or been dependent on others. It is furthermore almost impossible to designate any “pure” beginnings in any part of the world. It is at this point that I return to V. Y. Mudimbe's notion of gnosis. He makes it clear that by gnosis he is not referring to an episteme or a science. For me this indicates a lived or performed appearance—in other words, a mode of life where practice is to the fore but the theoretical implications of this practice act as critical principles. These principles allow room for the meaning of the practice to engage in all the implications of creating a world of meaning. This would be close to what goes on in religious communities.<br>

Abstract: In the event, SPEP did seem to be made up of oddballs and outsiders in those early years. In 1964 it was a bit larger than the twenty or thirty souls that Ed Casey describes in his paper, but not by much. The leadership was a diverse bunch: Aron Gurwitsch, gruff and insistent on rigor and clarity, the embodiment of the old-school European professor. His presence made me aware, for the first time, I think, of the existence of the New School for Social Research, that amazing institution where I would later teach and am teaching now. John Wild, with the fervor of the recent convert himself, was eager to convert others. According to one tale, possibly apocryphal, an undergraduate student reported that he kept talking about a place called “Lebensville” and saying we ought to go back there. Herbert Spiegelberg, sweetest of men, had earned the respect and gratitude of all for publishing his two-volume
      The Phenomenological Movement, which had appeared in 1960. George Schrader, slowly abandoning Kant for Heidegger. Bill Earle, a very smooth talker—that's all I remember. Erwin Straus, who in his old age exemplified, every time he stood up to speak, the epic struggle of our species to attain the upright posture. Dreyfus, Todes, Lingus, Schrag, and Edie were the Young Turks in that group. We graduate students, still looking on curiously from the sidelines at that point, slowly got a sense of the great learning and intellectual integrity of our elders and also eventually picked up the excitement of being an embattled minority struggling for survival and recognition.<br>

Article Title: American Continental Philosophy in the Making:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Here is part of what I meant when I said that the early meetings were theoretically disorganized. There was no mainstream of American Continental philosophy, no orthodoxy, and on our side at least, no bright red line between what was philosophy and what was not. The pervasive mood was youthful and inclusive—and so, exactly the sort of atmosphere where novices could find their own voices. From this unsynthesizable disarray of speakers and attendees, I learned to assume that just about anything, even mathematical and logical things, can be treated phenomenologically—indeed perhaps especially when tradition tells us not to. Yet I also learned that no one can ever be entirely sure about the best way to address the things themselves, even when we have them in our sights. In one of the earliest meetings—I think it may have been the fourth—I remember attending an evening seminar on phenomenology and natural science, where the speakers were Theodore Kisiel, Patrick Heelan, and van Fraassen. Except for the fact that they are all white males, I retain an image of their discussion as modeling what the study of science as a human practice will eventually be, when traditionally trained epistemologists have stopped writing most of the textbooks and nobody reads the Leiter report. As Heidegger quips, we should always strive to treat phenomena phenomenologically. It seemed that for the most part, we understood this point without assuming we had already found the best way to do it. In this situation, hearing many disparate voices helped.

Abstract: While sharing a planet may be necessary for peace, as we know, it is not that simple. Although we occupy the finite surface of the earth, our experiences here can be worlds apart. As Derrida (
      2011, especially 8–12) suggests in the last seminar before his death, we do not, and cannot, ever know if we inhabit or cohabit the same world as any other creature on earth. This includes not just strangers, enemies, and those we find most abhorrent but also our fellows, kin, and most beloved, whose singularity is just as other to us as any other. And then there are those other others, the ones Levinas and Derrida lose sleep over, those others whom/that we do not recognize, those so radically other that we cannot even call them foreigners, enemies, aliens, or monsters—those that may inhabit the same planet but live in worlds radically different from our own, to the point of calling into question this “our own” and what it means to “have a world.”<br>

Here, again, is a sense of “I” in which I can be aware of myself and refer to myself without it being necessary to employ any nonindexical or third-personal referents.<br>

Abstract: No doubt the rise of religion has not only posed a particular dilemma for critical theory but also provided a curious place to end this reflection. Having started my career doing philosophy of religion it is somewhat surprising to meet religion again as I turn to what surely must be at least a later phase of my career. I am reminded of Antonio's line from the Italian film
            C'eravamo Tanto Amati, translated asWe All Loved Each Other So Much: “We thought we could change the world, but the world changed us.” “Philosophers only interpret the world, the point is to change it,” so said Marx. But in a curious way those who would change the world are changed by it.<br>

Abstract: In the SPEP volume published in 1983 and made up of selected papers from the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth meetings, the editors, William McBride and Calvin Schrag, commented on the “radicality, openness, passion for dialogue, freedom, and interest in pluralism” that the included papers made apparent. The year 1984 marked a significant turning point especially for the organization. The Committee on the Status of Women formed with the purpose of increasing the participation of women in SPEP. In 1981 six women participated in the program, three of them as moderators. In 1982 four women participated, one as moderator, and Joan Stambaugh gave an invited paper at the Nietzsche Society. In 1983 nine women participated, and two others gave papers at the Society for Phenomenology and the Human Sciences. In 1984, five women participated, with one moderator among them, and there were three women giving papers at the Society for Phenomenology and the Human Sciences. Then, after the founding of the Committee on the Status of Women in 1984, the program in 1985 had sixteen women on the program inclusive of two moderators, a keynote address by Julia Kristeva, and a book session on Ofelia Shutte's book

The voting members at the twenty-fifth SPEP conference in 1986 selected Professor Dallery as the first woman co-director of SPEP, and twenty-four women were on the program, with four moderators. A panel discussed Linda Nicholson's bookGender and History, and Joan Stambaugh gave the paper “The Future of Continental Philosophy” in a plenary session symposium. Also in that year, at a tumultuous business session, the membership agreed that the Executive Committee would provide annually statistics on the number of papers by women that were submitted and that were accepted.

Abstract: We now reach the point at which I address the question in my title: “Can Continental philosophy deal with the New Technologies?” I characterized this earlier as somewhat ironic—because SPEP has never had questions of science and technology as forefront issues. One of my hobbies, as a veteran SPEPer myself, has been an annual “bean count” of the figures and topics in the program index. Very few entries could ever be found, with most not bearing the Heidegger–Marcuse tilt, and my own SPEP entries. This count shows up ratios of interest and changes of trends. So, with exceptions noted, Heidegger and Marcuse remained the primary “canonical” figures interpreting technology for SPEP. And it is to these figures that I address my critique of what I will call the “old philosophy of technology.”<br>

Article Title: Ethics and Religion in Continental Philosophy<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: That correlationism is a red herring is made plain by turning to the most sensible voice in the new debate, Bruno Latour, who was a student of Michel Serres's and whose work in “science studies”—conducted under the motto of the title of his first major book,
            We Have Never Been Modern—has been to show that science does not drop out of the sky. One would be hard put to differentiate what Latour calls his “non-modernism” from what Continental philosophers (loosely called “postmodern”) are saying. Indeed Latour's work had led to the charge that even he does not “believe in reality,” an objection that only momentarily left him speechless but quickly led to a wonderful book entitledPandora's Hope.
                  There he argues that, far from being opposed to each other, our power of “construction”—read “constitution”—goes hand in hand with “reality.” The more construction—the more sophisticated the scientific community, the more complicated the experiment, the more technical the laboratory instruments, the more funding for research—the more reality science will attain. Unhappily, Latour dismisses phenomenology as a “philosophy of consciousness,” as if the entire history of phenomenology after Husserl never happened. Don Ihde, one of the SPEP's most distinguished thinkers, has called Latour to task on just this point.32
               
                  Latour's point applies no less to religion.33
               
                  Religious beliefs and practices are certainly constructed—in concrete cultures, languages, traditions, and historical worldviews. The people whose practices these are understand (just like the people who actually practice science) both that they have composed these prayers, constructed these places of worship, made these statues, and so on34
               andthat in them they access something real that they have not made.<br>

Article Title: Is a Hermeneutic Phenomenology Wide Enough? A Ricoeurian Reply to Janicaud's<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.28.3.issue-3<br>
Date: 7 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Davidson Scott<br>
Abstract: There are two results of this discussion to which I want to draw specific attention. First, this article suggests that commentators on Janicaud's minimal phenomenology, though few, have largely misunderstood the significance of this development. They have taken it to diminish the prestige of phenomenology, to the point of turning it into a trivial enterprise that describes banal phenomena.
         
               This can be traced back to the fact that they set up the issue in terms of a contrast between an ambitious maximal phenomenology that tests the limits of the visible and a minimal phenomenology that roots itself firmly within its boundaries. But Janicaud himself already dispels that contrast: his call for a minimal phenomenology does not advocate for a less ambitious or more restrained vision of phenomenology, as if its motto were to “keep costs down, do as little as possible, take no risks.”27
            
               The alternative is not, as commentators have suggested, between either a phenomenology of the invisible or a phenomenology of the visible; instead it concerns two different possible approaches to a phenomenology of the invisible: one that pushes the limits of the visible through a maximal threshold of excess (Marion, Levinas, Henry) and another that pursues those limits through a minimal threshold of sense (Merleau-Ponty, Deleuze). That is the choice that Janicaud bequeaths to phenomenology today.28<br>

Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Derrida is specifically addressing the role of hyperbole within his thought, but his argument is also driven by the hyperbolic through a practice of excess. He exaggerates the lie of exceeding the totality in order to “announce” the opening of the possibility, which paradoxically precipitates the structure of deferral it attempts to escape but is always entrenched within. Demonic, duplicitous hyperbole will always reach beyond its own economy of signification, but it will never succeed in exceeding because the heights of hyperbole always descend back into reeconomization, a point Derrida also makes in his discussion of hyperbole and negative theology. This highlights two characteristics of “demonic hyperbole” for Derrida that further reveal its errant structure: 1) its infinite deferral within a system it attempts to exceed and 2) its necessary force of repetition.<br>

Abstract: According to Ricoeur, this activity of appropriation occurs in a phenomenological, prepublic realm. To link this realm with the public world, I turn briefly to the vocabulary of constitutive rhetoric. In “Constitutive Rhetoric: The Case of the
         Peuple Québécois,” Maurice Charland explains how certain public texts, in addressing individuals as a group before that group actually exists in the extratextual world, can constitute a collective based on identity and oriented toward action. Charland uses the work of Kenneth Burke in order to shift the focus of rhetorical scholars away from “persuasion” and toward “identification” (1987, 133). Charland argues that public texts constitute subjects that didn't previously exist. In this sense, such texts do notpersuadealready existing individuals; they invite individuals to think of themselves in a manner thatentailscertain actions (1987, 134). This conceptualization extends Ricoeur's insights about appropriation and refiguration into the public world of action. Within this formulation, readers or listeners not only imagine themselves in new ways.
               They14
            actas the world of the text invites them to do and in so doing close the gap between mimesis3and mimesis1, between reading and acting. This is the space that needs to be crossed in order to give the straight line between mimesis1and mimesis3its arc and so enable it to form a spiral. A child reading Patterson's book, for instance, might simply dismiss it as a stuffy story about a famous person long dead. Or, the reader may actively engage the narrator's subtle closing exhortation to “make Dr. King's dream his own” (96). Because of “Dr. King's dream,” the reader may speak up when she hears someone employ racial slurs or stereotypes or intervene when a classmate is unjustly punished or bullied. The reader thus acts her way into Dr. King's proposed world and becomes the kind of agent whose actions may in turn inspire others. Her actions may be so ~<br>

Abstract: The two essays that follow situate their gaze on Shaw's cosmology. Jay Tunney's moving, evocative piece, “The Spiritual Shaw,” again affirms the profundity of Shaw's close relationship with his father, Gene. The extraordinary experience on the island of Brioni was a powerful moment in Shaw's ongoing reflection about the intersection of the physical and metaphysical, manifested (among other places) in his keenness for boxing. Witnessing Polly Tunney's painful and near-fatal appendicitis attack, Gene's faith, and the miraculous arrival of two medical saviors, Shaw was deeply affected by what Tunney describes as the “simplicity and enormity of the circumstance,” and thereafter “prayer broadened his definition of the human spirit.” With the reputed interconnection between health and hope as his starting point, Howard Ira Einsohn also explores Shaw's moral and religious philosophy in “Bernard Shaw and Paul Ricoeur: Emissaries of Hope, Faith, and Wellness.” Einsohn's commentary traces convergences in the thinking of both figures to articulate how Shaw's tragic-optimism acts as “his equilibrium, his wellness, in a world wildly out of kilter.”<br>

Abstract: Moreover, the astute logician in Shaw sees the newborn child as a commissioned envoy of divinity, whether that divinity is understood as the Judeo-Christian God, the Shavian Life Force, or the equivalent in some other belief system. Using the Christian sacrament of Baptism as a dispositive case in point, Shaw, always the cogent syllogist, argues that “if God is the Father of all men, and if the child is the father to man, it follows then that the true representative of God at the christening is the child itself.”
         
               Hence, from Shaw's considered viewpoint, if we seek the Kingdom of Heaven, we need not scour the galaxy frenetically. Instead, we should look no further than ourselves, for in each of us dwell effervescent particles of the same numen that breathes life into inert matter. In sum, for Shaw, every conception is immaculate,42
            
               and every child is a living incarnation of the primeval goodness that bathes the universe.43<br>

Abstract: In the essay I adopt Tamar Yacobi's “communication model” for settling discrepancies and inconsistencies in fictional texts and use it to demonstrate that the hypothesis of unreliable narration does not necessarily entail only one kind of interpretation. To support this point, I offer the distinction between
         self-deceptiveandother-deceptivenarrating characters, and I argue that some texts constantly cause the reader to hesitate between conflicting interpretations of the narrator as belonging to one of these two types. Such equivocation on the part of the reader is then extended to competing interpretations of the text, in accordance with each type of narrator. The chosen novel for this purpose is Vladimir Nabokov'sLolita.<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: So many twentieth-century rhetorical theories can be said to have utopian aims that just a list may be enough to persuade utopian studies scholars of the theoretical and interpretive potential available to them in this thriving discipline. Any rhetorical theorist who claims that rhetoric may be the answer to avoiding physical violence or war, or that it may be the cure for ills in society that result from ideological differences, has utopian ideas about rhetoric's function. The theories of Chaim Perelman, Richard Weaver, Stephen Toulmin, Mikhail Bakhtin, Wayne Booth, Stanley Fish, and others all seem to fit into this model to a greater or lesser degree. Twentieth-century theories of rhetoric often arose from historical circumstances involving war and what the theorists saw as the abuse of rhetoric, so understanding social processes and substituting a “good rhetoric” in order to build a better society is something they see as an antidote. Rhetoric, like utopia, is inherently an ethical concern from this point of view. The fact that several of these rhetoricians have been influenced by the Marxist utopists I just discussed is evidence of cross-pollination in the two contemporary fields—or perhaps more accurately, the lack of distinct differences between them at all. Like all areas that seem to be lumped under “cultural studies,” there is so much borrowing and generalizing that it is a struggle to speak of distinct disciplines. Nevertheless, there are creative and interpretive benefits to the mix, including a wealth of terminologies from which to choose.<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 10 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: If the Utopian breaks down upon its contact with material history, then perhaps by inscribing—and, more importantly, integrating—its antithesis and its own absurdity within itself (as indeed More's
         Utopialiterally—by the argument of its first part—does), it might achieve a balance and a self-awareness sufficient to sustain it beyond the moment of its conception, the revolutionary or revelatory moment, and to translate its abstraction into the very materiality, the physical placedness, that had originally threatened to extinguish it.Finnegans Wakemay be a dream—but it is a cyclic one: one from which the reader can never awake, yet within which its ownwaking-fromis already inscribed and therefore preempted. Yet does this Viconian cyclicity refute the possibility of Utopia? Utopian historicity is necessarily progressive and teleological, rather than endlessly cyclic. But it seems that these two positions might be reconciled if we view the cycle itself as dynamically Utopian, rather than any single point in that cycle—the divine, heroic, democratic, or chaotic—as a necessary end point, a stereotypically static Utopia.<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: If Utopia is as permanent as is desire, its survival does not depend on either Marx or communism. Nonetheless, Utopia may be just what Marx needs now, lending to Marxism a preoccupation with space and the city and dreams that it lacks—a significant enhancement that Harvey in
         Spaces of Hopeand, earlier, Lefebvre have articulated. More to the point, the much celebrated failure of communism and Marxism—to date—makes Utopia even more relevant now. While Vidler recognizes a correspondence between his own thinking and Jameson's, he believes that Utopia is all but impossible outside of already transformed conditions: an impossible situation that would inevitably negate any value for Utopia, confirming Vidler's proposition “that utopian thought killed the possibility of utopian thought,” because of its hubris, combined with its very impossibility. In this regard, according to Vidler: “Fredric Jameson has proposed that utopian thought whether in prose or design can offer alternatives in a time of lock-down and melt down…. [B]ut for this to happen, architects have to regain their sense of social responsibility, and their political sanity, vote for a world ruled by communitarian and socialist ethics and practices, and not for a world ruled by the myth that the next technological discovery will provide a solution.”
