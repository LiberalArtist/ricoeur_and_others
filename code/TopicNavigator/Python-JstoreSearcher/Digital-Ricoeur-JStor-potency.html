  Abstract: In “Tradition and the Individual Talent,” Eliot calls the auditory imagination a feeling for language that unites the most primitive and civilized minds.¹ Heaney’s
                  Northseeks a similar union by exposing both minds to the light of consciousness. As part of this process of exposure, Ulster’s pattern of violence forces him to confront the tragic origins of culture. However, raised as it is inNorthto a vision of malevolent transcendence, tragedy is finally unthinkable. Were it not for the innate rage for order of tragedy, the potency of disorder would consume all meaning—even tragic meaning. Tragedy therefore promises<br>

  Author(s) Manolopoulos Mark<br>
  Abstract: Aristotle, in distinguishing between actuality (ἐνέργεια) and possibility (δύναμις), undertook two crucial steps that have haunted the history of Western metaphysics ever since: he gave a qualitative priority to actuality over potency, and then he identified the former with pure essence. Possibility, for Aristotle, is a mode that denotes transition and corruption, and thus imperfection. However, the risk that he acknowledges and fears most is that potency is ambiguous and undecidable. In his words, “the possible could be both a being and a non-being … it could equally be both things and neither” (1050b10, 1051a1). It is this

  Abstract: As with many performing arts in Asia, neither the highly stylized images of the Javanese shadow play nor its musical complexity detracts from its wide popularity. By a context-sensitive analysis of shadow-play performances, Ward Keeler shows that they fascinate so many people in Java because they dramatize consistent Javanese concerns about potency, status, and speech.<br>

  Abstract: People’s relations with signs in Java, the degree to which they are master of or subject to them, at once indicate and determine their potency. This assumption about the relationship between self and Signs has important consequences for Javanese epistemology. Exegesis of wayang exemplifies these consequences, and I will take it as a starting point for a more general discussion of Javanese interpretation. My point is that, like speech, the signs that are an art form, a tract of ngèlmu, or a dream, all pose a challenge to a person’s autonomy, a challenge to which modes of interpretation are the<br>

  Abstract: The history of fantasy in the realm of children’s literature has been one of forceful contradictions: on the one hand, fantasy is criticized as being fraudulent, irrational, and overly imaginative; on the other, it is criticized for being formulaic, escapist, and not imaginative enough. The seeds of this debate lie in early uses of the word, which seem to have little to do with literature per se, but nevertheless powerfully influenced the activity of imagination over centuries. Fantasy’s potency in relation to children’s literature reflects its potency in relation to literature in general: it takes us into the heart of<br>

Author(s): Young III William W.<br>
Abstract: In
         Types of Christian Theology, as in much of his later work, Frei’s primary conversation partners are Frank Kermode and Paul Ricoeur. Ricoeur, as the foremost advocate of a hermeneutics of understanding, and Kermode, as a literary critic who refuses esoteric or figural interpretation, both render problematic the literal sense as Frei understands it. As Frei says on numerous occasions, the literal sense of scripture is best understood as taking the text to mean what it says, with the caveat that the text means what the community agrees that it says. As we shall see, in both its pluralism and its interpretive potency, this is a far more complex claim than is frequently assumed, and it can be best understood via contrast with Ricoeur’s approach.<br>

Journal Title: American Journal of Education<br>
Article Title: Fundamentally 9/11: The Fashioning of Collective Memory in a Christian School<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: aje.2006.112.issue-3<br>
Date: 05 2006<br>
Author(s): Schweber Simone<br>
Abstract: The situation is hardly particular to fundamentalist Christian religious private schools. As Keith Barton and Linda Levstik (
         2004) point out, history education in U.S. public schools typically knits events into a narrative framework, and “not … just any old narrative,” but into the “dominant narrative of U.S. history—the story of freedom and progress” (166–67). As Bruce VanSledright (1998) has argued, “much of what passes for history in the [public] schools is actually rooted in heritage’s attempt to turn selective memories into articles of truth” (244). Numerous studies evince the potency of this master narrative, of American exceptionalism (among them: Barton and Levstik2004; Epstein1998; Foner1998; Kammen1991; Loewen1995; Wertsch2002). My own previous work on Holocaust education bears this out as well (Schweber2004). Though knowledgeable about history in general and Holocaust history in particular, a public high school teacher I called Mr. Zee taught about the Holocaust as a story of triumph and progress rather than as one of tragedy or moral collapse.18It is clear, therefore, that whether teaching toward religious collective memory or national collective memory, history teachers in both religious and public schools fit historical events into overarching narratives, consciously or not. And while the contents of the overarching narratives may differ greatly, the processes of directing students’ thinking do not necessarily diverge.<br>

Abstract: We may now put the phenomenon of the promise together with the problems of sovereignty in order to address the difficulties about exceptionality and the political raised by Agamben. Promise goes beyond his construal of gift and potency by giving actuality not to itself but to another. It is not a gift that is only given within identity or one that retains the sovereign potential but is instead promised to another being.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 671448<br>
Date: 10 01, 2013<br>
Author(s): Feder Yitzhaq<br>
Abstract: As in the models analyzed by Nemeroff and Rozin, the distinct characteristics of each image, and particularly the distinct means of purification for each, supports the assumption that they were taken as separate models, despite the fact that they were incorporated into a common category:
         ṭumʾtah. Although the relationship between these images and their role in the semantic development ofṭumʾtahrequires further study, it is possible, at least, to suggest a provisional assessment. I am inclined to view both the uncleanness and infection images as primary (i.e., not derived from one another), and subsequently merged under a single term.
               This convergence can be explained on the basis of the observation that contamination sensitivity is “elicitor neutral,” as explained by Daniel Kelly: “Any elicitor of disgust, regardless of the actual nature of the elicitor or which ‘domain’ of disgust it falls in (physical, social, moral), has contamination potency of the same basic sort.”96
            
               That is to say, the notion of contagion was sufficiently generic to warrant the usage of a common term to describe both uncleanness and infection.97
            
               However, as noted above, the stain-of-transgression image should probably be viewed as a secondary development, modeled after aspects of uncleanness and infection.98

Date: 10 01, 2013<br>
Author(s): Csordas Thomas<br>
Abstract: While Csordas favors an analysis of evil in its “most immediate sense,” a caveat is needed here. Indeed, if he stresses “evil at the human and intersubective level of analysis rather than to cosmological or radical evil,” how then does this match with his earlier statement about focusing on the “immediate existential sense” of evil, which cross-cultural ethnographies show more related to the cosmological, and/or the numinous dimensions defining the limits of morality? Moreover, for many societies, social ties link not only humans among themselves but also with many kinds of beings and what Westerners call “natural phenomena” and different sorts of materialities. So, the trope “a human phenomenon rather than cosmological or radical evil” tends to restrict the scope of the whole endeavor against a wider view of what “human” and “intersubjectivity” mean (see, e.g., Jackson
         1998; Wright2005). Even though I find positive the use of the notion of evil in this discussion, in the long run the “problem of evil” may result too Christianocentric and Western, in spite of Csordas’s efforts to neutralize its cultural load. As a suggestion, maybe the notion of “power” or “potency,” derived from Rudolf Otto’s work (1925), could provide a better term to refer both to the numinous/ominous cosmological forces involved in human moral life, and what Western Junguian psychology (Jung2008) identifies as the “shadow” and its relations with personal Destiny. Here the dimensions of the outside (cosmic) and the inside (psyche) might express their “power” and “potency” embedded in concrete individual and collective events.<br>

Author(s): Øye Inger-Elin<br>
Abstract: Building on 25 months of fieldwork in eastern Germany from 1991 to 2003, this article explores the interpenetration of aesthetics and politics, and questions them as theoretical categories. A multilayered description depicts aesthetic perception and action, guided by an imagery of façade, as constituted and reproduced by state policies, positioned experiences, and subversive responses. Moving beyond the Cold War legacy, aesthetics' potency and politicization is dated back to early nation building and Protestant and Romantic influences. Being essential to and controlled by shifting, largely authoritarian regimes, aesthetics simultaneously provided a 'shadow life' and a 'lingua franca', cross-cutting verbal and non-verbal mediums and everyday and high culture, as people juggled with, distrusted, and decoded surfaces, expressing and in search of deeper, hidden truths. I argue that historically generated aesthetic perceptions and praxis not only mark east German political culture but also emerge in Habermas's public sphere theory and, moreover, offer arguments to revise it.<br>

Abstract: Si la personnalité philosophique de Michel Henry est saluée, son œuvre continue, quarante ans apres L'essence de la manifestation, à ne pas être reçue, ou à ne l'être que sur la base de malentendus. Pourquoi ? Les raisons alléguées peuvent sembler faibles (le ton absolu de Michel Henry, l'indifférence politique ou la sensibilité de droite qu'on lui prête, etc.), elles renvoient (la reconnaissance généralement faite de la « puissance » de sa pensée, ce qui est pressenti avec ce terme, plaident en ce sens) à une autre, plus décisive : la réception n'est pas la réception dans le monde mais la reception dans la vie, de la vie par elle-même – ce qui néanmoins serait la condition d'une politique pour notre temps. If Michel Henry's philosophical personality is indeed hailed, his work goes on, forty years after The Essence of Manifestation, not being received but on the basis of misunderstandings. Why ? The alleged reasons may seem rather weak (e.g. Michel Henry's absolute tone, his so-called political indifference, or his right-winged sensitiveness) ; they refer to another, more decisive, one (what is usually acknowledged as a potency of thought) : reception does not mean reception in this very world, but in life, which nonetheless would be the condition of a new politics of our time.<br>

Date: 9 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Aubry Gwenaëlle<br>
Abstract: Les études ici réunies visent à explorer la résurgence, dans la philosophie et la théologie contemporaines, du motif de l'impuissance de Dieu. La question n'est plus seulement celle, comme dans la pensée médiévale, de la limitation de la toute-puissance divine, mais bien de son complet abandon. Elle est étroitement liée à l'interrogation sur ce que peut être une théologie d'après la Shoah, et elle préside aussi, chez des penseurs comme Hans Jonas, Gianni Vattimo, ou Giorgio Agamben, au redéploiement des problèmes du mal et de la création, des concepts théologiques de kénose et d'incarnation, ou encore des catégories aristotéliciennes de la puissance. The contributions assembled here explore the resurgence in contemporary philosophy and theology of the notion of a powerless God. What is at stake here is no longer the medieval question of limitations of divine omnipotence, but its radical abandonment. This is closely linked to the question of a new post-Shoah theology. Among thinkers such as Hans Jonas, Gianni Vattimo, or Giorgio Agamben, it presides over a re-examination of the problems of evil and creation, of the theological concepts of kenosis and incarnation or even the Aristotelian categories of potency.<br>

Publisher: European Centre for Traditional and Regional Cultures (ECTARC)<br>
Issue: i40127040<br>
Date: 1 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Cohen Anthony P.<br>
Abstract: In Britain, as in France, 'mainstream' anthropologists were hesitant to acknowledge studies within their own country as proper subjects for anthropological enquiry. British social anthropology defined itself as the study of 'other cultures' and became entrenched in a tradition in which Otherness was confused with manifest difference. This naivete, elevated into a scientific principle, precluded the recognition of 'self as anything other than a scientific instrument; but also led to the invention of a generalisable Other, and thereby ignored the complexity of variation within the cultures it studied. By the same token, it blinded anthropologists to heterogeneity within their 'own' local cultures as well, and was finally changed only by a series of related paradigm leaps. Our understanding of culture changed from a set of prescriptive influences which integrated society, to a ragged and non-systemic array of interpretive tools which aggregated society. Consequent upon this change, symbols were acknowledged as vehicles of expression and of negotiable meaning rather than as having stipulated and invariant referents. The demise of modernist theories liberated anthropology from its scientific illusions and positivistic pretensions, enabling it to acknowledge the personal and speculative nature of the enterprise. This admission of the subjective, of the anthropologist's self, was necessary in order to see Otherness as inhering in 'person' rather than in an abstraction such as 'culture' and, therefore, to be enabled to recognise diversity within cultures rather than merely between them. This enhanced perception of internal heterogeneity clearly places the Self of the anthropologist at the centre of the stage and has led to the contemporary debates about the nature of ethnographic writing and the status of ethnographic 'authority'. It has also had obvious consequences for anthropological research, including the raising anew of the relationship of individual to society; and t~<br>

Article Title: Milton's God and the Matter of Chaos<br>
Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219828<br>
Date: 10 1, 1965<br>
Author(s): Watkins John<br>
Abstract: Milton scholarship has long regarded chaos in Paradise Lost as hostile to God and creation. This judgment identifies Milton with traditional Western attitudes toward matter and material disorder-evident as early as the Babylonian creation epic, the Enuma elish. In contrast to such attitudes, modern science conceives of chaos as dynamically productive of order, and postmodern cultural studies sees chaos as a relevant principle of ironic indeterminacy. Milton anticipates the postmodern endorsement of chaos in his theology of matter and in the symbolic reflections and allegorical representations of chaos in Paradise Lost. Appreciation of chaotic disorder and of indeterminacy and disapproval of the tyrannical suppression of these qualities distinguish Milton's idiosyncratic theology, political theory, and aesthetics. Even Milton's God contains the potency of chaotic matter, a womblike virtue essential to God's creative power.<br>

Abstract: Perhaps continental thinking affords common ground without need of firm identity, ground that transcends nationalities and canonical texts and accommodates, even inspires, differing, endless becoming, in Grosz's words, or, in Lingis's, an endless stream of improbabilities. There is room in our philosophy for things undreamt of, and for dreaming, for remembering and forgetting, for loss and potency, for emergence and for nothing, nothing at all. And while there is room for conflict and even hostility, as our own years together evince, there is no room for hostility toward heterogeneity and historicity. In our next fifty years, let us take up our continental differing anew, not viewing it through the narrowed eyes of island-thought but affirming it in its Pangaean splendor.<br>

Abstract: Second, like Ricoeur, Shaw posits the poetic imagination, as it reveals itself in religious and other kinds of narrative texts, as the capability best suited for mending the ailing soul and resurrecting the frangible will. The human heart may be deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked, as the prophet laments, but for Shaw (and Ricoeur) it is corrigible. Things can and do change; this is the first law of Shavian evolution. And, in Shaw's judgment, there is no more effective catalyst for provoking restorative transformation, for ridding the world of the ignorance that fuels evil, than the making of imaginative art that is aesthetically pleasing. Why is this the case? Because storytelling can break the infernal spell that enthralls the will. Telling stories, Shaw maintains, can deliver the imbecilic will from slavery, thereby restoring enlightened individual autonomy and the untrammeled capacity to act in accordance with higher rather than lower passions.
      
               “Fine art,” he muses, as exemplified for example in his own dramatic works, by implication, “is the only teacher except torture.”50
            
               In this regard, Shaw is very much like the “artist” and “Bohemian” Jesus he commemorates: the sage and commiserative guide who, “when reproached for resorting to the art of fiction when teaching in parables,” justified “himself on the ground that art is the only way in which the people can be taught.”51
            
               Consider the biblical Testaments, once more. Shaw believes they are unreliable historical documents yet nonetheless finds “in their readable parts”—that is, in their tales, fables, and legends—a treasure trove of tropes vital to the species' wellness (the same is true for Ricoeur).52
            
               However, and this is critical, he cautions that “you cannot read the Bible if you have no sense of literary art.”53
            
               Thus, in addition to whatever else they do, insist~<br>
